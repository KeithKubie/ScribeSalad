00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:09.667
DiBona: So...we're here
doing an interview.

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:10.834
Liu: We are.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:14.734
We are here to get
nuggets of insight

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.000
from Chris DiBona.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.033
DiBona: Little chunklets.
Liu: Just little ones.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:20.133
Because we can't handle
anything more.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:24.167
But first we have to ask
about the Chrome comic.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:25.701
&gt;&gt; DiBona: I should point out

00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:27.634
when I heard they were doing
comic, I was like...really?

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.434
A comic?
Are you sure?

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:31.601
They were like, yeah.
I was like, okay.

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.334
And he, uh, made my goatee
very smooth, you know?

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.434
Liu: It's very, uh...

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:36.701
DiBona: Sweet...
Liu: Yeah.

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:38.067
DiBona:
That the internet it.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:39.601
There were a lot of great
parodies, actually,

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.033
of that Chrome comics.

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:45.634
&gt;&gt; Liu: So how's--the feedback's
been very positive from Chrome.

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:47.934
DiBona: I think people seem
to like it, yeah.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:49.868
There's been already a couple
of really interesting products

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:51.367
that have taken the Chrome code

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:52.467
and done different things
with it

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:54.334
which I thought
was really very positive.

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:57.334
There's already a ton of people
out there patching.

00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.868
sending patches in to Chrome
to fix things.

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:02.000
In fact, we think
there's more patchers now

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.400
than there are employees.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.501
Of course, they don't have
the same kind of output.

00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:06.968
I mean, we're just talking
individual bug fixes,

00:01:06.968 --> 00:01:09.267
but it's pretty impressive
that, you know,

00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:11.501
we're able to look at that many
people that fast.

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:12.701
Liu: Yeah, so...

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:13.901
DiBona: I mean, not all patches

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:15.501
are appropriate for us
to accept but, yeah.

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.200
Liu: So obviously this was
a very, you know,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.701
secretive project for a while,

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:20.467
and then you kinda like
just put it out there.

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:22.000
So again, companies
get flack sometimes

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.100
for like throwing code
over the wall...

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.200
DiBona: Sure, sure.
So it's funny, you know.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.300
We actually have these
great internal debates

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.000
about when it's okay
to release some source code.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.701
Is it okay to just release it
and forget about?

00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:36.133
Is it okay to release it and not
have a big deal around it?

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:40.167
Or should they all be heavy,
you know, sorta lots of people

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:41.767
working on building a community
and all the rest?

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:45.367
I think the answer is you should
do all of those things, right?

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:47.701
If you look at most
open source projects,

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:51.501
99% of them
is one person working on

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:53.801
a code base in the public,
and they get no help.

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.801
They get no bug fixes.
They barely get the users.

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.601
And then you have
small sets of those,

00:01:58.601 --> 00:01:59.801
they try a couple
of extra developers,

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:01.367
couple extra bug fixers.

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:03.434
And thus, a community, right?

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:05.000
And then you have others
that are,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.100
frankly,
incredibly unusual

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.234
like Linux Chrome,
like Samba, like Mozilla...

00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:14.601
which are incredibly large,
with thousands of developers,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.334
thousands of people
working on them.

00:02:16.334 --> 00:02:18.501
And those are not the norm.

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:19.968
Liu: What was the choice--

00:02:19.968 --> 00:02:22.067
like what went into
the decision to...

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:24.167
hey, we're gonna make
this browser.

00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:27.167
Why don't we just open up
a project on code

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:30.167
and then develop
a new open for the entire way?

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:32.234
DiBona: So with Chrome,
you know, ask Glen,

00:02:32.234 --> 00:02:33.501
as he can probably
answer it best.

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.534
But there are times
when they release projects

00:02:35.534 --> 00:02:40.634
that are, um...you know...

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:42.334
you know,
being developed in-house

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:45.868
in a very focused manner,
you know, for years,

00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:48.434
you know, in the case of
Chrome and Android both.

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.868
I think they're both more than
two years old, those efforts.

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:52.868
And so, you know,

00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:55.067
they want to basically
to tie performance,

00:02:55.067 --> 00:02:58.334
tie performance reviews,
tie employees to the product.

00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:00.801
And...and that's not...

00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:04.100
something that's incompatible

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.801
with open sourcing,
by any measure.

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.300
But there is a level of...

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.834
"we just wanna do this work
ourselves for a while" goin' on.

00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:12.834
We're actually--
we're not really under control.

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:14.634
Control takes a lot of work.
Man: Right.

00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:18.434
I firmly believe the only way
to establish control

00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:21.534
in open source is not through
the use of restrictive licensing

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.434
and not through any sort of
tricks around that.

00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:27.200
I firmly believe
that the way you have control

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.334
and the way you have leadership
in open source

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:32.367
is by showing intelligent

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:34.701
technical leadership
on a project.

00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:38.334
So as long as the Chrome team
at Google, you know,

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.167
makes the right decisions
technically for the product,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:43.167
they're gonna be
in charge of Chrome

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:44.634
and Chromium, right?

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:46.634
Chromium meaning
the open source...

00:03:46.634 --> 00:03:48.000
Man: Open source.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.033
DiBona:...version of Chrome
that Chrome is built from.

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:51.701
So...with that said,

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:56.300
if people decide that Google
isn't giving that leadership,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.434
then they will fork and
they'll create something else.

00:03:58.434 --> 00:04:00.467
You know, probably call it
Technicium or something.

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:01.834
Whatever, you know?

00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:03.033
Come up with something
I want to name it after.

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:06.000
And, um, the thing is
that's okay.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.467
That's a healthy thing.

00:04:07.467 --> 00:04:09.767
That's something we wanna
actually encourage as a company

00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:11.167
so when we release things
like Chrome,

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.601
we're doing it to make
the internet better.

00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:14.567
We're not doing it to build
market share for Google.

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:16.868
We're doing it to make the
internet a free and fair place,

00:04:16.868 --> 00:04:19.634
a place that can really
exist in a world

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:21.734
where people are used to
responsiveness and functionality

00:04:21.734 --> 00:04:23.400
in desktop applications.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.167
So...if people
take our technology

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:28.901
and advance that strategy,
great.

00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.868
We're very happy.
Same with Android, you know?

00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:33.334
It's like, you know, if people
don't like Android

00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:34.467
and they wanna change it

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:36.434
and make it better
for their customers,

00:04:36.434 --> 00:04:39.234
well, that's good for the idea
of a free and fair

00:04:39.234 --> 00:04:41.667
and open cellular phone
operating system

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:43.734
and cellular phone
marketplace as well.

00:04:43.734 --> 00:04:45.434
Which is good for Google,
right?

00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:48.300
So we feel that we compete
quite well

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.400
in free and fair markets
like the internet

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.133
and like free and open
cell phones.

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:55.501
So that's why we're releasing
this technology.

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:57.067
So if somebody says
that they can do that

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:59.067
even better than we can...
that serves us.

00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:00.601
It does well in my eyes.

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:02.167
So we try to encourage anyone.

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:03.667
But, yes, there's some things

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:06.067
we strategically decided
not to release.

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:07.567
GFS is one of them.

00:05:07.567 --> 00:05:10.200
And so what we do instead
in those cases

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.634
is we try to ensure
that people are publishing.

00:05:12.634 --> 00:05:16.567
So, for instance, Jeff Dean
and Sanjay Ghemawat

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:19.501
have done papers on GFS,

00:05:19.501 --> 00:05:21.634
MapReduce, uh, BigTable.

00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:25.033
You know, Luiz Barroso did
a paper on, you know,

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.467
drive lifetimes.

00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:29.133
And if they're read
by technical people,

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:32.400
they can come up with these
technologies fairly rapidly.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.534
And, in fact, that's happened
in the open source world

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.334
with Hadu and with HBase

00:05:36.334 --> 00:05:38.434
and with some of the other
things that we've created.

00:05:38.434 --> 00:05:40.534
So I'm actually really happy
about this, you know?

00:05:40.534 --> 00:05:42.667
I think it's really important
that actually

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:45.901
GFS has an open source
competitor.

00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:47.667
Because it both keeps us
honest,

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:49.567
but also, if it gets
better than what we have,

00:05:49.567 --> 00:05:50.634
we can just adopt it.

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:51.901
Man: Exactly.

00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:54.634
DiBona: So we don't feel
competitive with Hadu.

00:05:54.634 --> 00:05:57.667
But the other side of this is
is there's some software

00:05:57.667 --> 00:06:01.834
that if we release, we make
the internet worse, right?

00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:03.434
And that would be like
if we released, uh,

00:06:03.434 --> 00:06:06.100
the information of how
we do web ranking,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.601
page ranking
for the web search.

00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:10.901
Then web spammers
would get hold of it,

00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:12.567
and that would be
a very big problem.

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:13.901
And not just for Google,

00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:15.434
but for Yahoo and Microsoft
as well.

00:06:15.434 --> 00:06:17.901
Well, I firmly believe,
and quality numbers bear out,

00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:21.234
that Google gives the best
search on the internet.

00:06:21.234 --> 00:06:22.901
And part of that has to do

00:06:22.901 --> 00:06:25.634
with how we look at these people
who abuse the internet

00:06:25.634 --> 00:06:28.868
and change how those results
are displayed to end users.

00:06:28.868 --> 00:06:30.701
So if we were to let
that information out,

00:06:30.701 --> 00:06:33.734
it would make things very,
very bad for not just us

00:06:33.734 --> 00:06:34.734
but for Yahoo
and Microsoft too.
