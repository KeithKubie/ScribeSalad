00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.519
 
well one of the fundamental things that

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:03.529
well one of the fundamental things that
 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:08.150
well one of the fundamental things that
humans and animals do is find their way

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160
humans and animals do is find their way
 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.580
humans and animals do is find their way
around the world so they to do that they

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
around the world so they to do that they
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.709
around the world so they to do that they
need to know where they are and they

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719
need to know where they are and they
 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.070
need to know where they are and they
need to know where other things are and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
need to know where other things are and
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720
need to know where other things are and
they need to know the relationship

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
they need to know the relationship
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.500
they need to know the relationship
between these places and the way the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
between these places and the way the
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.359
between these places and the way the
brain does that is it represents places

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
brain does that is it represents places
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.269
brain does that is it represents places
where you are now and and it represents

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279
where you are now and and it represents
 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.569
where you are now and and it represents
distances and directions and so over the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
distances and directions and so over the
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.040
distances and directions and so over the
years what we've been able to establish

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050
years what we've been able to establish
 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.400
years what we've been able to establish
is which parts of the brain do this

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410
is which parts of the brain do this
 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.389
is which parts of the brain do this
particularly a part of the brain called

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
particularly a part of the brain called
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.660
particularly a part of the brain called
the hippocampus and the related areas

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670
the hippocampus and the related areas
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.690
the hippocampus and the related areas
and especially one of them the internal

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700
and especially one of them the internal
 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.279
and especially one of them the internal
cortex and what types of cells that are

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
cortex and what types of cells that are
 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.979
cortex and what types of cells that are
there which represent these different

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
there which represent these different
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.220
there which represent these different
kinds of spatial information and we know

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
kinds of spatial information and we know
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.490
kinds of spatial information and we know
that there are cells representing places

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500
that there are cells representing places
 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.420
that there are cells representing places
so when you're in the familiar

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430
so when you're in the familiar
 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.490
so when you're in the familiar
environment different cells represent

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
environment different cells represent
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.250
environment different cells represent
different locations in environment we

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
different locations in environment we
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.770
different locations in environment we
know there are cells which represent

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780
know there are cells which represent
 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.240
know there are cells which represent
directions so that when you're looking

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
directions so that when you're looking
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.580
directions so that when you're looking
in a particular direction or moving in a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
in a particular direction or moving in a
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.350
in a particular direction or moving in a
particular direction there are cells

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
particular direction there are cells
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570
particular direction there are cells
which tell the rest of the brain that

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
which tell the rest of the brain that
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.760
which tell the rest of the brain that
and then we also know there are cells

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770
and then we also know there are cells
 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.060
and then we also know there are cells
which appear to tell the distances that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070
which appear to tell the distances that
 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.160
which appear to tell the distances that
are moved in particular directions and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
are moved in particular directions and
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.770
are moved in particular directions and
if you put all these together what that

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
if you put all these together what that
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080
if you put all these together what that
provides you with is something we call a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
provides you with is something we call a
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.319
provides you with is something we call a
cognitive map which is a framework for

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
cognitive map which is a framework for
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.240
cognitive map which is a framework for
identifying where you are where other

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
identifying where you are where other
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190
identifying where you are where other
things are in environment and how to get

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
things are in environment and how to get
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.799
things are in environment and how to get
from one place
