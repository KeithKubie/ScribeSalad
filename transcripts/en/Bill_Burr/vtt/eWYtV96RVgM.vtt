00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.873
Okay.

<v 1>Hey, what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:05.880
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast, but Monday,

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.630
March 13th, 2017 what's going on?

5
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.960
<v 2>how are you ?</v>

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.030
<v 1>How are you, you know what? I asked you that every week. How are but this,</v>

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.050
did you know this Monday I would really like to know how are you?

8
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.670
What's going on Mandy? What's going on with you? You're,

9
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:26.290
you're scaring me.

10
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.070
<v 1>You know, that's the type of shit you can do when you're abroad,</v>

12
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:33.560
but if you're a guy, you can't do that. You can't be like, Mike,

13
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.080
what's going on with me? What's going on? What's going on with you?

14
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.140
You're scaring me. You know? It was just taken by both his hands.

15
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.243
<v 2>MMM. [inaudible]</v>

16
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.570
<v 1>all right. I've got an hour here to do and I gotta be honest with you.</v>

17
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.620
I don't have shit to say because my life has become very compartmentalized.

18
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.090
Being a dad here. Daddy. Hello? Oh,

19
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.670
she's asleep downstairs, man. She's fucking awesome.

20
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.960
Anybody who says that being a parent is hard is a fucking pussy. You know?

21
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.670
I'm not saying that's not tedious.

22
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.690
I'm not say saying it's not like walking around with a little fucking Kettlebell

23
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:11.980
all day long. You know, especially if you fucked up one of your rotator cuffs.

24
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.490
I've got to keep her in close in the right hand side, you know,

25
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.400
keep her in tight. Tiki barber, don't fumble.

26
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.533
<v 2>Um,</v>

27
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.730
<v 1>but uh, we just sit around. We uh, listen a lot of music with her.</v>

28
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.820
I was listening to fucking, um, there was,

29
00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.390
I listened to yesterday just like they called Mulch shop oldies.

30
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.980
It's basically like doo-wop from the 1950s and I kind of settled on that channel

31
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.470
and after a while I wanted to turn the channel,

32
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:43.410
but I couldn't because she was sleeping and the remote was across the table once

33
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:47.050
a month, say fall asleep dude. It's just like, you know,

34
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:48.340
I don't care what position you're in,

35
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:50.260
you're not moving cause if fucking sleeping, right.

36
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:54.250
So I just sat there and listened to on a loop to all this

37
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.590
<v 3>Diana, Diana [inaudible].</v>

38
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.470
<v 1>But, but, but, but, but, but they're slowly going out of my fucking mind.</v>

39
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.440
Do ops great for about four songs in a row.

40
00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:09.850
And then it just becomes the same song over and over and fuck it over again.

41
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.010
Um,

42
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.010
I was listening to that shit for like fucking like an hour and like half of

43
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.970
those songs have been in Scorsese movies. You know,

44
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.650
it's always like some guy's name and then the name of a card, you know,

45
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.630
so and so in the Fleetwood something,

46
00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:32.620
something in the Belmonts Dion and the Belmonts. You got to love them.

47
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.623
Miss still fucking great.

48
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.980
<v 0>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.330
<v 1>You know, the wanderer,</v>

50
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.160
that fucking song is so applicable to anybody who didn't get married.

51
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.880
You're in your forties. Yeah.

52
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:48.230
Well on a tablet guy who will never settle down and makes you feel great about

53
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:53.000
the choice you made until the, you know, you realize he sang it in his twenties

54
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.680
and you're like, oh fuck, what was that other one?

55
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.410
You talk too much. You talk too much.

56
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:07.360
You were re meet a dead. You talk too much. At least as you even worry. My pet,

57
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:12.160
it's just like they can't be the fucking line, but they played it twice. Um,

58
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.730
speaking of talking too much, just what the fuck I do on this podcast. Um, oh,

59
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.460
I know what I can, I know what, we actually had a date night.

60
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.590
This is how much of a fucking dad and becoming, you know,

61
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.790
still playing drums, you know, schedule a helicopter, uh,

62
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.810
thing. So, you know, I'm still trying to keep the hobbies going,

63
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.060
but they're there. They're starting to wobble on the sticks here. So, um,

64
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.560
we were watching a commercial the other day. No, you're watching.

65
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.440
We'll ah, Barchan um, the other day and um,

66
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.840
they always get to the fucking,

67
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.170
the last prize and we'll fortunate it's so fucked in a touristy cheap.

68
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.360
First of all,

69
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.930
you're basically spending this giant roulette wheel and even on the real wetland

70
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.400
roulette wheel, they got, you know, green zero in the double green zero.

71
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.380
And just that alone, that alone will completely fuck you over.

72
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.480
Now obviously you guys hopefully listen to podcasts long enough to know that I

73
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:17.200
am not a mathematician, so I cannot explain why,

74
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.240
but just having those two will fuck you over.

75
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

76
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.710
<v 1>But what's her face is the, uh, we were fortunate to got like fucking,</v>

77
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.940
I swear to God, it's like two or three bankruptcy, lose a turn,

78
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.590
just constantly,

79
00:04:30.591 --> 00:04:35.150
every two seconds you just see that fucking reverse flute thing or they go

80
00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:38.570
bankrupt and then it comes to their big price.

81
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.570
When they try to act like dig enough, they,

82
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.730
they're going to throw down some goddamn cash. The last one,

83
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.880
it's so fucking difficult. Well, we're going to guess some letters for you.

84
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.410
We're going to get some letters for you. Let me get some letters for me.

85
00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:52.700
You know the fucking answer.

86
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.010
And they act like it's weird when only like one letter.

87
00:04:56.011 --> 00:05:00.060
They only guess one letter. Right. Then if you'd be like, okay, give me,

88
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.860
give me three fucking letters in a vow,

89
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.100
p m f l a and then it's always like,

90
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.300
great guesses, but you're not gonna like this feeling. I got one letter.

91
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.140
It's just like, you know, do the best you can. They always fuck them over.

92
00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:17.000
But this lady, this lady,

93
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.720
she actually did okay and she won the prize. She didn't do okay.

94
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.260
She fucking crushed it. I came in and said,

95
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.720
keep your hands to yourself or something like that was solving like, no,

96
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.750
this is a phrase like who would ever come up with that on a fucking game show?

97
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:38.020
Keep your hands to yourself with something on that level.

98
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.110
It's like semi aggressive slash you know date rapey and it's on a fucking game

99
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:47.620
show and she somehow got it. There is a point at the end of this, right,

100
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:52.300
and she ends up winning this fucking to sita, some sort of Mazda or some shit.

101
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.690
Not a Miyata. I don't know what the fuck it was. Suzuki,

102
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.710
I have no fucking idea.

103
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.000
It was a two seat sports car and I'm

104
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.110
immediately, my first thought was I looked at neo is just like,

105
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:09.470
you can't get a kid in there. And then she laughed. She's like, ah,

106
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.090
look at you becoming a dad. And I'm like, No God, I'm still young and cool.

107
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.070
But she was right. You know, not becoming a dad.

108
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:20.330
I am a Goddamn dare, but I'm not,

109
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.270
I'm not going to be one of those Douchey dads that talks about how foe parents

110
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.870
who talks about how fucking difficult their life is, it's fucking awesome.

111
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.960
But having a kid when you're in your twenties and you're broke sucks,

112
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:33.831
you know,

113
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:36.770
but when you travel in the country and they're paying your money that talk about

114
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:41.720
your decks and do fucking sh dicks talking about your deck and do shit jokes,

115
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.250
it's not that bad. I'm only on the road like six days a fucking month.

116
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.680
You know,

117
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.440
as I flying at night early to go watch the fucking Bruins or Celtics or some

118
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:55.610
shit, if our schedules line up, um,

119
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.220
uh, that, that I'm here and she's cool as shit. Man. She doesn't really cry.

120
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:05.720
She only cries, you know, you know, it needs a diaper. Chains wants to be held,

121
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.700
you know, hungry. Other than that, she totally chills.

122
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.210
She's met a bunch of people. She doesn't freak out with strangers.

123
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:17.120
One of the best compliments. I got it. She's like, oh, your kid's really a,

124
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.390
there's a really relaxed, healthy baby. You know what I mean?

125
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.600
Which I'm fucking cite cause that's what I want and obviously healthy,

126
00:07:26.091 --> 00:07:30.020
but I want to fucking chill baby. I don't want like,

127
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.360
I basically don't want my kid to be like me.

128
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.930
That's why I got to keep up with this meditating because I didn't do it for a

129
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.170
minute. And though, oh the old gray mare,

130
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:46.550
she a I've started fucking going back to what the fuck I was,

131
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.660
you know, like I fucking, uh, I was trying to, you know,

132
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.580
sneak out of the bedroom cause I was going to go work out cause I'm a fucking

133
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:59.570
fat cupcake. Eaton Douche. And um,

134
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.680
Nia just opens her eyes and just goes, could you change it really quick?

135
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.620
I just stopped and I looked at her and I said,

136
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.840
you really need to work on your good mornings. She's like, sorry,

137
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:18.610
good morning. And even though I was right,

138
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:23.380
my tone was just, it was way too, you know, I was like that.

139
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.290
Uh, I always say Liam Neeson neon Niamh Leeson lease some,

140
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.540
I don't know, whatever. I I took it too far, which kills me.

141
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.930
That's why I love meditating cause I don't take it too far.

142
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.950
And if I make a point, I'm still right. But when I don't meditate, you know,

143
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:45.250
I'd basically, I walk around at a six, you know,

144
00:08:45.251 --> 00:08:48.400
like saying 10 is completely losing your shit. I walk around,

145
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.410
I'm just walking down the street with a fucking balloon on my wrist at a six to

146
00:08:53.411 --> 00:08:58.230
a seven. So it's very easy for me to go right to 10 unless I meditate.

147
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.300
Then that backs me down to about four or three, which still is pretty high,

148
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:05.610
but it's kind of cutting my number almost in half.

149
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.920
But what kills me is when I'm not meditating and I'm up around a six or seven,

150
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:14.550
you know, it gets to that point, even if I'm right,

151
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.570
my reaction gives them this. There's wiggle room,

152
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:22.410
you know, some Bill Clinton wiggle room to get the fuck out of it. You know,

153
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:27.300
some Trump executive order thing to go around some shit. Um,

154
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.030
so, uh, you know, so I gotta I gotta I gotta stay on that type of shit, dude.

155
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:34.350
Speaking of fucking

156
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.900
Niamh Lisa Niamh listen, why can't it, you know, it's one of those,

157
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:44.070
fuck if it goes by so fucking quick, you never really even hear it. No Bell.

158
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:45.960
We all hear it. You don't normally look at, okay,

159
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.660
get this guy's fucking name right. He's great actor here. Niamh

160
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.090
oh no, it's Liam Neeson. His first name's not Liam.

161
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.830
Yes it is. Niamh lease out whatever.

162
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:06.570
I'll never get that right. I'm never going to get that fucking right. Anyways,

163
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.730
a fucking head of hair on that son of a bitch. Um, anyways,

164
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.200
I saw a fucking great movie this week. So Saturday night, Saturday,

165
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.970
Saturday we go out and uh,

166
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:25.230
we actually have a date night, so we'll be like, all right,

167
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.060
well go get maybe like dinner and a movie.

168
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.900
What basically turned about appetizer and a drink. And I'm sitting there like,

169
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:33.750
you know, I'm on the wagon, I can't do it. And he was like, oh,

170
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:37.010
just fucking have one. So I was like, all right, I'll have one, you know,

171
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.330
still on the wagon, you know,

172
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:42.180
I'm not like a fucking alcoholic or I just gotta shut the whole thing off.

173
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:44.250
You know what I mean? So I had one,

174
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:47.820
I had a cognac of folk and Cognac and I just said, you know,

175
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:51.930
I just ordered the best one that they had, you know, so it tasted amazing,

176
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:54.840
but it was also like drinking gasoline so they could only sip it.

177
00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.720
And we got like an appetizer and then we just sat there, uh, you know,

178
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.170
shooting the shit. It felt weird cause we hadn't been out together in awhile.

179
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:13.450
And then we just started talking about our daughter and looking at pictures of

180
00:11:13.451 --> 00:11:14.284
her.

181
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.810
It's like two addicts going out, you know what I mean?

182
00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:23.260
At some point you're going to start talking about blow and how much fun it is.

183
00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.000
Um, so then, you know, after that we walked up the street,

184
00:11:28.001 --> 00:11:32.230
we went to the movie theater and, uh, we saw get out,

185
00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.710
um, that Jordan Peele fee film. Dude, it was fucking, that was amazing.

186
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.440
You gotta go see it. I know there's, you know, you know,

187
00:11:41.441 --> 00:11:44.050
there's always that movie and he's like, dude, you gotta go fucking see it.

188
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.380
And it doesn't live up to the eye. It lived up to the EIT, man.

189
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.390
It was fucking great. And what I loved,

190
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:54.250
what I loved about it and what I love about all fucking movies like is it was a

191
00:11:54.251 --> 00:11:59.251
bunch of shit in there that you ha he left you to figure out yourself.

192
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.290
And I saw the movie like two, three days ago, Saturday, that was a Monday,

193
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:09.730
two days ago. You know, and I keep even, I'm driving,

194
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:12.340
I'm still thinking about the movie. I was like, Oh fuck,

195
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:15.790
that was this and this meant that and this is over here.

196
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.900
And this person's ad like, you know, was the perfect length,

197
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.210
the whole thing and the acting. And it was unbelievable. Um,

198
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.240
dude, that fucking guys swear to God, man.

199
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:31.300
That's like one of the most talented people to come around and a long,

200
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.450
long time, you know,

201
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.680
to be that good at like, you know,

202
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:41.350
the characters they did on a sketch show and the writing.

203
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:42.670
And then on top of that,

204
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:46.450
you can direct them in these kinds of fucking limitless as far as talent goes.

205
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:49.600
But if you haven't seen it yet before somebody ruins it,

206
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.260
you got to go check it out. All right, there's my, I never do a movie plug,

207
00:12:53.261 --> 00:12:55.720
so there you go. There's one for Ya. Um,

208
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:59.590
so we ended up going to that thing and uh,

209
00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.600
<v 0>okay.</v>

210
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.330
<v 1>I remember what the fuck we did after that. I think we just came straight home.</v>

211
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.150
Oh, I know. Walked up to my car and for some reason the fucking lights were on

212
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.480
because cars are so god damn confusing.

213
00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.790
Like wherever the fuck my lights used to be was the automatic you just turned

214
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:17.720
the car on and they fucking come on at night.

215
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.040
Like somehow the light sense night, fucking creepy is that.

216
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.110
And I did the manual one and now that it's on the manual one,

217
00:13:27.111 --> 00:13:28.820
I can't figure out where the fuck to put it.

218
00:13:28.821 --> 00:13:30.800
So now I always have to do it and now I'm like, you know,

219
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.690
but you know it kills me with today's technology is I left those things on,

220
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.940
went and had a drink and an appetizer and then saw like a fucking whatever,

221
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.510
whatever that movies, 90 minutes, hour and 45 minute movie and I came back,

222
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.660
my car still started up back in the day. You are fucked.

223
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:49.650
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

224
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.990
<v 1>Everybody had jumper cables, doe, can you give me a jump?</v>

225
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:53.960
Do you mind if you can?

226
00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:59.250
Eight body can get me a jump and it was always like the shittiest fucking car

227
00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:03.000
ever. And you're looking at math? Nah Man, a kid, a kid.

228
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.660
Now you could just say no I can't. The big, why not? It's like,

229
00:14:06.661 --> 00:14:10.140
well with today's technology it's pointless for me to ever look under my hood.

230
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.610
I just take it down to the dealer and they deal with everything.

231
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.270
I don't even know where the battery is and I can get and fucking to you. When I,

232
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.830
when I fucking lift up the hood,

233
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.700
I probably have to remove something to get to one of the terminals.

234
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.440
So, I don't know why you're not a member of AAA, but you know,

235
00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:29.274
I don't want it to tell you.

236
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:34.050
And I leave and I get my car and I drive away from a fellow American.

237
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.370
You understand me do what's going on with the fucking Celtics.

238
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

239
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:45.260
<v 1>You've lost six of their last 11 games that five and six and now the wizards,</v>

240
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:48.830
the whiz ease on down, ease on down the road hold.

241
00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.730
I never really realized that until a buddy of mine has been giving me Shit,

242
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.240
you know,

243
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.330
cause it wizards and been playing well against the Celtics and just playing

244
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:56.961
great this year.

245
00:14:56.961 --> 00:15:01.961
They slid into a second place and I just keep trashing about the name.

246
00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.830
I don't like the bullets is too violent, you know,

247
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.390
which I understand because the city was so violent back in the day, you know,

248
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.970
but to go from being the bullets, which I used to think, you know,

249
00:15:16.971 --> 00:15:19.310
number one with the bullet, that's how I always looked at it.

250
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.350
Or faster than a speeding bullet. Superman Shit. I didn't think like, you know,

251
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:29.090
the team was embracing gang violence out on the street and was like pro crack.

252
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.130
It's such stupid shit. I fucking hate when they, so then what do they do?

253
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.570
What are the soccer moms fucking political correct.

254
00:15:38.571 --> 00:15:42.680
Police who for some fucking stupid reason think that they're the progressive

255
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:46.700
people and think that they can just, Oh, we'll change words if we change words.

256
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:50.510
It changes to perception. Now it doesn't. Now it doesn't.

257
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.370
If your parents would dopes racist [inaudible] that's what the fuck your kid's

258
00:15:55.470 --> 00:16:00.350
going to be. That's it. Unless your kid is lucky enough to win,

259
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:03.920
interact with somebody within the group that your parents used to fucking trash,

260
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:09.210
then maybe you got some day like you don't just change a word and it's this

261
00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:13.950
fairy dust that sprinkles over somebody's heart and you change the thought

262
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.780
itself. Fucking dumb.

263
00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.980
All it did was just become a way to lose your job because you said the wrong

264
00:16:19.981 --> 00:16:23.520
fucking word. And then what? The person who uses the word,

265
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.890
then they realize it after they lose the job. Oh,

266
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.000
now I'm not racist or homophobic and so fucking dumb.

267
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.450
So they've gone right down to these stupid fucking team names.

268
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.860
I love how they changed the bullets, but not the Redskins.

269
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.030
You know, the B got you. Get like the fucking, uh, thank them.

270
00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.770
If they ever changed the Redskins, it'd be like, yeah, I get that. I get that.

271
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.850
Like the Indians, you know, it's like, all right. You know,

272
00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:54.950
we weren't from fucking, we weren't, you know,

273
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:57.500
Columbus didn't understand that there was a real world.

274
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.400
If this shit's even real, who the fuck knows? There was no tape recorders.

275
00:17:01.401 --> 00:17:02.840
This guy didn't have a fucking diary,

276
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.860
but other story was told was that he was like, no man,

277
00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:08.330
the world is fucking round.

278
00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:12.000
This guy had the balls.

279
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.340
Scott had the fucking balls to,

280
00:17:15.341 --> 00:17:20.341
to start going towards where they thought you'd go off the edge of the earth in

281
00:17:20.621 --> 00:17:23.680
a fucking boat. You know,

282
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.140
I don't know why the water makes it more scary, but you know,

283
00:17:26.141 --> 00:17:27.850
if anybody just sat around thought about Saturday,

284
00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.880
thought the world is fucking flat. Um,

285
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.430
how is it the water just running off the edges here?

286
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.030
Did they not have counters and sinks? I guess they didn't.

287
00:17:40.031 --> 00:17:42.400
Did they have plumbing at that point? Again, you know, the Romans did

288
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.820
fucking Edens banging each other in the goddamn bathrooms there, whatever.

289
00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:52.320
They eight until he had puke rooms just eat until you fucking puke.

290
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.210
So I would actually think, well, at the very least, even if it is flat,

291
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.370
the fact that there's still water in the ocean,

292
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.400
there's gotta be land on the other side holding it in. Right?

293
00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

294
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.030
<v 1>But not all, Christopher Columbus, not all Chrissy. He was like, no, fuck damn,</v>

295
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:12.800
I'm going to get to the West indies, whatever the fuck it was,

296
00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:13.820
and we'd get to India.

297
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.170
<v 2>I'm going the other way.</v>

298
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.700
<v 1>Me fucking sky the balls to sell out that way. Sales out that way.</v>

299
00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:28.090
And then he thinks so fuck yeah, these people must be Indian.

300
00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:33.860
You know, that's just sort of like, oh,

301
00:18:33.861 --> 00:18:37.010
are you Arab? I thought you were Italian. I mean,

302
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.380
it's at that level of offensive, like, I mean,

303
00:18:39.381 --> 00:18:41.960
would you really get that offended? Like, no, I'm fucking Arab.

304
00:18:41.961 --> 00:18:46.340
How dare you be like, well, what do you got to get to? Talions you can't, sorry.

305
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.600
<v 2>Yeah. Anyways. Um,</v>

306
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.131
<v 1>speaking of which,</v>

307
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:56.550
I don't understand all these people going into to ancestry.com why you would go

308
00:18:56.551 --> 00:19:00.270
to a fucking website and let them take a swab of your saliva.

309
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:05.790
How fucking dumb are people? Oh my God,

310
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:09.070
I didn't realize, you know, I'm also Swahili

311
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:15.390
and whenever them fun, why always pick Swahili? I was thinking of Romania.

312
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.590
I didn't understand that was so, so Hungarian. Great.

313
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.420
Now I know why I like Goulash one eighth of the time.

314
00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:31.650
At this point you're so fucking far removed and I don't understand why people

315
00:19:31.781 --> 00:19:36.160
are sitting there acting like there's any sort of culture there isn't all right.

316
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.860
It's just like what I saw in the Greater Phoenix area.

317
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:43.630
There's a new patch of land, you know, you fucking clear it out.

318
00:19:43.631 --> 00:19:46.270
You put a bunch of houses down and then you slammed down

319
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:52.600
a fucking strip mall. Sorry, I've got to do this podcast before.

320
00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.373
<v 2>Okay.</v>

321
00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.730
<v 1>But daughter wakes up here. Um, yeah,</v>

322
00:19:56.731 --> 00:19:59.970
they slept on a fucking strip mall and then you just continue to progress that.

323
00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:02.700
That's basically, you know, then there's a cheesecake factory.

324
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:07.590
They get a frozen yogurt place and that's what it's become. Okay. There's no,

325
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:12.390
there's no culture left. Is there? I mean that is the culture.

326
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.180
I just sounds like one of the douchey talk show right now,

327
00:20:17.181 --> 00:20:20.710
there is no culture and this is what needs to stop.

328
00:20:20.711 --> 00:20:24.730
We have to stop these strip malls. All right. Do you have a solution? No,

329
00:20:24.731 --> 00:20:29.530
I don't. I just don't like cvs anchored strip malls.

330
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:31.320
<v 0>Okay.</v>

331
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.020
<v 1>There was a bunch of people out the other day, you know,</v>

332
00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.380
you know when you just have like shit to do like a Saturday, right. And uh,

333
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.000
it's rained a bunch when we were out here and some fucking idiot politicians

334
00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.400
said the drought's over. It's like, no it isn't. It's never over.

335
00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:50.380
It's just in a good right now. When is it going to rain again?

336
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:51.840
You don't know snow.

337
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.370
You gonna let people go back to taking long fucking showers.

338
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.440
I never do that out here. I shut,

339
00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.590
I turn on and shut off the water like fucking five times when I take a shower,

340
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.150
turn it on, you know, get yourself wet, you know, and then you shut it off,

341
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.400
such yourself up. Then you turn it back on, wrench itself off.

342
00:21:11.401 --> 00:21:12.600
You shut it off and that's it.

343
00:21:12.601 --> 00:21:16.380
So it says standing there under the cascading water, you know,

344
00:21:16.381 --> 00:21:17.700
like he's some sort of God.

345
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:20.883
<v 4>Um,</v>

346
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.900
<v 1>but I like to think a lot of people try to do that.</v>

347
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:27.190
At least my wife does and she fucking turns a thing on his fucking walking

348
00:21:27.191 --> 00:21:30.400
around. You know, she's one of those chill people.

349
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.370
She hasn't, she hasn't think about shit like that. You know?

350
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.720
I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm a better person than my wife and I don't

351
00:21:38.721 --> 00:21:42.380
know how to bring that up. If you guys know a good way to word it.

352
00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.100
Like how can I basically say, you know what it is honey.

353
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:49.370
I guess at the end of the day I'm just,

354
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.150
I'm just a better person than you are.

355
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.850
I just already pictured her rolling her eyes anyways.

356
00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.710
I'm the fuck was my point. All right. Yeah, so Indians. Okay.

357
00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:03.760
That's like fucking,

358
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.020
that's almost kind of funny. Like, no, you're fucking dope.

359
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.140
You like 6,000 miles away from what you think you are.

360
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.110
I guess it was probably funny at first.

361
00:22:17.111 --> 00:22:19.900
So he started chopping people's arms off cause they couldn't fucking get some

362
00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:21.910
gold for the holes in his teeth.

363
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.380
And who the fuck am I to say what's offensive? What it,

364
00:22:25.381 --> 00:22:26.740
but you would think that red skin,

365
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.940
what that would be at the top of the fucking list over bullets, you know,

366
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.840
it was the worst one.

367
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.280
The fact that the Tampa Bay devil rays and now just the race,

368
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.630
you know, that's when you know you got to move. That's when you just sit like,

369
00:22:42.631 --> 00:22:43.110
wait a minute,

370
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:48.110
are there enough Jesus freaks in this area that the local team has to appease

371
00:22:48.241 --> 00:22:52.230
their, you know, hocus pocus bullshit.

372
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.870
I mean devil rays that isn't that,

373
00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.600
is that an actual name of like some sort of sting ray [inaudible]?

374
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:01.740
I have no idea. Maybe it is. Maybe it is.

375
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.940
All I know is that that guy's first name is Liam.

376
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:12.330
It sounds too close like lime, like Lyme disease. Um, all right,

377
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:13.230
devil

378
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.520
<v 4>ray. Here we go. Yeah.</v>

379
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:24.263
Let me see here.

380
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:30.050
<v 1>All I'm seeing is pictures of fucking sting rays, giant ones with the fucking,</v>

381
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.840
you know, like they're flying through the water.

382
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:37.870
If somebody can explain to me how that makes you move forward when they make you

383
00:23:38.361 --> 00:23:43.090
go up to this surface. Do these things a fucking gigantic.

384
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.043
They're bad ass.

385
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:46.090
<v 4>The good</v>

386
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.000
<v 1>thing, it's getting air. It's jumping out of the water.</v>

387
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:52.080
Unless somebody Photoshop it. I've got to go video now.

388
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.470
They just changed it to the race.

389
00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:59.540
We just array incredible flying rays.

390
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.270
So I guess devil ray was the nickname. Protect Your Business Data from,

391
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:10.100
Oh Jesus Christ. I don't need a commercial. I do the commercials. Not you

392
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:13.280
on the west coast.

393
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.620
On the west coast is always some fucking English accent and the Shork plus the

394
00:24:17.621 --> 00:24:18.740
BBC. Sorry. Yes.

395
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:22.280
<v 4>Feeding [inaudible].</v>

396
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.400
<v 1>Oh Jesus. What are they showing there? And I somehow I got a fucking Pelican</v>

397
00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.230
20 abnormally large animals that actually exist.

398
00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.830
This is how you fucking go down aisle. You go down just like a a,

399
00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:38.340
what do they call it? The go down in the fucking rabbit hole.

400
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.260
Let's see. Come on, man. Oh, that was a,

401
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.940
still was a school of I'm an asshole. Right? Is it fucking got good?

402
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:52.520
Jesus. Those things are ugly as Shit, Huh?

403
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.420
All right, so they're dead. They're in a helicopter.

404
00:24:58.421 --> 00:25:00.790
I imagine they're flying over this, uh,

405
00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:05.460
this whole school of them. It's like a fucking devil, ray or G.

406
00:25:05.461 --> 00:25:09.300
That's why I bet the other ones, they're like more like a, what do they,

407
00:25:09.301 --> 00:25:13.660
what do you call it? If you're just monogamous? These things are out here.

408
00:25:13.661 --> 00:25:17.200
Fucking the shit out of each other and the local Jesus freaks down and

409
00:25:17.201 --> 00:25:20.300
Clearwater, Florida. They couldn't have it. Nah,

410
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.860
they fly out of the fucking water. They're a two graceful with the,

411
00:25:23.861 --> 00:25:25.300
with the landing there. All right,

412
00:25:25.301 --> 00:25:28.270
I'll repost that fucking video in case you want to watch that while you listen

413
00:25:28.271 --> 00:25:29.104
to me ramble about it.

414
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:31.323
<v 4>Um,</v>

415
00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.530
<v 1>yeah, they changed it to the rays, the Tampa Bay rays,</v>

416
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.940
the Tampa Bay devil rays. Two syllables. Two syllables.

417
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.340
Okay. They went from four,

418
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:46.430
four time to three four they turned their fucking team into a Wallace.

419
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:48.763
<v 4>Oh, Bunco.</v>

420
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.620
<v 1>I Dunno. I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about. Can I, can I read?</v>

421
00:25:53.621 --> 00:25:55.960
Can I read you? Get you guys want you to listen to me? Read out loud.

422
00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.251
Hey everybody.

423
00:25:57.251 --> 00:26:00.640
It's time to feel better about your f the brain you are blessed with.

424
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.943
Just sit right here.

425
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.600
It's somebody explained to me why it's not at the font I need.

426
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.030
I like a nice fucking 18

427
00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.290
font. That's good for me. All right. Oh, dollar shave club, everybody. Oh,

428
00:26:19.291 --> 00:26:23.650
Jesus Christ. There's no reason to use a cheap disposable racy. You stupid cunt.

429
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.620
We'll pay a ridiculously high price for gimmicky, for gimmicky thing.

430
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.000
It's got a laser pointer with 17 blades.

431
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:38.160
You don't need to do it. Make the smarter choice and join. Do Always Shave club.

432
00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.440
Dude. Before Dollar Shave Club,

433
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.380
it was either save money and a painful shave from a disposable like ones they

434
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.120
give away for free at the gym,

435
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:52.560
which felt like shaving with a piece of glass or pay a fortune for the latest

436
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:57.210
gimmick. These shaped breakthrough you don't need like a laser chin detector

437
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.460
or has 17 blades is, I told you before,

438
00:27:02.461 --> 00:27:05.220

Helux you're unique. You're special.

No you're not. You're drowning in mediocrity.

What are you going to spread your wings like a devil ray?

493
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.920
Come out of the water and deal with your fucking eyeballs and hang out the side

494
00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:49.030
of your fucking head.

495
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.530
Come out of the water and show people who you are and then belly flop back into

496
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:57.280
it. All right. You're unique. Okay. Yeah. There's something about you I guess.

497
00:30:57.281 --> 00:30:59.770
You know, I guess if I talked to your mother she could find something.

498
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.390
You don't walk like everyone else. Talk like everyone else.

499
00:31:04.391 --> 00:31:07.240
Show Chet or sleep like anyone else.

500
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:14.070
So why the fuck is your mattress one size fits all they've ever thought about

501
00:31:14.981 --> 00:31:18.340
this cause you haven't. Who the fuck has time to think about this?

502
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:23.500
Because it truly customized mattress will cost you five to 10,000 bucks.

503
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.820
Jesus Christ is a comb with a couple of who is until now,

504
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:34.270
go to hell. Exceed like sleep.com answer a few simple questions.

505
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:40.530
Do a saliva swab and they'll run a three d biomechanical modal modal of your

506
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:47.140
body through the proprietary algorithms state developed with the help of the

507
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:50.380
world's leading error, ergonomics and biomechanics experts.

508
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.450
They're going to make a fucking robot.

509
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:53.450
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

510
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:55.370
<v 1>that's what they're going to do with. They're not going to do this.</v>

511
00:31:55.371 --> 00:31:57.470
I bet helix is going to fucking sell that.

512
00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:02.390
That fucking proprietary algorithm of your God Damn nutsack and next thing you

513
00:32:02.391 --> 00:32:02.870
know,

514
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:07.820
there's going to be a fucking lifelike robot walking around with an exact

515
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.670
replica of your junk. But I'm going to tell you right now,

516
00:32:10.671 --> 00:32:14.660
you're going to sleep like you never slept before. All right? You know why?

517
00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.940
Because Helen's customers helix report at 30% improvement in overall sleep

518
00:32:19.941 --> 00:32:23.530
quality. How they figured that out, I have no idea.

519
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.970
How can you fucking take notes while you're sleeping? I guess when they wake up,

520
00:32:27.971 --> 00:32:28.511
they feel you want,

521
00:32:28.511 --> 00:32:32.110
if you wanna improve your fucking sleep by 30% lay off the booze.

522
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.790
You're fucking drunk. Save money on the mattress. If you lay off the bar,

523
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.350
maybe this is the, this is the fucking mattress for drunks.

524
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.030
So as much as you're hung over, you offset it with this great mattress,

525
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.950
I'm going to get one of these things. And for couples, Oh,

526
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:52.610
now they're getting freaky. They customize each side of the mattress. Oh,

527
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:57.440
they went the other way. They customize each side of the mattress. You know,

528
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.040
that's for someone in a loveless marriage.

529
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.310
If you notice that your side of the bed isn't, as you know,

530
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:09.110
if you're annoyed that your wife likes soft magic, that's fucking over.

531
00:33:09.111 --> 00:33:10.930
And I liked the hard mattress. That's it.

532
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:15.020
Just go start sleeping on the couch and when she goes to bed, you know,

533
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.970
start trolling for Internet, Pussy, social media, you know,

534
00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:22.700
that's what you should do. But anyways,

535
00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:26.150
your mattress arrives at your door in about a week when it's shipping is 100%

536
00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:29.790
free. That's why everyone from GQ magazine to Forbes,

537
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:31.440
they're all talking about helix sleep.

538
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.990
Hellings you have a hundred nights to try it out, grouse.

539
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.460

540
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:42.790
they'll pick it up for free this stuff day and give you 100% refund.

541
00:33:43.071 --> 00:33:44.060
No questions asked.

542
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:47.870
I always picture Mr. White and Jesse Pinkman showing up in a hazmat suit.

543
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.080
You know, we're here for your mattress

544
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.870
and you won't even touch it at that point yet. It's in the back.

545
00:33:56.871 --> 00:34:01.310
Good luck to you. Go to helix, sleep.com/burn get $50 off your order.

546

sleek.com/burb lastly, but not leastly.

548
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.520
MVMT watches the company started by two broke college kids.

549
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:20.030
I've never understood that line. Hey, we're flat broke.

550
00:34:20.031 --> 00:34:23.720
You want to start a company? Absolutely. Um,

551
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.540
they wanted to wear stylish watches, but they couldn't afford them.

552
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.210
So they started their own watch company.

553
00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:34.370
Did they just solve the homeless problem? You know,

554
00:34:34.371 --> 00:34:36.830
I'm fucking living outside. I can't afford a house.

555
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:40.880
So I went out and I bought one no more homeless guy.

556
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:45.890
How is this like how you started built a following launched into a podcast,

557
00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:50.220
youtube, radio, Cetera? Oh, I guess on somebody. Oh,

558
00:34:50.221 --> 00:34:53.660
you know what this reminds me of when I started out like a comedian.

559
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:55.840
I didn't have any jokes, so I,

560
00:34:55.930 --> 00:35:00.800
I sat down and wrote something that I went up on stage at a,

561
00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:05.770
you know, I did. Okay. Does that remind you of watches?

562
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:10.210
All right. Little bit. Watch it started at just $95 at a department store.

00:36:33.871 --> 00:36:36.090
I don't understand that, that fuck. I mean, I get it.

587
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.340
I guess I get that Rolex thing.

588
00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:39.810
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

589
00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:44.730
<v 1>that hacky thing. I got a Rolex. As you can see, I've made my dreams come true.</v>

590
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.930
I'm a man in the world. I know there's a lot of guys out there.

591
00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:52.920
You know my dad always said a man shit on a nice watch.

592
00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.120
What else did he say? I get the fuck Outta here. I'm taking a shit. You know?

593
00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:02.010
What else did he say that was so fucking deep baby? You know, maybe at a nice,

594
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:06.480
calm, relaxed, relaxing person in your life.

595
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:12.310
Maybe you did. I'm always jealous of that. When I see like come families,

596
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.220
they gotta be bored shitless though. There's going to be, you know what?

597
00:37:15.221 --> 00:37:19.900
I bet I would actually be willing to guess that the child that is more likely

598
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.450
to just go fucking nuts. You know what I mean? Take out the family car,

599
00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:30.280
you know, throw a hatchet over somebody's head. It's going to come from a comm

600
00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:37.010
family after a while. That's stupid. No, it isn't.

601
00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.910
I'm just saying it's possible. Just the fucking monotony of it.

602
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.770
Like Kevin go to Disneyland.

603
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.210
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

604
00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:48.520
<v 1>and you fucking worn out and then you just started hearing.</v>

605
00:37:48.521 --> 00:37:52.930
It's a small world and it just keeps going over and over again and you slowly

606
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:54.910
feel yourself like losing your sanity.

607
00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:59.650
That right there is why I don't believe in heaven or hell.

608
00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:02.840
You know what I mean? I just don't believe in it.

609
00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.060
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

610
00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:07.883
<v 4>You know,</v>

611
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.480
<v 1>like if heaven was, if it was just having the whole fucking time,</v>

612
00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:17.580
heaven would eventually become hell because it would just be so fucking nice and

613
00:38:17.581 --> 00:38:20.400
everybody would just be walking around. Isn't this great? Oh my God. It's scary.

614
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.400
Can you believe how great this is? This is just fucking great.

615
00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.200
It's probably like every fucking day,

616
00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:29.790
and then at some point you're gonna be like, ah, it's fucking gray.

617
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.653
You know?

618
00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:34.210
<v 4>Like what do you do</v>

619
00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.590
<v 1>for the rest of your fucking life?</v>

620
00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:42.210
You just sitting there and it's always the same. It's just awesome.

621
00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.100
It never rains. There's no disappointments, there's no challenges.

622
00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:52.630
There's no funny stories to tell anymore. Hey,

623
00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:55.990
you remember, remember, remember that time when it was awesome? Yeah.

624
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.610
It's always awesome. Right?

625
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:04.340
Then if you're in hell, I'm on fire. No, I'm fine. I got them. I'm fine.

626
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.320
I'm fine. After a while, you know? Um, yeah, I'm on fire.

627
00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.050
I can't yell anymore. This is just become normal.

628
00:39:13.051 --> 00:39:15.480
I don't even remember what my fucking life was like before I got here.

629
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:21.460
I Dunno. I guess how well you can actually see how that would suck.

630
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:22.760
I don't get heaven.

631
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.633
<v 4>Okay.</v>

632
00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.950
<v 1>I don't want to fucking be like, you know, at some point somebody has to happen.</v>

633
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:33.560
I'm as I'm riding around in my fucking all angel white bicycle.

634
00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.230
At some point you got to get a flat right

635
00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.880
then immediately somebody would be there to help and help you out.

636
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.930
They'd be saying a bunch of Nice Shit to you. I would slowly just start crying.

637
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.630
We just whispered at some points. We like cheeses [inaudible]

638
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:55.640
I know. It's just weird. I understand and I'm not,

639
00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.810
I'm not trying to be that guy who's not appreciative, but could you just say no,

640
00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:01.730
cause you just call me a cunt or something?

641
00:40:01.731 --> 00:40:05.630
Could you fucking just slap me with your sandal?

642
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:11.210
You know? Can you just imagine the look on his face as he just sits there?

643
00:40:11.211 --> 00:40:12.500
You know, not saying anything.

644
00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.910
As you talk yourself into a corner and she's sort of looking at, you know,

645
00:40:16.911 --> 00:40:21.320
people look at you when they go from one eye to the other, right? I,

646
00:40:21.321 --> 00:40:24.800
you left it right out your left eye and you like,

647
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.480
this is trying to get in my head right now.

648
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:28.850
The son of God is trying to get in my fucking head.

649
00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.680
Then you got to explain that to the boss's son.

650
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.530
Why you don't like heaven? Not that you don't like it, but it's just like, can,

651
00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.370
can you make it rain every once in awhile?

652
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:45.050
Can it be that dog that's just fucking barking right as I'm going to sleep?

653
00:40:45.051 --> 00:40:46.370
Come. Can we just have that?

654
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.680
Does every fucking dog have to behave itself?

655
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.840
Why can't I say that word? Jesus. Why can't I say that word? My disruptive.

656
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.330
What are you gonna do now? Send me down to hell. It's over.

657
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:03.390
I already passed the test. All right.

658
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.970
Can somebody be annoyed with fucking something up here? Look at everybody.

659
00:41:08.971 --> 00:41:13.310
Look at it. Well, these fucking goddamn smiles on the faces.

660
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:20.050
It's creepy. Jesus. I don't know.

661
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:24.070
Would you want to fucking be like, it's like you joined a cult.

662
00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:26.330
<v 4>Hello.</v>

663
00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:31.260
<v 1>All of these fucking, you know what I mean? If I was running shit,</v>

664
00:41:31.261 --> 00:41:34.580
I wouldn't make religion illegal. It would just be fucking,

665
00:41:34.581 --> 00:41:38.360
I would just take it all away from everybody. You know,

666
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.880
I, that's what I would do. I would have, I would have a fucking crew, robots,

667
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:48.170
you know, to infiltrate every fucking religion.

668
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:51.260
And then at, when I made it illegal,

669
00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.840
they would join the radicalized people in every group. Right.

670
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.920
And then they would just wipe them all out, you know?

671
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.360
And then you'd have to listen to the whining and the crying of people that

672
00:42:02.361 --> 00:42:03.980
remembered fucking religion and all. He just,

673
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.670
he just take the whole fucking thing away. And the new religion is, hey,

674
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:12.470
I don't know what the fuck happens after you die,

675
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.080
you know? But you know, let's be nice to each other.

676
00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.820
And then that's it. Gay, no walking on water. No,

677
00:42:23.821 --> 00:42:26.400
never running out of fish pot and C's.

678
00:42:28.290 --> 00:42:30.450
I don't know about anybody else's religion. I don't know what the fuck,

679
00:42:30.451 --> 00:42:33.090
but I know there's always some fucking crazy thing that, you know,

680
00:42:33.091 --> 00:42:36.360
didn't happen and everybody acts like it happened.

681
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:38.303
It didn't happen.

682
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.660
Who is painted on a fucking cave wall and somebody elaborated on it?

683
00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.430
I Dunno. I get rid of all personally, I'm just,

684
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:52.170
I'm just talking for myself personally. I would get rid of it. Um, be,

685
00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:56.130
by the way, guess what? I'm doing on March 29th out here in Los Angeles.

686
00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.630
All right. If you are, um,

687
00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:05.120
if you're in Los Angeles and you're a guns and roses fan and you like reading

688
00:43:05.791 --> 00:43:08.910
their books about the band, I've read every fucking one of them.

689
00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:15.170
Um, I read slashes, I read Stephen Adler's,

690
00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.350
I read a the kid from canter's.

691
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.620
Do, you know, knew the band, took all the pictures.

692
00:43:22.621 --> 00:43:26.400
I have that fucking book and uh, recently, I don't know,

693
00:43:26.401 --> 00:43:28.770
I dunno when she put it out, but Deanna Adler,

694
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:34.530
Steven Adler's mom wrote a book, sweet child of mine. And um,

695
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.370
especially if you, if you, you should read this, you should read Steven's first.

696
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:40.703
You know,

697
00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:45.960
you get his version of the hell he went through was an addict and then you get

698
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:48.870
his mother's version, which is unbelievable.

699
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:52.410
And you know what would be fucking amazing is if you could go down

700
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:59.030
and meet her at a book signing it bonds the Nobel at the Grove on March 29th I

701
00:44:01.141 --> 00:44:05.610
believe it starts at 7:00 PM and you go down there and you could fucking meet

702
00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.420
the mother the best fucking one of the best drummers of the 80s my personal

703
00:44:09.421 --> 00:44:10.260
opinion, you know,

704
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:14.610
it'd be even more fucking amazing is if all of them came on my podcast and I got

705
00:44:14.611 --> 00:44:15.720
to interview them. Oh,

706
00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:22.230
Sarah's special Monday morning podcast coming up this week.

707
00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.160
Wouldn't that be incredible? What?

708
00:44:25.161 --> 00:44:28.990
What would it be like if Stephen Adler and you guys all know how much I fucking

709
00:44:28.991 --> 00:44:29.824
love him,

710
00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:34.890
his mother DNA Adler and then that brother Jamie Adler all came on my fucking

711
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.560
podcasts. What would that be like? We'll be out.

712
00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:41.730
Like if they all came on at the same time and they were this big happy family

713
00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:45.090
that just sat there interrupting each other and you felt like you were at their

714
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:46.050
fucking dinner table,

715
00:44:46.051 --> 00:44:50.280
how fucking cool would that be if I did a podcast like that? Well

716
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:56.050
it's going to happen. It already happened. I already recorded it. And um,

717
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:59.100
I'll wait till you guys listen to it. But, um,

718
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.280
I had so much fun with them and uh,

719
00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:07.200
their mother is an absolute salt of the earth sweetheart and she says a book

720
00:45:07.201 --> 00:45:08.460
signing and um,

721
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:13.110
she's all excited slash nervous that no one's going to show up, you know,

722
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:18.060
as you know, say when I put out a special, what if nobody watches it. So, um,

723
00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:22.140
I'm going to be hyping this, um, right up until March 29th.

724
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:25.860
Um, it'd be such a great thing if there was a bunch of people down there.

725
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:29.570
I'm going to be down there standing in line with the rest of you. Uh,

726
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:34.530
probably get down there. I Dunno, probably like around, uh, eight ish.

727
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:36.690
I think it starts at like seven,

728
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.330
but I'll be down there around h just cause I get, I get some fucking thing.

729
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:43.860
I'm taping right before, but um, yeah, I did a special podcast.

730
00:45:43.861 --> 00:45:48.660
I got to meet Steven Adler and I'm still fucking freaking out. And, uh,

731
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:50.580
and I'll,

732
00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.350
I'll wait till you guys listen to the interview and then I'll tell you all the

733
00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:55.980
fucking cool stories. All right, here we go. Let's, let's plow ahead here. Oh,

734
00:45:55.981 --> 00:45:59.910
my Bruins beat the fucking fly. Oh,

735
00:45:59.911 --> 00:46:03.390
at that little fucking prayer of a shot at the end. Not a prayer,

736
00:46:03.391 --> 00:46:06.730
just put it on net. Some out found its way to the back of the net Bruins.

737
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:11.310
Pick up a huge two points, Bruins it playing great. Um,

738
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:16.140
and as our, the Canadians, which, um, I don't like the Canadians,

739
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:20.880
but I'm happy for Khloe, Julian, you know, and uh, I'm actually, you know what,

740
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:24.780
I think the Bruins might've been right to make a move at this point. I think,

741
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.570
uh, it's just one of those things with coaching after a while,

742
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:31.500
even if the person is great, even if they one your cup, it's just,

743
00:46:31.501 --> 00:46:34.950
it's just part of coaching at some point they just show you the door. But, um,

744
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.500
we're playing great. We look a lot better than we did. So I think maybe both.

745
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.800
It's worked out in the fucking Canadians of playing better with Khloe. Julian,

746
00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:46.260
all my friends in this business who I had fans,

747
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.780
they keep texting me saying that they love and the guy,

748
00:46:48.781 --> 00:46:52.050
so I guess it worked out for everybody. So there you go. And closed.

749
00:46:52.051 --> 00:46:56.760
Went from original fucking six to original six. Um,

750
00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:01.200
there you go. All right. So anyways, let's plow ahead here. Um,

751
00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:05.220
let's read some of the, uh, some of the fucking,

752
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:09.360
whenever you call them for this week. The, uh, the questions. All right,

753
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:13.350
DDP Yoga. Hey Bill, first of all,

754
00:47:13.351 --> 00:47:16.410
thank you very much for your consistently amazing podcasts. Well,

755
00:47:16.411 --> 00:47:21.270
thank you for listening. Thank you for doing what you do,

756
00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:24.840
sir. Or ma'am. I absolutely love it to be honest with you.

757
00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.470
I feel like it's getting, it's,

758
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:30.550
I feel like getting it for free is too much.

759
00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:34.060
I'd gladly pay five to 10 bucks a month for all the content you're releasing.

760
00:47:34.061 --> 00:47:37.540
You don't need to do that. I'm fucking, I'm doing great with the advertising.

761
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:38.980
You know,

762
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.710
that's why I fuck around during the advertising because that's how I fucking

763
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:42.430
make money.

764
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:45.400
But I know you guys are going to fast forward through it and unless I keep

765
00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:48.820
pepper in it with Fox and [inaudible], that's it. It's a very simple formula.

766
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:52.150
Anyhow, he said,

767
00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:56.950
I want to get in touch and address yourself proclaimed dad bod.

768
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:03.040
Have you ever heard of or looked into DDP Yoga?

769
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.120
Uh, if not, maybe the name Diamond Dallas page rings,

770
00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:14.950
a bell, former WC w rest wrestler and all around.

771
00:48:14.951 --> 00:48:17.050
Great Guy. After leaving the wrestling business,

772
00:48:17.051 --> 00:48:20.860
he devoted himself to getting his body back in peak condition.

773
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:26.140
Even through wrassling, even though wrassling is his quote fake,

774
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.200
it definitely takes a toll. Yeah, they beat the shit out of their bodies.

775
00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.270
Long story short,

776
00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:36.570
he went from being a guy who wouldn't be caught dead in a yoga studio to trying

777
00:48:36.611 --> 00:48:37.600
it after all else.

778
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:42.250
Failed to develop his own system in helping thousands of people completely

779
00:48:42.251 --> 00:48:46.000
revitalize their lives. And I can tell you from personal experience,

780
00:48:46.001 --> 00:48:49.930
it's fucking great. No bullshit, no fluff, no one's structures, structures,

781
00:48:49.931 --> 00:48:53.530
calmly whispering about Chakra alignment.

782
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.370
So you say Chakra Chakra.

783
00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:01.540
It's about consistently performing the physical and mental exercises that will

784
00:49:01.541 --> 00:49:05.410
have you operating at your best. This is a commercial healing,

785
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:09.490
nagging aches and pains, increasing your endurance, gaining mental clarity,

786
00:49:09.491 --> 00:49:11.920
et cetera. Like I said, no fluff.

787
00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:15.220
He used the video that got me to take a chance on it.

788
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:18.490
It's not too late for you Billy. I hope you'll check it out.

789
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.440
Thanks again for the Goddamn podcast.

790
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:23.740
All the best to you and your family that actually read like a commercial.

791
00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:25.000
But you know what, I don't give a shit.

792
00:49:25.001 --> 00:49:28.990
It's a physical fitness thing and so many people have taken yoga and done in a

793
00:49:28.991 --> 00:49:32.590
different way. You know cause there is that thing.

794
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:38.250
If you really like a wound up psycho to go into a yoga class and the tone with

795
00:49:38.291 --> 00:49:43.060
which that they speak is a little jarring, you know,

796
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:45.690
to be in your car going,

797
00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:48.840
oh you fucking caught the lightest way you could have made it

798
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:54.610
to then being like how is everyone feeling today?

799
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:59.850
I know the traffic was kind of bad. I hope.

800
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:05.360
I hope you're not bringing that energy in here. Is it slowly walking around,

801
00:50:05.361 --> 00:50:09.900
lighting these smelly fucking things, you know,

802
00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.790
and as they're talking, the person next to you just goes

803
00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:21.160
and immediately you just want to like, I dunno,

804
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:25.630
just slowly roll up your mat and just walk out. Like I can't,

805
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:29.840
like I get it, I get, I need to chill out, but I can't feel like,

806
00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:32.481
you know, you know what,

807
00:50:32.481 --> 00:50:36.620
it just becomes like this asexual thing where everybody's just kinda like,

808
00:50:36.621 --> 00:50:40.730
hey man, we just kinda, you know, everybody's just like, we're all like one,

809
00:50:40.731 --> 00:50:43.640
you know, we like plants. Um,

810
00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.550
that's a little fucking jarring. I'll give it a shot.

811
00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:49.940
I've actually been meaning to do it cause I keep having setbacks with my fucking

812
00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:54.530
shoulder. Um, which is really frustrating. But, um,

813
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:59.630
most of it is diet. So, uh, whenever I get in shape,

814
00:50:59.631 --> 00:51:04.310
the first thing I do is I cut out the booze and, um, all I really need to,

815
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:06.530
I need to go like 46 days without any booze.

816
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:09.560
Even just having that one cognac didn't really do anything.

817
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.500
Like I had the one and then Amelia, my body's like, hey,

818
00:51:12.501 --> 00:51:16.370
why don't we have 15 more? But I had to go to the movie and then I was fine.

819
00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.000
Um, and then the second I'm in there and the buzz starts to wear off.

820
00:51:20.001 --> 00:51:24.050
I think I'll thank God I didn't have 15 more. Not to mention I gotta drive.

821
00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:28.700
Right. Um, I'm going to give it a shot. I just think if I did yoga,

822
00:51:28.701 --> 00:51:33.350
I'd have to do in the morning before the little one wakes up. Um,

823
00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:37.670
she's so fucking awesome, dude. I'm telling you right. You'll never regret it.

824
00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.010
I guess. You know, when you get it,

825
00:51:39.011 --> 00:51:42.710
if you have a kid with somebody that you're not love with,

826
00:51:42.711 --> 00:51:45.770
I guess that that would suck. But at the end of the day, the kids still awesome.

827
00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.860
It's a hell of a door price, I'll tell you that, right? Oh, I'll tell Ya.

828
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:54.380
Alright. Trans wrestling. Hey there. I'm already gonna Watch this.

829
00:51:54.381 --> 00:51:57.980
If this is what I think it is a, that Billy boo a,

830
00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:01.430
did you hear the story about the Trans girl going through home hormone

831
00:52:01.431 --> 00:52:04.940
treatment? Who was still wrestling girls in high school.

832
00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:10.660
His slash her defense is that it's a low dose of testosterone and it does not

833
00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:13.130
allow for any competitive advantage.

834
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:20.630
Wait a minute, isn't that what HGH is? That's human growth hormone.

835
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:24.070
Well, I guess they don't took human growth hormone. I don't know.

836
00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.620
I don't know what kind of hormones they take. Um, having said that,

837
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:32.960
I'm not sure I'd let my daughter wrassle a girl who had any edge at all.

838
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:35.120
Even if it's a tiny bit of extra strength.

839
00:52:35.121 --> 00:52:38.090
It could be the difference in breaking a bone. Thoughts.

840
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:42.950
Would you let your daughter wrestle in that situation? Uh, yeah. Yeah,

841
00:52:42.951 --> 00:52:46.940
I would then they're to break a fucking bone, you know what I mean?

842
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:52.130
How many times did people break a bone in wrestling? Does that really happen?

843
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:58.160
They just fucking on each other the whole time. It's like a,

844
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.810
you know, like that official level shit. Not that, not the fun shit,

845
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:08.930
the stone cold shit that the, the actual official college shit. It's like a,

846
00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.320
it's like competitive spooning. You know what I mean?

847
00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:16.370
It's like one person is trying to spoon with the other person and the other

848
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.670
person's like, I want to be this, the Spooner and not the spoonie.

849
00:53:19.671 --> 00:53:23.890
That's basically what's going on. They don't really, you know? No,

850
00:53:23.891 --> 00:53:28.630
I wouldn't be concerned about that. Yeah.

851
00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:32.830
I'm one of those debts. Well, the kids crying go away.

852
00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:36.940
You know? She's already half a guy. I'd be driving my ads as far as I know.

853
00:53:36.941 --> 00:53:39.340
She's still a girl, so suck it up.

854
00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:45.830
You want to be the best. Well then you got to wrestle half of two.

855
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:51.190
Oh, I don't want to hear another word out of you. I'd be like dead.

856
00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:56.140
Whether you embrace the opportunity to be like, well, here we go.

857
00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.060
If this is actually a fucking advantage,

858
00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:02.170
all this is going to do is make me better. You know what I mean?

859
00:54:02.290 --> 00:54:07.290
And then he could go up there and give you a record 27 and no against hundred

860
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:11.400
percent checks in what? In?

861
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:16.740
To get someone who's half a dude, right. You've got to embrace it.

862
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:19.980
I mean, what does that person supposed to do?

863
00:54:19.981 --> 00:54:23.520
There's not enough fucking people that are going through what the fuck she's

864
00:54:23.521 --> 00:54:26.550
going through to fit any of the side.

865
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.213
<v 2>You know,</v>

866
00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:34.860
<v 1>I think it's, I think it's a cool thing. Fucking that won't gives a shit. Look,</v>

867
00:54:34.861 --> 00:54:39.360
there's already gonna be that fucking monster anyways. Some,

868
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:43.890
some woman's gonna walk in there and it's just going to be blessed with frontier

869
00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:45.540
strength. You know what I mean?

870
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:48.750
Chopping wood strength is going to be that person anyways.

871
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.053
<v 2>Um,</v>

872
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:53.660
<v 1>I mean, I guess if she was actually,</v>

873
00:54:53.661 --> 00:54:58.661
if she was trying to get a scholarship in a loss could potentially affect it.

874
00:55:01.450 --> 00:55:03.340
<v 2>Um, maybe,</v>

875
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.970
<v 1>but I gotta be honest with you. I think I'm,</v>

876
00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:10.990

877
00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:15.430
as a father I'd be like [inaudible] see how you do this is actually an

878
00:55:15.431 --> 00:55:18.810
advantage. This is a great fucking opportunity to, you become a,

879
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:21.220
for you to become a better wrestler. There's no money on the line.

880
00:55:21.221 --> 00:55:25.170
Who gives a fuck? Let's go.

881
00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:27.610
Let me tell you something, brother.

882
00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:30.730
Come this Saturday when my daughter wrestles a good stat. Half a dude.

883
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:35.470
What are you going to do when these pythons run wild on your life?

884
00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.960
I get up for it. I wouldn't give a shit. Fuck it. Um, yeah.

885
00:55:40.961 --> 00:55:42.520
Many guy in Europe.

886
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:43.840
<v 4>Okay,</v>

887
00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.250
<v 1>so persons from Yemen.</v>

888
00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.840
<v 2>Yemeni. Yeah, Yemen and e.</v>

889
00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:53.360
<v 1>How the fuck do you say that guy in Europe. All right. Hey Bill,</v>

890
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:58.700
I'm a Yemeni guy who is bad. I hope I'm saying that right. No disrespect here.

891
00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.720
Who's been living in Europe for the past six fucking years?

892
00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:04.770
<v 4>Okay.</v>

893
00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.300
<v 1>Although everything is going all right.</v>

894
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.750
I want to ask your advice because I can relate to your personality.

895
00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:14.210
Hang on a second, sir. Or ma'am, I want to fucking figure out where the fuck.

896
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.110
I'm assuming you're from Yemen.

897
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.940
What is Yemeni?

898
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:26.690
What is a Yamini whom to whom is he is a Yemenite.

899
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:31.420
Oh yeah. Why did that all disappear?

900
00:56:34.220 --> 00:56:36.980
What is a Yemeni?

901
00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.573
<v 4>Come on.</v>

902
00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:45.680
<v 1>Alright. Relating to Yemen or its people. Holy Shit. I was right.</v>

903
00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:47.780
<v 4>Okay.</v>

904
00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:51.110
<v 1>That's a nice flag. I got a nice flag. I like just the three bars.</v>

905
00:56:53.330 --> 00:56:57.170
I'm a big three bar flag guy. France, Italy,

906
00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:02.370
Ireland, Yemen. I'm all right.

907
00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:04.093
<v 4>Okay.</v>

908
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:09.220
<v 1>What do you guys think of the new Russian flag? I kinda liked the old one.</v>

909
00:57:09.221 --> 00:57:12.580
The old one was this shit all red with that sickle. I thought the,

910
00:57:12.581 --> 00:57:15.910
I thought that that one was fucking dope. The new ones. All right.

911
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:19.930
What does it red, white and blue. Holy Shit. They got the same colors as us.

912
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:22.150
Is that what it, is it something like that? I don't know.

913
00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:27.130
I was watching this whole thing about flatten your Putin poison in these guys

914
00:57:27.131 --> 00:57:31.050
and shit. Allegedly. I have no idea.

915
00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.830
So watching it on 60 minutes so it's got to be true, right? Tick, tick, tick,

916
00:57:34.831 --> 00:57:36.770
tick, tick. All right. You have any guy in your bar?

917
00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:38.580
I've been over there for the last six fucking years.

918
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:40.920
I want to ask you a question because I can relate to personally.

919
00:57:40.921 --> 00:57:45.921
My family has been living in a war zone in Yemen for the past two years.

920
00:57:47.850 --> 00:57:48.930
Our old house,

921
00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:53.160
our old house there was bombed and my father was inside,

922
00:57:53.161 --> 00:57:55.860
but the lucky bastard came out without a scratch.

923
00:57:56.790 --> 00:58:00.780
I miss them and wish I could help them, but that's kind of not possible now.

924
00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.430
All right before the, I already feel like this is going to be way over my head.

925
00:58:05.431 --> 00:58:09.720
Before that I lost some good old friends that I knew for more than 10 years

926
00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:15.110
because of some stupid incidents was beaten by a gang of more than 15 men in

927
00:58:15.811 --> 00:58:18.420
Malaysia on a trip there for no reason.

928
00:58:19.650 --> 00:58:24.650
And my two year ex-girlfriend at the time cheated on me with their current

929
00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:27.870
boyfriend. Is this fucking amazing?

930
00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:30.750
This guy's from the other side of the planet and in seek sex, same shit,

931
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:35.520
gang violence and you fucking girl got sick of you and fucking bang.

932
00:58:35.521 --> 00:58:36.354
Somebody else

933
00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.710
cheated on me with her current boyfriend while I was on that trip,

934
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:46.670
I guess to Malaysia and didn't have the decency to break up with me before that.

935
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:51.110
She was my first, uh, you know, what are you going to do? People are young,

936
00:58:51.111 --> 00:58:52.640
they don't know how to break up.

937
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:56.120
So they wait till you go to Malaysia and they fucked somebody.

938
00:58:56.210 --> 00:59:01.070
Me that this is a time honored tradition of how to break up with somebody.

939
00:59:01.071 --> 00:59:04.100
All right. So if you, with your first love, what have we learned?

940
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.760
Do not go by yourself to Malaysia.

941
00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.240
I don't know how many times I brought that up on this podcast.

942
00:59:11.241 --> 00:59:15.950
You cannot go to fucking Malaysia. All right. I just graduated from college.

943
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:19.700
I have a beautiful girlfriend, which I love and feel blessed with what I have.

944
00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.760
I know that I an asshole at certain moments in my life,

945
00:59:22.761 --> 00:59:27.500
but I have changed a long time ago and I'm still trying to be more honest,

946
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:29.840
clear and focused. Well, welcome to the club, sir.

947
00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:35.260
I'm currently looking for a job in Germany and we'll try to apply after that for

948
00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:36.890
a German passport,

949
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:41.450
which will make my life much easier and allow me to start a company and sustain

950
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:45.620
myself without being dependent on others. Exactly.

951
00:59:45.621 --> 00:59:46.700
You want to work for yourself.

952
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:50.870
I know that you have lived certain moments in your life where you are faced by

953
00:59:50.871 --> 00:59:55.460
challenged, faced with challenges that might be taught a lesson,

954
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.340
but at the same time left a mark on your self confidence.

955
00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.840
How did you empower yourself and what advice would you give a young man like me

956
01:00:02.841 --> 01:00:06.140
confronting life's challenges? That's it. Fuck face.

957
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.930
Congratulations on your baby and fuck you.

958
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:14.180
Now there's a guy, okay,

959
01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.480
who speaks at least three languages and still is able to break balls.

960
01:00:17.481 --> 01:00:22.130
Isn't that amazing? He's probably speaks Yemeni, Yemenite,

961
01:00:22.790 --> 01:00:25.880
Yemen, Asian, whatever the fuck he speaks. Right? He's knows that one.

962
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:30.290
He's in Germany, so he's got to speak that language on via you in this space.

963
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:32.270
Right. And he can also speak English.

964
01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:34.863
<v 2>Um,</v>

965
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.820
<v 1>how did I empower myself?</v>

966
01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.773
<v 2>Uh Huh.</v>

967
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.530
<v 1>I used to just say shit out loud to myself. You know,</v>

968
01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:46.760
when I would feel the dark cloud of doubt coming in, I would just,

969
01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:52.340
you know, it took me a while, but I w I would. Um, but I mean,

970
01:00:52.341 --> 01:00:56.450
I wasn't facing what you're facing being an immigrant.

971
01:00:57.470 --> 01:01:01.910
So I mean, you're facing way more than I did in the, but the fact that,

972
01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.810
uh, I don't know, you're trying to become a better person, you know, you know,

973
01:01:05.811 --> 01:01:08.200
to reach out for help and all that. I th I think I,

974
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.040
my gut says you're going to be fine.

975
01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:14.690
Well you have to do in general is when the doubt comes in,

976
01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:19.880
you gotta beat the shit out of it. You know you have to, the biggest thing is,

977
01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.070
is that you're conscious that this have the self doubt.

978
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:29.120
So once you're conscious of it, you can then address it. It's when you,

979
01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.550
when you're really young and you're not conscious of it

980
01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:37.950
and that thought comes in and then you start dwelling on it and then it just

981
01:01:37.951 --> 01:01:41.820
washes over your whole body and you can literally,

982
01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:45.450
you know, have a fucking panic attack.

983
01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:49.930
Well you have to do, I did anyways is um,

984
01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:52.183
<v 2>okay.</v>

985
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.590
<v 1>You know, you tried to cancel it out with the positive thought.</v>

986
01:01:54.591 --> 01:01:57.650
I know this sounds like hokey shit, but I used to just say shit out loud.

987
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.180
I read some book one way and it started off with like,

988
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:05.690
I would just be walking down the street, you know,

989
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:08.990
walking by other people and I would just randomly just be like, yeah, fuck that.

990
01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:13.280
Fuck you looking at me. Like I was nuts. But I was like,

991
01:02:13.281 --> 01:02:16.710
fuck that negative thought man. Wouldn't yell it. But I would,

992
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.790
I would kind of just say, fuck that. Fuck that. No, it isn't. No one has it.

993
01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:24.600
Right. No, it won't or whatever the hell it was. And then it just became,

994
01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:26.520
like when I moved to New York

995
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:31.200
and I'm trying to get in at the clubs,

996
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:34.210
I knew I was going to get in. But you know,

997
01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.610
if the day to day just seemed like a,

998
01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:44.940
like impossible and you know, the club owners and everything and you know,

999
01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:49.980
some of them were cool and others enjoyed the fact that you were desperate and

1000
01:02:50.491 --> 01:02:53.460
just really enjoyed that position of power over you.

1001
01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:57.840
And I would walk out of the club dejected,

1002
01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:02.080
you know, I was afraid, you know, am I gonna run out of money?

1003
01:03:02.081 --> 01:03:03.520
I don't have a job right now.

1004
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.410
I'm doing these driving back to Massachusetts to fucking feature and Dick

1005
01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:12.070
Doherty's rooms that was not barely covering, you know,

1006
01:03:12.071 --> 01:03:16.750
living in New York every time you stepped outside your blue, 20 bucks, 30 bucks,

1007
01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.790
you know. And, um,

1008
01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:25.000
I just thought I'd started, I, what I said was, I'm tougher than you.

1009
01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:28.900
New York is what I would say is Hokey, is that sound. That's what they,

1010
01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:29.561
you know,

1011
01:03:29.561 --> 01:03:34.180
the city would kick me in the balls and then I would just mumble that to myself,

1012
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:37.510
you know, sometimes like six times in a row

1013
01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:43.150
until I got that thought on my head. And I would just say,

1014
01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:45.130
and then I would just be like, I'm going to get in the clubs,

1015
01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.170
I'm going to get in and I'm going to make a living. I'm going to be fine.

1016
01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.950
I'm going to be fine. Everything's going to be fine. Fuck that. Fuck that.

1017
01:03:53.951 --> 01:03:57.790
Fuck that. I mean, something like that.

1018
01:03:57.791 --> 01:04:00.970
That's what I had to do. And, um,

1019
01:04:03.010 --> 01:04:04.210
and then it just, you know,

1020
01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:10.720
and that continues throughout your fucking life and, uh, you know,

1021
01:04:10.721 --> 01:04:13.540
then you get to my age, you know, and I'm doing great and everything,

1022
01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:14.441
but there's also,

1023
01:04:14.441 --> 01:04:19.020
there's always your mortality around the fucking corner and how I've kind of

1024
01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:21.160
mentally dealt with death,

1025
01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:25.060
the inevitable death is that like, um,

1026
01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:30.790
that I just think it's going to be a great experience. You know what I mean?

1027
01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:36.230
That, uh, I don't think anything bad happens to you when you die, either.

1028
01:04:36.231 --> 01:04:40.490
You just go into the ground and then that's it. And,

1029
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:44.090
uh, and that's it. You know,

1030
01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.620
you got to be a person on this planet as opposed to like a fucking mosquito.

1031
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:53.690
You got the best fucking experience. Hopefully you did.

1032
01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:56.300
Um, and then that's it.

1033
01:04:56.330 --> 01:05:00.350
It's fucking over or you become something else.

1034
01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.880
And I just don't think that is bad, you know?

1035
01:05:04.881 --> 01:05:07.610
I just don't think that it doesn't make any sense that it would then just be

1036
01:05:07.611 --> 01:05:11.330
bad. Um, I don't know. I hope that helps you.

1037
01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.890
I got a little off the rails there.

1038
01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.740
So what I would say is you just baby step your away,

1039
01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:22.870
you know? And like for me,

1040
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:27.100
making it as a comedian was like a 20 year fucking 15,

1041
01:05:27.101 --> 01:05:30.730
20 year process. I was obviously, I was not the overnight,

1042
01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:33.100
I didn't have the hook, I didn't have any of that fucking shit.

1043
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.910
And I just basically, every day, you know,

1044
01:05:36.911 --> 01:05:41.590
was fucking hacking at the tree until it came down. And, um,

1045
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:47.930
you know, you just don't quit. You just, that's it. You just don't quit.

1046
01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:49.520
You don't give it a negative thought.

1047
01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:54.580
And every day you just fucking take a few steps towards it and then one day you

1048
01:05:54.621 --> 01:05:56.720
just wake up and you're way you wanted to be and you're like,

1049
01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.150
how the fuck did that happen? You know? And it was funny.

1050
01:05:59.151 --> 01:06:03.470
You don't feel any different, you know, so, um,

1051
01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.450
but she'll be all right. I think you're going to be alright. You know,

1052
01:06:05.451 --> 01:06:09.260
you speak three different fucking languages. You can break balls in English.

1053
01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:10.930
I mean, you sound me.

1054
01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:13.600
Sounded like you got a great sense of humor and you're trying to get, I,

1055
01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:17.420
you're going to be fine. Just say that to yourself. I'm going to be fine.

1056
01:06:17.421 --> 01:06:20.420
This is gonna work out and uh, then that's it.

1057
01:06:20.421 --> 01:06:24.080
Then you can try to fucking help somebody else out along the way. All right,

1058
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:29.060
last one here. Documentary recommendations. Hey.

1059
01:06:29.061 --> 01:06:33.170
Oh Billy. Oh Billy. Beat down. I was wondering if you had heard of the,

1060
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:37.490
this new documentary that just came up called ice guardians.

1061
01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.670
It's about the history of enforcers in hockey.

1062
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.040
And I would love to hear your take on it if you haven't seen it.

1063
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:46.880
I watch all of these fucking things. Um, I haven't seen it,

1064
01:06:46.881 --> 01:06:51.470
but I watched the trailer and it looked great. Um,

1065
01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:55.100
I don't know about the name. Ice Guardians.

1066
01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.360
That sounds somewhere between a superhero movie.

1067
01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:05.290
And I'm, I'm musical. I'm musical on ice.

1068
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.010
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1069
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:10.860
<v 1>Coming to Madison Square Garden. It's ice guardians.</v>

1070
01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:14.570
Flossie hands skating around the ice. Um,

1071
01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.390
he said thanks for all the laughs and for always making me feel better about the

1072
01:07:17.391 --> 01:07:21.140
way I read things out loud. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself.

1073
01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:23.380
Here's a link to the trailer. Okay, I'll,

1074
01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.680
I'll send out this link here to the trailer. By the way. Um,

1075
01:07:28.850 --> 01:07:33.260
I'm going to be at the south by southwest on Tuesday.

1076
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:34.580
I'm flying in Tuesday.

1077
01:07:34.581 --> 01:07:38.300
I'm doing a podcast with Al Madrigal for all things comedy network.

1078
01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.440
And then I'm, uh, flying right back out that night.

1079
01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:47.060
That's it. Boom. Doing a Po, landing, doing a podcast,

1080
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.920
jumping back on the plane and flying back.

1081
01:07:48.921 --> 01:07:53.570
That's my dedication to the goddamn network and also my dedication to fucking

1082
01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:58.010
coming back to see my daughter. That's it. And after that, I got three days,

1083
01:07:58.070 --> 01:07:58.670
a Monday,

1084
01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:03.670
a Tuesday or Wednesday at the Improv in San Jose Cruz.

1085
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:09.660
Um, and I think that that's my, uh, that'll be my fucking, uh,

1086
01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:14.750
that'll be my month. That's it. All right. Thanks. Listen to podcasts.

1087
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.760
Go fuck yourselves. I'll check in on you on Thursday. And,

1088
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:24.050
uh, I think that's it. That is it. All right. Go Fuck Yourself.
