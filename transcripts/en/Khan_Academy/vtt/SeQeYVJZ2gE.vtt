00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.400
In a local teaching district,
a technology grant is

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.410
available to teachers in order
to install a cluster of four

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.160
computers in their classroom.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.290
From the 6,250 teachers in the
district, 250 were randomly

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.590
selected and asked if they felt
that computers were an

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.410
essential teaching tool
for their classroom.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.770
Of those selected, 142 teachers
felt that the

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.490
computers were an essential
teaching tool.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.920
And then they ask us, calculate
a 99% confidence

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.040
interval for the proportion of
teachers who felt that the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.690
computers are an essential
teaching tool.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.460
So let's just think about
the entire population.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.000
We weren't able to survey all
of them, but the entire

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.230
population, some of them fall
in the bucket, and we'll

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.950
define that as 1, they thought
it was a good tool.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.920
They thought that the computers
were a good tool.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.670
And we'll just define a
0 value as a teacher

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.100
that says not good.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.140
And some proportion of the total
teachers think that it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050
is a good learning tool.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.960
So that proportion is p.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.820
And then the rest of them think
it's a bad learning

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.890
tool, 1 minus p.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.560
We have a Bernoulli Distribution
right over here,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.840
and we know that the mean of
this distribution or the

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.010
expected value of this
distribution is

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.080
actually going to be p.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.230
So it's actually going to be a
value, it's neither 0 or 1, so

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.160
not an actual value that you
could actually get out of a

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.460
teacher if you were
to ask them.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.550
They cannot say something in
between good and not good.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.050
The actual expected value
is something in between.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.720
It is p.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.240
Now what we do is we're taking
a sample of those 250

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.000
teachers, and we got that 142
felt that the computers were

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.040
an essential teaching tool.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:06.530
So in our survey, so we had 250
sampled, and we got 142

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.509
said that it is good, and we'll
say that this is a 1.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.030
So we got 142 1's, or we sampled
1, 142 times from this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.990
distribution.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.290
And then the rest of the time,
so what's left over?

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.580
There's another 108 who said
that it's not good.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.190
So 108 said not good, or you
could view them as you were

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.810
sampling a 0, right?

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.390
108 plus 142 is 250.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.610
So what is our sample
mean here?

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:46.460
We have 1 times 142, plus 0
times 108 divided by our total

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.390
number of samples,
divided by 250.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.710
It is equal to 142 over 250.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.920
You could even view this as
the sample proportion of

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.770
teachers who thought that
the computers were a

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.915
good teaching tool.

00:02:57.915 --> 00:03:01.100
Now let me get a calculator
out to calculate this.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:09.050
So we have 142 divided by
250 is equal to 0.568.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.330
So our sample proportion
is 0.568.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.680
or 56.8%, either one.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.910
So 0.568.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.410
Now let's also figure out our
sample variance because we can

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.630
use it later for building
our confidence interval.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.630
Our sample variance here--
so let me draw a sample

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.900
variance-- we're going to take
the weighted sum of the square

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.020
differences from the mean and
divide by this minus 1.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.990
So we can get the best

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.140
estimator of the true variance.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.950
So it's 1 times-- no, it's the
other way actually around-- we

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:56.160
have 142 samples that were 1
minus 0.568 away from our

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.470
sample mean, or we're this far
from the sample mean 142

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.690
times, and we're going to
square those distances.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.700
Plus the other 108 times we got
a 0, so we were 0 minus

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.810
0.568 away from the
sample mean.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.130
And then we are going to divide
that by the total

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.280
number of samples minus 1.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.040
That minus 1 is our adjuster
so that we don't

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.320
underestimate.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.290
So 250 minus 1.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.785
Let's get our calculator
out again.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.140
And so we have 100-- we put
a parentheses around

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:52.560
everything-- I have 142 times
1 minus 0.568 squared, plus

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.330
108 times 0 minus-- and you
could obviously do parts of

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.650
this in your head, but I'm just
going to write the whole

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:10.830
thing out-- minus 0.568 squared,
and then all of that

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.960
divided by 250 minus 1 is 249.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.300
So our sample variance is--
well, I'll just say 0.246.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.820
It is equal to-- it is our
sample variance-- I'll write

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.420
it over here-- our sample
variance is equal to 0.246.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.910
If you were to take the square
root of that our actual sample

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.290
standard deviation is going to
be, let's take the square root

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:49.450
of that answer right over there,
and we get 0.496 is

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.900
equal to 0.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.310
I'll just round that
up to 0.50.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.710
So that is our sample
standard deviation.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.580
Now this interval, let's think
of it this way, we are

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.450
sampling from some sampling
distribution

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.390
of the sample mean.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.980
So it looks like this
over here, it

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.870
looks that over there.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.490
And it has some mean, and so
the mean of the sampling

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.130
distribution of the sample mean
is actually going to be

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.150
the same thing as this mean over
here-- it's going to be

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.200
the same mean value-- which
is the same thing as our

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.570
population proportion.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.920
We've seen this multiple
times.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.970
And the sampling distribution's
standard

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.710
deviation, so the standard
deviation of the sampling

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:42.290
distribution, so we could view
that as one standard deviation

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.440
right over there.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.310
So the standard deviation of
the sampling distribution,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.020
we've seen multiple times,
is equal to the standard

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.760
deviation-- let me do this in
a different color-- is equal

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:03.690
to the standard deviation of
our original population

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.846
divided by the square root
of the number of samples.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.620
So it's divided by 250.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.800
Now we do not know this
right over here.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.130
We do not know the actual
standard deviation in our

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.230
population.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.040
But our best estimate of that,
and that's why we call it

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.280
confident, we're confident that
the real mean or the real

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.710
population proportion, is going
to be in this interval.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.200
We're confident, but we're not
100% sure because we're going

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.140
to estimate this over here, and
if we're estimating this

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.960
we're really estimating
that over there.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.680
So if this can be estimated it's
going to be estimated by

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.875
the sample standard deviation.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.400
So then we can say this is going
to be approximately, or

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.830
if we didn't get a weird,
completely skewed sample, it

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.860
actually might not even be
approximately if we just had a

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.550
really strange sample.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:07.960
But maybe we should write
confident that-- we are

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.930
confident that the standard
deviation of our sampling

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.730
distribution is going to be
around, instead of using this

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.200
we can use our standard
deviation of our sample, our

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.210
sample standard deviation.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:28.100
So 0.50 divided by the square
root of 250, and what's that

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.020
going to be?

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:34.330
That is going to be-- so we
have this value right over

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.360
here, and actually I don't have
to round it, divided by

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.970
the square root of 250.

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.190
We get 0.031.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:52.290
So this is equal to
0.031 over here.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.870
So that's one standard
deviation.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.700
Now they want a 99% confidence
interval.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:05.290
So the way I think about it is
if I randomly pick a sample

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:10.370
from the sampling distribution,
what's the 99%

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.560
chance, or how many-- let
me think of it this way.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.230
How many standard deviations
away from the mean do we have

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.120
to be that we can be 99%
confident that any sample from

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.150
the sampling distribution will
be in that interval?

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.880
So another way to think about
think it, think about how many

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.660
standard deviations we need to
be away from the mean, so

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.460
we're going to be a certain
number of standard deviations

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:38.550
away from the mean such that any
sample, any mean that we

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.020
sample from here, any sample
from this distribution has a

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:47.360
99% chance of being plus or
minus that many standard

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.900
deviations.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.750
So it might be from
there to there.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.780
So that's what we want.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.880
We want a 99% chance that if
we pick a sample from the

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.710
sampling distribution of the
sample mean, it will be within

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.260
this many standard deviations
of the actual mean.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.890
And to figure that out let's
look at an actual Z-table.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.330
So we want 99% confidence.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:10.040
So another way to think about it
if we want 99% confidence,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.270
if we just look at the upper
half right over here, that

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:21.230
orange area should be 0.475,
because if this is 0.475 then

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.890
this other part's going to be
0.475, and we will get to

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.580
our-- oh sorry, we want
to get to 99%, so it's

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.340
not going to be 0.475.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:38.330
We're going to have to go
to 0.495 if we want 99%

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:38.870
confidence.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.300
So this area has to be 0.495
over here, because if that is,

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.940
that over here will also be.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.560
So that their sum will
be 99% of the area.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.390
Now if this is 0.495, this value
on the z table right

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.225
here will have to be 0.5,
because all of this area, if

00:10:56.225 --> 00:10:58.870
you include all of this
is going to be 0.5.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.590
So it's going to be
0.5 plus 0.495.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:11.090
It's going to be 0.995.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.350
Let me make sure I
got that right.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.420
0.995.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.480
So let's look at our Z-table.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.530
So where do we get 0.995.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.570
on our z table?

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.190
0.995.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.380
is pretty close, just to have
a little error, it will be

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.660
right over here--
this is 0.9951.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:37.800
So another way to think about it
is 99-- so this value right

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.760
here gives us the whole
cumulative area up to that, up

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.200
to our mean.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.620
So if you look at the entire
distribution like this, this

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.610
is the mean right over here.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:52.580
This tells us that at 2.5
standard deviations above the

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.550
mean, so this is 2.5 standard
deviations above the mean.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.140
So this is 2.5 times the
standard deviation of the

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.430
sampling distribution.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:06.200
If you look at this whole area,
this whole area over

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.320
here, if you look at the
Z-table, is going to be

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:18.260
0.9951, which tells us that just
this area right over here

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:24.120
is going to be 0.4951, which
tells us that this area plus

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.040
the symmetric area of that many
standard deviations below

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.870
the mean, if you combine
them, 0.4951 times

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.060
2 gets us to 99.2.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:39.780
So this whole area right
here is 99.992.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.950
So if we look at the area 2.5
standard deviations above and

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:47.080
below the mean-- oh,
let me be careful.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.440
This isn't just 2.5,
we have to add

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.590
another digit of precision.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.140
This is 2.5, and the next digit
of precision is given by

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.030
this column over here.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.070
So we have to look all the way
up into the second to the last

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.100
column, and we have to add
a digit of 8 here.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.856
So this is 2.58 standard
deviations.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.000
We have 2.5 over here, and then
we get the next digit 8

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.180
from the column.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.360
2.58 standard deviations above
and below the standard

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.780
deviation encompasses a little
over 99% of the total

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.690
probability.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.700
So there's a little over a 99%
chance that any sample mean

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.610
that I select from the sampling
distribution of the

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.150
sample mean will fall
within this much of

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.000
the standard deviation.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.190
So let me put it this way.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:40.770
There is a 99-- it's actually,
what, a 99.2% chance, right?

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:45.890
If you multiply this times 2
you get 0.99-- actually you

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.680
get 0.9902.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:57.940
So we'll say roughly 99% chance
that any sample that a

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:11.840
random sample mean is within
2.58 standard deviations of

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:20.120
the sampling mean of the mean
of the sampling distribution

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.650
of the sampling mean, which is
the same thing as our actual

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.820
population mean, which is the
same thing as our population

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.800
proportion.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.670
So of p.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.200
And we know what this
value is right here.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.550
At least we have a decent
estimate for this value.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.390
We don't know exactly what this
is, but our best estimate

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:39.160
for this value is
this over here.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.300
So we could re-write this, so
we could say that we are

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:46.770
confident because we are really
using an estimator to

00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:48.330
get this value here.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:58.530
We are confident that there is
a 99% chance that a random x,

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:03.820
a random sample mean, is
within-- and let's figure out

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.480
this value right here
using a calculator.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:13.140
So it is 2.58 times our best
estimate of the standard

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:20.360
deviation of the sampling
distribution, so times 0.031

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.420
is equal to 0.0-- well let's
just round this up because

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:37.670
it's so close to 0.08-- is
within 0.08 of the population

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.650
proportion.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:41.690
Or you could say that you're
confident that the population

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.850
proportion is within 0.08
of your sample mean.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:49.710
That's the exact
same statement.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.230
So if we want our confidence
interval, our actual number

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.330
that we got for there,
our actual sample

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:01.500
mean we got was 0.568.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.620
So we could replace this, and
actually let me do it.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.290
I can delete this right here.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:07.350
Let me clear it.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:12.430
I can replace this, because we
actually did take a sample.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.530
So I can replace this
with 0.568.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.940
So we could be confident that
there's a 99% chance that

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:28.010
0.568 is within 0.08 of the
population proportion, which

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.700
is the same thing as the
population mean, which is the

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.820
same thing as the mean of the
sampling distribution of the

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.780
sample mean, so forth
and so on.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.760
And just to make it clear we can
actually swap these two.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.920
It wouldn't change
the meaning.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.350
If this is within 0.08
of that, then that is

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.930
within 0.08 of this.

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.170
So let me switch this
up a little bit.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:49.910
So we could put a p is within
of-- let me switch

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.500
this up-- of 0.568.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.560
And now linguistically it sounds
a little bit more like

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.820
a confidence interval.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.290
We are confident that there's a
99% chance that p is within

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.050
0.08 of the sample
mean of 0.568.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.099
So what would be our confidence
interval?

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:14.730
It will be 0.568 plus
or minus 0.08.

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:15.980
And what would that be?

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.530
If you add 0.08 to this right
over here, at the upper end

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.060
you're going to have 0.648.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:28.339
And at the lower end of our
range, so this is the upper

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:29.330
end, the lower end.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:34.080
If we subtract 8 from
this we get 0.488.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.130
So we are 99% confident that the
true population proportion

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.430
is between these two numbers.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:41.570
Or another way, that the true
percentage of teachers who

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.760
think those computers are good
ideas is between-- we're 99%

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.430
confident-- we're confident that
there's a 99% chance that

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.390
the true percentage of teachers
that like the

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:56.970
computers is between
48.8% and 64.8%.

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.870
Now we answered the first
part of the question.

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.670
The second part, how could the
survey be changed to narrow

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.710
the confidence interval,
but to maintain the

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.000
99% confidence interval?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.740
Well, you could just
take more samples.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.910
If you take more samples than
our estimate of the standard

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.290
deviation of this distribution
will go down because this

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.370
denominator will be higher.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.470
If the denominator is higher
then this whole

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.870
thing will go down.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.050
So if the standard deviations
go down here, then when we

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.850
count the standard deviations,
when we do the plus or minus

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.120
on the range, this value
will go down and

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.920
will narrow our range.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.650
So you just take more samples.
