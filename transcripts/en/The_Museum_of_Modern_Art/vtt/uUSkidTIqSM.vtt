00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.130
The exhibition covers the period from about
1912 to 1934.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.970
And more or less, it’s the period that we
consider to be kind of the high point of the

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.610
Russian Avant-Garde in terms of artistic practice,
but what’s really interesting about this

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.530
moment is the way that art and societal change,
governmental change, history, are all so inextricably

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.080
intertwined.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.359
So, when people ask about the Revolution,
the historical event that they’re really

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.699
talking about happens in 1917.

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.190
And so what we’re talking about is a moment
in which the long-ruling dynastic family of

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.180
Russia—they’ve been in power for three
hundred years at this point—is seen by the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.100
people as occupying this kind of elevated
position, this position of luxury and control,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.250
where the people of Russia are really struggling,
a lot of them.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.530
And so there is this kind of groundswell that
comes from the population, a sort of desire

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.129
for a new government—a government that’s
going to be by them and for them.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.249
Artists are really starting to think about
how they can make positive contributions to

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:03.249
the goals of the Revolution.

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.960
How can they really contribute to society?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.670
They decide maybe it’s no longer really
about being in the studio and making easel

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.980
paintings, and in fact, easel painting would
really come to be phased out by some of these

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.960
artists in the not-too-distant future.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.190
But in the meantime, they’re thinking about
what’s the way in which we’re going to

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.040
communicate with people?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.330
And there is a kind of decision among artists
like Rodchenko, whose work we see here, that

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.400
it’s going to be a language of abstraction.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.250
But it has to be something that’s clear,
something that’s understandable.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.370
So in drawings like these, what Rodchenko
does is he goes to these kind of objective

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.370
tools.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.579
He uses a ruler.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.680
He uses a compass.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.230
He’s able to almost scientifically map out
his drawing.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.670
It’s not about kind of his imagination in
the studio, a kind of daydreaming and invention.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:59.020
It’s about a kind of concrete, real world,
kind of constructed way of thinking.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.540
And that in a way is where this term “constructivism”
comes from.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.110
It’s the idea of making a type of work that
has a kind of concrete place in the world

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.489
using this kind of abstract language.

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.329
One of my favorite works in this gallery is
this group of six drawings by the artist Aleksandra

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.329
Ekster.

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:20.520
And they’re actually plans for stage sets
that she was thinking about or designing.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.849
So you see them here in beautiful color—sets
for The Merchant of Venice, for Romeo and

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:25.849
Juliet.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.239
When you kind of start to peel the excess
away and look at just kind of the bones of

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.560
these drawings, you realize that this is,
in fact, that abstract language.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.680
Those kind of repeating parallel lines, or
those kind of even cross-hatchings, those

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.279
diagonals that move across compositions, just
kind of expanded out to live, possibly, in

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.529
the real world—in this case the world of
the theater.

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:52.780
So we find ourselves now in the only monographic
gallery in this exhibition, and what that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.760
really means is the only gallery devoted to
the work of a single artist.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.100
That artist is El Lissitzky.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.290
Lissitzky was such a critical figure, not
only in the Russian Avant-Garde, but in the

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:04.909
Western Avant-Garde as well.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:10.280
And it was because he had such a kind of multifaceted
way of thinking about and looking at the world.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.319
The project here behind me is perhaps one
of the projects that he’s best known for,

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.099
and it was the creation of something that
he invented called the “Proun.”

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.939
So “Proun” is actually an invented term,
and it’s an acronym.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:26.639
It stands for “project for the affirmation
of the new,” and it really comes out of

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.790
Lissitzky’s philosophical thinking.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.280
It’s not something that’s so easily grasped
quite honestly.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.639
One of the great things about this project
is that Lissitzky actually included with it

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.840
a manifesto of Proun.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.310
Trying to kind of explicate for people, and
probably also for himself, what its parameters

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.480
were and what its real meaning was.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.360
So you see here the Russian version of this
manifesto which he then translates, just the

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.040
first part of, into German.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.779
German was another one of his primary languages.

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:03.909
But I think as you can see, it’s something
that isn’t necessarily a one-line concept.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.559
It’s something that could have philosophical
implications, it’s something that could

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:11.840
have theoretical implications, it’s something
that could have real world implications.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.940
So it’s a very kind of interesting three-dimensional,
360 way of Lissitzky theorizing about the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.940
world.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.580
If you look at a Proun like this one—this
is Proun 6B—you see that Lissitzky has annotated

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.100
the composition here at the bottom right suggesting
that this is how you can see the image.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.840
But then you notice that there’s also a
similar marking on this corner suggesting

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.340
that you could in fact rotate this and see
it as a vertical composition.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.500
And even more interesting, in this Proun—Proun
1—you see that it actually has at least

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.450
four possible orientations.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.380
And for me that suggests that not only can
you see them only in the round, but you could

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.950
start to see them rotating through space.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.450
It was about shaping reality and they were
looking beyond just the single pair of eyes

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.260
on something to how could I get more people
to see this and understand this.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.820
So in the case of Lissitzky’s Proun, the
idea of making a lithography portfolio—he

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.260
didn’t end up making very many of them—but
even twelve could go out into the world.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.450
He could send them to colleagues at other
university campuses, at other art institutes

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.920
in cities beyond the one where he was based
and in that way try to create a kind of ripple

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.570
effect, really send these ideas out, let them
reverberate, let much larger audiences have

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.260
access to them.
