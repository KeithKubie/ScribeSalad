00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.690
So we have these two parallel
lines, line segment AB

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.560
and line segment CD.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.810
I should say they are
parallel line segments.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.460
And then we have
these transversals

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.660
that go across them.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.020
So you have this transversal
BC right over here.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.020
And you have this
transversal AD.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.540
And what this
diagram tells us is

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.610
that the distance between A
and E-- this little hash mark--

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.490
says that this line segment
is the same distance

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.610
as the distance between
E and D. Or another way

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.640
to think about it is that
point E is at the midpoint,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.640
or is the midpoint,
of line segment AD.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.320
And what I want to think
about in this video

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.430
is, is point E also the
midpoint of line segment BC?

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.530
So this is the question
right over here.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:58.576
So is E the midpoint
of line segment BC?

00:00:58.576 --> 00:01:00.950
And you could imagine, based
on a lot of the videos we've

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.830
been seeing lately,
maybe it has something

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.239
to do with congruent triangles.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.130
So let's see if we can set up
some congruency relationship

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.420
between the two obvious
triangles in this diagram.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.300
We have this triangle
up here on the left.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.770
And then we have this
triangle down here.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.644
This one kind of looks
like it's pointing up.

00:01:15.644 --> 00:01:18.040
This one looks like
it's pointing down.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.940
So there's a bunch of things
we know about vertical angles

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.380
and angles of transversals.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.390
The most obvious one is
that we have this vertical.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.292
We know that angle AEB
is going to be congruent.

00:01:30.292 --> 00:01:32.750
Or its measure is going to be
equal to the measure of angle

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.370
CED.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:45.250
So we know that
angle AEB is going

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.700
to be congruent to angle
DEC, which really just means

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.020
they have the
exact same measure.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.245
And we know that because
they are vertical angles.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.850
Now, we also know that
AB and CD are parallel.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.115
So this line right over
here, this is a transversal.

00:02:11.115 --> 00:02:12.490
And there's actually
several ways

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.370
that we can do this problem.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.035
But we know that this
is a transversal.

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:19.660
And there's a couple of ways to
think about it right over here.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.130
So let me just continue
the transversal,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.004
so we get to see all of
the different angles.

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:27.910
You could say that this
angle right here, angle

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.560
ABE-- so this is its measure
right over here-- you could say

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.550
that it is the alternate
interior angle to angle ECD,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.510
to this angle right over there.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.321
And if that didn't
jump out at you,

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:43.570
you would say that the
corresponding angle to this one

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.340
right over here is this
angle right up here.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.822
If you were to continue
this line off a little bit,

00:02:48.822 --> 00:02:50.280
these are the
corresponding angles.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.530
And then this one is vertical.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.950
But either way, angle
ABE-- let me be careful.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:07.633
Angle ABE is going to be
congruent to angle DCE.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.840
And we could say because it's
alternate interior angles.

00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:19.170
I'll just write a
little code here.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:27.500
So Alt interior angles.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.610
And then we have an
interesting relationship.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.860
We have an angle congruent to an
angle, another angle congruent

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.360
to an angle.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.200
And then the next side is
congruent to the next side

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.700
over here.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.660
So pink, green, side.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.700
Pink, green, side.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.700
So we can employ AAS,
angle-angle-side.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.180
And it's in the right order.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.597
So now, we know
that triangle-- we

00:03:47.597 --> 00:03:50.138
have to make sure that we get
the letters right here, that we

00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:51.910
have the right
corresponding vertices.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.060
We can say that
triangle AEB-- actually,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.680
let me start with the angle
just to make it interesting.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.450
Angle BEA, so we're starting
with the magenta angle,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.880
going to the green angle,
and then going to the one

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.970
that we haven't labeled.

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.890
So angle BEA, we can say,
is congruent to angle--

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.950
we start with the
magenta vertices-- C,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.920
go to the center, E, and then
go the unlabeled one, D. And we

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.910
know this because
of angle-angle-side.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.260
And they correspond to each
other-- magenta-green-side,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.320
magenta-green-side.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.560
They're all congruent.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.520
So this is from AAS.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.890
And then, if we know
that they are congruent,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.480
then that means corresponding
sides are congruent.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.357
So then we know these two
triangles are congruent.

00:04:42.357 --> 00:04:44.190
So that means that their
corresponding sides

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.220
are congruent.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.689
So then we know that length
of BE is going to be equal--

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.730
and that's the segment
that's between the magenta

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.530
and the green angles.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.060
The corresponding side is
side CE between the magenta

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.037
and the green angles--
is equal to CE.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.120
And this just comes out
of the previous statement.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.620
If we number them, that's
1, that's 2, and that's 3.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.600
And so that comes
out of statement 3.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.980
And so we have proven this.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.520
E is the midpoint of BC.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.120
It comes straight out of the
fact that BE is equal to CE.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.710
So I can mark this
off with hash.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.687
This line segment
right over here

00:05:22.687 --> 00:05:24.770
is congruent to this line
segment right over here,

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.002
because we know that those
two triangles are congruent.

00:05:28.002 --> 00:05:29.460
And I've inadvertently,
right here,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.180
done a little two-column proof.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.735
This over here on the
left-hand side is my statement.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.840
And then on the right-hand
side, I gave my reason.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.800
And we're done.
