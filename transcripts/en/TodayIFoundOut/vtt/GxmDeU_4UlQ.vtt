00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.930
While there is no single correct way to walk,
most of us have a gait where we swing each

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.150
arm forward when its opposing leg moves forward;
likewise, as with the length of the stride,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.360
which is generally the same for both legs,
the distance of the arm swing is usually about

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.140
the same for both the left and right arms.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.000
While exactly why humans do this hasn’t
yet been definitively proven (with the most

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
popular theory being that, while not essential,
it’s mostly about improving balance and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.329
decreasing angular momentum of the body),
the fact remains that this is how the vast

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.719
majority of humans all over the world walk…

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.070
But not so with Vladimir Putin, President
of the Russian Federation.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.699
For those who’ve never seen Putin’s rather
odd walk, as is more common, when Putin walks,

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.160
his left arm swings freely forward with his
right leg stride.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.199
However, when his left leg strides forward,
his right arm barely moves at all, remaining

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.590
nearly still and close to his torso.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.530
This has resulted in some idly speculating
that maybe there is some neurological cause

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.420
for the gait, perhaps even a sign of Putin
being in the early stages of Parkinson’s

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.350
disease, as reduced arm swing is a potential
early indicator (though generally with tremors

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.170
in the limb or other such additional indicators
as well).

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.170
(Incidentally: The Man Who Parkinson’s Disease
is Named After Was Implicated in a Plot to

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.170
Assassinate King George III.)

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.430
Others have speculated Erb’s palsy or even
a minor stroke might be the underlying cause.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.610
The problem with all of these hypotheses is
that Putin not only has full use of his right

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.120
arm and hand for day to day activities like
writing, eating, etc., but even likes to show

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.630
off his prodigious Judo skills, as well as
strength in weightlifting.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.860
In both cases, the right hand and arm seemingly
show no sign of weakness, tremors, etc.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.590
Combined with the fact that Putin’s had
this gait for many years without change, this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.350
all seemingly rules out any of the aforementioned
potential causes.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.180
So what’s going on?

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.281
Well, thankfully as Putin himself has never
commented on it as far as we can find, a team

00:01:55.281 --> 00:02:00.260
of doctors, led by movement disorder specialist
Dr. Bastiaan Bloem, decided to look into the

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.310
matter, publishing their paper on the subject
in the British Medical Journal in 2015.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.450
In it, they came up with an intriguing and
quite probable hypothesis as to why Putin

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.700
walks this way.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.540
In their paper, titled “Gunslinger’s gait”:
a new cause of unilaterally reduced arm swing,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.170
They noted that Putin was once a long-time
member of the Soviet Union security agency

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.170
known as the KGB (1975-1991).

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.909
(In fact, he eventually rose to the rank of
Lieutenant Colonel within that organization

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.500
before leaving it during the brief August
Coup attempt against President Mikhail Gorbachev.)

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.480
Showing off their research skills, the doctors
dug up the book, KGB Alpha Team training manual,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.060
which, if you go read through that manual,
contains the following text (Chapter 2) concerning

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.120
the proper way to move:

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.209
…it is absolutely necessary to keep your
weapon against the chest or in the right hand.

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.489
Moving forward should be done with one side,
usually the left, turned somewhat in the direction

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:55.489
of movement.

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.209
You should crouch to stay concealed.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.599
Lean the body forward slight and keep the
knees bent.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.579
While Putin forgoes crouching and the like
when walking around in public, his gait otherwise

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.569
very much mimics the one recommended in the
training manual, with presumably his right

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.519
hand staying mostly stationary at his side
holding an imaginary gun or otherwise prepared

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.519
to draw such a non-existent weapon at need.

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.909
In other words, perhaps because it was so
grilled into him in training, or simply because

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.829
he thinks it looks cool when he’s walking
with that so-called “gunslinger’s gait,”

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.920
he seems to have chosen to keep the walk long
after his KGB days ended.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.090
Now, on its own this reference in the training
manual doesn’t definitively prove anything.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.709
It’s still just speculation by the doctors
in question.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.010
To give more credence to their hypothesis,
the researchers presumed that if it was really

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.310
the KGB training that cause this peculiar
walk, Putin wouldn’t be the only one that

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.310
walked this way.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.290
Thus, they examined the walks of other Russian
military and/or former KGB officers, finding

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.029
several Russian officials today that also
displayed the seemingly bizarre walk.

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:56.219
Most notable among this group are Prime Minister
Dmitry Medvedev, former ministers of defense

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:02.560
Anatoly Serdyukov and Sergei Ivanov, and a
military commander of high rank, Anatoly Sidorov.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.230
Like Putin, Ivanov was a KGB official, and
thus this seemingly supported the hypothesis

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.120
that strict adherence to KGB training led
to Putin’s now lifelong habit of walking

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.900
with one arm more or less fixed at his side
and body ever so slightly turned.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.250
In addition, although not KGB, Sidorov was
a member of the Russian military and Serdyukov

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.020
had served at least one year in the Soviet
Army where this particular type of movement

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.280
was similarly taught.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.050
In all of these cases, these individual’s
walks aren’t quite as extreme as Putin’s

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.930
can sometimes be, but they definitely display
the same basic pattern of movement.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.610
The one that doesn’t fit the mold, however,
is Medvedev, who has no direct links to the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.080
military or intelligence services, but still
walks this way at times.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.430
That said, in his case, he seems to have very
actively been coached to mimic Putin’s iconic

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.949
walk, expressions, and even speech patterns
during the process of being groomed to potentially

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.870
follow Putin as President, which he subsequently
did from 2008-2012.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.300
Of course, without confirmation from Putin
himself, nobody can really know why he walks

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.280
this way, but given the lack of any other
signs of a neurological issue that might cause

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.560
such a gait, that the movement pattern is
described well in the KGB training manual,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.560
and that at least some other ex-KGB operatives
also display a similar walk, this certainly

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:30.819
seems like the most compelling hypothesis
anyone’s come up with so far.
