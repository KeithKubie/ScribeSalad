00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.820
So, you've got three
minutes to deliver a pitch.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.670
And it's possible

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.430
that you're losing their attention
in the first ten seconds.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.080
Do you know what to do?

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.060
Hopefully now you do.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.400
Congratulations, you made
it through the lesson.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.310
In this lesson you organize your
story into a pitch you can use to get

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.480
attention, overcome objections,
and secure investment.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.820
This is a huge accomplishment,
so, great job.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.200
You've got an amazing story to tell and
now it's time to go out and tell it.
