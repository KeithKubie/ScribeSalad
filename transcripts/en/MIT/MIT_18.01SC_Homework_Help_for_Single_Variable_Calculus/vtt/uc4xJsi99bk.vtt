CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.120
In this video I want
to explain to you

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.310
where the coefficients
we saw in Simpson's rule

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.010
actually come from.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.620
So what I'm going to do is
take this curve that I have

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.970
and show you what the picture
of Simpson's rule does.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.570
And then I'm actually going
to determine explicitly where

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.300
the coefficients come from.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.570
So let's look at
this picture first.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.585
The picture I have here, the
white curve is going to be my y

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:39.159
equals f of x function.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.450
And so, if you remember, what
Simpson's rule is saying,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.270
you have to have two delta x's.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.610
So in this case h
is equal to delta x.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.230
So what Simpson's rule is saying
is I can find, approximate,

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.310
the area under this
curve from minus

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.680
h to h by a certain expression.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.520
And the expression is, I
said delta x is equal to h,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.066
so let me write h over 3 times
y_0 plus 4*y_1 plus y_2-- oh,

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.566
y_2.

00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:15.032
So that's what you got--

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:16.490
that's what you
saw in the lecture,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.802
that this is what
the coefficients are.

00:01:18.802 --> 00:01:20.510
So I want to explain
why this is a 1, why

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.915
that's a 4, why that's a 1,
and where that 3 comes from.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:24.540
The picture is not
going to explain it,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.740
but the picture will help
us understand how to go.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:34.530
So what Simpson's rule does is
it takes those three points,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.170
so the (x_0, y_0) the (x_1,
y_1) and the (x_2, y_2)

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.370
that are on the curve
y equals f of x.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.860
And it finds a parabola
through those three points.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.590
So I'm going to do my best to
draw what looks like a parabola

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.140
through those three points.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.870
Something-- I'll draw it lightly
first and then I'll fill it in.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.610
Something along these lines.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.560
Something like that.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.610
That's a, sort of
looks like a parabola.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.260
And so the idea
is Simpson's rule

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.777
is saying I can find the
area under the blue curve.

00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:16.610
So I can find the area
under the blue curve.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.540
So this is a function, we'll
call this y equal P of x.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.130
And that's what you were
actually told about in lecture.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.575
That you're approximating
your function y

00:02:31.575 --> 00:02:34.610
equals f of x by a
quadratic function that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.020
goes through the values
(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1),

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.160
and (x_2, y_2).

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.750
And then you find the
area under that parabola.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.990
Between minus h and h.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.890
Now this picture, you
might say, Christine,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.807
this looks really
like a bad estimate.

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:52.890
This looks kind of stupid.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.931
Maybe you should have
picked a different function

00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:56.790
to estimate this.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.940
And I did this one because I
wanted to be zoomed out far

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.650
and to show you, to give you
a little intuition about what

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.190
happens when we make h smaller.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.810
Notice that if I
cut the size of h

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.540
in half, so if I started
with here was minus h to h,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.540
what would my three points be?

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.750
My three points would be
this point, y_1, and y_2

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.920
would be right here.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.660
Well the quadratic
through those points

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.870
is much closer to
the actual function.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.460
And if I cut that in half
again, I'd have points here,

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.890
here, and here.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.730
Something like that,
and that starts

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.660
to look almost exactly
like a quadratic.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.222
So if I found the
area under this--

00:03:35.222 --> 00:03:36.680
or if I wanted to
estimate the area

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.070
under this piece
of the curve using

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.170
a quadratic through
those three points,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.280
they would be very close.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.680
So don't be alarmed
by Simpson's rule

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.371
as an approximation based
on this large picture.

00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:51.620
So now, what do we have to do?

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.703
Remember, what's our goal?

00:03:52.703 --> 00:03:55.280
Our goal is to figure out where
the coefficients come from.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.970
So what I actually
need to do is I need

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.870
to evaluate a certain integral.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.220
Or I need to integrate
a certain function.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.650
I need to integrate P of x.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.220
So what I'm going to be finding
through the rest of this video,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.310
is the integral from
minus h to h of P of x dx.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.750
And my goal is to show
that this integral is

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.840
equal to this expression.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.235
I want to show that
these are equal.

00:04:20.235 --> 00:04:20.860
That's my goal.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.305
So let's get down to it.

00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:26.930
What do I know?

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.780
What's the only thing I know
right away about P of x?

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.166
I know I'm choosing it to
be a quadratic function

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:34.165
and I know it goes through
three certain points.

00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:35.390
Right?

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.210
I'll write down what the three
points are when we need them.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.330
But first let's just
say, in general,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.010
let's take this integral
for a general quadratic

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.690
and see how much information
we actually need.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.940
So let me come over here.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.304
Actually, let me say first, what
do I mean my general quadratic?

00:04:55.304 --> 00:04:57.220
I mean something of the
form big A, capital A,

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.990
x squared plus B*x plus C.
So I'm not filling in values

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.950
for these coefficients yet.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.870
Those coefficients are coming
exactly from my three points.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.850
(x_0, y_0), (x_1,
y_1), and (x_2, y_2).

00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:14.950
So let's just integrate
that from minus h

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.812
to h first and see what
kind of information we need.

00:05:18.812 --> 00:05:19.770
So if I come over here.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:32.570
So what do I get when I
actually integrate this?

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.180
Well, I get A x to
the third over 3,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.724
plus B x squared
over 2, plus C*x,

00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:42.640
and then I have to
evaluate from minus h to h.

00:05:46.937 --> 00:05:48.520
Well, if you were
thinking about this,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.000
it shouldn't be surprising
that when I do this,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.080
there's not going
to be a B term.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.840
Why is that?

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.790
Well, these two
functions are even.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.172
A x squared and C
are even functions.

00:05:59.172 --> 00:06:00.880
And I'm integrating
over something that's

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.130
symmetric about the y-axis.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.420
I'm going from minus h to h.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.460
So if you think
about A x squared,

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.960
and I'm going from
minus h to h, I'm

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.430
finding the area under a
quadratic, from minus h to h,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.200
it's going to be twice
the area from 0 to h.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.470
But B*x, that's a
line with slope B.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:24.410
If I wanted to integrate
B*x from minus h to h,

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.670
that's the area, the signed area
under the curve, of a line B*x,

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.770
from minus h to h.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.120
If I just draw a quick picture,
what does that look like?

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.970
It's symmetric with respect
to a rotation there.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.210
I'd have this signed area.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.960
This is the curve y equals B*x.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.420
From minus h to h, I get
this area is negative

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.470
and this are is positive
and they're equal.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.940
So, what I'm about to do,
you shouldn't be surprised

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.100
there won't be a B term.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.370
So what do we actually
get when we evaluate this?

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:03.470
We get 2A h cubed,
over 3, plus 2*C*h.

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:07.390
That's what we get.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.723
You can actually work it all,
put in all the h's and see

00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:12.860
that, but I knew I was
going to have double

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.660
what was here when I
evaluated at h, and nothing

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.870
from the B term.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.400
So we're getting closer.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.280
We're getting closer.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.113
We might not look like
we're getting closer,

00:07:23.113 --> 00:07:24.320
but we're getting closer.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.210
So let's simplify this
expression a little bit.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.680
Actually, what I ultimately need
to do is I need to figure out C

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.870
and I need to figure
out something over here.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.960
I need to actually
figure out A h squared.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.080
And let me explain why I need
to figure out A h squared.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.790
In the end, if I come
over back to what

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.620
I want to show-- let me
even box it, so we see it--

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.340
I want to show that
this integral, which

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.360
I've started to calculate,
is equal to h over

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.100
3 times this quantity.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.610
So I want to keep
one around, but I

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.600
want the other, any
other powers of h

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.440
to not be there when I'm done.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:07:59.940
Right?

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.290
I need one power of h there.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.570
In fact I need an
h over 3 there.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.540
So I think what I'll
do is I'll start off

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.470
and I'll pull out an
h over 3, and then

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.320
I'll try and figure out if I can
get the rest of my expression

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.220
to look like what's
in the parentheses.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.140
That's really, ultimately,
what I'd like to do.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.130
So let's come back over here.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.355
I'm going to pull out an h
over 3 from both of these

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:23.146
and we're going to see
what we end up with.

00:08:23.146 --> 00:08:28.359
OK so if I pull out an h over
3 here, what do I end up with?

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:28.900
This is easy.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.340
That's 2A h squared.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.340
And this one's a
little bit trickier.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.470
But I have to multiply by
3 over 3 to get a 3 there.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.570
So I end up with 6C.

00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:45.250
OK.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.041
Let's make sure I didn't
make any mistakes.

00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:50.660
If I multiply through here
I get 2A h cubed over 3.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:56.790
If I multiply through here I
get 2h*C. Looking good so far.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.295
Now I have to figure out A and
C, or A h squared and C. Well,

00:09:01.295 --> 00:09:02.970
C is pretty easy to find.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.550
Let's think about why that is.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.200
I have this polynomial.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.840
The polynomial was equal to--
if we come over here and we look

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.730
again, it's A x squared
plus B*x plus C.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.350
And the polynomial has to go
through those three points I

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.340
had.

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:22.120
So when x is 0, P of 0
is C. So let's come back

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.190
and look at our picture.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:28.240
When x is 0, what's the
output on the white curve?

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.640
It's y_1.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.290
So C is exactly y_1.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.910
How am I going to
find A h squared?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.940
Well, what I need to do is
use these other two points.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.280
I'm going to evaluate the
function P of x at minus h.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.510
And its output has to be y_0.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:47.430
And I'm going to evaluate
the function P of x at h

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.054
and its output has to be y_2.

00:09:50.054 --> 00:09:51.970
So we're going to come
over to the other side,

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:53.780
but that's really
what we're doing next.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:59.900
So let's come over here
and let's evaluate P of h

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.590
and P of minus h.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:12.290
So P of h is A h
squared plus B*h plus C.

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:23.240
And P of minus h is A h
squared minus B*h plus C. OK.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:23.740
What else?

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.340
Again we said this one
has to be y_2, the output,

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.300
and this one has to be y_0.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.420
Because the output
at h has to agree

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.530
with the output of
the function f of x.

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.530
And its output at h was y_2.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.080
The output at minus
h of P has to be

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.490
the same as the output
at minus h of f.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.644
And that was y_0.

00:10:43.644 --> 00:10:45.310
Now this might not
look fun yet but what

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.350
if I add these two
things together.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.440
What happens?

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:54.110
I get 2A h squared.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.270
These drop out.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:06.980
And then I get plus 2C
is equal to y_0 plus y_2.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.060
I'm getting closer.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.610
I'm getting much closer.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.300
Because now notice what I have.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.412
I have 2A h squared,
I can isolate that.

00:11:14.412 --> 00:11:16.370
And that's something that
I want to figure out.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:17.786
I want to figure
out 2A h squared.

00:11:17.786 --> 00:11:20.620
So let's figure
out what that is.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:29.140
2A h squared is equal to
y_0 plus y_2 minus, well

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.640
what did we say C was?

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.210
C was the output at x equals 0.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.240
Which is y1.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.840
So it's minus 2C, which is minus
2y_1 So now we're very close,

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.740
we're very close to
getting what we want.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.716
And that's good, because
I'm almost out of room.

00:11:45.716 --> 00:11:47.090
So let's take that
expression, we

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.450
were working on this
expression right here,

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.930
and let's start to
fill in what we get.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:56.260
We get h over 3
times 2A h squared,

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:02.030
which is y_0 plus
y_2 minus 2y_1,

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.980
and then I have to add 6C.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.010
Now what's C?

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.970
C is y_1.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.390
So I'm going to add 6y_1.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:18.940
And if I simplify that, I
get y_0-- bingo-- plus 4y_1

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.770
plus y_2.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.290
And that's what we wanted.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.090
So let me take us through
kind of where all this came

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.920
from again, what the big pieces
were and we'll see now we

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.330
understand how we do Simpson's
rule, and these small chunks

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.680
of Simpson's rule.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.388
So let's come back to
the very beginning.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.570
OK, in the very beginning,
what we had was a function

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.120
f of x, that was
the white curve.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.270
y equals f of x was
the white curve.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.590
And then I found
a quadratic that

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.597
went through minus h, y0,
(0, y_1), and (h, y_2).

00:12:54.597 --> 00:12:55.930
Went through those three points.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.314
And I called that
quadratic P of x.

00:12:59.314 --> 00:13:00.730
And then what I
was doing, we know

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.720
Simpson's rule says find the
area under the curve of P

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.190
of x between minus h and h.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.390
So what I did was
I came over here

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.640
and I said OK, P of x, integral
of P of x from minus h to h.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.200
I wrote P of x in a
very general form.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.900
And then I actually
found an integral.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.275
I came through and
after writing it out,

00:13:21.275 --> 00:13:23.400
calculating the integral,
I got to this expression.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.180
This is actually the integral
of P of x from minus h to h.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.900
So it's the area under the curve
of P of x from minus h to h

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.270
is that.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.680
And now I had to
figure this out,

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.250
how to write this in terms
of the outputs of f of x.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.340
Which were y_0, y_1, and y_2.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:42.550
Those were the ones
we were interested in.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.270
So I ultimately knew I wanted
an h over three in front.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.160
I knew I wanted my integral
in my quadratic to be

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.940
h over 3 times something,
so I pulled out an h over 3,

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.144
and then I looked at
what this expression was.

00:13:55.144 --> 00:13:56.560
And if I could get
this expression

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.880
to look like the inside
of what I wanted,

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.460
which was y_0 plus 4y_1
plus y_2, I was in business.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.300
And so then I used
outputs that I

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.190
knew for P of x to
find 2A h squared

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.720
and to find C. I know P of h
is the output of the f of x

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:17.560
function at the far
right, which was y_2.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.710
And I knew P of minus h
was the output of the f

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.070
of x function at the far left.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.500
That's y_0.

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.600
I actually then evaluate
P at h and minus h,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.220
and when I add those together,
I get my 2A h squared

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.600
in terms of y_0, y_1, and y_2.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.320
Let me do this in terms
of y_0, y_1, and y_2.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.972
Because I also knew C was y_1.

00:14:36.972 --> 00:14:38.180
We talked about that as well.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.820
C had to be y_1.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.000
So I can then do the
substitution I need right here

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.640
and show where the coefficients
in Simpson's rule come from.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.390
So hopefully that was
informative for you.

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.990
And I think I'll stop there.
