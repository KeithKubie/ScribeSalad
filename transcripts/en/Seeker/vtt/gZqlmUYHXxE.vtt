00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.460
California is currently experiencing one of
the most severe droughts on record, and new

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.260
NASA data says it’s worse than we thought.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.260
Hey guys, Amy here for DNews.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.380
A drought is a natural hazard that develops
slowly over time as a climate or environment

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.380
changes.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.949
Water levels drop in the lakes and rivers
that we draw water from, forcing reliance

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.560
on underground stores called aquifers, sources
of fresh water that farmers also rely heavily

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.909
on, particularly in times of drought.

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.820
So what exactly is an aquifer?

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.430
An aquifer is a saturated rock that water
can easily move through.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.270
Typically these rocks are permeable and porous,
though non-porous rocks like granite can be

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.080
aquifers if they’re fractured enough to
hold water in the free spaces.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.670
This is where well water comes from; wells
are drilled into aquifers so the water inside

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.250
the rock can be pumped out.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.690
If the well goes dry, you just have to dig
deeper and lower the water table.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.800
Water flows into and eventually drains from
an aquifer in a cycle, so each has a natural

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.160
recharge and discharge zone or zones.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.070
The recharge zones typically lie at higher
altitudes so water can flow down, but they

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.370
can occur wherever it’s natural for water
to move.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.929
The discharge zones typically occur in springs
and low altitude wetlands.

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.829
The other benefit of this groundwater is that
the rock acts as a natural filter that traps

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.929
sediment and other nasty particles like bacteria
so the water that flows from the spring is

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.670
beautifully clean and clear.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.929
But aquifers can become contaminated, typically
by humans.

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.500
Contaminants can flow into an aquifer from
a natural or manmade pathway that drains into

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.680
the waterlogged rock.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.100
And as NASA’s GRACE mission is showing,
these underground water stores are drying

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.100
up.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.340
The GRACE mission uses two satellites flying
in tandem to very accurately measure variations

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.860
in the Earth’s gravity field.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.350
Changes to ocean currents do affect gravity
measurements.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.829
So do movements of glaciers.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.490
And so does the movement of ground water,
so these satellites can see that aquifers

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.289
are actually drying up because the gravity
in these areas is changing.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.619
And it’s a global thing.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.819
Using GRACE data of 37 aquifers over the course
of 10 years, scientists see that groundwater

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.610
is being rapidly depleted in the Middle East,
North Africa and Central Asia, and in the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.610
United States.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.710
The aquifer under California's Central Valley
is being badly overused.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.890
Even aquifers in sparsely populated and wet
areas like the Amazon Basin and the Great

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.030
Plains are doing a little better thanks to
rainfall that replenishes the water stores.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.660
That less water is available globally is starting
to affect political relations.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.560
Border issues in some parts of the world are
becoming increasingly complex as fights break

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.040
out about access to water under those borders.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.660
To learn more about how low water levels in
aquifers is affecting inter country relations,

And there’s a link in the description below!

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.810

saving water!

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.560
Turn the tap off while you brush your teeth!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.750
Don’t linger in the shower because you’re
bored!

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.590
What little things do you guys do to save
