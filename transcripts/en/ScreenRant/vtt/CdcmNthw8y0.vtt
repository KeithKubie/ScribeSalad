00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.130
It's safe to say that there's been enough
criticism and outright hate for the Star Wars

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.849
prequel trilogy to last a lifetime. But outside
of the plot, the characters, and the changes

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:23.779
made to the larger Star Wars mythology, it's
just as much fun to spot the mistakes, errors,

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.560
or blown takes that pop up in any blockbuster
movie. The fact that these made it into the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.399
galaxy far, far away just makes them that
much more memorable. Here are Screen Rant's

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.170
10 Star Wars Movie Mistakes You Missed PREQUEL
EDITION.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.730
An Observant Queen

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.540
Have you ever seen a movie scene so many times,
you can recite the lines along with the characters?

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.210
Well, it happens to actors, too - especially
younger ones who aren't used to hearing their

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.930
castmates repeat themselves for multiple takes.
In the Phantom Menace, Natalie Portman apparently

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.000
couldn't help herself, and had to mimic her
costar Liam Neeson introducing himself to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.420
Anakin's mother as "Qui-Gon Jinn," mouthing
the words right along with him. Good luck

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.519
ever missing that again.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.140
The Wig is Strong With Him

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.030
It's a reality of the movie business that
reshoots are almost always needed for large

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.290
scale movies. When the actors have gone on
to sport different haircuts since filming,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.909
things can get a bit more interesting. Star
Wars buffs can play an hour-long game of spotting

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.850
Ewan McGregor's wig, which makes some unforgettable
appearances, hard to miss since it's not even

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.490
close to the actual hairstyle the young Obi-Wan
Kenobi sports throughout the rest of the movie.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.930
Double Trouble

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.329
When a film includes dozens of principal actors
and is filmed outside of Hollywood, directors

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.520
are going to get plenty of use out of their
doubles and stand-ins - actors who look enough

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.590
like their stars to get by in background shots.
But when the Jedi Council arrives on Naboo

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.990
once the Trade Federation has been defeated,
it's clear Samuel L. Jackson couldn't make

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.880
an appearance as Mace Windu. That's not a
crime, but the crew probably should have just

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.680
left him out of the scene, instead of marching
his double through the frame alongside his

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.869
alien colleagues.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:58.369
Royal Fashion

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.340
The dresses and headpieces of Queen Amidala
stole the show in Episode 1, including one

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.939
dress that includes glowing orange orbs, as
if fabric wasn't enough. Don't spend too much

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.369
time wondering how the effects team got the
orbs to actually light up, though. Take a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.040
look in the background and you'll notice the
black power cord clearly running from the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.680
stone across the floor. How the effects team
couldn't find time to paint out that mistake

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.680
is impossible to know.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.680
Watch Your Head

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.209
Characters knocking their heads on doors is
kind of a running joke in the Star Wars series,

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.530
after a stormtrooper started the tradition
in A New Hope, and Jango kept it alive in

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.680
Attack of the clones. But one other door mishap
isn't quite as much fun. The effects team

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.629
put a lot of time into creating a complicated
CG door on Geonosis, but it still required

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.580
the actors to duck underneath it. Anakin didn't
get the message, passing his head right through

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.790
it, ruining the effect.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.500
Saber Issues

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.129
There's no weapon in the galaxy like a lightsaber,
a beam of energy that can cut through almost

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.569
anything. The prop swords used by the actors...
not so much. Pay close attention to Anakin's

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.390
swordfighting skills in a Geonosian factory,
and you'll catch a glimpse of actor Hayden

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.620
Christensen snagging his sword on his hood
and his sleeve, and struggling to remove it

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.790
before the camera cuts away, showing the Jedi's
blade isn't always an elegant weapon.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.069
Not-So-Special Effects

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.470
George Lucas' decision to use almost no practical
sets for the more extravagant buildings in

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.560
the story led to some questionable effects,
but one stands out above all others. When

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.790
Anakin is being won over by Chancellor Palpatine,
it's clear that the set they're walking through

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.769
is a digital creation. But when the camera
pans to the door, not only is the exit a painfully

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.569
fake painting, but the image itself actually
distorts and stretches. So even the best in

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.260
the business have shots they're not proud
of.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.760
A Psychic Senator?

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.099
When Anakin, Obi-Wan and Padme are chasing
down Count Dooku during Episode 2's final

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.909
act, an explosion sends the Senator overboard
leaving the two Jedi to track the Sith lord

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:02.340
to his secret hangar. The fight that follows
doesn't go their way, with Anakin losing his

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.040
arm. But Padme has apparently been watching
the fight along with the audience, since she

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.580
tells the clone troopers who come to return
her to safety where they're really needed.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:18.060
A hangar and battle that she has no actual
way of knowing anything about. Was she a Jedi

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.669
this whole time?

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:20.930
Gravity

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.930
Artificial gravity in spaceships can be a
tricky thing for sci-fi movies, which is why

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.190
most films commit to either zero gee or simulated
gravity. But in Episode 3's opening sequence,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.870
a ship is sent into freefall down towards
a planet's surface, sending the characters

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.970
either sliding downward, or running along
a now-horizontal elevator shaft. But neither

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.919
makes sense. If the ship has no artificial
gravity, freefall is freefall, and the characters

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.100
should be weightless. Either way, the artificial
gravity being turned on its side should be

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.139
impossible. We guess that's why these movies
are fantasy, not science fiction.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.889
Liquid Hot Magma

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:03.500
In the hundreds of effects and CG shots in
the prequels films, a lot, and we mean a lot

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.700
of small mistakes slipped through. But one
is guaranteed to annoy any fan of volcano

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.479
action films. When Anakin has been de-limbed,
burned and left for dead, a shuttle from the

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:19.300
Emperor comes to rescue him. Pay attention
to its shadow: when you realize it's somehow

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.130
darkening the glowing lava flowing beneath
it, as if it's lit by the sun, not itself,

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.789
you'll get a clear idea of how much time was
spent making these shots... scientifically

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.320
sound.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.050
Those are the most entertaining mistakes,
errors and goofs we've found in the Star Wars

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.190
prequels, but are there any we missed?

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.620
Let’s hope J.J. Abrams will make sure he
doesn’t have as many in The Force Awakens!
