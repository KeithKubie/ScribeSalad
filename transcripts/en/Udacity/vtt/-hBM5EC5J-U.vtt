00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, you could have solve this problem using the equation of motion that we learned about in unit 2

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or you could have use our new super cool technique of the work energy theory,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is how I'm going to solve this one.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
For work energy theory, first we need the total work and that is given by this equation.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well, let's look at the forces on the ball.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Well, this is an easy one, there is only gravity pointing downwards.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay, and Î”x, well, we're just going to use this distance 57 meters.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
W = mg  57 and that is also equal to the change in kinetic energy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And notice that an amazing but necessary thing happens, the mass cancels out.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I can also multiply both sides by 2.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Oh and don't forget that the initial velocity was zero since it was released from rest,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and now, we have this equation.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I just take the square root of both sides, and I get the final velocity of 34 m/s.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So, now, we have another tool to solve this problem.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We'll find there's actually places where this tool will solve problems that our previous tools couldn't.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I think I teased you a little too much when I said,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I don't know what energy is, but I know what energy does.

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's dove into that a little more deeply.
