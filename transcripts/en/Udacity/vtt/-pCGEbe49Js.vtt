00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.230
In addition to having query ID and randomization of that ID, the resolver can

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.820
randomize the source port on which it

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.810
sends the query, thereby adding an additional 16

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.000
bits of entropy to the ID that's

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.640
associated with the query. Unfortunately, picking a random

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.610
source port can be resource intensive and

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.770
also a network address translator or a NAT,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.170
could derandomize the port. Another defense is called the 0x20 or the zero x20

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.730
encoding, which is based on the intuition that DNS matching and resolution

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.240
is entirely case insensitive. So capitalization

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.920
of individual letters in the domain name

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.830
do not affect the answer that the resolver will return. This 0x20 bit,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.630
or the bit that affects whether a

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.470
particular character is capitalized or in lower case

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.640
can also be used to introduce additional entropy.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.420
When generating a response to a query such

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.960
as this one, the query is copied from the DNS query into the response exactly

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.970
as it was in the query. The mixed pattern of upper and lower case letters thus

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.440
constitutes a channel. If the resolver and the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.250
authoritative server can agree on a shared key,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.810
then the resolver and the authoritative are the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.500
only ones who know the appropriate pattern of

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.640
upper and lower case letters for a particular

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.840
domain name. Because no attacker would know the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.450
appropriate combination of upper and lower case letters

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.560
for a particular domain. It becomes even more difficult

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.030
for the attacker to inject a bogus reply,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.740
because not only would the attacker have to guess

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.550
the ID, but the attacker would also have to

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.150
guess the capitalization sequence for any particular domain name.
