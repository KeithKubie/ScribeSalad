00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:02.485
- [Voiceover] So we have
the differential equation,

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:04.404
the derivative of y with respect to x

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:08.442
is equal to y over six times four minus y.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:09.794
And what we have plotted right over here

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:11.412
is the slope field or a slope field

00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:14.433
for this differential
equation and we can verify

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:18.654
that this indeed is a slope field

00:00:18.654 --> 00:00:20.013
for this differential equation,

00:00:20.013 --> 00:00:22.157
let's draw a little table here,

00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:25.181
so let's just verify a few points,

00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:30.181
so let's say x, y, and dy/dx.

00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:34.896
So let's say we start with, I don't know,

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:39.896
let's start with this point
right over here, one comma one,

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:43.769
when x is one, and y is
one, well when I look at

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:47.405
the differential equation,
1/6 times four minus one,

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:50.959
so it's 1/6 times three, which is 3/6,

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:54.603
which is 1/2, and we see
indeed on the slope field,

00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:58.454
they depicted the slope
there if a solution goes

00:00:58.454 --> 00:01:02.259
to that point, right at that
point, its slope would be 1/2.

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:05.275
And as you see, it's actually
only dependent on the y-value,

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:08.050
it doesn't matter what x
is as long as y is one,

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.511
dy/dx is going to be 1/2,
and you see that's why

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:15.556
when x is 1 1/2, and y is one,
you still have a slope of 1/2

00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:20.454
and as long as y is one,
all of these sampled points

00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:25.985
right over here, all have a slope of 1/2,

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:28.411
so that, just looking at
that, that makes us feel

00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:30.877
that this slope field is consistent

00:01:30.877 --> 00:01:32.583
with this differential
equation, but let's try a few

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:34.530
other points just to feel a
little bit better about it,

00:01:34.053 --> 00:01:36.364
and then we will use a slope field

00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:39.605
to actually visualize some solutions.

00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:41.559
So let's say, let's do
an interesting point,

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:44.587
let's say we have this point, actually no,

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:47.010
that's at a half point, let's say we have

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:51.480
this, let's see, let's say we
do this point right over here,

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:54.658
so that's x is equal to
one, and y is equal to six,

00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:56.090
and we see the way the
differential equation

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.058
is defined, it doesn't
matter what our x is,

00:01:57.058 --> 00:01:58.753
it's really dependent
on the y that's going

00:01:59.275 --> 00:02:02.720
to drive the slope, but
we have 6/6, which is one,

00:02:02.072 --> 00:02:05.043
times four minus six,
which is negative two.

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.193
So it's negative two, so we should

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:08.822
have a slope of negative two and it

00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:11.370
looks like that's what they
depicted, so as long as

00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:14.201
y is six, we should have
a slope of negative two.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:17.127
Have a slope of negative two,

00:02:17.127 --> 00:02:19.500
and you see that in the slope field.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:20.112
So hopefully you feel
pretty good that this

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.783
is the slope field for
this differential equation,

00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:26.182
if you don't, I encourage
you to keep verifying

00:02:26.182 --> 00:02:28.741
these points here, but
now let's actually use

00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:30.882
the slope field, let's actually use this,

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:34.193
to visualize solutions to
this differential equation

00:02:34.193 --> 00:02:37.154
based on points that the
solution might go through.

00:02:37.154 --> 00:02:40.490
So let's say that we have a solution

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.135
that goes through this
point right over here.

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:45.498
So what is that solution
likely to look like?

00:02:45.813 --> 00:02:48.134
And once again this is going
to be a rough approximation,

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:48.223
well right at that point it's going

00:02:49.024 --> 00:02:51.852
to have a slope just as
the slope field shows,

00:02:51.852 --> 00:02:55.370
and as our y increases,
it looks like our slope,

00:02:55.037 --> 00:02:56.500
it looks like our slope...

00:02:56.833 --> 00:02:59.147
so at this point I should be, actually

00:02:59.147 --> 00:03:04.147
let me undo that, so if I
keep going up at this point

00:03:05.177 --> 00:03:07.819
when y is equal to two
I should be parallel

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.862
to all of these segments
on the slope field

00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:14.411
that y is equal to two,
and then it looks like

00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:18.474
the slope starts to
decrease as we approach

00:03:19.041 --> 00:03:23.430
y is equal to four, and
so if I had a solution

00:03:23.043 --> 00:03:24.615
that went through this point,

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:28.157
my guess is that would look something,

00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:30.201
and then now the slope decreases again

00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:35.201
as we approach y is equal to zero.

00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:37.662
And of course we see that,
because if when y equals zero

00:03:37.662 --> 00:03:38.947
this whole thing is zero so our

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.052
derivative is going to be zero.

00:03:41.052 --> 00:03:44.256
So, a reasonable solution might

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:46.705
look something like this,
so this gives us a clue

00:03:46.736 --> 00:03:49.540
of, look, if a solution
goes through this point,

00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:53.545
this right over here might
be what it looks like.

00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:56.172
But what if it goes through, I don't know,

00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:58.237
what if it goes through
this point right over here?

00:03:58.822 --> 00:04:01.723
Well then, it might look like...

00:04:01.723 --> 00:04:06.723
It might look like this
by the same exact logic.

00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:09.953
So it might look like
this, so just like that,

00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.908
we're trying to get a
sense, we don't know the

00:04:11.908 --> 00:04:13.949
actual solution for this
differential equation,

00:04:14.318 --> 00:04:15.832
but we're starting to get a sense of what

00:04:15.832 --> 00:04:19.418
type of functions or
the class of functions,

00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:22.363
that might satisfy the
differential equation.

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:24.136
But, what's interesting
about this slope field,

00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:27.209
is it looks like there's
some interesting stuff

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:31.888
if our solution includes points between

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:34.439
where the y value is
between zero and four,

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.987
it looks like we're going
to have solutions like this,

00:04:35.987 --> 00:04:39.582
but what if we had y-values
that were larger than that

00:04:39.582 --> 00:04:44.356
or that were less than that,
or exactly zero or four?

00:04:44.356 --> 00:04:46.672
So for example, what if
we had a solution that

00:04:46.672 --> 00:04:48.828
went through this point right over here?

00:04:48.828 --> 00:04:50.546
Well, that point right
over here, the slope field

00:04:50.546 --> 00:04:53.065
tells us that our slope is zero.

00:04:53.065 --> 00:04:54.476
So our y-value is not going to change,

00:04:54.476 --> 00:04:57.018
and as long as our y-value doesn't change,

00:04:57.018 --> 00:04:58.581
our y-value is going to stay at four,

00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:00.643
so our slope is going to stay at zero,

00:05:00.643 --> 00:05:02.326
so we actually already
found this is actually

00:05:02.326 --> 00:05:04.848
a solution to the differential
equation, y is equal

00:05:04.848 --> 00:05:09.112
to four is a solution to
this differential equation.

00:05:09.112 --> 00:05:14.112
So, y is equal to four,
and you can verify that

00:05:14.745 --> 00:05:17.991
that is a solution,
when y is equal to four,

00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:21.354
this right-hand side is going to be zero,

00:05:21.354 --> 00:05:24.923
and the derivative is zero
for y is equal to four.

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:28.308
So that is a solution to
the differential equation.

00:05:28.308 --> 00:05:31.372
And the same thing for y is equal to zero.

00:05:31.948 --> 00:05:35.292
That is also a solution to
the differential equation.

00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:37.674
Now what if we included points,

00:05:37.674 --> 00:05:39.312
what if we included this point up here,

00:05:39.312 --> 00:05:41.336
and actually, let me do
it in a different color,

00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:44.273
so that you could see it, let's say our

00:05:44.273 --> 00:05:46.188
solution included that point.

00:05:46.188 --> 00:05:51.188
Well then it might look
something like this,

00:05:51.696 --> 00:05:53.724
and once again, I'm just
using the slope field

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:57.837
as a guide to give me an
idea of what the slope

00:05:57.837 --> 00:06:02.837
might be as my curve progresses,
as my solution progresses.

00:06:03.247 --> 00:06:06.754
So solution that includes
the point zero five,

00:06:06.754 --> 00:06:08.663
might look something like this,

00:06:08.663 --> 00:06:11.704
and once again, it's just another clue.

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:16.704
A solution that includes the
point zero negative 1 1/2,

00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:19.746
might look something like...

00:06:19.746 --> 00:06:23.697
might look something like this.

00:06:23.697 --> 00:06:27.903
So anyway, hopefully this
gives you a better appreciation

00:06:27.903 --> 00:06:30.121
for why slope fields are interesting.

00:06:30.121 --> 00:06:31.919
If you have a differential equation

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:34.160
that just involves the first derivative,

00:06:34.016 --> 00:06:35.750
and some x's and y's,
this one only involves

00:06:35.894 --> 00:06:37.857
the first derivative and y's.

00:06:37.857 --> 00:06:39.826
We can plot a slope field like this,

00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:42.961
not too much trouble if we
essentially just keep solving

00:06:42.961 --> 00:06:45.825
for the slopes, and then
we can use that slope field

00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:47.799
to get a conceptual or
visual understanding

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:49.861
of what the solutions might look like

00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:54.861
given points that the solutions
might actually contain.
