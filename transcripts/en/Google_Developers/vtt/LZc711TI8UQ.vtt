&gt;&gt; Rishi Chandra: Let's look at a few examples.
First, I would like to invite Hunter Walk

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.629
from YouTube to showcase an exciting new YouTube
site.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.139
Hunter.
[ Applause ]

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:18.460
&gt;&gt;Hunter Walk: Thanks.
So we couldn't be more excited about Google

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.970
TV. We really think this is the platform that
starts to bring the interactivity of the Web

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.849
into the living room.
And so we're proud to announce the development

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.120
of YouTube lean-back which is meant to take
the entire YouTube corpus, hundreds of millions

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.000
of videos, and turn them into an experience
that you can lean back and enjoy.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The first thing you notice is that when you
go to YouTube Lean-Back it just starts playing.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.300
There's no browsing, no searching, no clicking.
It behaves like you would expect television

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.230
to. And what is it playing? Well, it's playing
one very important channel, the channel of

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.070
you.
A personalized video feed that's meant to

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.080
be exactly the content that you want to watch.
For example, this first video was favorited

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.670
by my friend Simon. He was on YouTube, he
saw it, he liked it, he favorited it. Because

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.520
we are friends, it gets pushed into my stream.
So using Google TV we are able to make the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.270
living room social.
But you don't have to just rely on your friends.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.030
There is also lots of great content in your
personal feed based upon what we think you

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.670
are going to like. So for example, here is
a music video from one of my favorite artists.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.509
Now, why is this here? It's because I subscribed
to his channel on YouTube which means as he

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.249
uploads new content, I am going to get it
right away. We have essentially turned all

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:35.609
your preferences into video subscriptions
that are just waiting for you.

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.310
But we don't have to rely just on the channel
of you. Beyond that, there's other ways you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.189
can browse. There are a bunch of default channels
of things you would expect, comedy, music,

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:52.429
news and sports, and you can even add your
own channels, like a channel dedicated unicorns,

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.999
if that's what you are into. I like sports;
manly, manly sports.

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:02.310
And of course, as YouTube adds new content,
it's going to show up here as well.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.079
So my rentals. As you might have heard, we
started to roll out paper stream abilities

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.701
for content creators on our platform. What
happens is you rent that on YouTube.com and

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:15.310
it's waiting right here on your television
for you to bring up and watch. So it's just

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.450
that simple.
So in all, we really believe that, prior,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.980
lean-back meant you had to give up control.
You had to watch what somebody else programmed

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.360
for you. But with YouTube lean-back on Google
TV, you are going to be able to access your

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.010
personal video feed in beautiful HD on your
TV at any time you want. And because developing

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.830
for Google TV is just like developing for
the Web, this isn't a TV device. This is a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.610
Web interface. And so within the next few
weeks, I am happy to announce we are going

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.010
to be launching a beta of this on the YouTube
Web site that you can access, try out for

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.650
yourself and give us feedback. So we are incredibly
excited by Google TV and YouTube lean-back.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.850
Thanks.
