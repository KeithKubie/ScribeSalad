1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,770
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,720
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcasts and

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,750
just checking it on Ya.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm checking in on you
because I give a fuck. Right.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,040
I care about you. Oh, who gives a fuck?

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,050
I do. Um, how's your week going?
Everything going good with you.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,590
I hope it is. Um, all freckles.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,010
The pasty old fucking man,
48 years old.

9
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:38,150
My back feels better than it has since
that since I don't know when, um,

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,080
just been going to the chiropractor
and getting this fucking,

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,840
the shit beat out of me in
massages is finally a, I dunno,

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,270
it's fucking great. I guess my
spine was compressed and twisted

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,610
for, for decades. So, you know,

14
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:02,570
after having professionals beat the shit
out of me for like weekly for like the

15
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:07,130
last since May, I guess. Um,
I dunno. I think I finally,

16
00:01:07,131 --> 00:01:11,720
I undid the, they undid it or whatever.
But now, like when I go to stretch,

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,780
when I go to a, you know,
you know the whole thing,

18
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:17,960
you lay on your back and this young people
won't know this because they just get

19
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:20,300
up off the couch and start running.
They're fine because they're young,

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,580
but old people, you know that
she lay on the floor, right?

21
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:26,450
You get down on the floor, right?
You make that noise and you keep

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,910
going down and getting up.
It's the same noise. Ah, right.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,760
You get down on the fucking
ground and then yeah,

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,490
you bring one of your knees
up to your chest, right?

25
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,400
And then you bring it over to one side
and then you have your arms sticking out.

26
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,263
You know,

27
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,010
like almost like you're doing like some
sort of old time you football move right

28
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,930
high stepping over somebody.
But when I do that on the ground now,

29
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:50,420
I just bring that over in my back.

30
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:54,290
Just cracks from the lower back to
about three quarters of the way up.

31
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,300
And that never used to,
I wouldn't crack at all.

32
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:01,430
It was just all fucking jammed
in there. And um, feel good,

33
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:04,430
man. I've been working out, I host been
eating like a fucking animal though.

34
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,720
Went to a barbecue Sunday, so that's
all she wrote with that. Right.

35
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:09,680
And I did a show,

36
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:14,150
so I ate barbecue and then I also
fucking eight and a comedy club,

37
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:17,300
Green Room. I was working down
there and have most at the, uh,

38
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,930
the comedy and Magic Club and,
um,

39
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,770
which is really fucking cool to go down
there now because whenever I look at the

40
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,760
pier, I'm like, that's the
thing I fly over. Right? But,
you know, as I'm coming down,

41
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,350
you know, does the Hermosa Beach
Pier and then Manhattan Beach Pier,

42
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,960
when you get to that one, you gotta
be down around like, you know,

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,400
like 300 feet. And that's when
you call lax and say, Hey,

44
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:44,150
I want to fucking skit adol underneath
the fucking jets there. Right.

45
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,110
And I never knew any of that. I never
knew where the beaches were. I mean,

46
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:52,010
look at me,
this Red Eddie cut.

47
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,360
Know where the beaches are.

48
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,200
The only reason why I know where the
beaches are is so I know how to drive in

49
00:02:57,201 --> 00:02:58,220
the opposite direction.

50
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,660
I fucking hate the beach.
I fucking,

51
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,070
oh my God,
I hate the beach.

52
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,280
I love the fucking beautiful brown
people that go there, you know,

53
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,660
tanning themselves up. God bless you.
I sit there like the boy in the bubble,

54
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,823
you know,

55
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,400
and one of those Ford Astros' with the
slide and fucking door with the AC on

56
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:23,390
looking out like the boy in
the bubble. Right? Um, I,

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,850
I fucking hate it. I get there.
It's hot as fuck. It's boring.

58
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,640
I'm terrified to go in the ocean.
I'm not fucking going in there.

59
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,740
It's Goddamn sea monsters and
they're going to fucking grab you.

60
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,990
You know what? A bunch of editing,
what kind of a fucking moron. I just,

61
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:44,170
I'll never get over there at the fact
that people just swim in the fucking ocean

62
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:48,280
and the oils a shark attack
today. Yeah. You know, it's funny,

63
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,660
somebody goes to the fucking zoo and
they crawl into the fucking cage and they

64
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:57,430
get attacked. Everybody's
general consensus. Consensus
is yes, it's a tragedy.

65
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,050
And what are you going there for? What'd
you think was gonna Happen? You know,

66
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,180
you go to the beach and you
go into the fucking ocean,

67
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:07,870
everybody acts like it's a big,
it's a big surprise out of that happened,

68
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:12,220
I can't believe it.
You went into an unnatural environment,

69
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,470
right?

70
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,200
And do something where there was a bunch
of shit there that could kill you when

71
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:21,490
something did or took a chunk out of you
took a fucking bite out here. You know,

72
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,690
when you've come stumbling out of there.
I don't know why.

73
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:29,740
It just makes me think of an unfinished
cigar when somebody gets bit right.

74
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,960
You know what? I went to
this fucking party, right?

75
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:36,880
And I brought in Sony for my birthday
and got me this really incredible box of

76
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,690
cigars. So I, uh,

77
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,550
I immediately call all my friends
because you know, or whatever. It's like,

78
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,300
cause I'm not gonna smoke all 10 of
these fucking things. First of all,

79
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:52,540
that's not what cigar smoking is about
to social thing. Right. And secondly,

80
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,420
I don't want to smoke all of them because
I'm trying to keep the habit at bay.

81
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,830
All right. Special occasions
once to twice a month. Right.

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,490
So I brought it over there and
there was a bunch of hover and cons,

83
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,840
who all showed up.

84
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:09,430
Everybody acting like they're fucking
cigar smokers and some handing them out to

85
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:11,620
these people,
I don't fucking know.

86
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,380
And I turned my back and
like 15 minutes later,

87
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,770
like three of them have
been stomped out there.

88
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:19,480
Like they weren't even halfway done

89
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,050
fucking idiots anyway. So then I just, I
figured that's, you get bit by a shark,

90
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:28,540
you know, he'd come in,
it takes like, you know,

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,710
the bottom 30 you off and
you come out like a, like a
fucking unfinished. The gar.

92
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,720
No, I don't fucking know. It
made sense to me visually.

93
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:41,110
That's what I thought of
at all going to be relax.

94
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,250
This podcast doesn't even count. This
is me just checking in on you. Oh,

95
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:49,810
Billy back brace. Huh? I took it
off like fucking Forrest Gump.

96
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,360
I actually feel like I could run,

97
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,530
the only downside to my back feeling as
great as it does right now is I have to

98
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,200
fight myself from doing
something really stupid. Um,

99
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,180
but uh, but as always, I was psyched.
I didn't have to use any drugs.

100
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,040
I stayed away from all of that shit.

101
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,580
And it reminded me of that guy
when I used to watch that doc,

102
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,460
the doctor drew show,
the celebrity Rehab,

103
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:20,420
and there was that guy from taxi who since
passed away and he kind of got hooked

104
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,310
on painkillers and shit. He's
always bitch about his back. And a,

105
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:27,980
I remember I had, for whatever reason,
I was just thinking about that. Go, man,

106
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:31,640
I wish that guy went to a
fucking chiropractic and
[inaudible] Seuss instead of

107
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,640
going down the fucking painkiller
route. I don't know. Who knows?

108
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,440
He might have fucking done heroin first.

109
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,320
He might've fucked up his
back nod off on heroin.

110
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,200
Although they tend to
stand pretty upright.

111
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,110
They have to keep that back straight
and then their legs bend. I don't know.

112
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:49,800
But as always, I don't know what
the fuck's going on. Um, yeah.

113
00:06:49,801 --> 00:06:54,440
So Monday night, Sunday night,
sorry, I went to, uh, went
to the comedy Magic Club,

114
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,890
uh, worked. And that's not an easy
room. It's not an easy room to do. Well,

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,220
and as those people have
seen a ton of fucking comedy,

116
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,200
you know Jay Leno goes down there every
Sunday so they used to see in the top

117
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:07,490
notch shit.
So you know,

118
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:10,150
if you go down there and you have
fast that you get a bump. So it had,

119
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,031
I had a good set.

120
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:14,250
Fortunately I had something in
the middle of my set though I was,

121
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,670
I was leaning on the mic stand
and they had, and I had my,

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,450
my arm sorta like instead of
leaning onto how I usually do,

123
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,840
I had my arm up and something
was like pushing into my elbow.

124
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,730
And when my hand was like that,

125
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:29,510
I went to close my make a
fist and like my middle,

126
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,540
my index and my fucking
ring finger wouldn't close.

127
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,450
It was like in slow motion
really freaked me out.

128
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,900
I don't know what the Hell I did, but
what I'm basically telling you, people's,

129
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:42,710
I'm falling apart. Um, but my
back feels good. So anyways,

130
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:46,430
so that was the first night
of me like an asshole.

131
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,580
But I still work out every day,
fucking crushed in the elliptical.

132
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,450
I give it back at night,

133
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,870
a little bit fucking drink
here are fucking cheese stick,

134
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:58,790
whatever the fuck I have. Right?
But uh, then Monday last second,

135
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,250
a buddy of mine called me up and said,
hey,

136
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,890
sting and Peter Gabriel a plan at
the fucking Hollywood bowl, right?

137
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,310
So I said, you know what, I bet
Vinnie call Udas playing drums.

138
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,540
I got to go see that.
That's like a bucket list.

139
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,890
He's one of my favorite
drummers of all fucking time.

140
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,800
And he's one of those guys
who just keeps getting better.

141
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,870
He's an absolute monster.
I mean,

142
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:25,871
the guy's like pushing 60 years old
and he could still like blow away young

143
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,830
drummers in their teens.
You know what I mean?

144
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:30,890
A lot of young drummers just thinking
of all the young guys are the shit and

145
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:34,580
they're all fucking flashy. And
then as guys get older, you know,

146
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,940
they stopped practicing or whatever.
He's one of the few fucking guys,

147
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,500
there was no drop off.

148
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:43,910
He just kept getting better and better
and better and better. So I say,

149
00:08:43,911 --> 00:08:48,170
fuck this, right? So I
called up somebody, you know,

150
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,290
who was in the know and I was like,
Hey, is Vinny play in tonight?

151
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,350
And they were like, they got back to
me and I was like, fuck, that was the,

152
00:08:54,351 --> 00:08:57,060
that was the game right there. I was
like, I gotta go fucking see it. Right?

153
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:59,640
So I go on the hub of the stub there,

154
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:03,870
they'll stub hub and just pay through
the fucking nose, get as close as I can.

155
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,410
So now I'm all fucking excited.
I'm all Dow low, right?

156
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,110
And I'm fucking going, oh my God, you
look at, they got to drum kits up there.

157
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,440
I'm guests,
Peter Gabriel's going to open do is set,

158
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,340
then stings going to do with
fucking set and then a, the end,

159
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:22,940
they're going to come out and sing,
fucking have on the Gila, whatever.

160
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,070
They're gonna do some sort
of encore together, right?

161
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,810
The fucking show starts.
Okay.

162
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,100
And the, uh, there was so
many fucking people on stage.

163
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:38,010
I didn't know what was going on.
And Peter Gabriel all of a sudden is like,

164
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,960
you know, you guys like right in front of
us, he sings one of his fucking, I dunno,

165
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,860
world music songs. It was amazing. And
his voice sounded fucking incredible.

166
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,880
And I'm like, okay, Peter
Gabriel and his giant band here,

167
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,380
this giant ass fucking band
with two drummers and shit is,

168
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,570
is going to fucking open and then stinks
going to come out and we get to see

169
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,570
Vinny, right? He finishes
the first fucking song,

170
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:04,470
he walks off stage and then
all of a sudden staying just
walks out and he's like,

171
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:09,180
what the fuck? Right? And he
starts playing the Afi Abba.

172
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,710
You right. You start singing that
song. And I'm like, wait a minute,

173
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,760
where the fuck's and I realized he's
been playing the whole fucking time.

174
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,320
He's just behind these,

175
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,530
this fight on what the fuck it
was somebody amps or some shit.

176
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,930
So I could see was like
the top of his head,

177
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,630
but there was like video
screens and stuff. So,

178
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:29,640
of course I was standing
on my tiptoes to watch it,

179
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:34,110
but what killed me about his
playing is, uh, you know,

180
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,950
every great musician has a voice, right?
I know this is like hacky to say that,

181
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,060
but that fucking guy,

182
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,040
the bell of his ride cymbal and when
he plays the cross stick on a snare,

183
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,540
it's just undeniably you're like,
that's fucking Vinnie call you.

184
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,130
And the fact that he was making that
noise that close to me and I was

185
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:54,450
immediately hearing it and just all
the Times that I've listened to, uh,

186
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,940
all the music that he's made
with staying in everybody else,

187
00:10:56,941 --> 00:10:59,970
the fact that they were actually
reproducing it live right there,

188
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,350
it was fucking nuts to me. You know, like
they're playing this, these songs for us,

189
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:07,980
this is fucking incredible,
right? So then the consequent,

190
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,290
and they just keep flip
flopping back and forth.

191
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,400
So stink finished his fucking song.
And then Peter Gabriel came back out,

192
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:15,750
but staying stayed

193
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:19,560
in fucking played bass on Peter's shit.

194
00:11:19,561 --> 00:11:22,740
And then they just kept going back and
forth. And occasionally Peter did too.

195
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:23,850
And then instinct to a couple,

196
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,180
occasionally sting would walk off and
Peter would do his thing and then vice

197
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:31,170
versa, whatever. And finally
in the middle of it, um,

198
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,280
well maybe towards the
beginning and I can't,

199
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,470
they talk to the crowd a couple times
and they basically said that they would

200
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:37,650
just,
that a,

201
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:40,650
they both had bands in there kind
of competing with each other's band.

202
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,670
And Peter Gabriel's band was the red
band and strings was the blue band.

203
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,130
And then I then I finally know
to sell one drum has got red,

204
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:50,850
the other Vinnie's playing on
blue drums. And I, you know,

205
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,800
the way he told the story,
they would just, you know,

206
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,110
having a battle of the bands and they were
like, why don't we fucking go on tour?

207
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,800
All I can say is it was
an incredible night.

208
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,300
They played like all the fucking hits.

209
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:05,590
Peter Gabriel played big time
sledgehammer, shocked a monkey,

210
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,260
a red rain, um, staying played, fucking,

211
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,450
uh, sending out and it's so as
bunch of shit off. 10 Summers tails,

212
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,150
uh, some shit off of soul
cages. It was some police stuff.

213
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:26,380
It was fucking amazing. It was
fucking amazing. And uh, you know,

214
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:27,670
definitely a bucket list night.

215
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,180
But of course I was in the
crowd and at the Hollywood bowl,

216
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,800
the either drink wine,
which just gives me a brutal hangover oil.

217
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,530
They had these giant fucking beers.
Um,

218
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,040
which I gotta be honest with just does
nothing to me. It's just this, it's like,

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,970
it's like somebody just handed a job here,
why don't you drink this?

220
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:48,250
I give fuck and I get,
I get really nothing out of it.

221
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,680
That's why I like whiskey, you know,
it gives you all right there Fred.

222
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,540
And it's just a couple of
swallows. Um, but anyways,

223
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,420
Jesus Christ, the level of
musicianship, the backup singers,

224
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:04,810
one in particular was just, they kept,
you know, given her solos and stuff,

225
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:09,580
she was incredible. Um, got
to watch sting played bass,

226
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,840
got to watch them up close.

227
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,390
And the weird way he kind of comes
from the side rather than might've.

228
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,880
Bass players are kind of have their hand
up top rest of their thumb on the low

229
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,060
eat or whatever the fuck that string is.
And he's,

230
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,130
he looks like he's coming at it
from the side like a fucking crap.

231
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,360
It was really interesting.
But uh, anyways,

232
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,410
it was like some of the best
musicians you ever going to see.

233
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:33,250
So that's what I did Monday.
And then Tuesday we came in,

234
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:36,580
we did the Polish up after
the table read of episode 10,

235
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:39,280
and we recorded episode 10,
and that's it.

236
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,900
Or fucking Billy red faces on
fucking a summer vacation here.

237
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,460
And I got a nice, um, I
don't know where I got,

238
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,470
I got about nine days before I go off to
the European tour and I'm going to work

239
00:13:52,911 --> 00:13:56,900
out like a madman still, you know, have
a couple, two, three drinks, whatever.

240
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:01,390
It work hard, play hard. What are you
gonna do? And I plan to have a nice,

241
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,660
um, I want to have a healthy
fucking tour over there. You know,

242
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,970
my wife isn't going on this run.

243
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:13,750
She's going to meet me over
there afterwards when take
a few days to hang out.

244
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,360
But uh, during the whole
run, it's a thrash.

245
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:18,100
It's like a different
city every fucking night.

246
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:21,280
So it's kind of boring and pointless.

247
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,970
You're really just saying to the
person who isn't doing shows like, Hey,

248
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:26,080
do you want to,
uh,

249
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,920
do you want to go over to Europe and
like pack and unpack every fucking day?

250
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:33,670
And they're like, yeah, no, I,
I don't in barely see anything.

251
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,740
That's what I'm offering you. So
what I want to do, the first side,

252
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,930
I'm working with Joe to Rosa in Dublin on
one of the shows. It's an earlier show,

253
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:47,140
which is odd to me, but whatever.
It's not my fucking deal. Right?

254
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,620
So that night's a wash. I mean,
we're going to get shit faced. Um,

255
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,810
then the next night I'm in Belfast
and I got to drive up and drive back.

256
00:14:56,811 --> 00:15:01,030
So that night I'll fucking take it easy.
I can hear all the Irish people bitch.

257
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:03,680
And I already asked that being
a pussy drink every night.

258
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:07,150
I can't do it cause I got to make sure
I have good shows and then I got Gallway

259
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,610
but a chill for that than London.
Chill for the first night.

260
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,080
Second night I'm going to maybe,
you know, knock a few back.

261
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,370
And then I go to Scotland,
I believe, and uh,

262
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,560
two nights stair I'll just fucking chill.
And then the third night, you know,

263
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,120
that's going to be hard because it's,
it's the whole fucking,

264
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,990
the festivals going on over there.
Somebody may mean a ton of comedians.

265
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,500
That might be a rough one. And in
Germany, I don't gotta worry about Shit.

266
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,170
Who's kidding? Who? I've got to go out
and have some beers that you, okay.

267
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:38,380
It's going to get a little rough once I
get around Scotland. Who's kidding who,

268
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,710
but, but the, the first half of it. Oh,
that first half I'm going to be healthy.

269
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,790
Um,
does the Amsterdam in there?

270
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,820
Okay.

271
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,960
All right. You know what? This whole
thing just went off the rails. Okay.

272
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:52,280
For the first few nights in Ireland,

273
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:54,820
I think it's got to be okay one night
in London. Other than that, yeah,

274
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,690
it might be a little rough,
but if I can eat well,

275
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,640
the problem is when you go over to Europe
though, there's just this, just fuck it.

276
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:05,150
There's no treadmills. They, these
people just don't work out. It's weird.

277
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,620
They're not like necessarily fat,
but they're not in shape,

278
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,920
be that they're just sort of people,
you know what I mean? Like, yeah,

279
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:17,530
those arms, you know? Yeah.
They're connected to your torso.

280
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,403
They got like,

281
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,220
like, I think ellipticals
are illegal in England.

282
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:26,510
I don't know what the fuck it is.

283
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,130
Everybody's so jammed in there and that
little island, um, I'm fucking with you.

284
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:32,210
Obviously they have gyms over there,

285
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:36,560
so I'm going to try to hit treadmills
and shit as much as I can. And, um,

286
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,820
I already know how I'm going to open
my set when I'm over there, you know?

287
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,530
Um, it's, it's gonna be, it's
gonna be a great fucking time.

288
00:16:46,531 --> 00:16:47,670
I can't wait to do it.

289
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:53,030
And I'm so site that we got the
first big chunk of work done on a,

290
00:16:54,661 --> 00:16:57,750
on f is for family. I feel I
can, could finally fucking, uh,

291
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,950
could finally fucking chill out a
and coming up this week, by the way,

292
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,200
next Monday night is the second,
uh,

293
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,730
the two year anniversary of
the goddamn comedy jam and a,

294
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,970
they're going to have it at the rock
seat down on sunset boulevard. And,

295
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,930
um, rumor has it that I'm,
I might be down there,

296
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:20,190
I've gotta be down there for that show.

297
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:25,050
It's next Monday night if
you're in the area and uh,

298
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,910
I'm going to be busting out the fucking,

299
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,660
I'm going to bust out the
fucking green sparkle Ludwig Kit.

300
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,600
I'm going to bring it down there for that.
And I bought it two years ago.

301
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:38,520
I've never played it. I got this
71 Ludwig, it's fucking gorgeous.

302
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,720
And right as I got it,
I had it all set up and everything we got,

303
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,670
we had the water damage on the house.

304
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,530
Fortunately thank Christ it didn't come
down in the room with the drums were so

305
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:52,650
immediately went out and I got drunk
cases and I put the fucking things away.

306
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,450
And then, um, you know,

307
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,120
that was a year getting the house
fixed and they stayed in cases.

308
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,650
And then the next year my truck,
shit,

309
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:04,010
the bed I had to get the engine rebuilt
because it was going to do is put them

310
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:07,220
in the cases and take them
over to rehearsal space. I
was never able to do that.

311
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,900
And, uh, then my truck was better. And
then I started writing on f is for family.

312
00:18:11,901 --> 00:18:16,190
So and just like that fucking two
years goes by. So I busted them out.

313
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,230
71 Ludwig Kit, I got the fucking Pisces
symbols, that whole bottom set up,

314
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:27,120
the 15 inch high hat, the 24 inch
ride, complete fucking overkill.

315
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:28,200
And I'm going to play a couple songs.

316
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:31,590
I actually sat down and played drums
today for the first time since like March,

317
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,690
I played like a drum kit,
you know,

318
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:36,240
other than a cup that I think I took
two lessons. But that's, you know,

319
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,180
different than sitting down and playing.
And I'll tell you right now,

320
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:43,610
I fucking sign, oh Jesus, I'm sorry.

321
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,460
Just blew out the uh, you're saying, oh my
God, that was fucking terrible. Terrible.

322
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,060
I better get my shit together by Monday
night or I'm just going to look like a

323
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,750
dose with a really nice kid
who can't fucking play. Um,

324
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,760
but I'm really looking forward to
doing that. And now let me do a little,

325
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,040
let me still read here.

326
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,630

345
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,220
ziprecruiter.com/ [inaudible] all
right. There you go. Sorry about that.

346
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:34,390
I fucking thought I had the levels down.
I guess when you scream zip recruiter,

347
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:39,190
it's bound to go off the
rails after awhile. Um,

348
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,250
all right. So what else did I
want to talk about? Anything. Um,

349
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,570
somebody said that the New York Times
did this article and for the love of God,

350
00:20:46,571 --> 00:20:48,010
I can't,
it they did it.

351
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:53,070
And talking about the legalization of pot
and was saying in states where weed is

352
00:20:54,111 --> 00:20:56,220
become illegal, that, uh,

353
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,520
prescriptions have gone down drastically,
obviously for pain,

354
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,280
anxiety and all of that other stuff.

355
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,660
And it's really starting to become the
wonder drug man that all the hippies

356
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:11,710
always said. And I always
fucking was like, no, booze
is legal, blah, blah, blah.

357
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,730
And now it's really looking at like,
booze does way more fucking damaged. Oh,

358
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:20,620
but it's so delicious. Does way
more damage than we does. So,

359
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,660
according to this New York Times article,

360
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,010
according to this person who said it
was in New York Times article, um,

361
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
that the pharmaceutical lobbyists are
now going after legalized marijuana in

362
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:37,510
every state and that they're going to try
and start trying to fucking, you know,

363
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:41,080
basically go, oh my God, it's the
devil and Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

364
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:45,640
and get people to stop using it and
have all this shit about side effects.

365
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:49,840
But they start showing commercials and
all that. But I got to tell you, um,

366
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,220
the fact that this is the prop,
well maybe they won't.

367
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,680
I was gonna say the problem that they're
going to have is now that the cat's out

368
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:00,960
of the bag,
okay.

369
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,830
In these states are making
so much money in tax revenue,

370
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,160
right? Like this, this whole
thing going on in Denver,

371
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,580
because it's legal at a state level,
but not at a federal level.

372
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,360
You don't pay federal income tax. I don't
know. It's this weird fucking thing.

373
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:19,230
So nobody knows. Oh, I know
banks won't accept the money,

374
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,010
you know,
cause the banks,

375
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,480
federal banks or whatever can't accept
the money or whatever. So what these,

376
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,290
these people who grow the wheat are doing,
they're just buying up land.

377
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:33,350
So in Colorado, from what I
earned, once again, I never read,

378
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,980
I listened to people and
whatever they say to me,

379
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,980
I just considered it as as a fact,
right?

380
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:43,310
It's so much easier than doing research.
And you know what's great about it?

381
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,660
If you fuck up, it makes other
people feel smart, you know?

382
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,520
Nothing, nothing. Structure Ego
like correcting another human being.

383
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,630
That's a human being. That thing
can speak. It can drive a car.

384
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,960
Maybe you can fly a plane to be right.
I mean,

385
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,090
anybody can be right when there's a dog,

386
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,500
you know there's a fucking dog in the
room that doesn't do anything for you,

387
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,500
you know? But if it's another
fucking person, right,

388
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,900
who's got a thumb and shit
and can like hold a hammer,

389
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,790
if you fucking rad that just,
it's the greatest. I actually, ah,

390
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,600
that was,
it was actually 1897 yes.

391
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,060
1890 set Spanish American war.

392
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,780
Anytime you get to do that and then you
get to watch them be all fucking mad.

393
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,730
Like when I was talking about George Bush,

394
00:23:28,731 --> 00:23:32,090
I thought everybody was making fun of
him because he did. He didn't dance well,

395
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:36,050
I didn't realize it was some
memorial service for, you know,

396
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,430
fallen officers or, or, uh, uh, an
officer in particular. I didn't, I didn't,

397
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:43,670
I didn't look, I just watched the
fucking video. Oh. And it just rolled in,

398
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,670
you know, everybody, oh, let's, let's,

399
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,700
let's fucking correct old Billy red beard.
You know,

400
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,830
everybody had a great fucking time doing
that. Um, but I'm off the rails here.

401
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,720
Okay. I still have to say, you know, you
know, as much as that was inappropriate,

402
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:03,350
which it was completely inappropriate,
obviously it was fun to see him, you know,

403
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,140
it was fun to see that he's
enjoying his retirement.

404
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:08,270
It's like when you see Letterman,
he let the beer go out.

405
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:11,030
He got rid of the fucking two
pages and it doesn't give a shit.

406
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,520
And when you looking at him, a lot
of people were saying, you know,

407
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:17,450
maybe George was a little drunk.
And, uh, you know what good for him,

408
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,260
good for that fucking guy
because that fucking guy,

409
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,240
he held it together for
eight goddamn years. Ya Know,

410
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,030
granted he gave a speech,
the way I read advertising,

411
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,860
granted we went and into Iraq because
there was weapons of mass destruction and

412
00:24:33,861 --> 00:24:37,610
we never fucking found Eddie.
I love how that fucking story goes away,

413
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,920
but if you make fun of
fat people as a comedian,

414
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:43,190
all of a sudden you get in trouble. And
was like, what about this fucking guy?

415
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,010
This guy was playing fucking patty cake,

416
00:24:46,011 --> 00:24:50,330
Patty cake bakers man at a
fucking funeral. Good Lord.

417
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,200
That guy is like, he's like, when
you talk about failing upwards,

418
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,670
I think, you know something.
There's something about that guy.

419
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:01,520
He's just smart enough to
know that he's not qualified.

420
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:03,170
And I think that that's why he drinks.

421
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,080
I think that's why it's to shit
that fucking vibe. He just, he,

422
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:11,300
he's kind of like Rodney, like he does
everything but tugs on his collar.

423
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:16,160
Like it'll tell you it's a rough
one, you know? Um, I dunno,

424
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,880
we'll see. We'll see what
the fuck happens. But what,
what was I talking about?

425
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,460
Oh yeah. In New York Times
they were saying that, yeah.

426
00:25:22,461 --> 00:25:24,740
That these pharmaceutical
lobbyists, you know, we're,

427
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,490
we're going to be trying to fight
back to win back some of their money,

428
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,690
capitalistic society here. Right? What
do you do? Somebody's taken into year,

429
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:36,710
you're cutting into your territory. What
do you do? Yeah. You go on the offensive,

430
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,270
you start making up shit about him. You
lie, you know, that's what you do. So,

431
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:42,643
um,

432
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,270
I was going to say now that the cat
is out of the bag legally with weed,

433
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,120
um, and I think it's going to be
really hard. I was going to say,

434
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:57,740
because not only is it appearing to have
all these positive effects medically

435
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,390
according to stuff that people said
to me that they sit allegedly said

436
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:06,350
scientists did.
Um,

437
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:09,830
it also makes you feel good. That's
a rough one. You know what I mean?

438
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,080
Whereas all that other shit,

439
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:16,340
a lot of the pharmaceutical stuff
just sort of like numbs the pain,

440
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,540
all of that stuff.

441
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,970
And then you all of a sudden you get
onto the harder drugs and all that.

442
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,570
It's really fucking evil. You
know, I got a friend of mine,

443
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,710
she had problems with there. She couldn't
something going on with the shoulders.

444
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,820
She couldn't pick a fucking
arms up past the shoulder.

445
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,090
I refer to this same as suits that I
went to and she immediately was getting

446
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:37,850
results and she, she
was, according to her,

447
00:26:37,851 --> 00:26:40,850
was stuck going to these
fucking doctors. I'm, look,

448
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:45,540
I'm not totally shitting on doctors
and stuff like that, but, uh,

449
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,371
I don't know.

450
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:51,660
It would be nice if the mainstream medical
would kind of let these other people

451
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:56,440
come in. You know what I mean?
It's just that I think the,

452
00:26:56,441 --> 00:27:01,441
the people outside people outside of the
mainstream medical basically hospitals

453
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:04,320
and shit, I didn't know what mainstream
medical means. It just sounds right to me.

454
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:08,280
Right? Oh Jesus. I am so out of my fucking
element. You know what? It feels good.

455
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,870
I feel like I could start swinging
my arms at a funeral right now. Um,

456
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,270
when you get outside of hospitals
and stuff, you could actually,

457
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,550
most people you'll find don't
know what the fuck they're doing.

458
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:24,720
But if you find that gem that's outside
of the fucking studio system, basically,

459
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,910
they actually can cure, you know,
where a lot of this other shit is.

460
00:27:29,911 --> 00:27:33,630
Just treating it and treating it and
treating it and treating it until you then

461
00:27:33,631 --> 00:27:36,630
get symptoms for something else and
then treat that, treat that, treat that.

462
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:41,190
You know, I dunno. It's, it's
a fucking shady think and uh,

463
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:45,020
it's a big fucking problem and it
requires a lot of reading and research.

464
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,350
And I have to be honest with you,

465
00:27:46,351 --> 00:27:49,530
I did none of that before I started
talking about seven minutes ago.

466
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,420
So there's that subject.
What are we up to here? 27,

467
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:56,640
almost 28 minutes.
Um,

468
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,920
this is all drum nerd shit, but I saw
Steve Smith is playing with journey again.

469
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:04,650
I'm going to have to go fucking see that.
You know,

470
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,660
I've never seen him when he
played with vital information.

471
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:10,800
I've never seen that guy play life, got
all this fucking DVDs and all that shit.

472
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:14,970
There's another one I got to check off
the fucking bucket list. But uh, um, if,

473
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,170
if that, that sting Peter Gabriel
tour is coming to your, uh,

474
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,340
neck of the woods, do not sleep on
it. Like I've never seen like staying,

475
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:27,690
having so much fucking fun and I've
never realized how like goofy and silly

476
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:31,280
Peter Gabriel was. He's got all
these sychronized dances and shit.

477
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,340
It's fucking hilarious.

478
00:28:32,341 --> 00:28:37,341
And he's funny as hell and like sting
was just like really just taken a back

479
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,040
seat when letting Peter Schein
and all of that all, you know,

480
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:44,280
all that fucking drama that you
always heard in that band. The police,

481
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:47,310
it was great seeing sting just fucking,
I mean granted the guy still,

482
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,650
he looks better than he looked
when he was in the police.

483
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:51,840
It's fucking ridiculous.

484
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,490
Jesus Christ clean living
and fucking yoga and,

485
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,300
and whatever the fuck he does that
tantric where you come for like fucking 50

486
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:04,320
minutes, whatever that
shit is. It's unbelievable.

487
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:09,240
I mean the guy looks better than
he did fucking 30 years ago.

488
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,090
His hair somehow grew back.
I don't know.

489
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:13,860
I don't know what the
fuck this guy is doing.

490
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,880
He looks like it's a combination
of like a teen idol and he,

491
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:23,280
he's in like Mad Max all at the same time.
He never kind of would like,

492
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:25,080
as far as like his wardrobe though,

493
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:29,700
I will say that guy is never
sort of advanced past, um,

494
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,650
uh, that synchronicity tour, you know?

495
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,300
And when he yells, he always has to
put an o at the end of it. You know,

496
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:43,660
when he did Roxanne and then when he had
wanted to do a call and response with

497
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:46,900
the Cra, what the crowd
is going rock said, oh,

498
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,610
like where do they all come
from? He loves the, Oh,

499
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,650
I bet he does that. His castle, you
know, his wife yells up, you know,

500
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,400
up the fucking goddamn stone stairways,

501
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,380
what do you want for lunch? Lunch, lunch.

502
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,470
And he's up there has said which show?

503
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,380
It's fucking driving her nuts. Fuck does
he put, oh, at the end of everything,

504
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:17,610
just fucking say sandwich. All
right, you fucking cunt. What?

505
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:20,270
You get knighted and all of a sudden you
can put an o at the end of everything.

506
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:24,570
I don't know. Anyways, what am I doing
here? It was a fucking great show. Um,

507
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,780
all right, so I still have to go to
work tomorrow. Now we do the animatics,

508
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,730
I'll take you through the whole process.

509
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:32,670
Everybody over the next year as we wait
for this fucking thing that come out.

510
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,680
So once you write the thing, and once
you record it before the animated,

511
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:41,610
they have these things called animatics,
which is just rough sketches.

512
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:47,010
Okay. Of the scenes, the way that they're
going to drop, draw. Like, you know,

513
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,510
they look at the script and says,
you know,

514
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:50,580
frank walks into the house so
they know it's in the house,

515
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:53,850
but there's a lot of other stuff that
is sort of variables about where people

516
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,140
are standing and where they're sitting,

517
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:58,740
how they're eyes are moving and
all of that shit. And it's that,

518
00:30:58,741 --> 00:31:01,230
this is where it gets a
little bit tedious. But, uh,

519
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,390
it was much harder the first season,
the second season.

520
00:31:03,391 --> 00:31:05,670
Now everybody kinda knows how
everybody creates and shit.

521
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,950
So we go in now and we'll look at the
animatic for like the second first or

522
00:31:10,951 --> 00:31:14,820
second episode. And you just look at, you
know, is the scenes go and you'd be like,

523
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:15,121
all right,

524
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:20,121
frank needs to be standing up here or
sue needs to be doing this or whatever.

525
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,430
And um,
I have to be honest with you,

526
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,900
I am decent at arm gestures,
but I'm really bad at the directing shit.

527
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,340
Like this should be a two shot that
should be a master and all that. Um,

528
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,290
not only make bad at it,
I have no desire to get good at it.

529
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,700
So that's a tough thing.

530
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,730
Like I don't give a shit that is that
there's nothing more boring to me then

531
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,740
that just sitting there going like,

532
00:31:43,741 --> 00:31:46,440
this should be over this guy's
shoulder and this should be a two shot.

533
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,240
Can we Dolly in? Can we get
a fucking whatever the fuck
they say. And I just said,

534
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:54,570
I just glaze over.
It reminds me of when,

535
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,690
for whatever stupid fucking reason,

536
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,040
my junior year of high school,
like

537
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:08,630
I took Algebra two and
fucking trigonometry and it
was just like I fucking had

538
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:13,860
to go to summer school after Algebra.
I barely got out of that shit.

539
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:18,870
I got a fucking d minus in geometry
just because my teacher was cool.

540
00:32:18,871 --> 00:32:20,940
I flunked it.
She gave me the d minus,

541
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:27,120
so I didn't have back to back going
to summer school and did this.

542
00:32:27,121 --> 00:32:30,570
I mean I was lost by, I was done. I
was done three weeks into September,

543
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,370
Algebra two and trig was fucking over
and I ended up in fucking motherfucking

544
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,200
summer school again.

545
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,450
I swear to if my geometry teacher
didn't hook me up with a d minus,

546
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,440
I have had like a dynasty. I would have
three years in a row, a summer school,

547
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,620
fucking dope. Um, I dunno,

548
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,730
I'll tell you this right now.
This is how dumb I am is,

549
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:55,040
I can't even remember why I
even just fucking told you that.

550
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,830
What the hell was I talking about? I
just sat up in my whole memory, went,

551
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,550
what the fuck out of
his? Say what? Yo. Right.

552
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,390
Then I started talking about some, I
don't, I don't, I don't remember. Um,

553
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,130
but you know what the great thing is is
I don't have to remember anything else

554
00:33:09,131 --> 00:33:11,680
who gives a shit because this is,
this is the a,

555
00:33:11,681 --> 00:33:13,210
this is just me checking in on you.

556
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,680
Just peeking into your cubicle or maybe
you got an office. You've got a door. Huh?

557
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,610
You feel good about yourself. You
liked that door. You put stuff on it.

558
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:25,540
Do you close it and say,
no calls makes you feel good.

559
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:29,260
Then you close the door and you snicker
to yourself. Like I just said, no calls.

560
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,220
I'm the no calls guy.
Hold my calls.

561
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,820
Um, anyways. All right, that's
it. That's, that's a podcast. Uh,

562
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:43,250
please go see Peter Gabriel and sting on
tour and the amazing Vinny Coley, Yoda,

563
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,190
and everybody else in both of those bands.
Uh,

564
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:48,970
I should have known more than
names. I should have looked
it up, but, uh, you know,

565
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:52,210
I'm running around like a fucking
loan to tick. Um, and that's it.

566
00:33:52,211 --> 00:33:55,180
If anybody can find that New York Times
article, I would really love to read it.

567
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,800
And um,

568
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,850
I'm also going to try to read up on all
that whole fucking European Union thing

569
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,350
for when I go over there just in
case anybody's a cut to me, uh,

570
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,300
about not knowing what the fuck's going
on in the world, which, which I don't. Um,

571
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:15,400
I do know that there was some sort of
fucking failed coup attempt in Turkey.

572
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,730
Jesus Christ. The only thing scarier
than trying to overthrow the,

573
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,230
the government is attempting
it and then failing.

574
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:30,070
This is one of the scariest
couple of paragraphs I ever read.

575
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:32,950
Turkish President Tay.
Yup.

576
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,660
T double why p Ertegun tapered again,

577
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:44,140
I'm declared a state of
emergency on Wednesday is he
widened a crackdown against

578
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:48,620
thousands of members of the
security forces judiciary to you,

579
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,693
you're airy,

580
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,520
civil service and academia
after a failed military coup.

581
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:58,950
All right, here's where it gets
scary. Erdogan, how you said,

582
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,790
said the state of emergency lasting three
months would allow his government to

583
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:08,791
take swift and decisive measures against
supporters of the COO and was allowed

584
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:12,910
under the constitution.
Yeah.

585
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,880
They're about to kill a
couple thousand motherfuckers.

586
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,550
Jesus.

587
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:24,820
That right there is that definition
and Odot, Jesus in the old right there,

588
00:35:24,821 --> 00:35:28,480
Fred, right? There's no
code lotion in there.

589
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,943
MMM.

590
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,120
You're not cold. Lotion is, is
is your final meal on death row.

591
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,120
Yeah, man. We'll make you whatever you
want. Uh, you guys are sweet art. Yeah.

592
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:46,680
And then we're going to electrocute
you. Ah, Jesus. Then. All right. Um,

593
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,410
that's the podcast. Just checking in
on you. I'll see you guys again on, uh,

594
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,680
talk to you again on Monday.
And uh, um, that's it.

595
00:35:55,681 --> 00:35:58,560
Thank you to everybody who helped
fix my fucking back. I feel great.

596
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,660
I'm in a great mood.
Please enjoy this music.

597
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,960
And then we got 30 minutes
of some throwback podcasts.

598
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,690
Greatest hits from a podcast in a year.

599
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,333
All right,
see

600
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,073
you.

601
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,033
[inaudible] [inaudible]

602
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,110
so I got that out of the way.

603
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:20,680
Then I had two days to hang in New York
and then I came down in New Jersey and

604
00:37:20,681 --> 00:37:24,220
I'm like, this is going to be great.
I got the pressure Letterman off me.

605
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:29,770
That's off my fucking back.
And, uh, now what? Now.

606
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:33,880
What do I do? I get to go to one of
my favorite clubs in the country,

607
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,610
the stress factory I was already talking
to while Vinnie brand, the club owner,

608
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,510
he's got a boat. We were going
to go out on his boat on Sunday.

609
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,330
Everything was going to be great.
All the shows were fucking sold up.

610
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,050
Had a great time.
And then what happens?

611
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,600
These fucking nerds on the
weather channel. What do they do?

612
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:58,600
They turn out all the lights in this
studio and they put a flashlight under

613
00:37:58,601 --> 00:37:59,434
their Chin

614
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:07,410
and just start scaring the living shit
out of people and you know what kills me

615
00:38:08,171 --> 00:38:12,610
is every fucking time people buy into it.

616
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,790
I was joking about it all weekend.
I'm like, nothing's going to happen.

617
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:21,160
I'm in my whole tell them I don't
even have a fucking snickers bar.

618
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,040
Nothing's going to happen.
You're going to be fine.

619
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,940
All these people going out
gathering up fucking food for what

620
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,270
people do. You realize how long you can
go without food. Food is no big deal.

621
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:39,210
You need water. That's what the
fuck you need. That's what you need.

622
00:38:39,211 --> 00:38:42,720
I'm actually looking here on a,
who gives a fuck.com?

623
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,520
How long can a person survive
without food and water? Uh,

624
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,080
basically it depends on a number
of factors such as body weight,

625
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,520
genetic variations, other
health considerations, whether
you're a fat fuck or not.

626
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,930
Uh, most importantly the presence
or absence of dehydration.

627
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,480
As long as you got water people,

628
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,370
you can basically go 46
to about 73 days without,

629
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:09,204
without food.

630
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,220
Then that was based on a 10 individuals
who died on a hunger strike and they all

631
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:18,450
died between 46 days and 73 days.
As long as they drank water.

632
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,630
If you don't have water,
I believe you dead in about three days.

633
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,470
All right,
so enough with the fucking milk and eggs.

634
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,220
Yeah,

635
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,840
Ali soccer moms now for the next fucking
three weeks. Who wants, who wants cereal?

636
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,770
Who wants to wait?

637
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,530
What you have in theory all and you're
having an Omelette isn't going to go to

638
00:39:35,531 --> 00:39:36,364
waste.

639
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,770
He's fucking people telling you to fill
up your goddamn bathtub full of full of

640
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:47,660
full of water just in case

641
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,240
Jesus fucking Christ. I'd rather
die than drink out of my bath tub.

642
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,500
All right.
I wash my fucking dog in there.

643
00:39:59,380 --> 00:39:59,770
Yeah.

644
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,840
Not Drinking out of that thing.
What?

645
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:04,480
Can I just stick my head out the
window and drink the raindrops?

646
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,000
I think those windows be cleaner.

647
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,110
Okay.

648
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,710
Then the God damn tub that I watched
my dog in and then hit with chemicals,

649
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,430
love stomach cancer.
By the time to fucking rescue boat comes,

650
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,070
you just get water.
Everybody get water.

651
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:26,260
Get yourself a couple of fucking zag
nut bars and they'd go down, go down,

652
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,730
go down to a Goddamn fucking
seven 11 and go buy an $8 Poncho.

653
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,080
You find you're in a house.
You find

654
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:42,360
he's fucking people. Whether Chino much
they cost me half my God damn gig money.

655
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:43,510
Yeah.

656
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,180
We could've had shows.
We could add show Saturday night.

657
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,260
It was raining hard Saturday night.
It could have done both shows.

658
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,030
Everybody could have
got their fucking labs.

659
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:57,050
Everybody goes home and then
at night [inaudible] Boegli

660
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,750
the fucking hurricane or hurricanes
come through the northeast. It's like,

661
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,060
it's like an old price fighter.
By the time it comes to us,

662
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:12,290
it's all fucking punch drunk and people
have no business standing out in it

663
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,030
cause they should've gotten knocked out,

664
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:17,150
have no fucking problem than they just
sit there laughing at it. All right.

665
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,560
Yeah.

666
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,980
That's what it is. That's what a
hurricane is in the northeast. It,

667
00:41:21,981 --> 00:41:24,770
you know when it's down south,
it's Cassius clay.

668
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,500
Right before he becomes Muhammad Ali.

669
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:30,950
By the time it gets up to Jersey
in New York, it's fucking Ali.

670
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:35,900
When he fought Larry
Holmes every fucking time.

671
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,940
Yet these people,
they all run out

672
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,780
the weather channel.
How long you guys,

673
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:45,380
you guys think Fox News
lies to you or CNN?

674
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:48,220
Depending on what side of the
political fence you're on. You want it.

675
00:41:48,221 --> 00:41:50,540
You want to see some lies
put on the weather channel.

676
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,740
Anytime there's a storm
scaring the shit out of you.

677
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:58,430
Every time there's going to be,
it's going to be four to six Sanchez.

678
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,520
Holy Shit.
That's almost up to my calves.

679
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,940
How will I ever get to where the food is?

680
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,520
46 inches.
Jesus Christ.

681
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,413
Yeah.

682
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,340
Who are they talking to?
80 year olds.

683
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:15,620
Okay.

684
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:20,370
Even then, you know, 80 year old
people, they'll be fine. You are.

685
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,040
They're already wearing a sweater.

686
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:24,620
Okay.

687
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,450
They're dressed for a blizzard year round.

688
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,930
Does anybody you work
for the weather channel?

689
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,880
Does anybody who listened to my
podcast? Can you please tell me? Well,

690
00:42:34,881 --> 00:42:39,190
who's behind you? I think the
supermarkets are behind that, right?

691
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,110
Ralph's Shaws,
Gelson's fucking whole foods.

692
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:49,610
All of them. That's their payola. You
know with the big time corporations,

693
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,260
they wait for the political elections.

694
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:54,650
That's when they start throwing their
money around and start calling up a truck

695
00:42:54,651 --> 00:42:58,970
full of hookers to go blow some
Bible belt and Douche bag, right?

696
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:04,790
I'm married. I got five kids. I love my
wife and I love Jesus. Support the troops,

697
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:08,780
right? And then what do they
do? They throw a big pile
of money at them. Have two,

698
00:43:08,781 --> 00:43:12,080
three whores dropped to their knees
and next what? Next? What happens next?

699
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:16,400
He comes on his blue blazer.
That's what happens.

700
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:20,900
Everybody goes all over his red tie
and then he goes out. Jesus Christ.

701
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,470
All right, you got me, you
own me. You got video of it.

702
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:25,940
Just tell me what you want me to do.

703
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:30,080
I will pass any bill you want
me to pass for the love of God.

704
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:31,250
Don't let my wife see that.

705
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:33,590
Yeah.

706
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,290
That's basically how that
works. Well though, let's,
let's stay on track here. Okay.

707
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:39,170
The fucking weather. She, does
anybody listen to my podcast work?

708
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,220
Did they ever work?

709
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,110
Can you give me any sort of anonymous
behind the fucking scenes over there? Why?

710
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:46,640
Every time it's just going to rain.

711
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,023
Okay.

712
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:51,570
Do they scare the living shit out of us?
Why is that?

713
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:54,403
You know,

714
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,530
how often are they right?
It always is.

715
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,940
It's always downgraded to a tropical
storm. By the time it comes here,

716
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,320
someone was telling me the entire
east coast, the way it's shaped,

717
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,510
that's from years of hurricanes comes
riding into Florida and Georgia,

718
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:16,511
South Carolina gives it a nice fucking
uppercut to their southern balls and then

719
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:21,320
slows the fuck down right
over the Carolina, Virginia.

720
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:24,530
Yep.
Then what?

721
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,740
Trimet hits DC. Barack Obama's out on
the porch drying off his nuts with those.

722
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:33,180
Nice. When that Nice
Hurricane Wind, right?

723
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,090
Oh Jesus. I don't know what I'm talking
about. I just want to fucking go home.

724
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,400
I was actually thinking, you know, when
you, you know, when you fuck up in life,

725
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,680
feel like God, if I could just go back
48 hours, Howard do this differently.

726
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:51,230
There's an Avis in the lab of my,
uh,

727
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,890
uh, Jesus as a callback. Remember
this time we left this comedian,

728
00:44:54,891 --> 00:44:57,950
he was always late.
We had a car service to the airport.

729
00:44:57,951 --> 00:45:00,230
We were so sick of waiting for and
we were going to miss our flight.

730
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,450
We just took off with that
and we said fuck them.

731
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:07,070
And we got halfway to the airport and he
calls up all pissed off. It's like, Yo,

732
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:11,210
where the fuck boy you put a fuck. Why
you like dude, we waited for 20 minutes.

733
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,370
You didn't show up. And
he's like, I was in the

734
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,543
yeah.

735
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,890
And that became the catch
phrase for the rest of the tour.

736
00:45:21,891 --> 00:45:26,600
I was in the lobby anytime you fucked up
and people will call it calling you on

737
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:30,930
some shit. You went over your time. No I
didn't. Yes you did. I was in the lobby.

738
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,290
Oh. And it made us laugh. I
don't know if it made you laugh.

739
00:45:36,291 --> 00:45:40,040
I don't give a shit what he
expected from me. I'm, I'm stranded.

740
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,580
I feel like I'm being held hostage in
my captures. Forgot about me, you know,

741
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,690
or maybe it was just all a practical joke.
I have no idea.

742
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,040
Yeah.

743
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,450
So whatever.
Here I sit.

744
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,010
Yeah.

745
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,490
You know, is there anything sadder than
a stranded comedian with no shows to do?

746
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,550
Yeah.

747
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,220
They got a 24 hour gym downstairs.
I haven't used it.

748
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:06,050
Yeah.

749
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,210
Um, but talking to you guys about all
the way to eat, the way to lose weight.

750
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:11,850
I haven't been doing it dummy pizzas.

751
00:46:11,851 --> 00:46:14,610
I had fish and chips today
at fucking to hamburgers.

752
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,900
This is all during the hurricane.

753
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:21,890
Big Bad hurricane Irene
fucking over rated.

754
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,873
Ugh.

755
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,680
So I'm sitting here, I realized,
you know, tomorrow I'm like,

756
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:31,800
finally I'm getting the fuck out of
here. Go home. Could see my girl,

757
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,110
I can see my dog,
right?

758
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:36,130
Yeah.

759
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:39,760
Can have a good fucking time,
you know,

760
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,090
can cruise around in my hybrid.

761
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,170
That's what I was looking
forward to doing. And, uh,

762
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:52,750
all of a sudden I realized that
was stranded here. So what do I do?

763
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,610
Do I handle it like a man? What do
I start cursing like a little bitch?

764
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,020
You know what the answer is? So once I'm
done having my fucking temper Tantrum,

765
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:07,550
excuse me, I a sufficient
chips. I say, all right,

766
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:11,420
I'm going to rent a fucking
rent a movie here in the hotel.

767
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,710
So I go to rent a movie.

768
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:19,470
It's called catching hell to documentary
about the guy with the glasses who was

769
00:47:19,811 --> 00:47:22,570
at the cubs game, who, uh,

770
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,600
reached up for that foul ball that Moisis
I Lou was allegedly going to catch.

771
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:33,400
So I hit the info to watch the
trailer and they're talking about,

772
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:34,450
they got this guy on,

773
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,330
they're gone and says how you
worked for sports illustrated?

774
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,230
And his assignment was defined,
this guy,

775
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,970
whatever the fuck his name was, Steve, Ms
Arac, I don't know. I'm not from Chicago,

776
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:49,900
so I don't give a shit. I don't know what
his name is. Alright, his is, he goes,

777
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:54,730
my assignment was to find this guy
and he goes, my heart sank. You know,

778
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,440
because I actually felt for this guy,

779
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,680
I didn't want to go see him and
I said to my editor, editor,

780
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:02,310
why can't we just leave this guy alone?
Can we just leave the guy alone?

781
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,760
And he goes, no, go find them.

782
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,880
And then they shot showing
the highlights of this dude.

783
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,650
And for those of you don't know the play,

784
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,390
basically the cubs have won the
world series since 1908. You know,

785
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:17,050
they're a game away from going there.

786
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:21,100
Five outs away from going to the fucking
world series. Sorry to all the cub fans.

787
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,790
Just hit fucking mute for
the next 10 minutes. Um,

788
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,460
yeah,

789
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,490
they got the five outs
away. So some dude, right?

790
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,850
A lefthanded batter hits a slicing
foul down the left field line.

791
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,820
It's right there.
And uh,

792
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:42,060
the cubs left field or Moises Alou, he's
got a chance to make a play and all the,

793
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,860
all these fans reach up to
grab the ball. But the, the,

794
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:49,930
it just hits one guy and a Moises Alou
flips out cause he doesn't catch it and

795
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:54,480
he sort of yells towards the fans. Like,
what the fuck? I could have caught that.

796
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,120
And then after that the
wheels start falling off,

797
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,890
but they got a double play ball.

798
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,270
Gonzales could have made it buddy boated
it and first and then they let up eight

799
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:04,080
runs,

800
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,860
they lose the game and then they lose
games seven and then everybody wants to

801
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,710
murder this fucking kid.
So this guy is basically sold that.

802
00:49:10,711 --> 00:49:13,590
They're going to basically interview
the guys as far as I could fucking tell.

803
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:17,460
Am I Jesus Christ? That's fascinating.
I won't let me watch this. God,

804
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,840
God knows that got the time.
Let me watch this movie.

805
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,250
All right. So I go to order
it and it doesn't allow me to,

806
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:29,580
so I got to call downstairs
to have the uh, you know,

807
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,240
I don't know what somebody had kids or
something. He didn't want to run a porno,

808
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,890
so had to get that,
you know,

809
00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:37,770
switched over so I could actually
be an adult and pick out a movie.

810
00:49:37,771 --> 00:49:41,790
So I watched this fucking thing.
All right. About the cubs,

811
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,090
about their history,
about their curse,

812
00:49:45,091 --> 00:49:49,170
about this poor bastard that
got used as the scapegoat.

813
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,280
This is what I was sold. This is
the bill of goods. I was sold.

814
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:58,830
Okay. After 36 hours of being lied
to by the fucking weather channel,

815
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,700
I want some truth in my life. This is what
you're telling me. This thing is about,

816
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,310
this is how your advertising
and I want to see it.

817
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,100
Do you know what the first
15 minutes of that movie was?

818
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:13,970
It was taking me through the red sox
in 1986 as they excrutiatingly slowly

819
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:21,950
replayed the bill Buckner incident
and I'm sitting there watching it.

820
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:24,210
All of a sudden I'm looking
at bill Buckner. I'm like,

821
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:27,500
what did I order the wrong fucking thing?
I don't want to see this shit.

822
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,440
Do you understand? This is like my
baseball nine 11 I don't ever want,

823
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,540
you know that like the 10 year anniversary
of nine 11 is coming up and like they

824
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,980
, I don't want to watch any of that. I
don't ever want to see that footage again.

825
00:50:39,981 --> 00:50:44,210
Like how the fuck could you ever forget
it? It's absolutely fucking horrific.

826
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,380
Horrific.
I don't want to see it.

827
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,820
I don't need to see it to remember it.
I'll never forget. It's our Pearl Harbor.

828
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:58,630
My grandmother still doesn't like
Japanese people because of Pearl Harbor.

829
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,740
Okay.
If she can remember that shit,

830
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,650
I don't think I've got a problem members
something 10 fucking years ago. Okay.

831
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:07,430
So now, anyways, total
total fucking tangent there.

832
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,290
So I'm watching this thing and for the
first 20 just to warn red sox fucking

833
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,640
fans,

834
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,640
the first fucking 50 minutes of this
movie is the bill Buckner thing.

835
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:21,830
The thing that we left behind.

836
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:26,570
It's so funny because Paul Versey just
texted me then the night before during

837
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:29,120
the hurricane,
typical fucking Yankee Fan.

838
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,580
Typical Yankee Fan living in
the past, right? He texted me,

839
00:51:34,581 --> 00:51:37,910
he goes, hey bill, what was, what
was worse for a Red Sox Fan? He goes,

840
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:41,720
Buckner or Aaron Boone
just out of nowhere.

841
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,440
We weren't even talking baseball.
And I was just like,

842
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,040
I was like neither do to that.
It's like,

843
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,460
I don't even think about that shit
anymore to be honest with you.

844
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:57,200
And then he gets mad at me. A typical red
sox fan, terrible fucking answer. Blah,

845
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,510
blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like, I
don't know what he wanted out of me.

846
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,670
So I just texted him
back. It's like, dude,

847
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:05,930
I haven't thought about that shit since
2004 it's over. You know what it is.

848
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:10,700
It's Yankee fans used to be able to bully
red sox fans about that shit because

849
00:52:10,701 --> 00:52:15,120
we hadn't won one forever, you know?
So they just, I think that they,

850
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:16,310
they miss,

851
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:20,570
they're kind of like our big brother who
just beat the shit out of us forever.

852
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:24,770
And then one day we were the same height
and kick the shit out of him, you know?

853
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:30,880
And then they just stay. It was
over. We're not scared anymore.

854
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,080
We expect to beat you.
It's fucking over.

855
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,890
And I think they still
don't know what to do.

856
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,430
You know?
Wait a minute,

857
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:43,820
we used to tease you and we used to
always win and yeah, now you don't,

858
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,740
now you don't.
Now we've got this,

859
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,040
the biggest choke of all fucking
time has hung around your neck.

860
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:50,203
That'll never be beaten.

861
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:55,070
When do you guys think another
$220 million $10 million team,

862
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:57,890
whatever the fuck it was with five first
ballot hall of famers are going to lose

863
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:00,260
four games in a row,
have to be an up three games to none.

864
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:04,160
I'm asking you to a fucking team that
hasn't won a world series in like a

865
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,850
hundred years. Right. He had just
asked me about that and I swear to God,

866
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:12,220
I had not thought about Buckner.
Yeah.

867
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:15,700
Since like oh four it was fucking,
it was over. It was great.

868
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:20,050
I don't even give a shit now. I don't
even give a shit. And I gotta tell you,

869
00:53:20,051 --> 00:53:25,051
it's phenomenal to sit down and watch a
red sox game and expect something good

870
00:53:26,101 --> 00:53:28,530
to happen.
And when something bad happens,

871
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,210
you get upset at the player rather than
some sort of specter or some sort of

872
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:36,570
ghost or some overly Boodley horseshit.
Right?

873
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:39,663
So

874
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,510
I'm going to watch this fucking thing
and all of a sudden out of nowhere,

875
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,660
this show and I made two,
they broke,

876
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:53,180
they almost broke down bill Buckner more
than they broke down the poor cubs fan.

877
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,450
And in the end, the dude doesn't get
the interview. There's no interview.

878
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,260
They just taught all that.
But what I still recommend it,

879
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:07,610
I'm still wrecking recommending
it because they show,

880
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,680
um, they talk to the people. Some people,

881
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,470
I guess they found that people
who like through bear at him,

882
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,260
they talked to the security guard.
He was removing them,

883
00:54:18,261 --> 00:54:22,430
giving them shit that he now feels bad
that he did and they have the footage of

884
00:54:22,431 --> 00:54:23,264
him.

885
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:24,290
Okay.

886
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,500
Going out of the ballpark and
putting the jacket over them.

887
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:31,640
It's fucking amazing what
happens to this dude.

888
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,200
And uh, I, I totally
recommend it, but I just,

889
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:40,130
they should have been some sort
of warning for a red sox fan.

890
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:44,210
It was like walking,
go run into your old psycho girlfriend,

891
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,300
somebody who stopped you or something.

892
00:54:47,301 --> 00:54:52,160
Just somebody who just hadn't
even thought about 2047 years.

893
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,390
I haven't thought about that shit.
I haven't even thought about that.

894
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,340
And fucking seven years and all of a
sudden this documentary about the cubs,

895
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,310
they just go blow by blow through
the Buckner thing. Cause they,

896
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:05,600
I guess they wanted to show

897
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,770
how Buckner was used as escape goat,

898
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:12,170
despite the fact Bob Stanley
through the wild pitch.

899
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,710
And now this kid was used
as a scapegoat for the cubs,

900
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,940
despite the fact that Gonzales
booted a fucking double play ball,

901
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:23,090
which would've got him out
of the [inaudible]. Um,

902
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:30,170
I dunno, it's, I, it's
definitely interesting, but
I was, I was more than upset.

903
00:55:31,290 --> 00:55:32,070
Yeah.

904
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:35,130
That and, and Eleanor and they
even show the Aaron Boone home run,

905
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,000
which I don't even remember because
that was basically annoying for about 12

906
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:40,590
months,
you know?

907
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:42,280
Huh.

908
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,200
Because it was immediately rectified

909
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,320
and,
uh,

910
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,530
but it was just one of those things. I
don't know. I don't fucking know, but I,

911
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:53,680
I gotta be honest with you,
I never really felt bad for cubs fans.

912
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:58,480
I never did because, you know, they
didn't have that anger did the Midwest,

913
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:01,840
I don't know what it is. They're
positive. I don't know what it is.

914
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:05,800
They just didn't have that
anger or misery, you know,

915
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:10,300
with the red sox back in the day, it was
every Yankee success was our failure.

916
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:13,480
And with the cubs, they
just, you know, hey,

917
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:18,550
let's play two zippity Doo Dah.
I was like a big fucking keg party,

918
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:20,023
you know.

919
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,430
It's like they didn't even give a shit.
Even their curse was stupid.

920
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:26,440
The curse of the goat.
It was just fucking stupid.

921
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:28,903
MMM.

922
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:32,160
Made no sense. It's a ballpark. You
got to go. It doesn't belong here.

923
00:56:32,161 --> 00:56:36,090
It's going to shit all over the place.
Get it Outta here. I curse you. Really?

924
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,433
MMM.

925
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,473
Any fucking waste.

926
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:44,610
So they actually bring up what like
scapegoat am actually ruining this entire

927
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:45,900
thing.
You probably don't have to fucking run it.

928
00:56:45,901 --> 00:56:49,650
They start talking about what is,
how they came up with that terminology.

929
00:56:49,651 --> 00:56:52,900
The scape goat and it went
back to religion. Oh Gee.

930
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:57,450
That I guess back in the day, I don't
know what the hell religion it was.

931
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:02,090
They're all fucking stupid when you really
get down to it other than they're due

932
00:57:02,091 --> 00:57:05,580
on to other stuff that every religion has.
Um,

933
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:10,230
they would basically have a goat.
They bring a goat in and I'm thinking,

934
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:13,230
all right, they're going to sacrifice
it or whatever. And they wouldn't have,

935
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:18,260
the priest would lay his hands on a goat
for once instead of some unsuspecting

936
00:57:19,381 --> 00:57:20,214
child.

937
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:29,400
Oh, a little molestation joke for
you. How'd you guys like debt? Huh?

938
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,460
Do you like dead on your Monday? Do you
think that that was crossing the line?

939
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,860
Well, fuck you. I'm
stranded in New Jersey.

940
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,160
Okay.

941
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,110
Fucking New Jersey, Huh? Jesus
Christ. What a bunch of animals.

942
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,580
It amazes me about New Jersey is
how they still support Jon boat.

943
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:48,170
Jon Bon Jovi or the Bon Jovi ban.

944
00:57:48,171 --> 00:57:52,180
To the point that that band
can sell out giant stadium

945
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,293
still.

946
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:57,970
Yeah.

947
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:01,570
Unbelief. Let's Jersey Foya. It's
70,000 people singing, singing along.

948
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:04,300
Lay Your hands on me.

949
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,210
Your love is not bad medicine.
Zach

950
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,400
[inaudible].
Whoa.

951
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:19,630
Fucking acid wash as far as
the eye can see. Dirty Jersey.

952
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:25,830
Actually I think New Jersey underrated
is New Jersey. It's fucking phenomenal.

953
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:29,850
All of these New York's snobs,
Paul Versey being one of them.

954
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,470
I'm really trashing him this week.

955
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,540
Paul versus your typical New York snob
and I hope you're listening to this. Paul,

956
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:41,190
our help on somebody sends this to you.
Um,

957
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,140
yeah, he's, he's a snob.

958
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:47,190
He's one of those guys who just thinks
because he's on the other side of an

959
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:49,440
imaginary line that all of a sudden,

960
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,780
I don't know what that
the trees are greener.

961
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:57,550
The grass is Grad or know
what the fuck it is. You know,

962
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:01,620
I really realized like most New Yorkers
Judge New Jersey on their drive to

963
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,740
Newark Airport, when they go by all
those chemical plants, look at it.

964
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:08,040
It's so fucking shit hole. Oh, right.

965
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:12,720
Despite the fact that all some of
the most major celebrities live here.

966
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:16,530
What do you think they live
next to the plant? You know,

967
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,520
all those fucking guys down on Wall
Street, the children of the Illuminati,

968
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:26,650
they all live out there and red
bank with their fucking, uh,

969
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,600
Rockefeller estates. I know, but they,

970
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,180
they got New Jersey license plates.
Therefore it must suck. Anyways,

971
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:38,270
let's get back to the
scapegoat. Um, so basically the,

972
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:39,561
uh,
you know,

973
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:43,790
the priest would take a day
off from dental and kids
and he'd lay his hands on a

974
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:47,630
farm animal and one would think he
would grab the horns and then start

975
00:59:47,631 --> 00:59:52,450
fornicating. But this, that's another
story. What they would do with the,

976
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:57,020
with the goat is he lay his hands on
it and he would basically, somehow,

977
00:59:57,021 --> 01:00:00,110
I guess after everybody
confessed to this douche bag,

978
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:05,111
he would then place all of the sins on
the goat and then they would just banish

979
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:10,320
the goat and send it out of town with
all the sins in everybody's souls.

980
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,910
We're going to be clean again, but this
is the funny thing. As the goat left,

981
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:17,990
people would line up on either
side of the street and they would,

982
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:21,830
they would heckle the
goat and jeer at them. Eh,

983
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:25,910
you fucking adulterous paces shit.

984
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,530
Yeah.
Why don't you check off again?

985
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:35,540
You cut just yelling about the sins
that they did. I don't know what it was.

986
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:40,490
Yeah. It keeps stealing from the
pot at work. You selfish prick,

987
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:46,130
yelling at a farm animal.
You know, I swear to God,

988
01:00:46,131 --> 01:00:51,131
I would love to have a segment on here
of all this stupid fucking things that,

989
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,590
that, that they do in religion
that people, you know,

990
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,310
there's no fucking way,

991
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,970
there wasn't somebody like me back
then going through, this is fuck,

992
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:07,620
why are we yelling? At a goat, you know?

993
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:15,310
I mean, I hope you, you banged somebody
fucking wife. You stole money from work.

994
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,840
You know,
you're booted an old lady in the ass.

995
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,740
Do you really think it's in the
goat now and it's just walking?

996
01:01:23,741 --> 01:01:27,940
I just don't fucking get it. Even if
they filled you head up with it as a kid,

997
01:01:27,941 --> 01:01:31,330
at some point you gotta be looking
at it like this is a fucking goat.

998
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,240
It's got nothing to do with it.
So anyways,

999
01:01:34,241 --> 01:01:37,330
they would just cheer at this thing
and they'd send it out of town and then

1000
01:01:37,331 --> 01:01:40,660
everybody would be absolved. And I
don't know where to go. Would go.

1001
01:01:40,661 --> 01:01:43,810
Sometimes they say they take the goat
and they would throw it off a cliff,

1002
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,510
you know? I know it's extra painful
for me because I fucking love goats.

1003
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:52,960
I really do.
I was actually feeding some this morning.

1004
01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:58,750
I don't know what it is about them. I
think they're fucking hilarious. You know,

1005
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,380
I got this buddy. He lives out here,
right? It's got this giant house,

1006
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:07,660
there's all this fucking land and he's
got farm animals, farm animals on it.

1007
01:02:07,661 --> 01:02:11,880
And I'm thinking he's got these fucking
things because he's like me. He's,

1008
01:02:11,881 --> 01:02:15,270
he likes, he thinks goats or
funny or whatever, and it isn't.

1009
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:20,310
I found out that there's tax laws
out that if you farm on your land,

1010
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:25,620
you only have to pay
property taxes on one acre.

1011
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,760
So he went out and got these goats.
He doesn't even give a shit about him.

1012
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:34,983
Yeah.

1013
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,590
Can you fucking believe that?

1014
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,550
He's got like 10 goddamn goats and he
has to go out there with this bucket of

1015
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:42,384
feed every day.

1016
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:49,590
He's got to feed these things and it's
hard as an in it. That's what kills me.

1017
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:51,140
Okay?

1018
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,900
It's just just pay.
It's just pay the taxes.

1019
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:56,301
If I,

1020
01:02:56,301 --> 01:03:00,680
it would be worth it to not get up there
with that lunch pail a cheerios every

1021
01:03:00,681 --> 01:03:01,580
fucking morning,

1022
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:03,250
okay?

1023
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:07,510
Jesus fucking Christ. What is wrong? It's
just money. It's paper. Who gives a fuck?

1024
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:12,340
You just, you know, work a couple extra
hours. Fuck it. What do I owe you?

1025
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:15,790
You sit down,
you write numbers on a piece of paper,

1026
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:20,260
you stick it in a magic envelope,
you'll fucking Likud you send it out next.

1027
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:28,330
Jesus Christ. You're gonna sit there
and have a bunch of goddamn livestock

1028
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:31,810
is fucking guys swear to God.

1029
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:34,280
Okay.

1030
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:38,880
If, if, if you had a Giraffe, oh, what
do you guys want? What do you guys want?

1031
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:43,800
Hang on. This is the hotel.
Yeah, sorry about that.

1032
01:03:43,801 --> 01:03:44,850
I had to go answer the phone.

1033
01:03:44,851 --> 01:03:47,070
I couldn't even figure out
how to work the fucking phone.

1034
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,610
He's probably somebody above me.
I was probably yelling too loud.

1035
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:53,340
God knows what they all mad about.

1036
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,130
Yeah.

1037
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:57,770
And now just think about some of
the Shit I've made fun of. You know,

1038
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:01,010
Jesus beastiality and Bon Jovi

1039
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,380
and they all hold the same
weight here in New Jersey. Um,

1040
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:10,490
the hell was I talking about? Oh yeah,
this fucking guy. I swear to God, if he,

1041
01:04:10,491 --> 01:04:14,370
if he would get a giraffe, you
get like five giraffes. If,

1042
01:04:14,371 --> 01:04:16,820
if he only had to pay
like a quarter acre tax,

1043
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:22,130
that always amazes me when people
like that in the money, you know,

1044
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:27,920
I mean, I obviously give a fuck about
money. I want to have enough to survive.

1045
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,573
But,
uh,

1046
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,370
the amount of shit that didn't
work and I never took it back,

1047
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,960
just blows my eye.

1048
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:44,880
I've probably kept at least 25 grand with
his shit. That doesn't work in my life.

1049
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:49,500
I just gotta you gotta be shit
they see as what the fucking prime.

1050
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:54,190
He's fucking pieces of shit and I go off,
then my girl goes last year, return it.

1051
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:58,570
Ah, I'm not doing that shit. Standing
down there with the sales slip,

1052
01:04:58,571 --> 01:05:00,940
like some angry old fucking lady.
I'm not doing it.

1053
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:04,210
Who the have would be calling me now?
I'm all self conscious.

1054
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:09,770
I would have or if I'm too loud,
knock on my door. I sweat it.

1055
01:05:09,771 --> 01:05:13,850
Got Up. But it was the Bon
Jovi Shit. Um, anyways,

1056
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:16,370
let's get on with the podcast.
This is the money morning podcast.

1057
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:21,220
Everybody if you to this podcast
welcome. Um, this is, yes,

1058
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:24,430
and if you're thinking this is extra
dirty and extra angry this week. No,

1059
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:27,970
this is how it is every fucking week.
All right. Do one of these every week.

1060
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:31,780
I do them on Monday mornings because I
know most people hate their jobs or they

1061
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:35,770
hate their commute. They hate their
spouse or they hate themselves,

1062
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:39,290
you know, and they
need, they need a break.

1063
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:44,240
And it's also a great way to whore
out wherever the fuck I'm going to be.

1064
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:49,640
Uh, speaking of which I
am going to be in, uh,

1065
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:52,100
Columbus,
Columbus,

1066
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:55,520
Ohio at the funny bone down at the mall,

1067
01:05:55,580 --> 01:06:00,110
not bragging on the, uh,
September 9th, 10th and 11th.

1068
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:05,570
That is my next gig. I'm going to try
to go to that, uh, Ohio state game.

1069
01:06:07,010 --> 01:06:11,750
You know, it's in September. That's
always a dangerous one. You know,

1070
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:15,230
to go to a college football game in
September. Who they play it. Huh?

1071
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,410
They playing Wentworth
technical institute.

1072
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,430
You know, I'm new to college football
the last couple of years and ever deadly.

1073
01:06:25,431 --> 01:06:26,270
That's what they do.

1074
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:30,520
They've got all their cupcake games
in the beginning of the year. And, uh,

1075
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:34,550
I guess these other colleges,
uh, they pay money to,

1076
01:06:34,551 --> 01:06:37,970
to play these giant teams and get
the living shit kicked out of him on

1077
01:06:37,971 --> 01:06:39,170
television just to,

1078
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:44,330
I don't know what to expose to get TV
exposure for their school. I have no idea.

1079
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:45,700
Speaking of scapegoats,

1080
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:50,120
their entire fucking division three team
goes out there a bunch of up against a

1081
01:06:50,121 --> 01:06:54,050
bunch of roided up division one guys
or whatever the fuck they're doing now.

1082
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:57,420
I don't know. And then they get the shit
kicked out of him, but I don't know,

1083
01:06:57,560 --> 01:07:00,740
every once in awhile an
Appalachian Mountain state

1084
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,400
community college will beat a Michigan.

1085
01:07:04,401 --> 01:07:07,220
So I don't know who they're playing that
weekend, but I'm going to go down there.

1086
01:07:10,270 --> 01:07:13,870
I was looking forward to it until I spent
fucking 14 straight days on the road.

1087
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:18,260
But, uh, anyways, the podcast.
Um, anyways, if you want it,

we also have the podcast select and
this is where I interview interesting

1100
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:08,710
people.
I've only done one of them,

1101
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:12,340
but I like to speak of them as if
it's a giant library. I got one,

1102
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:17,490
they're 99 cents is a great
to contribute 99 cents,

1103
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:20,840
and he gets something if you want
to listen to NFL football star,

1104
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:22,820
right tackle [inaudible] from Salaam.

1105
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,480
Talk about trying to rip
somebodies voicebox out as they,

1106
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:31,070
as that guy tried to fucking break his
arm, that interview was there and a,

1107
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:36,071
I will be doing Monday morning podcast
selects as I meet interesting guests.

1108
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:41,210
That's how I'm doing them. All right. When
somebody, uh, somebody different. Okay.

1109
01:08:41,211 --> 01:08:43,940
Because,
uh,

1110
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,760
I don't want to interview other comedians.

1111
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:48,590
I just feel too many
podcasts of doing that.

1112
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,960
I've done too many podcasts
talking about comedy.

1113
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:53,900
I don't have any comedy stories left.
I really don't.

1114
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,600
And I gotta be honest with you,

1115
01:08:56,601 --> 01:08:59,750
aside from a couple of
people who are really good
interviewers, the Mark Marin's,

1116
01:08:59,751 --> 01:09:02,480
Joe Rogan's and that type of shit,
uh,

1117
01:09:02,481 --> 01:09:06,020
I probably should've saved
most of them for, ah,

1118
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:07,490
the unmasked that I did.

1119
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:08,940
Yeah.

1120
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:13,440
With, uh, Ron from Ron and Fez,
I dunno where he can find that,

1121
01:09:13,441 --> 01:09:15,820
but I did one of those this past week and,
uh,

1122
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:19,110
I just been running my Yap all
fucking week. Liz, why don't,

1123
01:09:19,111 --> 01:09:23,530
why don't we get to something entertaining
here? Uh, somebody sent me a, um,

1124
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,290
this youtube video or this week,
you really have to watch it. Okay.

1125
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:30,960
It's one of those shows. It's
basically, it's a rip off of the view.

1126
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,620
It's for broad sitting around and they
got, you know, the same thing. You know,

1127
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,960
they got the older one,
they got the sexy one,

1128
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,990
they got the one who was fat and then
got her fucking stomach tied up like a

1129
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,430
goddamn balloon. Not now. She's dropping
weight faster than a junkie. Right.

1130
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,400
I don't even know if that's true.
I just looked around him, you know,

1131
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:52,680
they got the racially mixed chick and
they all got on their fucking shoes.

1132
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:57,330
Right. The little outfits.
Uh, hang on a second.

1133
01:09:57,331 --> 01:09:59,490
Hang on a second. Somebody's knocking.
I'll let you know what this is.

1134
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:01,390
Yeah.

1135
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:01,571
All right.

1136
01:10:01,571 --> 01:10:05,920
You guys aren't going to believe this
shit that was security and they just said

1137
01:10:05,921 --> 01:10:09,940
that they, they had a noise
complaint. It was a lot of, uh,

1138
01:10:11,130 --> 01:10:13,030
the guy comes, I go to the door. Right?

1139
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,430
This is so pathetic that it 43.
I'm getting reprimanded.

1140
01:10:18,431 --> 01:10:22,210
I feel like I'm in fucking high
school and I talk like it too. Um,

1141
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,270
let me just the levels here or maybe
turn up yours cause I don't want to get

1142
01:10:25,271 --> 01:10:28,180
kicked out of here.
Um,

1143
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:33,190
until you open the door and there's a
security guard and he goes, uh, you Ben.

1144
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:35,223
And I'm like,
no.

1145
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:37,443
Okay.

1146
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:46,000
Cause I know he,
I know that he knows my name is bill.

1147
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:49,560
Well this is the thing when
security interrogates you,

1148
01:10:49,561 --> 01:10:54,460
you never offer any information,
you know,

1149
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,800
are you bent now?
And then I just looked at him like,

1150
01:10:56,801 --> 01:11:00,310
is there anything else I can
help you with? And he's like a,

1151
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:05,710
he looks down on a piece of paper.
Oh are you bill? And I was like, yes,

1152
01:11:06,490 --> 01:11:10,000
yes I am. And he goes, uh, yeah, we, uh,

1153
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:13,740
we get a noise complaint from
people on either side of you.

1154
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:19,410
Uh, these are VIP rooms on either side
of you. And uh, talking about, uh,

1155
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:24,810
three loud, there's a lot
of cursing. And I'm like,

1156
01:11:24,811 --> 01:11:28,320
all right. He goes, is there anyone else?
No. Oh wait, wait, wait. He told me,

1157
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:33,060
can you step out in the hall?
And I go for what? He goes,

1158
01:11:33,061 --> 01:11:35,190
I need to step out in the
hall. And I said, for what?

1159
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:40,820
And then he just goes into a Spiel,
you know,

1160
01:11:40,890 --> 01:11:42,390
what the fuck do I need to
step out in the hall for?

1161
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:43,830
Am I gonna be able to hear you better?

1162
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:47,640
You know the rack like your God
Damn State trooper with you,

1163
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:51,420
you're fucking sport coat on.
But as the name of the hotel on the Lapel,

1164
01:11:51,630 --> 01:11:53,370
I'm supposed to step out in the hall.
I don't know who you are,

1165
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:55,853
right?

1166
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:01,150
I'm such a Dick. It's ridiculous.
Right? So I made them basically say,

1167
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:04,960
I just didn't doorway. And he asked me,
he goes, is there anybody else in there?

1168
01:12:04,961 --> 01:12:07,120
And I was like, no. And then yeah,

1169
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:09,550
that's what he basically
said that I'm being too loud.

1170
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:15,430
Jesus Christ. I was cursing, I
think it was when you realized,

1171
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:17,830
he said there's people on
either side trying to sleep.

1172
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:22,660
And I was singing Bon Jovi songs
at the top of my fucking lungs.

1173
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:25,373
All right.

1174
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,710
And I was also talking about
beastiality and I was trashing Jesus.

1175
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:33,850
You know what? This hotel is cool as hell.
Cause when you really think about it,

1176
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:36,070
they probably should have
kicked me up. Um, all right,

1177
01:12:36,071 --> 01:12:40,630
so this is going to be my voice for the
rest. This is bill on punishment voice.

1178
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:46,300
I'd like to apologize to everybody
here at the Sheridan. Um,

1179
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:49,950
anyways, you know what some rich
costs on the other side of the door,

1180
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:53,830
that fucking piece of one of those
really fancy glasses that they think came

1181
01:12:53,831 --> 01:12:57,970
from France but actually came
from a fucking pottery barn. Um,

1182
01:12:58,450 --> 01:13:00,400
if you can hear me,
go fuck yourself.

1183
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:05,850
This is what you get for nuke in the
economy. Um, all right. So anyways,

1184
01:13:05,851 --> 01:13:10,690
so I'm watching this show, these
four fucking broads on it. Okay.

1185
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:17,470
Listen nothing to Irb. Oh, he told me this
is, this is your one and only warning.

1186
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:22,180
Next time you'll be
rejected from the hotel.

1187
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:27,130
He had such hacky security,
uh,

1188
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:32,370
like terminology, you
know, I don't fucking know.

1189
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:37,830
I T do you know how bad I just want to
yell content at the top of my lungs right

1190
01:13:37,831 --> 01:13:41,280
now and get ejected from the fucking
hotel just so I can get out of Jersey?

1191
01:13:41,930 --> 01:13:45,090
Maybe I should call up Paul version.
Tell me to, you don't fuck that.

1192
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:46,980
That's what I'm gonna
do after this podcast.

1193
01:13:46,981 --> 01:13:49,830
I'm calling up Paul [inaudible] and
I'm having them come down and get me.

1194
01:13:50,490 --> 01:13:53,310
All right. You know, fucking
threaten me next time I come up here.

1195
01:13:53,311 --> 01:13:54,440
What do you my fucking Dad

1196
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,220
fucking douchebag

1197
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:03,560
Christ. I swear to God. You know what's
funny about the male voice is it, uh,

1198
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,520
is it carries you have another set

1199
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:11,980
and there's a couple next door.
You can never, the woman's voice,

1200
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:16,200
you just hear the guy every
once in a while ago. Uh, Lou.

1201
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,510
Yeah. Well the WHO? Yeah.
You'd never hit the broad, so

1202
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:28,390
I'm probably going to get kicked
out. What do I do? Go Fuck Yourself.

1203
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:29,710
I'll take a cab back to New York.

1204
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:31,770
Yeah.

1205
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:32,581
Then they prop.
Of course,

1206
01:14:32,581 --> 01:14:34,770
they probably won't show up
because they're still afraid.

1207
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:40,140
Afraid of the weather channel. Um, anyway,
so these four fucking brides are on TV,

1208
01:14:40,141 --> 01:14:40,974
right?

1209
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:45,210
And they ended up there talking
about that guy that doing that story.

1210
01:14:45,211 --> 01:14:48,060
You know that story where that
dude got his dick cut off.

1211
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:53,010
I'm gonna have to raise the levels here.
There we go. How's that? Is that better?

1212
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,250
All right. So they're talking about
that guy who got his dick cut off

1213
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:01,400
his wife, drugged him, tied him to a bed,

1214
01:15:02,360 --> 01:15:05,780
cut his dick off, threw it in a
garbage disposal and turned it on.

1215
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,420
And it was basically because

1216
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:14,990
he wanted to get a divorce from
her. She mutilated. And um,

1217
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,840
she ended the guy's fucking
life and he solved quality.

1218
01:15:17,841 --> 01:15:22,841
Life is over and these women are
talking about it and lo and behold,

1219
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,500
it's fucking hilarious to them.

1220
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:33,160
They had all they could do to keep a
straight face during the first minute of

1221
01:15:34,011 --> 01:15:35,180
setting up the story.

1222
01:15:35,181 --> 01:15:39,260
And then all the jokes come and they're
laughing their fucking asses off.

1223
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:44,780
It's the funniest fucking thing ever.
And this right here.

1224
01:15:45,470 --> 01:15:50,470
It's because of that type of shit that I
don't feel that I am massage monistic I

1225
01:15:52,521 --> 01:15:56,480
just don't,
I think that I am just like women.

1226
01:15:57,650 --> 01:15:59,750
I trashed women the way they trash guys.

1227
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:03,620
It's just nobody pays attention
to the broads. They don't.

1228
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:10,260
Do you think of a guide mutilated a woman
in any shape or form that four guys on

1229
01:16:11,121 --> 01:16:15,350
a pregame NFL show would be
laughing about it. You know,

1230
01:16:16,430 --> 01:16:20,990
Sharon Osborne was the guest and she goes,
somebody asked,

1231
01:16:20,991 --> 01:16:23,840
do you think the guy deserved? And she
goes, well, it depends on what he did.

1232
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:25,850
You know,

1233
01:16:25,850 --> 01:16:30,850
I mean that thought is totally overlaps.

1234
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:36,791
The thought of those morons in the
Middle East who cut women's clits off,

1235
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:38,943
you know,

1236
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:43,700
it's fucking medieval thought
and it's just considered silly.

1237
01:16:43,730 --> 01:16:45,950
I don't know what it is.
I don't know.

1238
01:16:46,220 --> 01:16:48,710
But it maintains what
I've always fucking said,

1239
01:16:48,711 --> 01:16:53,711
that women will do it to you exactly
what they don't want you to do to them if

1240
01:16:54,831 --> 01:16:55,664
you let them.

1241
01:16:55,940 --> 01:17:00,710
And I think why so many guys are miserable
in marriages is they get married to

1242
01:17:00,711 --> 01:17:05,030
fucking young before they really know
how to stick up for themselves in a

1243
01:17:05,031 --> 01:17:09,350
relationship. And that's why
before you know it, yeah,

1244
01:17:09,351 --> 01:17:14,351
married and all your shit is either in
the basement of the garage and she's

1245
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:17,090
barely touching it and a,

1246
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:20,660
and you're wondering what the fuck
happened to your life. You know,

1247
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:24,530
I dunno.
The video is,

1248
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:27,680
is going to be up on the [inaudible]
podcast.com. You know something.

1249
01:17:27,681 --> 01:17:29,540
This is actually,
I like this talking like this.

1250
01:17:29,541 --> 01:17:34,541
This is very challenging to try and
be funny with a late night DJ voice.

1251
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:40,970
All right, this next chunk of the
podcast goes out to the ladies. Ladies,

1252
01:17:40,971 --> 01:17:44,660
if you're out there and you're single,
hang in there,

1253
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,210
there's a date rapists on the horizon.

1254
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,960
This next song right me by
nirvana goes out to all you.

1255
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,730
Um,
I know there's somebody,

1256
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:59,000
some Vanderbilt on either side
and may going Keith cursing again.

1257
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:03,200
Um, anyways, uh,

1258
01:18:03,230 --> 01:18:07,070
being on the road or do they want to
talk about bitches laughing at Dick being

1259
01:18:07,071 --> 01:18:12,020
cutoff already talked about that,
wanting to go home, talked about that.

1260
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:14,900
All right. Last week, uh, I was,

1261
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,430
I was showed that youtube clip about
that guy running on that soccer field and

1262
01:18:19,431 --> 01:18:20,780
getting, uh, you know,

1263
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:24,800
getting beat down by the cops and then
the crowd overwhelms the cops and beats

1264
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:25,634
down the cops.

1265
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:30,670
And I wanted to hear from the police
officers to just ask basically why they're

1266
01:18:30,991 --> 01:18:35,930
such dicks when they pull you over. I'm
not in a judgment that way, but just,

1267
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:39,590
I'm just basically asking the
question the way all drivers talk.

1268
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:44,300
So we have a kite responding here. He
says he built, not all cops are assholes.

1269
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:49,570
Some are just lazy. Uh, the summer
after my sophomore year, oh, no, no, no,

1270
01:18:49,571 --> 01:18:53,270
no. This is a different one. We'd
have fucker's the one from the cop.

1271
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:57,920
That's the one I want to hear. Oh,
here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

1272
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:02,640
Let's see if I can read this before
being ejected from the hotel. Uh,

1273
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
you're not going to be the
worst is if I do get injected.

1274
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:06,470
This guy's gonna be standing here,

1275
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:08,963
uh,

1276
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,120
with this security fucking
jacket on in my hotel room,

1277
01:19:12,121 --> 01:19:15,540
watching me gather my things.
So once again,

1278
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:19,140
I already have a game plan for that.
If I come,

1279
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:23,250
if there's another knock at my door,
I'm not opening it.

1280
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,710
I'm going to look through the people
and I'm talking through the door.

1281
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,690
So we opened the door please.
And I'm going to go, why?

1282
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:36,020
Uh, uh, cause and I'm just
going to ask him straight out.

1283
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:40,190
Am I being ejected from the hotel?
Uh, yes sir. You need to let me, uh,

1284
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,770
and I'll just bolt the door and
I'm going to be like, listen,

1285
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,860
I'm gonna gather my things. I'll be out
there in five minutes. You just sit tight.

1286
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:50,420
All right.
You with no fucking badge.

1287
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,570
All right. What are you going
to do? Take off your shoe?

1288
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:59,510
Is that what you're gonna do? Train.
Throw it through the crack in the door.

1289
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:00,344
It's not going to hit me.

1290
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:02,770
What

1291
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:06,910
a fucking asshole. Can you step out
into the lobby until the hallway police

1292
01:20:09,180 --> 01:20:10,110
go fuck yourself.

1293
01:20:11,710 --> 01:20:12,543
Huh?

1294
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,340
You fucking half a cop.
You half a security guard?

1295
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:22,740
Well I step out into the
hotel. Yeah, no I won't

1296
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:28,840
locate then I'll just just stay there.
Then you douchebag.

1297
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,820
Um, anyways, this plow ahead.
So here's a cup a day. Um,

1298
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:36,840
okay bill.
Uh,

1299
01:20:36,841 --> 01:20:41,760
the thing about this job is basically
that we have no fucking idea who we are

1300
01:20:41,761 --> 01:20:43,320
dealing with at any given time.

1301
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:47,040
Just because someone looks sweet and
innocent and just because the situation

1302
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:51,270
isn't likely to escalate doesn't mean
that they're not capable of murder or that

1303
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:54,840
the situation may go pear shaped quickly.
I don't even know what that means.

1304
01:20:56,030 --> 01:20:56,430
Yeah,

1305
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:59,490
pear shaped. I didn't want to
shape is a pair of shape. Like

1306
01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:05,580
what? What, what shape is it before it
goes pear shaped? Is it an apple shape?

1307
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:09,860
Listen Buddy, he can't talk
shop cause you're gonna lose me.

1308
01:21:09,861 --> 01:21:11,990
I'm not that bright a guy. Um, anyways,

1309
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:16,010
I can't tell you how many times
that someone said to me like,

1310
01:21:16,011 --> 01:21:20,640
I'm going to do anything. People. Oh, what
about that person running upstairs? Hi,

1311
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:23,980
can you reject that eight, eight year
old on the fucking hotel. All right.

1312
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:29,510
[inaudible] you know, I feel,
I feel like right now like, uh,

1313
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:31,010
okay.

1314
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:35,180
Either I'm announcing a golf match or um,

1315
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:37,353
okay.

1316
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:42,070
Um, I'm reporting live from
a hostage situation. Okay.

1317
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:47,200
There talking to him right now, he still
has the weapon up to the woman's head.

1318
01:21:47,201 --> 01:21:49,300
You can clearly see that
she's frightening. Okay.

1319
01:21:49,301 --> 01:21:53,380
There's somebody flanking him on
the left. Oh, he doesn't like, okay.

1320
01:21:53,381 --> 01:21:57,160
He's fired a shot. It missed and hour
they just took them down. Oh my God.

1321
01:21:57,161 --> 01:22:02,050
He's been shot in the head
and they have the woman. Um,

1322
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:05,430
anyways, here we go. Plowing
ahead here. Um, so anyways,

1323
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:08,830
the amount of time just got pulls people
over and the person behind the wheel

1324
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:13,720
says like, I'm going to do anything.
People think that I know. Oh,

1325
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:14,171
the people,

1326
01:22:14,171 --> 01:22:18,550
the drivers and stuff think that I know
them their whole lives and know that

1327
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:21,760
their Cape, that they're incapable
of harming anyone. But I don't,

1328
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:26,200
I always think back to the academy and
all the videos we watched of cops getting

1329
01:22:26,201 --> 01:22:31,201
killed or nearly killed because they
made one mistake or had a lapse in the

1330
01:22:31,691 --> 01:22:35,200
paranoia that keeps us
safe. See that? I knew it.

1331
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:38,770
I knew it was something that they
showed them at the academy. I said,

1332
01:22:38,771 --> 01:22:42,670
another thing to remember is that there
is a gun at every call and every traffic

1333
01:22:42,671 --> 01:22:44,200
stop the gun on my belt.

1334
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:48,100
No Man is invincible and a lucky
punch can knock me unconscious,

1335
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:52,720
leaving me vulnerable to take to them
taking my weapon and killing me or others.

1336
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:56,530
For this reason, we like to keep some
distance. We don't like to be touched.

1337
01:22:56,531 --> 01:22:57,364
And above all,

1338
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:01,480
we can't allow people to get the
opportunity to take control of our weapon.

1339
01:23:02,770 --> 01:23:07,000
Um, so when someone's Sir a squirrely
or not listening to my commands,

1340
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:11,380
they may get cuffed and put in the back
of my car until everything is figured

1341
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:15,610
out. They may not like it, but I am
going home at the end of my shift,

1342
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:20,140
not to the morgue. Um, that
leaves another point of control.

1343
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,810
No one likes to be bossed
around and told what to do.

1344
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:24,160
But when the police are there,

1345
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:27,460
were there for a reason someone called
us or we have a reason to believe that

1346
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,290
we're needed. Once we're there, we have
to be in control. We call the shots, not,

1347
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:37,540
um,
not forgo or to be on a power trip,

1348
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,480
but because if we lose control,
we're fucked. It's our ass.

1349
01:23:40,481 --> 01:23:43,900
If someone gets hurt and our president
and it's literally our ass if we get hurt

1350
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:47,500
or killed, if someone thinks that they
can do what they want or walk over me,

1351
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:52,270
how am I supposed to do my job? Uh,
as for the videos you recently posted,

1352
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:55,870
those cops with the name changer
were absolutely terrible.

1353
01:23:56,230 --> 01:24:00,610
If there is a lawful warrant for
that guys arrest despite the reason,

1354
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:04,540
uh, it is their job to arrest him. Um,

1355
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:09,520
the suspect knew about the warrant.
I didn't know what video is.

1356
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:13,120
It didn't take care of it. Now he asked
to see a judge. They should've just,

1357
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:16,600
they should have used much more
forced to take them into custody.

1358
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:20,530
But the reality of it is you can't
just be able to keep passively Redis

1359
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:24,910
resisting a cop until, until
the cops let you go. Uh,

1360
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:27,220
they can't let you go.
All right, here we go.

1361
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,870
The video at the stadium was disturbing.

1362
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:32,110
They shouldn't have been obviously
jabbing the guy with their buttons,

1363
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,300
but they had the right to
take them into custody.

1364
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:37,840
People running around sports fields
isn't and shouldn't be tolerated.

1365
01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:41,860
Are they supposed to stop the game and
wait for him to be finished with running

1366
01:24:41,861 --> 01:24:44,320
around?
What if he assaulted or killed at athlete?

1367
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,750
Then everyone would be crying
that the cops didn't do anything.

1368
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:49,690
There was a great point. Also,
when we deal with people,

1369
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:53,950
90% of the possible danger
from them is their hands.

1370
01:24:54,250 --> 01:24:58,690
If you're laying on your hands and I
can't see them, I will expect the worst.

1371
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:02,440
How am I supposed to do? How am I
supposed to know what they are late?

1372
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:05,410
That they aren't laying on a weapon?
Uh,

1373
01:25:05,470 --> 01:25:10,330
when I want your hand gimme your hand or
I will use force to get them out. Yeah.

1374
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:16,410
There you go. Uh, one
last thing is tasers. Uh,

1375
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:19,660
they are amazing tools. I had been
tased and training and yes, it sucks,

1376
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:23,350
but it beats getting thumped or
shot. Uh, we're in the old days,

1377
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:26,740
that guy may get the crap beat out of
him or his brain can cause now he gets an

1378
01:25:26,741 --> 01:25:28,330
electric ride for five seconds.

1379
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:33,130
It's also amazing because the suspect
can be cuffed while being taste basically

1380
01:25:33,131 --> 01:25:36,340
less chance for everyone to see,
to get seriously hurt.

1381
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:40,720
Why should I risk getting seriously hurt
or killed going hands on with someone

1382
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:44,790
when they can just be taste. Um, that,

1383
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,380
you know what somebody told me a
long time ago, if you want to make,

1384
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,240
if you get pulled over by a cop,

1385
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:55,230
a great way to help them relax and maybe
bring down them being a dick to you is

1386
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:59,740
a, have your hands where
they can see them. You know,

1387
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:03,860
if it's during the day, I always put
them like right on the steering wheel.

1388
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:08,750
I get pulled over a lot, by
the way. Uh, not as much. I
guess back in the day I did,

1389
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:13,460
cause I used to just drive 80 miles an
hour anywhere I was going, you know,

1390
01:26:13,490 --> 01:26:17,240
there's only so many fucking
farm she can look at. Um,

1391
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:19,210
yeah,

1392
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:21,530
it was funny. So I'm still nervous
about getting thrown out of here.

1393
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:25,280
And the only reason why is because some
of the roads are washed out and I don't

1394
01:26:25,281 --> 01:26:26,420
know where the fuck I would go,

1395
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,200
but I don't know why I'm nervous because
I am now speaking in a speaking tone if

1396
01:26:30,201 --> 01:26:31,550
I'm not allowed to speak.

1397
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:33,403
Okay.

1398
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:38,750
No, this is actually great stuff. What
if I show the hotel security my hands,

1399
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:43,680
maybe he'll allow me to stay.
So anyways,

1400
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:46,480
um, yeah, I,

1401
01:26:46,481 --> 01:26:50,820
I put my hands right on
top of the steering wheel
where they can see them. Um,

1402
01:26:50,821 --> 01:26:55,590
if it's a sunny day, I have one hanging
out the car window where they can see it.

1403
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:59,770
And the other one I just put on top of
my head like an ape chilling out in, uh,

1404
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:01,560
in the zoo.
You know,

1405
01:27:01,561 --> 01:27:04,320
when they sit there and they just have
that one arm draped over their head,

1406
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:08,460
uh,
I sit like that

1407
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:14,200
and then when they show up, I just had
my hands on the steering wheel and uh,

1408
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,200
and you know what,
there's still assholes.

1409
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:20,890
Yeah.

1410
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:24,250
You know, it's kind of a
crap shoot, you know, so,

1411
01:27:24,251 --> 01:27:26,020
but I think this guy run
up a lot of great points.

1412
01:27:26,021 --> 01:27:27,880
What the fuck is he supposed to do?
And that's a great point.

1413
01:27:27,881 --> 01:27:29,890
If the guy ran on the field and
did something to an athlete,

1414
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:32,710
then they would blame the security and it
would be screaming and yelling at them,

1415
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:33,610
you know,

1416
01:27:33,610 --> 01:27:36,220
which probably goes back to the weather
channel then if they don't scare the

1417
01:27:36,221 --> 01:27:39,580
living shit out of people that they
would get blamed for not warning people.

1418
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:43,900
But I think it has more to do with a
scaring people, gives them great ratings.

1419
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,113
Um,

1420
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:46,700
yeah,

1421
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:50,450
so I don't know any more cops want
to weigh in? I, here's one for you.

1422
01:27:50,451 --> 01:27:52,340
I want to know what do
you guys think about that?

1423
01:27:52,341 --> 01:27:54,740
You can anonymously
talk about this as cops,

1424
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:59,870
that kid who got shot on
the subway platform and died
new year's Day in Oakland,

1425
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,710
um,
that do definitely wasn't being compliant.

1426
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:08,270
He definitely wasn't given them
showing them his hands. And this guy,

1427
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:11,090
I don't know,
he's like the Manchurian candidate.

1428
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:14,840
All of a sudden the guy said the wrong
thing. The guy's laying on his stomach.

1429
01:28:16,950 --> 01:28:19,890
One cops got his foot on his neck.
I mean that the dude is down.

1430
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:21,220
Yeah.

1431
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:24,280
And all of a sudden this
one kid just stood up,

1432
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:27,820
takes out a gun and just shoots the guy
right in the back. And I do, it's like,

1433
01:28:27,821 --> 01:28:30,820
what the fuck you shot me?
And he ended up dying.

1434
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,460
Um,
you know what about [inaudible]

1435
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:37,070
that one? That's, that's, that's one.

1436
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:40,760
This is what I should say for the podcast
select cause that's what I want to ask.

1437
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:45,800
And I didn't want to like just have
somebody go on there and honestly and just

1438
01:28:45,801 --> 01:28:50,630
say what you think about it.
Should have that cop gone to jail because,

1439
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:55,640
uh, he got what basically usually
happens when a cop shoots somebody.

1440
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,890
Is he

1441
01:28:56,890 --> 01:29:00,610
it off? Um, I dunno,

1442
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:02,130
but

1443
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:05,490
I don't want to, I don't want to do
this whole cop thing attack and cops.

1444
01:29:06,210 --> 01:29:10,290
I'd like to try to create some sort of
forum where you can actually anonymously

1445
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:15,450
present your side and that worry about
pissing off other cops or worry about

1446
01:29:15,451 --> 01:29:18,390
pissing off victims are in that type of
shit. Cause I think it's, I don't know.

1447
01:29:18,391 --> 01:29:21,510
It's one of those things for
some reason I guess I know why.

1448
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:25,200
The reason is it's too much shit at
stake so people don't talk about it. Um,

1449
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,360
that could have been a lot more fun topic.

1450
01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:29,490
I didn't have to speak
in my time up voice.

1451
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:33,720
This is officially the
first mm podcast timeout on.

1452
01:29:33,810 --> 01:29:36,210
Oh wait a minute then fucking
old bastard downstairs.

1453
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,460
You know something?
I think I'm allowed asshole.

1454
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:42,610
Yeah,

1455
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:47,050
I think that that's what it is. You
know, on both sides of the country.

1456
01:29:47,051 --> 01:29:50,110
I've been told that I'm too loud. I
need to shut the fuck up self. You know,

1457
01:29:50,111 --> 01:29:52,480
at some point you've gotta look in the
mirror and realize that you, all right,

1458
01:29:52,481 --> 01:29:56,770
let's plow ahead of here. All
right. Advice for the week. Bill.

1459
01:29:56,771 --> 01:30:01,660
I have known this young lady for a few
years and we're very fond of each other.

1460
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:04,300
Uh, but she has had, she's had,

1461
01:30:04,810 --> 01:30:07,450
she has a possessive boyfriend
with a stupid haircut.

1462
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:11,470
And a couple of times when she's broken
up with him, she's come to me. Uh,

1463
01:30:11,471 --> 01:30:16,360
but then she goes back to macro man.
Uh, this is the thing that bothers me.

1464
01:30:16,361 --> 01:30:18,820
Whenever things have got
gotten sexual between us,

1465
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:22,960
like I go down on her and
blow her fucking mind.

1466
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:26,950
This guy has definitely got confidence.
He goes, she never returns the favor.

1467
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:30,160
She gets disgusted.
She even gets disgusted.

1468
01:30:30,161 --> 01:30:35,161
If I sulk in my seat that I didn't
get any dude sulking is like,

1469
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:39,940
I don't, I'm not gonna sit here and
act like I know what turns women on.

1470
01:30:39,941 --> 01:30:44,380
But I can tell you the exact
opposite of turning a woman on.

1471
01:30:44,381 --> 01:30:48,310
If you want to have the exact opposite,
Spanish fly would be sulking.

1472
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:52,630
Nothing makes her pussy dry up,
like sulking,

1473
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,350
just letting you know
right there. Okay. Um,

1474
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:02,140
but nothing that makes it wetter with
complete indifference. Um, anyways,

1475
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:06,570
once she said callously Oh,
after she did,

1476
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:09,250
after the guy went down on her and
then she, he didn't get a blow job.

1477
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:13,930
She wants callously said,
have a wank to alleviate my horniness.

1478
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:19,540
After having her completely naked on my
chair worshiping her and pleasuring her

1479
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:23,440
holes to Jesus Christ, buddy,
they got 'em at yelling.

1480
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,350
That one right there would
have kicked me out. Uh,

1481
01:31:26,351 --> 01:31:30,640
it was just me with the Styrofoam Cup.
Another time when we had intercourse,

1482
01:31:30,641 --> 01:31:31,390
we were drunk.

1483
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:35,290
She stopped me halfway through and
she even stopped halfway through,

1484
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:42,450
uh, shit doing you a favor, a hand
job. She's never made me come.

1485
01:31:43,230 --> 01:31:46,800
These are only the only examples
of when she tried to get me off.

1486
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,390
And I'm a good looking chappy,

1487
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:53,850
so it's not that recently I
boycotted her body. I said,

1488
01:31:53,851 --> 01:31:57,810
let's be friends to be strictly platonic.
I won't even play with her.

1489
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:01,570
NORCS I'm guessing her
titties. Uh, this is,

1490
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:07,080
this has had the result of her trying
to rekindle things like the old magic.

1491
01:32:08,920 --> 01:32:13,240
Um, if she's not that into me, what the
fuck is going on? I'm finished with her.

1492
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:17,290
But any insights you can give is a
treasure. All right? First of all, dude,

1493
01:32:17,291 --> 01:32:19,390
you're not finished. What? They're, um,

1494
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:22,900
just halfway through writing that you've
probably realized what a PSAP you were

1495
01:32:22,901 --> 01:32:26,510
being. All right. Okay. First of
all, who's kidding who? You're,

1496
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:30,850
you're fucking with the
psycho. All right. And uh,

1497
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,980
I don't know if this is a very, there's
a very touchy one to talk about here,

1498
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:36,580
but um,

1499
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:41,140
this girl strikes me as one of those
girls who wants to be put in her place and

1500
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:45,400
wants to be bent over something and once
a guy to tell her what the fuck is what?

1501
01:32:45,880 --> 01:32:49,180
Ra. Okay. Consensually.

1502
01:32:50,230 --> 01:32:53,440
Do you understand what I mean?
Okay. Don't take this the wrong way.

1503
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:57,670
Going in and just fucking give him a
forearm. Give her a forearm shiver. Right.

1504
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,660
I'm not saying to do
that. All right. You know,

1505
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:04,990
some girls are cons and they know their
account and they want to get us to

1506
01:33:04,991 --> 01:33:09,590
basically tell them that it could be this.
I have no idea.

1507
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:13,660
If I could tell you one thing right now,
sulking and keep coming back for more.

1508
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:17,740
You'll like Charlie brunch keeps
pulling the football and uh,

1509
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:22,090
you know, if you want to fuck
this girl, walk away from her,

1510
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:25,710
stop returning your phone calls
and all that type of shit, you,

1511
01:33:25,711 --> 01:33:29,770
you basically started to do that when
you boycotted a body. But then you said,

1512
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:33,190
let's be friends. That's
a weak move. Okay.

1513
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:38,560
What's this girl I think wants to
see you be a fucking man. All right?

1514
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:40,620
And you're not,
you're going down on her,

1515
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:43,240
you're pleasing her and
she's doing everything.

1516
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:48,430
Everything she can to disrespect
you and you're allowing it.

1517
01:33:50,330 --> 01:33:51,163
MMM.

1518
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:55,420
And I think that's turned on or off.
And I think she's a fucking statistic.

1519
01:33:55,421 --> 01:34:00,400
Psycho. So she's getting you off. She's
leaving you with blue balls, you know,

1520
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:01,750
I don't know.
That might be it.

1521
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:05,080
Or she might be fucking angry at something
else and she's taken it out on you.

1522
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:07,840
All I know,
dude is walk away from this girl.

1523
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:10,990
Just walk away from her brother
for some fucking reason.

1524
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:13,840
You still want to bang her one more time,
blow her off,

1525
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:18,280
blow off her texts in or calls
for like a week and a half.

1526
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:22,780
And then randomly answer one.
And when you pick up the phone,

1527
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,980
just just have a whatever
vibe. Hey, what's going on?

1528
01:34:27,570 --> 01:34:31,150
And we're being McCune and make calls
and me or make ticks and the busy,

1529
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:36,580
what's up? You want to
hang out now? Why not?

1530
01:34:36,610 --> 01:34:40,450
Yeah. You know, I don't know. What
do I want to hang with you for?

1531
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:44,530
Get blue balls.
You know,

1532
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:50,530
you're fucking selfish. You're fucking
annoying. Leave me alone. You know,

1533
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,370
that's probably too angry,
but just, I'm sorry guys,

1534
01:34:54,371 --> 01:34:58,790
I'm fucking angry right now that I
have to talk like this. Um, yeah,

1535
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:01,850
just blow her off and just be,
you know,

1536
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,120
and when you go to meter
meter in a public place,

1537
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:07,610
don't go over a place
where she can immediately,

1538
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:10,700
she's going to dress extra sexy when you
come over there because she's trying to

1539
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:11,960
get that power over you again.

1540
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:16,730
Meet her in a fucking public place and
be talking to her as you kind of glancing

1541
01:35:16,731 --> 01:35:18,620
around the room,
you know,

1542
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:23,990
sort of head on another girl while
she's standing there, I'm telling you,

1543
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:29,020
you know, and when she asked
you to go home with their, don't

1544
01:35:31,110 --> 01:35:35,850
just say I'm cool or whatever,
you know, fucking blow her off.

1545
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:39,840
If she ever calls you again, she
wants to hang out or whatever. Tell,

1546
01:35:39,930 --> 01:35:41,130
tell him to come over to your place.

1547
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:47,130
And the second she starts acting like
a Douche, kick her out. I don't know.

1548
01:35:47,460 --> 01:35:48,293
I had sheets.

1549
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:53,670
What sucks about a girl
like that as immediately you
got to try and get into her

1550
01:35:53,671 --> 01:35:55,800
head. Then you've got to start
playing games. It's not worth it.

1551
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:59,250
There's too many decent girls out there
who will, when they take the dick out,

1552
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:03,340
they will fucking complete whatever you
want. So I would just walk away from her.

1553
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:05,833
MMM.

1554
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:11,130
Let's be friends. Jesus Christ, buddy
that and sulking you need to take.

1555
01:36:11,131 --> 01:36:14,220
Those are the two parts of your game.
You need to work on this off season.

1556
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:19,470
All right? And then maybe next
year you'll get the ring. Okay.

1557
01:36:19,471 --> 01:36:24,120
Good luck. All right, next one.
Bill. I'm a cubicle dwelling,

1558
01:36:24,121 --> 01:36:25,980
suffocated engineer in Texas.

1559
01:36:26,220 --> 01:36:29,520
I was rushed through the college
machine with all the rest of the cattle

1560
01:36:29,521 --> 01:36:33,840
destined to find a job, dimes, some
pleated Khakis and live the rest,

1561
01:36:34,770 --> 01:36:38,490
live the rest of our lives. And he's
steadily paid servitude of the man.

1562
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:40,650
But a few years ago out of college,

1563
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:43,430
uh Oh,

1564
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:47,720
but a few years ago out of college
and I hated, like you saying,

1565
01:36:47,721 --> 01:36:50,390
I'm a few years out of
college and I hate it. Uh,

1566
01:36:50,391 --> 01:36:52,940
I wish I'd followed my desire
to be some sort of a writer.

1567
01:36:53,220 --> 01:36:56,900
And after listening to your podcasts
among others and hearing from friends that

1568
01:36:56,901 --> 01:37:01,280
I should have, I wish I'd given stand
up a shot. Well, now I'm 30 years old,

1569
01:37:01,281 --> 01:37:05,360
staring down the barrel of 35 more
years as a cozy smug engineer,

1570
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:10,190
making six figures, but hating five
out of every seven days of my life.

1571
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,500
I don't have any wife or kids,

1572
01:37:12,501 --> 01:37:15,690
but I feel like I'm too old to jump
back into being a starving artists.

1573
01:37:15,691 --> 01:37:16,524
What do I do?

1574
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:19,113
Yeah,

1575
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:22,510
dude, this is on you. All right?

1576
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:27,790
I would never tell somebody who's got a
six figure paying job to jump into this

1577
01:37:27,791 --> 01:37:32,110
fucking awful business. All right? Um,

1578
01:37:32,140 --> 01:37:33,670
but I would never tell you not to do it.

1579
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:39,390
All I got to tell you is you can't
half ass getting into this business,

1580
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:44,890
all right? Or you are going to be,
you think you hate in your life. Now,

1581
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:49,780
uh, just picture hating five
out of every seven days,

1582
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,730
except you're making fucking,

1583
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:58,680
you make it low five and you're old now
and nobody wants to fucking book you and

1584
01:37:58,981 --> 01:38:02,010
you don't have any wife and
kids. I'm telling you, all right,

1585
01:38:02,730 --> 01:38:07,560
I'll give you this advice. If you
decide to become a fucking comedian,

1586
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:11,820
there's no turning back, all right?
And you've got to go into it.

1587
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,770
You can't even consider quitting.

1588
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:22,110
And it has nothing to do with fucking
talent and has to do with desire.

1589
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:27,180
I'm telling you. Um,
that's what I would say.

1590
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:29,160
So what I would do if I was you,

1591
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:34,190
I would keep my six figure job and
I'd start doing some open mics.

1592
01:38:35,640 --> 01:38:38,040
That's what I would do.
All right.

1593
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:42,990
And if you feel in your heart as you're
standing on stage that this is what the

1594
01:38:42,991 --> 01:38:44,610
fuck you want to do with your life.

1595
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:50,100
I would do it in a second
because six figures, seven
figures, if you're miserable,

1596
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:52,680
it's not going to be worth it.
All right?

1597
01:38:53,190 --> 01:38:56,160
But I don't know if you
know you're into comedy,

1598
01:38:58,230 --> 01:39:02,730
you know, the way I'm into playing
drums, drums or a hobby for me,

1599
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,750
I absolutely fucking love them.
But there's no fucking way I would have,

1600
01:39:06,751 --> 01:39:10,890
I was about to climb into a van
with three other fucking guys,

1601
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:16,440
you know, and eat pasta. I want, I'm not
going to do it. It just, I don't know.

1602
01:39:16,470 --> 01:39:20,190
I actually played drums and
I realized I didn't have it.

1603
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:25,620
You know, I didn't, I didn't have it as
a musician and I didn't have that drive.

1604
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:31,640
Um, but when I got on stage, the
first time I did comedy, I just, I,

1605
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:35,850
I never look back and I was just
like this, I'm doing this shit. So,

1606
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:40,950
um, they go, so you have
to answer those questions.

1607
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:45,690
So the best way to do it is to sign
up for some open mics. All right?

1608
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:48,990
See how it goes and see how you feel.
And like I said,

1609
01:39:48,991 --> 01:39:51,390
if you feel like that's what
you want to do, then I would,

1610
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:56,490
I would work towards it, but I would
not quit that six figure paying job. Uh,

1611
01:39:56,520 --> 01:39:58,050
you don't just quit your fucking job.

1612
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:04,100
You don't build up your time so you can
swing out of that job into some fucking

1613
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:06,900
paid gigs. That's how I did it. Um,

1614
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:11,700
I kept my day job until I moved to New
York City and I had saved up a bunch of

1615
01:40:11,701 --> 01:40:16,620
money. Um, you know, I
had paid off all my bills.

1616
01:40:16,621 --> 01:40:18,300
I didn't have a car payment,
I had nothing.

1617
01:40:18,301 --> 01:40:22,950
And I moved to New York and I had a
nest egg of fucking money. And uh,

1618
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:26,550
and yeah,
I've told these stories before.

1619
01:40:26,551 --> 01:40:28,530
I hate fucking spaghetti
every goddamn night.

1620
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,980
Three pieces of bread filled up my stomach

1621
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:38,310
and I just did stand up every night and
I just did. I just wasn't doing standup.

1622
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:40,500
I was working towards
getting better at it,

1623
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:44,940
analyzing what I was doing wrong,
and um,

1624
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:50,970
you know, but I would, I would
never tell you to quit your job.

1625
01:40:50,971 --> 01:40:54,880
And I would also never tell you that you
can't start comedy at 30 years of age

1626
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:57,700
because you can't. All
right, so there it is,

1627
01:40:57,730 --> 01:41:02,440
but at the ball's in your fucking court.
All right. Youtube videos of the week.

1628
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:07,310
Uh, we had an earthquake
here, um, this past week. Uh,

1629
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:10,090
best earthquake reaction.
This is hilarious.

1630
01:41:10,091 --> 01:41:13,840
It's like three guys on the MLB network
or something like talking about baseball

1631
01:41:13,841 --> 01:41:16,270
and all of a sudden the hurricane comes.
Uh,

1632
01:41:16,271 --> 01:41:19,270
it's fucking hilarious because people
on the east coast don't know what an

1633
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:23,800
earthquake feels like. A, so they're
sort of looking around like, um,

1634
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:29,710
wait a second is, does anybody else
feel like something moving? Uh,

1635
01:41:29,770 --> 01:41:33,250
in defense of them was one of
those little shakin ones. Um,

1636
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:38,690
somebody sent some home videos
of Peyton manning as a kid, uh,

1637
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,670
running around whining
or whatever. But, uh, I,

1638
01:41:42,820 --> 01:41:45,460
I'm too hard on Peyton manning is fucking
ridiculous. How hard I am on this guy.

1639
01:41:45,730 --> 01:41:46,900
Bought A,
everybody wind is a kid,

1640
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:50,560
but at this still funny as
a patriots fan to watch. Um,

1641
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:56,830
and here's two that I
get. Um, it's called fuck,

1642
01:41:56,860 --> 01:42:01,660
fuck the police one. And this
is hilarious. This is some guy,

1643
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:03,160
I dunno if he's in Brooklyn or what,

1644
01:42:03,190 --> 01:42:08,190
this black dude who knows his rights
has been harassed by the police.

1645
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:11,020
She can tell his entire life or whatever,

1646
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:15,790
but he's screaming at the cops.
That's the mistake he makes.

1647
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:20,950
They don't arrest them, but the shit
he's saying, if he would just say it,

1648
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:26,470
if he just said it, I think he would've
been fine, but he's screaming it.

1649
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:30,160
Uh, and it's really funny.
It's actually, it was,

1650
01:42:30,161 --> 01:42:35,161
this guy goes on for
like 20 minutes and uh,

1651
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:36,701
I've said before,

1652
01:42:36,701 --> 01:42:39,940
it's all about not losing your
shit and this guy loses his shit.

1653
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:44,410
But I don't think he ever gets arrested,
but it's fucking hilarious. Um,

1654
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:46,690
and he has a youtube video of the week.

1655
01:42:46,691 --> 01:42:50,260
This was actually suggested
by Paul Versey, uh,

1656
01:42:50,950 --> 01:42:54,010
oh out will forte. And this is
a, a sketch with Peyton manning.

1657
01:42:54,011 --> 01:42:57,070
Peyton manning is fucking
hilarious in the sketch. Um,

1658
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:00,550
it's basically will forte,
you know,

1659
01:43:00,551 --> 01:43:04,330
everybody comes walking in there like a
basketball team and they get their asses

1660
01:43:04,331 --> 01:43:08,230
kicked and well forte comes in and
basically tells people that they shouldn't

1661
01:43:08,231 --> 01:43:13,231
quit and that he had a coach and they
played him this song one time when his

1662
01:43:13,241 --> 01:43:17,280
team was down by 60 points and by
listening to the song and amped,

1663
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:18,183
I'm all the way up.

1664
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:22,540
And then he basically puts on some
fucking songs from the 1930s and starts

1665
01:43:22,541 --> 01:43:27,370
dancing to it and it's fucking hilarious.
Underrated for the week. Will Forte,

1666
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:31,540
the guy is fucking hilarious.
And uh,

1667
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:36,130
please watch the director's cut of
macgruber. Highly recommended that.

1668
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,340
And what else do we got here?
We got the a woman cuts,

1669
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:41,710
guy's Dick off all the four
broads laughing at that.

1670
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:46,300
And then I got one other one here. What
the fuck is it? Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1671
01:43:48,950 --> 01:43:53,660
Um, I'm the worst. The fuck did it go?

1672
01:43:53,900 --> 01:43:56,540
All right. Oh wait, don't say it
too loud. Don't curse too loud.

1673
01:43:56,541 --> 01:44:00,280
We will eject you from the Sheridan.
Um,

1674
01:44:00,710 --> 01:44:01,700
I'll future gun owner.

1675
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:07,780
I'll creepy game show host is another
one that we have creepy fucking game show

1676
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:09,081
host.
She used to see this,

1677
01:44:09,081 --> 01:44:13,970
I can't believe that this guy actually
was allowed on air and I showed it to

1678
01:44:13,971 --> 01:44:17,360
Bobby Kelly and he was laughing
at just this guy's fucking,

1679
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,190
the game show was basically a mother
and a daughter. You know something.

1680
01:44:22,191 --> 01:44:23,810
They already showed this on tosh point.
Oh,

1681
01:44:23,811 --> 01:44:26,120
I really try not to do that because
I figured everybody sees them,

1682
01:44:26,121 --> 01:44:27,500
but we'll put it up there just in case.

1683
01:44:27,830 --> 01:44:29,900
But Bobby Kelly actually
showed me another one.

1684
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:35,060
I don't know where the fuck this took
place. It sounds like it's in Scandinavia.

1685
01:44:36,430 --> 01:44:39,800
And this guy calls this kid up to sing
a song and he basically just starts

1686
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:44,480
kissing his back. It's
unbelievably disgusting. Uh,

1687
01:44:44,900 --> 01:44:48,470
nibbling on his ear in the back of
his hair is this kid is singing.

1688
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:52,790
It's fucking brutal. Um,
all right. Overrated.

1689
01:44:52,791 --> 01:44:55,550
Underrated for the weekend. Then I'm
going to fucking rap this pie. Holy Shit.

1690
01:44:55,720 --> 01:45:00,460
Hour and 15 minutes. Time flies when
you're whispering in a super eight, um,

1691
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:02,120
overrated hand sanitizer.

1692
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:05,450
I've been sharing the company restaurant
with a bunch of coworkers who believe

1693
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:09,710
using hand sanitizer is the equivalent
or even superior to washing their hands

1694
01:45:09,711 --> 01:45:11,030
with good old soap and water.

1695
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:15,620
It's not the rubbing alcohol and the
hand sanitizer kills the bacteria and

1696
01:45:15,621 --> 01:45:18,710
destroys virus presence on the hand.
And that's about it.

1697
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:23,890
It does not physically remove the genital
grime deposited on the hands after guy

1698
01:45:24,051 --> 01:45:28,010
has finished jiggling his junk to
get rid of the last drops of Piss.

1699
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:32,150
These people also use other commodities
such as the company refrigerator,

1700
01:45:32,151 --> 01:45:36,290
therefore effectively covering every
goddamn thing that they touch with their

1701
01:45:36,291 --> 01:45:41,180
dead penis and vagina cells.
All right, guy, he's not short.

1702
01:45:41,181 --> 01:45:45,290
If descriptive adjectives,
uh, overrated launch,

1703
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:48,740
people dump all kinds of chemicals
to make them look pretty. Personally,

1704
01:45:48,741 --> 01:45:53,150
I prefer a clean water over a pretty
long, uh, overrated. The overnight,

1705
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:57,920
the other night, and decided to have a
nice wink and crash out for the night.

1706
01:45:58,490 --> 01:46:02,330
So I hop on the generic porn site and
started browsing. Next thing I know,

1707
01:46:02,331 --> 01:46:05,270
two hours have passed. I was
still awake, hadn't banked,

1708
01:46:05,271 --> 01:46:09,140
and barely even had a Fleetwood Mac,
soft rock,

1709
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:14,270
half Chubb, et Cetera. Uh, I
didn't even watch a full video,

1710
01:46:14,271 --> 01:46:17,630
which I think no one really does
total fucking waste. Instead,

1711
01:46:17,631 --> 01:46:21,200
I just use the girl's section of a
Hurley catalog I had laying around,

1712
01:46:21,201 --> 01:46:25,400
which worked pretty well, just
so we all know. All right.

1713
01:46:25,401 --> 01:46:28,430
Underrated the paper.
Grocery bags,

1714
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:30,890
plastic bags are given to you by default.

1715
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:35,030
And all the grocery stores I've been to,
they should give you paper,

1716
01:46:35,090 --> 01:46:38,990
and if you want plastic, he should
have to ask for it. Uh, all right.

1717
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:42,980
This ends the, uh, comedy,

1718
01:46:43,150 --> 01:46:45,920
the Monday first Monday morning podcast,
comedy timeout.

1719
01:46:47,060 --> 01:46:51,990
And I feel lucky because I did
not get ejected from the hotel.

1720
01:46:52,850 --> 01:46:55,890
Um, that's it. I hope you enjoyed
this weird ass fucking podcast.

1721
01:46:56,040 --> 01:47:00,330
This podcast was like a nirvana song
started off loud. Then it got quiet,

1722
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:05,190
but never got loud again. Um, so I
guess it isn't, it's like the first

1723
01:47:07,070 --> 01:47:09,780
don't feel shut the fuck up. All right.
Go fuck yourselves. That's the podcast.

1724
01:47:09,781 --> 01:47:10,614
See Ya.

1725
01:47:49,890 --> 01:47:50,723
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1726
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:33,513
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1727
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:47,920
