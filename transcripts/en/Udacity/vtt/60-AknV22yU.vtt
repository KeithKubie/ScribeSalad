00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.430
Let's take a look at what
the Analytics Dashboard reveals

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.510
about the path that users
take to buy products.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.870
You go to the Shopping Behavior page and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.380
you should now see some
sessions with transactions.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.540
Now let's look at the checkout behavior.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.840
So this screen shows the sessions where
users got as far as the checkout step.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.180
So we had seven sessions where
they started checkout and

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.720
two sessions that ended
in a transaction.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.480
We'll look more into how you
can track users' progress

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.600
through the checkout
process in a minute.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.410
Now let's look at
the Product Performance Screen.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.700
Earlier, you saw that this screen shows
all the products that have been included

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.210
in analytics hits.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.379
But up until now, there was zero
revenue associated with any of them.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.280
But you expect that to change now
that some actual sales have occurred.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.290
Oh and it has $15.00 for dinner.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.720
So here we see the revenue for

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.300
the products that were included
in the purchase actions.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.760
You can drill down into
the products to get more details.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.960
So we see that these three
dinners here got bought.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.630
There's money associated with them.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.180
And these other dinners
did not get bought.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.640
So again you can set
a secondary dimension,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.650
if you want to see the labels for the
products: Ecommerce &gt; Product Variant.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.780
And now I can see which dinners
were the ones that got bought.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.370
So the product SKU, also pronounced
skew, is the ID for the product.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.650
SKU is a stock keeping unit.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.430
It's something that retailers
use to uniquely identify

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.930
each product they sell.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.600
So here it's called product SKU,
but here in the code,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.600
we talk about the product ID,
but actually it's just the ID.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.500
The method that sets it is setId.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.360
You can drill down into the Products.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.085
I didn't set any coupon code or
affiliations.

00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:59.705
But you can see that this is where
they would show up if you'd set them.

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:03.115
You can also see other kinds of
information, such as the quantity that

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:07.123
got added to the cart, and the quantity
that got removed from the cart.

00:02:07.123 --> 00:02:08.335
And, of course, for

00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:12.395
a remove cart hit to be registered,
you'd actually have to write the code to

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:16.715
send that hit in the method that
implemented the remove from cart action.
