00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.450
So we talked about security planing sort
of, consist of many different parts,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.530
the last one was we
talked about controls.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.160
Next, we talk what we call
a security policy that you have.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.800
Who talking daily about
enterprise security policy.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.690
You could have policies at national
level or something like that.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.600
Federal government may have one
across its different agencies, and

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.570
each agency may have its own and things
like that, but if you think about this

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.370
in the context of an enterprise,
security planning requires that you have

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.700
some sort of a security policy,
what exactly is a security policy.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.450
A security policy really sort
of at the high level articulate,

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.850
what are the security objectives are?

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.470
What is that want to?

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.270
What goals do we have?

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.752
We want to maintain confidentiality.

00:00:48.752 --> 00:00:51.970
We want to make sure that
sensitive is not disclosed

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.060
to parties not authorized to see it.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.620
We want our systems to be available.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.900
We don't want our data to be corrupted.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.340
We don't want sensitive
data to get into the hands.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.430
We want to be legally compliant or
whatever.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.220
Cause you can think of all the kind of
security objectives somebody might have.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.920
Which actually motivate
what a policy is.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.230
So often this high level articulation
requires it would include

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.310
some sort of a legal, business and
regulatory rationale for

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.610
why the policy has what it does.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.980
While legal and regulatory you
don't really have lot of choice.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.370
Business, reasons tell you why it's good
for the enterprise or for the company.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.470
And what's good for the company,
of course, is good for its employees.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.620
So that's the articulation of
the outlined reasons why we want to

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.020
have the kind of policy that we do.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.090
So the policy is really what you
should do and what should not be done.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.070
So we talked about passwords,
for example.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.830
What kind of password you should choose,
what the size and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.300
length of your password,
things like that.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.540
We may have web and
email policy, for example,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.260
can use surf the web
while you're at work.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.800
The policy actually might say, if
something were to go wrong there is some

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.580
security event that occurs, what sort of
response is that we're going to have.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.930
Do you need,
if your machine gets compromised.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.300
Do you had informed somebody for
example.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.680
The security policy or
the dos and don'ts, and

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.470
we saw some examples of those, of course
they may have to do with prevention, so

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.750
bad things don't happen.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.470
They may have to do with detection, so
compromise how you find out that there

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.430
was a breach may have to do with how
we respond to that sort of a thing and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.320
how remediation occurs, and of course
it must address the concerns and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.650
impact and
that could any of these things have.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.050
So rationale, articulation of why things
need to be the way the policy says

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.600
they should be and if it doesn't sort
of address the concerns and needs and

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.100
impact it may have on users of course
the policy may not be well accepted.
