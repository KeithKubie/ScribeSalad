00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.600
So now that you've learned about pacing
your game and making it challenging.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.710
But not too challenging by
adding goals and obstacles.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.870
What else can we do to keep
our players interested?

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.570
&gt;&gt; I know I'm getting a lot better
playing our bouncing game by myself but

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.500
I wish there was some way I could
know exactly how good I am.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
It would be great to see how we rank

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.080
against other players.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.840
Let's play against each other and
add some competition.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.020
&gt;&gt; All right, when players compete and
have a chance to win or set a record,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.910
they have even more motivation to
keep coming back to your game.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.770
Let's see some different ways that
game apps create competition.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.240
&gt;&gt; One simple way to create some
friendly competition in your app

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.260
is to add a leader board which lists
the players with the highest scores or

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.380
achievements.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.940
Like in the game Temple Run,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.040
it let's players share their rank with
one another and let's you keep track

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.270
of the highest scores over the current
day, the week, and over all time.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.060
Another good way to include
competition is with personal ratings

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.350
like the star rating in Angry Birds,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.640
which is an example of
a personal player achievement.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.680
It gives players a number of stars,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.110
one out of three,
based on how well they beat the level.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.120
This gives them an idea of how
skilled they are at the game.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.460
And if they think they can do better,
they'll play the game for a longer time.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.310
And the more time players
spend in your game,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.990
the more money it will
eventually be able to make.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.950
Another way to get players to
keep coming back to your game

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.740
is to offer them special timed awards.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.240
Really cool items or mystery stages
during a specific time window.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.810
This is also a great strategy for

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.610
getting players who may have
left your game to come back.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.910
By offering a special stage or award you
keep your game exciting and interesting.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.730
For example, puzzle and
dragons have urgent dungeons that can

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.710
only be played on a specific day or
within a limited timeframe,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.080
like this dungeon can only
be played on a Thursday.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.240
Other games have daily or
weekly challenges.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.610
And these special timed events, combined
with leaderboards and achievements,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.850
create exciting competition between
members of the gaming community.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120
And are all great ways to
keep players involved.
