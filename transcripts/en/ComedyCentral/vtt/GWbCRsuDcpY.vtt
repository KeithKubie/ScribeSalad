Joking aside,

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:05.638
I was doing a play
many years ago in New York,

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.673
and, um, I came home
one night after the show.

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:10.576
And there was a letter
in my apartment building

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:12.812
from the Four Seasons Hotel.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.681
And I read it, and it was
one of the most thoughtful,

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:19.185
articulate letters
I got about this whole play.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.387
And it was signed
"Bruce Willis."

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.489
And I immediately called
my friend Stewart and said,

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.925
"Fuck you.
It's a wind-up."

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.593
And, uh, he said, "I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.128
So, I called Bruce.

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.463
I said, "Did you really
write me this letter?"

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:32.465
He said, "Yeah."

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:38.604
So we had a beer, and, um,
he says, essentially,

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:40.540
"You're doing the kind of work
I want to be a part of,

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.976
and whatever you're doing,
if you can put me in the mix,

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.279
I'm in, sight unseen."

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:50.917
And, um, I didn't think
that would really stick.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.985
And many years later,

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:56.756
when I wanted to make my own
film, real passion project --

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.758
it's hard to get
those things done --

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.426
he was the first person
I called.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:04.430
And he said, "I told ya,
if you ever need me, I'm in."

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:06.833
And, uh, we just made
this movie together

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.334
and had a beautiful time.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.237
And I wouldn't have gotten it
made with you.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.540
Uh, and I'm really
deeply grateful for that.

00:01:14.573 --> 00:01:16.375
Um, I love you.

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:18.044
Or maybe I'm very a good actor

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.345
and I'm just acting
when I say that.

00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:20.546
You would...

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:22.748
[ Laughter,
cheers and applause ]

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:23.850
Yeah!

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:26.686
Um...

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.023
You wouldn't know
the difference,

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:32.925
and that's the reason
I love you.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.228
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.630
Oh, buddy.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.198
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:40.299
Thank you.

00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:41.668
Fantastic.
