BEFORE YOU ASK YOUR QUESTION.
NOW I WANT TO GO OFF SCRIPT FOR

00:09:31.577 --> 00:09:37.619
JUST TWO MINUTES.
THE FIRST THING IS, I JUST SAW

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.066
THE WONDERFUL PBS DOCUMENTARY 
ABOUT THE LIFE OF CONGRESSMAN

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:46.241
LEWIS.
IT'S REALLY UNBELIEVABLE.  ONE

00:09:46.242 --> 00:09:51.255
OF THE THINGS THAT HE TALKS 
ABOUT IN THE DOCUMENTARY IS THE

00:09:51.256 --> 00:09:54.655
GREAT CIVIL RIGHTS ICON ROSA 
PARKS.

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:58.446
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE, THE 
LIBRARY OF CONGRESS HAS THE ROSA

THE SECOND THING I WANT TO SAY

00:10:15.002 --> 00:10:19.388
IS THAT I WAS IN ORLANDO IN JUNE

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:24.473
WHEN CONGRESSMAN LEWIS SPOKE AT 
A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR THE

00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:29.180
VICTIMS OF THOSE KILLED IN THE 
NIGHT CLUB IN ORLANDO AND

00:10:29.196 --> 00:10:31.940
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS, I HAVE TO 
TELL YOU, IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST

00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:39.422
HEARD AND I JUST WANT TO THANK 
YOU FOR ALL YOU DO AND I'M JUST

00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:41.626

WHAT DOES THE RECOGNITION OF 
THIS WORK RECEIVED MEAN TO YOU.

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:31.229

SPEAK ABOUT THIS BOOK, READ THE 
BOOK.

00:13:04.995 --> 00:13:09.857
TURN THE PAGES, AND JOINING IN 
THE IMAGES, IT TAKES ME BACK TO

00:13:09.858 --> 00:13:17.292
ANOTHER PART OF MY LIFE.
IN READING MARCH BOOK 1, BOOK 2,

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:24.624
ALABAMA, I THOUGHT IT WAS A 
PLACE CALLED TROY.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:34.586
SO I WILL RECEIVE THE HONOR 
ALONE -- I WON'T RECEIVE THE --

00:13:34.587 --> 00:13:40.068
I WILL RECEIVE THE 
HONOR WITHDY.

00:13:40.303 --> 00:13:42.303
IT TOOK ME BACK

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:51.483
TO RURAL ALABAMA 
IN 1956, WHEN I WAS 15 YEARS OLD

00:13:51.714 --> 00:13:55.051
OLD, WITH MY BROTHERS  AND 
COUSINS, WE WENT TO A LITTLE

00:13:55.052 --> 00:13:59.546
LIBRARY TO TRY TO GET A LIBRARY 
CARD AND CHECK OUT SOME BOOK.

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:02.220
WE WERE TOLD BY THE THE 
LIBRARIAN

00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:05.911
WAS FOR WHITES ONLY AND NOT FOR 
COLORS.

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:10.291
AND THEN GO BACK TO THE 
LIBRARIAN TO MANY, MANY YEARS.

00:14:10.292 --> 00:14:14.050
BY THIS TIME, I'M IN CONGRESS 
FOR A BOOK SIGNING.

00:14:14.719 --> 00:14:17.569
SO HUNDREDS OF BLACKS  AND WHITE

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.153
CITIZENS SHOWED UP AND AFTER THE

00:14:20.154 --> 00:14:28.268
BOOK SIGNING, AFTER WE HAD SOME 
REFRESHMENTS, AND TO WORK WITH

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:31.871

00:14:50.226 --> 00:14:52.907
MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR, AT A TABLE,

00:14:52.908 --> 00:14:59.317
A DESK AND READ THE BOOK, AND AS
 AS

00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:02.130
I TRAVEL AROUND AMERICA, 
DIFFERENT PLACES, PEOPLE COME UP

00:15:09.552 --> 00:15:13.152
SIGNED FOR MY 
BROTHERS, ANEW NIECES, ANEW

00:15:13.153 --> 00:15:14.386
NEPHEWS, WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD

00:15:14.387 --> 00:15:16.294
THING.
WE ALL SHOULD READ.

00:15:16.295 --> 00:15:21.123
BOOKS ARE POWERFUL.
THEY CAN TAKE US PLACES THAT WE

00:15:21.124 --> 00:15:24.702

KOJO NNAMDI:  I'M GLAD YOU

00:15:24.703 --> 00:15:28.145
FINALLY GOT YOUR LIBRARY CARD.
BEFORE WE GET TO THE THIRD BOOK

00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:29.926
IN THE SERIES.
LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:15:29.927 --> 00:15:35.073
WHY THIS PROJECT TOOK THE SHAPE 
IT DID AND THE GRAPHIC NOVEL.

00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:39.970
IT HAS TIE TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS 
NEWMENT.

00:15:40.214 --> 00:15:43.898
WHEN DID YOU FIRST ENCOUNTER A 
COMIC THAT SPOKE TO THE CIVIL

00:15:43.899 --> 00:15:49.972
RIGHTS MOVEMENT?
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  IN LATE 1957

00:15:53.315 --> 00:15:57.781
BOOK CALLED MARTIN LUTHER KING, 
JR.  AND THE MONTGOMERY STORY.

00:15:57.782 --> 00:16:01.427
IT SOLD FOR 10-CENTS AND ANDREW 
WILL TELL YOU, THROUGH HIS

00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:08.811
RESEARCH, HE DISCOVERED THAT DR.
 KING HAD EDITED THIS BOOK.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.434
THIS BOOK BECAME LIKE A ROAD MAP

00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:14.873
FOR THOSE OF US WHO GOT INVOLVED

00:16:14.874 --> 00:16:18.381
IN THE AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS 
MOVEMENT.

00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:22.218
IT TOLD THE STORY OF MONTGOMERY.
IT SPOKE ABOUT THE WAY OF PEACE,

00:16:25.576 --> 00:16:33.282
OF NONVIOLENCE, HOW PEOPLE 
ORGANIZE, HOW PEOPLE WORKED,

00:16:33.283 --> 00:16:35.283
SHARED

00:16:37.201 --> 00:16:41.862
RISE AND CAUSE, RODE IN 
SEGREGATED BUSES IN MONTH

00:16:41.863 --> 00:16:45.857
GENTLEMAN G.O.P. RYAND 
MONTGOMERYIES DURING THE 50'S,

00:16:45.858 --> 00:16:49.328
BLACK AND WHITE PEOPLE COULDN'T 
BE SEATED TOGETHER ON A CITY BUS

00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:53.251
BUS.
EVEN HERE IN WASHINGTON D.C. IN

00:16:53.252 --> 00:16:59.379
1961, DURING THE FREEDOM RISE, 
BLACK PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.409
COULDN'T BE SEATED TOGETHER, 
LEAVING WASHINGTON, TO TRAVEL

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.955
THROUGH VIRGINIA, GA G ALABAMA, 
MISS.

00:17:08.511 --> 00:17:16.863
SO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, 
WHETHER THE BUSES HAD BEEN A

00:17:16.864 --> 00:17:21.987
MEANS OF CARRYING THE STORY OF 
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

00:17:23.321 --> 00:17:28.372
YOU HAD TO BRING DOWN THOSE 
SIGNS.

00:17:30.267 --> 00:17:35.761
WHITE MEP, COLORED MEN.
WHITE WOMEN, COLORED WOMEN.

00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:38.351
TODAY, GROWING UP, YOU WON'T SEE

00:17:38.352 --> 00:17:43.826
THOSE BUS ON -- YOU WON'T SEE 
THOSE

00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:47.202
SIGNS  ON A BUS TODAY, THE ONLY 
WAY YOU WOULD SEE SEE THOSE

00:17:47.203 --> 00:17:52.607
SIGNS TODAY IS IN A BOOK, A 
MUSEUM OR IN A VIDEO THEY'RE

00:17:52.608 --> 00:17:57.365
GONE AND IT'S MY HOPE THEY WILL 
NEVER EVER RETURN.

00:17:57.383 --> 00:18:00.535
KOJO NNAMDI:  DESPITE THE FACT 
THAT THE CONGRESSMAN ENCOUNTERED

00:18:04.275 --> 00:18:07.856
MARTIN LUTHER KING WHEN HE WAS 
JUST 17 YEARS OLD, YOU STILL HAD

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:13.730
CONVINCING YOUR COLLEAGUES AND 
OKAY THE CONGRESSMAN HIMSELF TO

00:18:13.731 --> 00:18:17.563
WRITE A GRAPHIC NOVEL.
WHY DID YOU THINK THIS WAS THE

00:18:17.564 --> 00:18:26.270
RIGHT FORMAT FOR THIS PROJECT??
&gt;&gt; I GREW UP IN ATLANTA, THE

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.285
CONGRESSMAN HAS BEEN THE 
CONGRESSMAN SINCE I WAS THREE

00:18:28.286 --> 00:18:30.156
YEARS OLD.
YOU WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL AND I

00:18:30.157 --> 00:18:32.940
FELT HEARD THE STORY OF THE 
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT OVER AND

00:18:32.941 --> 00:18:36.245
OVER AGAIN.
I HEARD IT IN DOCUMENTARIES, IN

00:18:36.246 --> 00:18:37.990
BOOK, I HEARD PEOPLE TELL THE 
STORY.

00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:40.347
BUT TO ME, I HAD GROWNUP READING

00:18:40.348 --> 00:18:42.484
COMICS.  IT'S SORT OF MY 
SALVATION.

00:18:43.447 --> 00:18:46.801
MY REFUGE.
MY FATHER LEFT WHEN I WAS FOUR,

00:18:46.802 --> 00:18:47.996
FIVE YEARS OLD AND IT WAS WHERE 
I TURNED.

00:18:47.997 --> 00:18:51.779
I WANTED STORIES OF HEROS WHO 
WANTED JUSTICE BECAUSE IT WAS

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.166
THE RIGHT THING TO DO

00:18:58.077 --> 00:19:00.980

00:19:06.588 --> 00:19:08.588
SWEEPING THROUGHOUT DEMOCRATIC 
PRIMARIES.

00:19:08.806 --> 00:19:14.106
PEOPLE IN POLITICS WERE RE
REEVALUATING THE WAY THEY COULD

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:16.633
COMMUNICATE.
WITH YOUNG PEOPLE, WHETHER IT

00:19:16.634 --> 00:19:20.121
WAS THE INTERNET, THE VISUAL 
LITERACY THAT COMES WITH THAT.

00:19:20.122 --> 00:19:23.896
OR HOW WE TALK TO PEOPLE.
WHAT WE'RE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT

00:19:24.146 --> 00:19:26.158
ABOUT.
SO AS IT CAME DOWN TO THE END OF

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.203
ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING AND THE

00:19:30.204 --> 00:19:31.306
MONTH GENTLEMAN G.O.P. FREE 
STORY.

00:19:31.307 --> 00:19:37.108
HERE, I HAD SPENT THE WHOLE 
SUMMER TELLING JOHN LEWIS

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:41.557
TELLING STORIES OF THE YOUNG 
PEOPLE, WHICH WAS SO MUCH

00:19:41.573 --> 00:19:44.261
DIFFERENT NOT THAT STORY I HAD 
ALWAYS BEEN TOLD.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.416
AT THE SAME TIME.
THE CONGRESSMAN WAS TELLING ME

00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:52.156
THAT HE READ A COMIC BOOK WHEN 
HE THOUGHT ABOUT JOINING THE

00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:55.476
MOVEMENT.
THE 24-YEAR-OLD NERD JUST KIND

00:19:55.477 --> 00:20:01.170
OF EXPLODE, AND IT FELT LIKE IT 
WAS OKAY TO BE ME.

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:09.818
MAYBE IT WAS ALL THE OTHER 
PEOPLE WHO PUT THEM DOWN WHO

00:20:09.819 --> 00:20:12.487
WERE WRONG.
SO WHEN I STARTED THINKING, YOU

00:20:12.488 --> 00:20:18.133
KNOW, THERE SHOULD BE A COMIC 
BOOK ABOUT JOHN LEWIS'S LIFE, IT

00:20:21.808 --> 00:20:24.934
SUMMER, WHAT I HAD WITNESSED 
FIRSTHAND.  AND HEARING JOHN

00:20:24.935 --> 00:20:26.513
LEWIS TELL THE STORY, SEEING HIM

00:20:26.514 --> 00:20:31.888
ACT IT OUT, SEEING HIM IN FRONT 
OF YOU, THAT WAS A BIG PART OF

00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:34.974
IT FOR ME, SO TRYING TO FIND A 
WAY TO CAPTURE THAT EXPERIENCE

00:20:34.975 --> 00:20:36.966
AND PUT IT DOWN ON PAPER, WORLDS

00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:41.169
ALONE COULD NOT DO IT THE 
JUSTICE THAT IT NEEDED.

00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:52.283
KOJO NNAMDI UPON:  WHAT DO YOU 
MAKE OF THE SHIFT OF PERCEPTION

00:20:52.284 --> 00:20:54.284
THAT THE 
GRAPHIC

00:20:58.418 --> 00:21:00.510
NOVEL.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I THINK "MARCH" IS

00:21:00.511 --> 00:21:04.004
PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER 
STRONGER THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

00:21:04.214 --> 00:21:07.705
I DON'T THINK WE SET OUT TO DO 
THAT, PER SE.

00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:16.971
WE SET OUT TO TELL JOHN LEWIS'S 
STORY, TO REACH IT MORE PEOPLE

00:21:16.972 --> 00:21:18.878
THAN HAD EVER BEEN REACHED BY 
THIS STORY.

00:21:18.879 --> 00:21:21.329
COMICS ARE COMING OF AGE BECAUSE

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.807
OF THE INTERNET.
LIKE ALL OF YA'LL, YA'LL ARE

00:21:25.808 --> 00:21:30.622
DYNEL TILL NATIVES.
YOU GREW UP ON THE INTERNET.

00:21:30.866 --> 00:21:33.713
YOU COMMUNICATE THROUGH MEANS.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.046
YOU HAVE BOLD CONVERSATIONS  
WITH SUCCESS KIDS, AND

00:21:40.047 --> 00:21:44.084
EVERYTHING ELSE.
SO YEAH.

00:21:44.988 --> 00:21:50.574
AND SO FOR THIS GENERATION.
COMIC SYSTEM THEIR NATURAL

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:52.575
LANGUAGE.  IT IS GRAPHIC 
NARRATIVE.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.093
IT IS SEQUENTIAL STORY TELLING.
IT'S SIMPLY HOW THIS GENERATION

00:21:57.094 --> 00:21:59.987
SPEAKS TO EACH OTHER.
AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME,

00:21:59.988 --> 00:22:06.334
WHAT WE'RE MOST FORTUNATE ABOUT 
IS IT'S JOHN LEWIS'S STORY THAT

00:22:06.335 --> 00:22:08.581
BROKE DOWN THAT BARRIER, IT WAS 
RIGHT THERE WHEN IT NEEDED TO BE

00:22:09.268 --> 00:22:11.893
AS OPPOSED TO, WE COULD ALL BE 
CELEBRATED

00:22:11.894 --> 00:22:16.860
CELEBRATING THE, I DON'T KNOW, 
THE GREAT PUPPY WARS OR

00:22:16.861 --> 00:22:20.907
SOMETHING, THAT REALLY WOULDN'T 
RESIDE NATE THIS WITH THE WAY

00:22:20.908 --> 00:22:26.402
JOHN LEWIS'STORY DOES.
SO I THINK IT WAS A COMBINATION

00:22:26.403 --> 00:22:27.580
OF BEING JUST A LITTLE BIT AHEAD

00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:31.611
OF OUR TIME AND BEING AT THE 
RIGHT PLACE FOR THIS GENERATION,

00:22:36.398 --> 00:22:40.898
KOJO NNAMDI:  CONGRESSMAN LEWIS 
D IT TAKE A LOT OF CONVINCING TO

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.091
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  LIKE ANDREW 
SAID, IT TOOK A LITTLE TIME B.

00:22:48.092 --> 00:22:53.321
HE DIDN'T GIVE UP.
HE JUST SAID CONGRESSMAN, JUST

00:22:53.322 --> 00:22:55.698
WRITE A COMIC BOOK.  I SAID OH.
MAYBE.

00:22:56.048 --> 00:22:58.201
CAME BACK AGAIN

00:23:06.439 --> 00:23:08.695
CAME BACK AGAIN.

00:23:13.904 --> 00:23:18.557
AND THE REST IS HISTORY.
KOJO NNAMDI:  INDEED AIR, MARK

00:23:18.558 --> 00:23:22.944
OF HISTORY.
THIS TRAILOLOGY BEGAN ON THE EVE

00:23:24.286 --> 00:23:26.815
INAUGURATION.
A REFLECTION OF THE WORK YOU

00:23:26.816 --> 00:23:30.003
WERE DOING ON CIVIL RIGHTS 
MOVEMENT.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:32.571
AND ARE WE IN A PERIOD NOW WHERE

00:23:32.572 --> 00:23:39.658
WE'RE SEEING THAT THERE'S MORE 
WORK TO BE DONE?

00:23:39.673 --> 00:23:41.673
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  L

00:23:44.169 --> 00:23:48.002
... L I THINK 
WE ARE FOR A MEETING WE ARE

00:23:48.003 --> 00:23:51.463
ENTERING IN DISCUSSION.
BUT I THINK IN AMERICA TODAY,

00:23:51.464 --> 00:23:54.512
RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE SAYING 
WHERE ARE WE GOING AS A NATION

00:23:54.513 --> 00:23:57.451
AND AS A PEOPLE?
ARE WE GOING BACKWARD?

00:23:57.471 --> 00:24:03.601
ARE WE GOING TO STAND STILL OR 
ARE WE GOING TO GO FORWARD?

00:24:03.622 --> 00:24:08.679
I THINK "MARCH" TELLS US ALL 
THAT, WE HAVE COME A DISTANCE,

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.315
WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS, 
BUT THERE ARE FORCING THAT WANT

00:24:12.316 --> 00:24:18.446
TO SLOW US DOWN OR TAKE US BACK.
AND WE WOULD LIKE FOR PEOPLE TO

00:24:18.447 --> 00:24:21.378
BE HOPEFUL, TO BE OPTIMISTIC AND

00:24:21.379 --> 00:24:23.416
TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE ONE 
PEOPLE.

00:24:23.644 --> 00:24:27.979
THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER 
WE ARE BLACK, WHITE, LATINO,

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:31.214
ASIAN-AMERICAN OR NATIVE-
NATIVE-AMERICAN.

00:24:31.446 --> 00:24:34.525
WE ALL LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE

00:24:40.742 --> 00:24:43.511
WORLD FEDERATION HOUSE.
A. PHILIP RANDOLPH WE SPEAK

00:24:43.512 --> 00:24:47.655
ABOUT BECAUSE HE WAS THE MAN 
THAT CALLED TOGETHER THE MARCH

00:24:47.656 --> 00:24:51.958
ON WALK WALK AND HE USED  TO SAY

00:24:51.959 --> 00:24:54.729
FROM TIME TO TIME MAYBE OUR FORE
FOREMOTHERS  AND FOREFATHERS ALL

00:24:57.879 --> 00:25:00.073
DIFFERENT SHIPS.
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT NOW.

00:25:00.074 --> 00:25:02.825
WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH 
OTHER AND HELP EACH OTHER.

00:25:03.481 --> 00:25:09.119
AND DR. KING SAID ON ONE 
OCCASION, AND HE SAID IT SO

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.506
BEAUTIFULLY, THAT WE MUST LEARN 
TO LIVE TOGETHER

00:25:16.632 --> 00:25:18.170
AS ONE FAMILY, 
AS ONE PEOPLE.

00:25:18.171 --> 00:25:21.642
IF NOT, WE WOULD PERISH AS FOOLS
FOOLS.

00:25:23.656 --> 00:25:30.877
AND I THINK THIS IS THE MESSAGE 
THAT WE TRY TO CONVEY IN MARCH

00:25:30.878 --> 00:25:33.068
THAT IT'S BETTER TO LOVE

00:25:36.386 --> 00:25:38.003
IT'S 
BETTER TO ABIDE BY THE

00:25:38.004 --> 00:25:40.888
PRINCIPLES AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF

00:25:40.889 --> 00:25:46.356
NONVIOLENCE AND NEVER HATE, FOR 
HATE IS TOO HEAVY A BURDEN TO

00:25:46.357 --> 00:25:48.357
BEAR

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.942
.
KOJO NNAMDI:  A. PHILIP RANDOLPH

00:25:55.187 --> 00:26:00.493
HE CALLED THE MARCH ON 
WASHINGTON TOGETHER IN 1963.

00:26:00.727 --> 00:26:03.710
ANDREW AYDIN, AS YOU WERE GOING 
THROUGH THIS PROCESS WITH THE

00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:07.302
KONGMAN T GAVE YOU NOT ONLY A 
PERSPECTIVE ON HIS LIFE, BUT DID

00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:13.744
PERSPECTIVE ON HISTORY, THAT 
ALLOWS YOU TO BETTER INTERPRET

00:26:13.745 --> 00:26:17.884
THE PRESENT?
ANDREW AYDIN:  ABSOLUTELY.

00:26:18.809 --> 00:26:22.727
WHEN WE FIRST DEBUTED BOOK 1, WE

00:26:22.728 --> 00:26:26.203
WENT TO SAN DIEGO COMICON, WHICH

00:26:26.204 --> 00:26:29.576
IS MORE OF MY PEOPLE.
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:29.595 --> 00:26:33.624
AND SO WE START OFF, YOU GIVE A 
LITTLE SPEECH ABOUT

00:26:36.738 --> 00:26:38.854
YOU KNOW, 
THIS IS WHAT MY BOOK IS CALLED.

00:26:38.855 --> 00:26:47.680
I ASKED HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER 
WATCHED "BATTLESTAR GALACTICA"

00:26:47.681 --> 00:26:49.833
ALMOST EVERY PERSON'S HAND WENT 
UP IN THE ROOM.

00:26:50.292 --> 00:26:53.228
I SAID YOU'LL REMEMBER.  ALL OF 
THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE AND ALL

00:26:57.035 --> 00:26:59.812
.
THIS IS BEFORE FERGUSON.

00:27:00.035 --> 00:27:02.378
BEFORE ERIC GARNER, BEFORE THE 
ELECTION.

00:27:02.512 --> 00:27:05.724
THIS WAS AT A TIME THAT I THINK 
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO

00:27:05.725 --> 00:27:13.415
BE QUIET FOR A KYLE.
BUTT MORE YOU UNDERSTAND ABOUT

00:27:13.416 --> 00:27:16.946
JOHN LEWIS'S STORY AND HOW MANY 
OF OUR POLITICS TODAY ARE A

00:27:16.947 --> 00:27:17.830
DIRECT RESULT FROM FORCES TRYING

00:27:17.831 --> 00:27:25.540
TO OPPOSE THE PROGRESS THAT HE 
MADE, THE MORE IT SEEMED LIKE AN

00:27:28.693 --> 00:27:34.933
AND AT THE SAME TIME, I HOPE WE 
CONVEYED THE OPTIMISM THAT THE

00:27:34.934 --> 00:27:39.313
ACTIVISTS TODAY NEED, THAT THE 
YOUNG PEOPLE, THEY NEED.

00:27:39.874 --> 00:27:42.366
I OFTEN ASK THE QUESTION OR POSE

00:27:42.367 --> 00:27:48.170
IT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SCLC STILL
STILL, WE HAVE THE N.A.A.C.P.

00:27:48.171 --> 00:27:50.627
STILL.
WE HAVE THE URBAN LEAGUE STILL.

00:27:50.628 --> 00:27:54.457
WHAT WE DON'T HAVE IS A STUDENT 
NONVIOLENCE COORDINATING

00:27:54.458 --> 00:27:56.750
COMMITTEE.
WE DON'T HAVE AN ORGANIZATION,

00:27:56.751 --> 00:28:01.155
DEDICATED TO YOUNG PEOPLE OF 
DIRECT ACTION, THAT IS

00:28:01.156 --> 00:28:02.053
COMPLETELY STAFFED AND ORGANIZE
ORGANIZED

00:28:02.054 --> 00:28:08.445
AND RUN BY YOUNG PEOPLE.
AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN

00:28:08.446 --> 00:28:12.600
THAT SORT OF CONTEXT TODAY, 
HISTORY IS YOUR GUIDE.

00:28:15.637 --> 00:28:18.692
KOJO NNAMDI:  WHAT STOOD OUT TO 
YOU THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T KNOW

00:28:18.693 --> 00:28:20.712
ABOUT BEFORE?

00:28:24.327 --> 00:28:26.549
MANY PEOPLE I KNOW ARE FROM THE 
CARIBBEAN.

00:28:28.478 --> 00:28:33.172
WHAT I (INAUDIBLE) NAMED ALEX
ALEXER

00:28:33.173 --> 00:28:37.874
AND LUGEY, TURNED OUT WAS FROM 
ANTERGIA WEST INDIES

00:28:40.955 --> 00:28:45.620
FROMMAN ANTIGA WEST INDIES.
DID YOU HAVE THOSE KINDS OF

00:28:45.621 --> 00:28:47.308
EXPERIENCES  IN WHO STOOD OUT TO

00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:49.984
YOU, ANDREW THAT YOU DONE KNOW 
ABOUT BEFORE?

00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:51.118
ANDREW AYDIN:  THERE ARE SO MANY

00:28:51.119 --> 00:28:56.812
OF THEM N. NASHVILLE, I HAD NO 
IDEA IDEA ABOUT WILL CAMPBELL

00:28:56.813 --> 00:28:59.594
ORACLEY SMITH.
JEN LAWSON, OFF THE BAT, I'VE

00:28:59.595 --> 00:29:02.503
HEARD ABOUT HIM AND THE 
CONGRESSMAN HAS SPOKEN ABOUT HIM

00:29:03.495 --> 00:29:09.402
HIM, BUT THE EXTENT OF REVEREND 
LAWSON'S ROLE IN THE CIVIL

00:29:09.403 --> 00:29:14.948
RIGHTS MOVEMENT HAS BEEN LOST 
AND I HOPE WE RESURRECTED HIS

00:29:14.949 --> 00:29:15.859
CONTRIBUTION.
IT IS SO POWERFUL.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:22.717
HE MAY BE THE MOST INFLUENTIAL 
ON THE MOVEMENT BEHIND MARTIN

00:29:22.718 --> 00:29:24.718
LUTHER KING

00:29:27.798 --> 00:29:29.798
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T

00:29:38.696 --> 00:29:43.867
REQUEST WHEN YOU PEOPLE DO THAT 
TODAY, IT'S HARD NOT TO SEE IF

00:29:43.868 --> 00:29:48.978
THEY WALK IN THE LEGACY OF MR. 
MR. THURMAN.

00:29:49.226 --> 00:29:53.424
I CAME TO APPRECIATE THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A. PHILIP

00:29:53.425 --> 00:29:56.619
RANDOLPH.
THREATENED THE FIRST MARCH ON

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.547
WASHINGTON IN 1941 AND MADE F FD
R

00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:04.688
BLINK AND DESEGREGATE PARTS OF 
THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX Q. IT WAS

00:30:07.236 --> 00:30:11.011
2'S RESEARCH PERIOD, I READ AN 
INTERVIEW, FROM RUSTON AND ASKED

00:30:15.037 --> 00:30:18.179
HE SAID, THERE WAS THIS MOMENT 
AT THE END OF THE MARCH ON WALK

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.461
WALK.
HE CAME BACK TO THE OFFICE AND

00:30:20.462 --> 00:30:23.862
HE SAW A. PHILIP RANDOLPH 
LOOKING AT HIS SIGN AND HE START

00:30:23.863 --> 00:30:30.095
STARTED TEASING HIM.
PIECE OF TRASH GARBAGE IS

00:30:30.096 --> 00:30:33.926
COMPLETELY CLEANED UP.
THINKING IT WAS A CELEBRATORY

00:30:33.927 --> 00:30:37.918
MOMENT.  AND RANDOLPH HAD TEARS 
STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE.  AND HE

00:30:39.907 --> 00:30:41.817
YOU.
HE SAID THAT WAS THE MOST MEAN

00:30:41.818 --> 00:30:49.262
MEANINGFUL MOMENT OF HIS LIFE 
AND HERE IT IS, BURPYIED IN AY

00:30:49.263 --> 00:30:51.554
BURP BURIED IN A 
TEXT BOOK SOMEWHERE.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:57.507
WHAT A PRIVILEDGE.
A THANK YOU THAT WAS LONG, LONG

00:30:57.508 --> 00:31:00.130
OVER DUE.
KOJO NNAMDI:  TO THE YOUNG

00:31:00.131 --> 00:31:04.608
PEOPLE HERE, WHEN YOU PASS 
THROUGH UNION STATION, THERE'S A

00:31:06.878 --> 00:31:09.743
IS THIS UNBELIEVABLE MAN WHO WAS

00:31:09.744 --> 00:31:14.452
BORN IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA, 
MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY, BECAME A

00:31:21.875 --> 00:31:26.724
THE ABILITY TO ORGANIZE AND MOVE

00:31:26.725 --> 00:31:30.422
PEOPLE AND INFLUENCE AS ANDREW 
STATED.

00:31:30.748 --> 00:31:34.884
IT WAS A. PHILIP RANDOLPH WHO 
CALLED THAT MEETING WITH

00:31:34.885 --> 00:31:37.730
PRESIDENT KENNEDY.
WE HAD THE FIST MEETING TO

00:31:37.731 --> 00:31:42.225
DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
MARCH ON WASHINGTON.

00:31:42.453 --> 00:31:48.269
YOU SPEAK ABOUT [INDISCERNIBLE] 
LUBY.

00:31:48.499 --> 00:31:51.519
AN AMAZING LAWYER.
JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:55.660
HUMAN 
BEINGS.

00:31:55.661 --> 00:31:59.570
WE WERE SITTING IN, MARCHING AS 
STUDENTS, HIS HOME WAS BOMBED

00:31:59.571 --> 00:32:01.620
EARLY ONE MORNING

00:32:07.045 --> 00:32:08.808
.
IT DESTROYED HIS HOUSE.

00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:12.657
HIS WIFE WAS KNOCKED OUT OF HER 
BED

00:32:19.728 --> 00:32:23.330
.
THE CLAN TRIED KILL HIM AND

00:32:23.331 --> 00:32:26.745
DESTROY.
WE MADE A DECISION TO MARCH WHEN

00:32:27.998 --> 00:32:32.369
LIKE 6:30 IN THE MORNING.
WE SENT A TELEGRAM TO THE MAYOR

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:33.723
OF THE CITY OF NASHVILLE, SAYING

00:32:33.724 --> 00:32:35.724

NOTWITHSTANDINGS OF YOUNG PEOPLE

COLLEGE PROFESSIONALS AND THE 
MAYOR SAID YES, I FAVOR

00:33:06.423 --> 00:33:08.423
DESEGREGATION

00:33:12.985 --> 00:33:14.274
.
KOJO NNAMDI:  THERE'S SO MUCH

00:33:14.275 --> 00:33:16.390
HISTORY PACKED IN THESE TRAIL
TRAILOLOGYIES.

00:33:16.618 --> 00:33:20.571
SO MANY NAME THAT IS JUMP OUTOUT

00:33:20.572 --> 00:33:24.240
AT YOU, ELA BAKER, JAMES FOREMAN
FOREMAN, BOB MOSES.

00:33:25.344 --> 00:33:29.758
FANNY LOU HAMER.
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ANY ONE

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:31.807
OF THOSE WHO

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:41.134
FOR OUR STUDENTS.
ANDREW AYDIN:  I'D ABOUT WITH EL

00:33:41.182 --> 00:33:44.053
ELA BAKER RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
SHE WAS THE MOTHER OF THE MOVE

00:33:44.092 --> 00:33:46.440
MOVEMENT.
AND IT'S SO PIVOTAL IN A WAY,

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:49.561
IT'S NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD TODAY 
AND I HOPE WE CONVEYED THAT AS

00:33:49.562 --> 00:33:51.800
MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
SHE'S ONE OF THOSE

00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:54.183
CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIVES YOU 
WITH THROUGH ALL THE BOOKS.

00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:59.642
SHE WAS THERE AT FOUNDING OF SNI
SNICC AND SHE WAS SHE WAS A

00:33:59.643 --> 00:34:03.202
KEYNOTE SPEAKER AT THEIR POLITIC
POLITICAL CONVENTION.

00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:05.101
SHE WAS SO IMPORTANT AND I THINK

00:34:05.102 --> 00:34:10.046
ONE OF THE GREAT TRAGEDIES OF 
THE HISTORY THAT'S BEEN TOLD

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:11.376
THUS FAR IS WOMEN'S ROLES DURING

00:34:11.377 --> 00:34:14.185
THE MOVEMENT HAVE BEEN MARGINAL
MARGINALIZEED AND I THINK FOR US

00:34:14.731 --> 00:34:16.556
, 
IT WAS SO IMPORTANT TO CORRECT

00:34:16.557 --> 00:34:19.227
THAT, TO SHOW

00:34:27.914 --> 00:34:29.657
EVERYONE WHO 
PARTICIPATED, THEY WERE OFTEN SO

00:34:31.431 --> 00:34:33.720
THEY DIDN'T PUSH TO BE THE ONE 
TO BE IN THE PHOTOGRAPH.

00:34:33.803 --> 00:34:38.626
THEY PUSHED TO BE THE ONE WHO 
DID THE WORK, WHO WHO ACHIEVED

00:34:38.627 --> 00:34:44.512
THE HARDEST PART.
KOJO NNAMDI:  WHEN I FIRST CAME

00:34:44.513 --> 00:34:47.344
TO WASHINGTON.
AMONG MY MONTH ORS ARE THOSE WHO

00:34:48.792 --> 00:34:53.400
I KNEW ALL OF THEIR NAMES, 
DIDN'T QUITE KNOW THE DETAILS OF

00:34:56.875 --> 00:34:58.790
THE TRILL SCREE HELP MEAD 
UNDERSTAND.

00:34:58.791 --> 00:35:02.272
WHY THEY REVERED BOB MOWSAN SO 
MUCH.

00:35:02.482 --> 00:35:07.729
BUT YOU TWO WORKED  WITH NATE 
POWERS.

00:35:07.862 --> 00:35:11.856
HIS IMAGES ARE VIVID AND 
SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO LOOK AT.

00:35:11.857 --> 00:35:15.651
WAS IT DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO LOOK

00:35:15.652 --> 00:35:21.403
BACK AT THOSE.
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  YES AND IT'S

00:35:22.758 --> 00:35:28.117
PICK UP THIS BOOK.
THIS IS BOOK 3.

00:35:28.241 --> 00:35:30.824
BOOK 1 AND BOOK 2 AND SEE SOME 
OF THE IMAGES.

00:35:31.738 --> 00:35:35.546
SOMETIMES I TEAR AND SOMETIMES I

00:35:35.547 --> 00:35:39.922
CRY.
THERE'S AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS

00:35:39.923 --> 00:35:48.016
BOOK, DEPICTING ME MARCHING AND 
I LOVE IT BECAUSE, I GUESS AS

00:35:48.017 --> 00:35:51.461
YOUNG PEOPLE AND I'M NOT THAT 
YOUNG ANYMORE, BUT I DID LOOK SO

00:35:52.341 --> 00:35:55.287
[LAUGHTER]
I HAD ALL OF MY HAIR AND I WAS A

00:36:01.585 --> 00:36:04.833
ME 
WITH MY BACK PACK, BACK IN 1985,

00:36:10.657 --> 00:36:13.602
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE 
ARRESTED AND GO TO JAIL.

00:36:13.664 --> 00:36:16.067
SO I BROUGHT A BACK PACK FROM AN

00:36:16.068 --> 00:36:24.027
ARMY SURPLUS STORE, OF ALL 
PLACES AND I WANTED TO HAVE

00:36:24.028 --> 00:36:26.028
SOMETHING TO READ WHILE I WAS

00:36:28.706 --> 00:36:31.409
IN 
JAIL:  I THOUGHT I WAS REALLY

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.380
GOING TO JAIL.
I HAD TWO BOOKS.

00:36:33.381 --> 00:36:36.669
I WANTED SOMETHING TO EAT.
I HAD AN APPLE AND AN ORANGE.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:40.054
I SAID I'M GOING TO BE IN JAIL 
WITH MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUESES

00:36:40.192 --> 00:36:43.155
COLLEAGUESES.
I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO BRUSH MY

00:36:43.156 --> 00:36:46.419
TEETH.
SO I HAD TOOTHPASTE, A

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.451
TOOTHBRUSH.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT BOOK 3 AND TURN

00:36:53.833 --> 00:36:59.525
TOLD YOU THIS.
I LOVE THAT IMAGE OF THIS STRONG

00:36:59.526 --> 00:37:05.489
STRONG, YOUNG, JOHN LEWIS 
GETTING READY TO WALK ACROSS

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:07.490
THAT BRIDGE

00:37:08.765 --> 00:37:11.378
.
KOJO NNAMDI:  AN APPLE AND AN

00:37:11.379 --> 00:37:14.137
ORANGE.
YOU KNOW, READING THESE BOOKS,

00:37:14.138 --> 00:37:18.560
ONE DISCOVERS THAT YOU OFTEN 
WENT AGAINST THE GRAIN OF WHAT

00:37:18.561 --> 00:37:20.707
OTHERS IN THE MOVEMENT MOVEMENT 
WERE

00:37:20.708 --> 00:37:23.304
DOING, SKIPPING THE SIGNING 
CEREMONY FOR THE CIVIL RIGHTS

00:37:23.305 --> 00:37:26.918
ACT.
KEEPING THE PROTEST GOING WHEN

00:37:26.919 --> 00:37:28.969
THE SO-CALLED [INDISCERNIBLE] 
ASKED YOU NOT TO.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.594
GOING AHEAD WITH THE 
AFOREMENTIONED SELMA TO

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:35.660
MONTGOMERY MARV, WHEN OTHERS 
WERE AGAINST IT.

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:39.614
AND YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS 
IDEA OF GOOD TROUBLE, ABOUT

00:37:39.615 --> 00:37:42.629
STANDING UP FOR WHAT'S RIGHT, 
EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT POPULAR.

00:37:42.865 --> 00:37:46.495
WHEN IT'S NOT EASY.
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT STRENGTH

00:37:46.496 --> 00:37:48.291
FROM?
WHAT DO YOU WANT THESE YOUNG

00:37:48.292 --> 00:37:51.477
PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT THE NOTION 
OF GOOD TROUBLE IF MAYBE JUST AS

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:57.097
YOU'RE GETTING INTO THE GOOD 
KIND OF TROUBLE AND NOT THE BAD

00:37:57.098 --> 00:38:01.133
KIND?
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  L IT'S VERY

00:38:01.134 --> 00:38:03.297
SIMPLE.
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP IN A

00:38:03.298 --> 00:38:08.995
LITTLE TOWN OF TROY, MONTGOMERY.
TROY IS ABOUT 10 MILES FROM

00:38:08.996 --> 00:38:12.016
WHERE I GREW UP.
YOU GO DOWNTOWN TROY, YOU SEE

00:38:12.017 --> 00:38:15.251
THE SIGNS THAT SAY WHITE AND 
COLORED.

00:38:15.367 --> 00:38:17.519
GO TO A MOVIE ON A SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON.

00:38:17.749 --> 00:38:22.858
ALL OF US LOOK LIKE CHILDREN.
HAD TO GO UPSTAIRS TO THE

00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:26.643
BALCONY AND ALL THE WHITE 
CHILDREN WERE DOWNSTAIRS.

00:38:26.872 --> 00:38:31.155
I WOULD COME HOME AND ASK MY 
MOTHER, MY FATHER, MY

00:38:31.156 --> 00:38:32.189
GRANDPARENTS.
WHY.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.576
WHY.
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

00:38:33.577 --> 00:38:38.112
DON'T GET IN TROUBLE.
BUT I HEARD OF ROSA PARKS WHEN I

00:38:39.477 --> 00:38:41.477
AND I MET ROSA PARKS WHEN I WAS 
17.

00:38:41.505 --> 00:38:45.490
I HEARD OF DR. KING WHEN I WAS 
15 YEARS OLD, AND I MET HIM WHEN

00:38:48.734 --> 00:38:51.576
IT CHANGED MY MIND SO I WAS 
INSPIRED TO GET INTO WHAT I CALL

00:38:53.264 --> 00:38:54.650
CALL, GOOD TROUBLE.
NECESSARY TROUBLE AND I'VE BEEN

00:38:54.651 --> 00:39:01.232
GETTING IN TROUBLE EVER SINCE.
WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT IS

00:39:01.233 --> 00:39:08.770
NOT RIGHT, NOT FAIR NOT JUST, 
YOU HAVE AN ENGAGES TO SAY --

00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:10.883
YOU HAVE AN 
OBLIGATION TO SAY SOMETHING TO,

00:39:10.884 --> 00:39:14.272
DO SOMETHING.
YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO BE SILENT.

00:39:14.273 --> 00:39:17.703
IF YOU THINK

00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:24.122
YOU ARE BEING MIS
MISTREATED, YOU HAVE TO RESIST

00:39:24.123 --> 00:39:26.791
AND SAY, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

00:39:28.833 --> 00:39:30.833
IT'S NOT JUST

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:35.288
FOR THE STUDENTS 
IN THIS ROOM WORKS LIVE IN THE

00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:41.111
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, A CITY 
THAT HAS.

00:39:41.142 --> 00:39:42.919
KOJO NNAMDI:  RESIDENTS OF WHOM,

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.186
MANY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS AS A

00:39:45.187 --> 00:39:51.923
STATE, THESE YOUNG PEOPLE MAY 
ONE DAY, DECIDE TO BE ACTIVE NOW

00:39:51.926 --> 00:39:55.766
NOW, AND EVEN MORE SO REQUEST 
THEY REACH VOTING AGE.

00:39:55.961 --> 00:40:00.471
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE VERY 
FUNDAMENT QUESTION THAT IS

00:40:00.472 --> 00:40:03.172
PERSIST?
AROUND THE ISSUE OF VOTING

00:40:03.173 --> 00:40:07.189
RIGHTS, NOT JUST AROUND THE 
DISTRICT, BUT IN A LOT OF

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.878
JURISDICTION IN THE UNITED 
STATES WHEN, IT COMES  TO

00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:14.042
ADEQUATE VOTER REPRESENTATION?
VOTING RIGHTS ACT WAS PASSED  IN

00:40:20.842 --> 00:40:24.694
ANDREW AYDIN:  YEAH, I'M A D.C. 
RESIDENT.

00:40:25.017 --> 00:40:29.315
I THINK IT'S LONG OVER DUE THAT 
WE HAVE FULL REPRESENTATION IN

00:40:29.316 --> 00:40:30.468
CONGRESS.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN

00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:34.940
LIVE IN THE CITY AND PAY TAXES 
IN THE CITY AND IT SEEMS SO

00:40:34.941 --> 00:40:38.984
OFTEN THAT THE OPPONENTS OF 
VOTING RIGHTS ARE ALSO THE

00:40:38.985 --> 00:40:40.981
PEOPLE WHO DECLARE THEIR RIGHTS,

00:40:40.982 --> 00:40:44.869
BASED ON HOW MUCH TAXES WE PAY 
AND YET, HERE WE ARE IN THE

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.983
DISTRICT AND WE PAY QUITE A 
LITTLE BIT.

00:40:47.222 --> 00:40:49.115
AND WE WENT HAVE FULL REPRESENT
REPRESENTATION.

00:40:49.116 --> 00:40:51.351
I THINK FOR CROWNING PEOPLE IN 
PARTICULAR, IT'S A TREMENDOUS

00:40:51.352 --> 00:40:53.690
OPPORTUNITY FOR CIVIL 
DISOBEDIENCE.

00:40:54.032 --> 00:40:56.067
I'M JUST SAYING.
DON'T TELL YOUR TEACHERS.

00:40:58.085 --> 00:41:00.085
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:04.175
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT,

00:41:04.176 --> 00:41:09.235
VOTING RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK.
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WHETHER

00:41:09.236 --> 00:41:12.829
IT IS FICTITIOUS CLAIM THAT 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE VOTING

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:16.687
ILLEGALLY, LET'S JUST SAY IT, 
THEY'RE NOT.

00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:19.145
OR THE ATTEMPTS TO MAKE IT 
HARDER AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR

00:41:19.146 --> 00:41:23.976
PEOPLE TO REGISTER AND VOTE.
FULL DISCLOSURE, I WORKED ON ONE

00:41:26.104 --> 00:41:28.332
AND I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND

00:41:32.019 --> 00:41:33.498
THAT 
ONLY HAS ONE VOTER PROTECTION

00:41:33.499 --> 00:41:37.436
TEAMS.  THE OTHER PARTY DOESN'T 
NEED THEM.

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.550
THEIR VOTERS DON'T HAVE ANY 
TROUBLE.

00:41:40.024 --> 00:41:44.204
AND THAT WAS PROFOUND TO ME.
THAT WE COULD CREATE A SYSTEM

00:41:44.205 --> 00:41:48.809
THAT WAS SO LOPSIDED IN ITS 
CERTAINLYIES.

00:41:52.925 --> 00:41:56.473
WHEN YOU WORK FOR JOHN LEWIS, 
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

00:41:56.703 --> 00:42:01.750
IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT 
WE WERE ALL CREATEDICALLY AND IN

00:42:03.295 --> 00:42:09.146
THE RIGHT TO VOTE AS PARTICIPATE
PARTICIPATES IN THE AMERICAN

00:42:09.147 --> 00:42:14.144
WHEN YOU WORK AGAINST THAT, YOU 
WORK AGAINST WHAT MAKES AMERICA

00:42:14.145 --> 00:42:17.621
STRONG AND WHAT HAS BROUGHT 
AMERICA TO THE FOREFRONT OF

00:42:17.622 --> 00:42:21.858
GLOBAL POWER AND IT MAKES 
AMERICA WEAK.

00:42:22.767 --> 00:42:25.955
KOJO NNAMDI:  FOR THOSE OF YOU 
IN THIS ROOM WHO MAY BE THINK

00:42:25.956 --> 00:42:27.155
WHAT YOUR RIGHTS ARE, AND SHOULD

00:42:27.156 --> 00:42:29.017
BE.
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT SITTING IN

00:42:29.018 --> 00:42:31.595
THIS ROOM IS THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL OF THE DISTRICT OF

00:42:31.596 --> 00:42:34.791
COLUMBIA.
SO WHEN THIS IS OVER, YOU SHOULD

00:42:36.903 --> 00:42:39.279
CONGRESSMAN, WOULD YOU RAISE 
YOUR HAND, PLEASE.

00:42:39.344 --> 00:42:41.344
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:47.636 --> 00:42:51.132
.
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS, WE SEE A LOT

00:42:51.133 --> 00:42:53.519
PEOPLE 
WHO WOULD LIKE TO EFFECT CHANGE

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.435
BUT THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY, THE

00:42:56.436 --> 00:42:57.528
CURRENT DIRECTION LAX LEADERSHIP

00:42:57.529 --> 00:43:00.355
AND COHESION, SOME OF THE THINGS

00:43:00.356 --> 00:43:02.864
PEOPLE SAID ABOUT IN 1960, AS I 
RECALL.

00:43:03.185 --> 00:43:05.073
WHAT IS YOUR HOPE FOR WHAT THESE

00:43:05.074 --> 00:43:09.897
BOOKS, AND FOR WHAT YOU CAN 
TEACH THIS YOUNG GENERATION OF

00:43:09.898 --> 00:43:15.471
ACTIVISTS AND PROTESTING.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: IT IS MY HOPE THESE

00:43:15.472 --> 00:43:18.838
BOOKS WOULD INSPIRE ANOTHER 
GENERATION, BUT ESPECIALLY YOUNG

00:43:24.544 --> 00:43:27.230
LESSONS OF THE MOVEMENT.
WHAT WE DID AND WHAT WE'RE

00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:32.589
TRYING TO DO AND HOW WE 
SUCCEEDED AND TO BE HOPEFUL, TO

00:43:32.590 --> 00:43:36.117
BE OPTIMISTIC AND TO NEVER GIVE 
UP.

00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:39.830
BUT HOLD ON TO YOUR DREAMS ON

00:43:44.793 --> 00:43:49.844
.
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  THESE BOOKS

00:43:49.845 --> 00:43:53.718
ARE A BLUEPRINT, A ROAD MAP.
I GOT ARRESTED A FEW TIMES.

00:43:54.047 --> 00:43:58.090
40 TIMES AND SINCE I'VE BEEN IN 
CONGRESS, ANOTHER FIVE TIMES.

00:43:58.091 --> 00:44:04.249
MY LAST ARREST, THIS YOUNG MAN, 
I LEFT SOME MONEY SOME PLACE, SO

00:44:09.939 --> 00:44:13.689
ANDREW AYDIN:  SPOTTED YOU A FEW

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:17.066
DOLLARS.
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  SPOT MEAD A

00:44:17.067 --> 00:44:21.836
FEW DOLLARS TO BE RELEASED.
THE LAST ARREST TOOK PLACE A

00:44:21.837 --> 00:44:25.370
SHORT DISTANCE FROM HERE, ON 
CAPITAL GROUNDS, 200 PEOPLE.

00:44:25.824 --> 00:44:27.862
EIGHT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WHO 
WERE TRYING TO GET THE SPEAKER

00:44:27.863 --> 00:44:32.037
OF THE HOUSE TO BRING FORTH A 
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM

00:44:36.383 --> 00:44:39.810
IF THEY HAD BROUGHT THE BILL TO 
THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE, ALMOST

00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:44.999
EVERY SINGLE MEMBER ON OUR SIDE 
WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR IT AND WE

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.709
WOULD HAVE HAD ENOUGH MEMBERS 
FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND WE WOULD

00:44:48.974 --> 00:44:50.747
AND PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WOULD

00:44:50.748 --> 00:44:59.015
HAVE SIGNED IT INTO LAW.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US TO

00:44:59.016 --> 00:45:01.016
HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

00:45:03.772 --> 00:45:03.870
, 
ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE,

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:11.897
CHILDREN LIVING IN FEAR THAT 
SOMETHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO

00:45:11.898 --> 00:45:17.144
THEM OR TO THEIR PARENTS OR 
GRAND PARENTS.

00:45:22.058 --> 00:45:26.300
WHEN THE.CAME AND SPOKE TO A 
JOINT SESSION ON CONGRESS, HE

00:45:26.301 --> 00:45:31.072
SAID WE ARE ALL IMMIGRANTS.
WE ALL COME FROM SOME OTHER

00:45:31.074 --> 00:45:33.074
PLACE

00:45:34.329 --> 00:45:38.754
AND THAT WILL PROBABLY BE 
THE GREAT DEBATE IN THE DAYS TO

00:45:38.755 --> 00:45:40.937
COME.
NONE OF US ARE REALLY FREE AND

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:48.246
ALL OF US ARE FREE.
KOJO NNAMDI:  NOW, IT'S TIME FOR

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:55.696
I KNOW THERE ARE THOSE OF YOU 
WHO HAVE READ ONE, TWO, OR ALL

00:45:55.697 --> 00:46:01.832
BOOKS IN THE TRILL SCREE.
NOW IS THE TIME -- IN THE

00:46:01.833 --> 00:46:04.176
TRILOGY.
NOW IS THE TIME TO RAISE YOUR

00:46:04.177 --> 00:46:07.043
HANDS OTHERWISE I'LL JUST KEEP 
TALKING  AND BORE TO YOU TEARS.

00:46:07.044 --> 00:46:10.529
OH,.
S  TO A HAND UP FRONT HERE.

00:46:11.741 --> 00:46:17.751
STAND UP SO WE CAN SEE YOU.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: I DIDN'T DO RESEARCH

00:46:20.653 --> 00:46:25.521
AROUND WHEN MARTIN LUTHER KING 
WAS BORN OR IS HE OLDER TAN YOU?

00:46:26.937 --> 00:46:27.956
KOJO NNAMDI:  WHEN WERE YOU BORN

00:46:27.957 --> 00:46:31.988
IN RELATION TO WHEN DR. MARTIN 
LUTHER KING WAS BORN.

00:46:32.003 --> 00:46:36.939
LEWIS:  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, 
JR. WAS BORN IN 1929.

00:46:37.164 --> 00:46:44.808
AND I WAS BORN IN 1940.
SO IN A SENSE, IT WAS LIKE A BIG

00:46:50.919 --> 00:46:52.919
I MET HIM WHEN I WAS 18 
YEARS OLD.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:57.227
HE CHANGEED MY LIFE.
ANDREW WILL TELL YOU, HE CALLED

00:46:57.228 --> 00:46:59.882
ME THE BOY FROM TROY

00:47:04.261 --> 00:47:07.740
.
SOME OF YOU READ WHEN I WAS A

00:47:07.741 --> 00:47:12.817
LITTLE BOY, I WANTED TO BE A 
MINISTER AND WE USED  TO RAISE

00:47:12.818 --> 00:47:16.366
CHICKENS, AND WITH THE HELP OF 
MY BROTHERS  AND SISTERS  AND

00:47:16.367 --> 00:47:19.569
COUSINS, WE WOULD GATHER ALL OF 
OUR CHICKENS TOGETHER IN THE

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.721
CHICKEN YARD, LIKE RIGHT HERE IN

00:47:21.722 --> 00:47:27.333
THIS ROOM.
AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS  AND

00:47:31.363 --> 00:47:34.716
YARD AND I WOULD START SPEAKING 
OR PREACHING AND WHEN I LOOKED

00:47:34.717 --> 00:47:39.583
BACK, SOME OF THESE KICKENS 
WOULD BOW THEIR HEADS.  LAWSUIT

00:47:39.584 --> 00:47:41.411
SOME OF THE CHICKENS WOULD SHAKE

00:47:41.412 --> 00:47:43.736
THEIR HEADS.
THEY NEVER QUITE SAID AMEN.

00:47:44.625 --> 00:47:47.892
BUT I'M CONVINCED SOME OF THOSE 
CHICKENS CAME TO LISTEN TO ME,

00:47:47.893 --> 00:47:51.136
MUCH BETTER THAN SOME OF MY 
COLLEAGUES LISTEN TO ME TODAY IN

00:47:51.496 --> 00:47:54.284
[LAUGHTER]
AND SOME OF THOSE CHICKENS WERE

00:47:54.285 --> 00:47:56.772
A LITTLE MORE PRODUCTIVE.
THEY PRODUCED EGGS  AND THEY

00:47:56.773 --> 00:48:00.286
WANTED ME TO SELL IT'LL THAT 
STORY.

00:48:00.306 --> 00:48:03.849
ANDREW AYDIN:  WE HAD TO LEAVE 
THOSE LINES OUT OF THE BOOK.

00:48:03.864 --> 00:48:06.066
KOJO NNAMDI:  I FOUND THAT TO BE

00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.742
THE MOST FASCINATING PART OF THE

00:48:06.743 --> 00:48:08.644
BOOK.
ME KNEW THE CHICKENS

00:48:08.645 --> 00:48:12.094
INDIVIDUALLY.
BY NAME AND AFTER A POINT, HE

00:48:12.095 --> 00:48:15.032
DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THE 
CHICKENS HAD TO BE KILLED, IN

00:48:15.033 --> 00:48:20.727
ORDER TO BE EATEN.
LEWIS:  I DIDN'T LIKE THE FACT

00:48:20.728 --> 00:48:23.081
THAT MY MOTHER AND FATHER WANTED

00:48:23.082 --> 00:48:31.148
TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE CHICKENS 
FOR A WHEEL AND I GOT -- FOR A

00:48:31.149 --> 00:48:33.150
MALE.
I GOT TO KNOW THESE CHICKENS.

00:48:33.151 --> 00:48:39.063
I TOLD THEM TO BE QUIET.
NOT TO MAKE NOISE AND FOR THEM

00:48:39.064 --> 00:48:41.657
TO LOVE EACH OTHER.
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:41.675 --> 00:48:45.742
KOJO NNAMDI:  ANY OTHER 
QUESTIONS?

00:48:45.761 --> 00:48:50.528
&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, LAST YEAR, OUR 
SCHOOL WENT TO A FIELD TRIP TO A

00:48:55.152 --> 00:49:01.375
MEMORIALS, ALL AROUND, ALL 
AROUND THE SOUTH AND SO WON'T

00:49:01.376 --> 00:49:04.939
PLACES WE ACTUALLY WENT TO WAS 
SELMA.  WE WALKED ACROSS THE

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:09.092
BRIDGE THAT YOU WALKED ACROSS ON
ON.

00:49:09.209 --> 00:49:12.362
SO COULD YOU TELL US WHAT SOME 
OF YOUR EXPERIENCES WERE WHEN

00:49:12.363 --> 00:49:15.219
YOU CROSSED THAT BRIDGE?

00:49:22.594 --> 00:49:27.924
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  IN SELMA, 
ALABAMA, PEOPLE OF COLOR COULD

00:49:27.925 --> 00:49:31.959
NOT REGISTER TO VOTE BECAUSE OF 
THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN

00:49:35.181 --> 00:49:37.423
.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN LISTER, DOCTORS

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:43.829
DOCTORS, TEACHERS, HOUSEWIVES, 
FARMERS WERE TOLD THAT THEY

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:46.910
COULD NOT READ OR WRITE WELL 
ENOUGH.

00:49:47.673 --> 00:49:49.690
SOMETIMES PEOPLE

00:49:55.193 --> 00:49:57.805
(INAUDIBLE) THE NUMBER 
OF JELLY BEANS IN A JAR.

00:49:58.611 --> 00:50:01.642
ONE DAY, MORE THAN 300 PUBLIC 
SCHOOL TEACHERS LEFT SCHOOL.

00:50:02.524 --> 00:50:10.005
LINE UP AND WENT DOWN TO THE 
COURT HOUSE, RECEIVED A COPY OF

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:15.075
THE TEST.
THEY STOOD IN LINE.  THE RENAL

00:50:15.076 --> 00:50:17.542
STAR CLOSED THE OFFICE AND THEY 
WERE DENIED THE RIGHT TO

00:50:17.543 --> 00:50:27.135
REGISTER TO VOTE.
AND FEW DAYS LATER, CELL MARX A

00:50:27.136 --> 00:50:30.232
GROUP OF PEOPLE MARCHING, IT WAS

00:50:30.233 --> 00:50:37.057
A PROTEST IN A HOME TOWN OF 
CORETTA SCOTT KING.

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.771
ONE PROTESTER WAS SHOT AND LATER

00:50:40.772 --> 00:50:43.291
DIED AT THE LOCAL HOSPITAL IN 
SELMA.  THE CAUSE OF WHAT

00:50:43.292 --> 00:50:47.743
HAPPENED TO HIM, WE MADE A 
DECISION TO MARCH FROM SELMA TO

00:50:47.744 --> 00:50:52.860
MONTGOMERY.
600 OF US, ORDERLY, PEACEFUL, NO

00:50:58.507 --> 00:51:00.512
WORD.
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE MARCH, A

00:51:00.513 --> 00:51:05.268
LOCAL SHERIFF, A MEAN MAN, 
REALLY JUST MEAN,

00:51:08.651 --> 00:51:10.660
HE CARRIED AN 
ELECTRIC COW PRODER.

00:51:10.723 --> 00:51:14.591
AND HE DIDN'T USE IT ON COWS.
HE USED IT ON PEOPLE.

00:51:14.804 --> 00:51:17.384
HE WOULD PUSH PEOPLE.
HE WOULD BEAT PEOPLE.

00:51:17.617 --> 00:51:21.066
FOR EXERCISING OUR 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

00:51:26.496 --> 00:51:31.712
SO ON THAT 
BRIDGE ON SUNDAY ALABAMA STATE

00:51:31.713 --> 00:51:35.813
TROOPERS, WE CONTINUED TO WALK.
WE CAME WITHIN HEARING DISTANCE.

00:51:35.814 --> 00:51:40.522
A MAN SPOKE UP AND SAID I'M 
MAJOR JOHN CLOUD, ALABAMA STATE

00:51:40.523 --> 00:51:42.979
TROOPERS.
THIS IS AN UNLAWFUL MARCH, YOU

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:47.627
WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.
I GIVE YOU THREE MINUTES TO

00:51:47.628 --> 00:51:51.575
DISPERSE AND RETURN TO YOUR HOME
HOMES OR TO YOUR CHURCH.

00:51:51.748 --> 00:51:53.687
AND THE YOUNG MAN WALKING BESIDE

00:51:53.688 --> 00:52:00.961
ME, ONE OF THE LEADERS, IN DR. 
DR. KING'S ORGANIZATION BY THE

00:52:00.962 --> 00:52:04.140
NAME OF JOSE WILLIAMS.
SAID MAJOR, GIVE US A MOMENT TO

00:52:04.141 --> 00:52:09.102
KNEE AND PRAY.
MAJOR, MAY I HAVE A WORD?

00:52:09.122 --> 00:52:16.276
ME SAID THERE WILL BE FOE WORD.
THEY CAME BEATING US WITH NIGHT

00:52:16.277 --> 00:52:19.592
STICKS, TRAMPLEING US WITH HORSE
S

00:52:19.593 --> 00:52:24.056
HORSES, RELEASING TEAR GAS.
I WAS ADMIT IN THE HEAD BY A

00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:28.393
STATE TROOPER WITH NIGHT STICKS.
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE ON

00:52:28.394 --> 00:52:31.776
THAT BRIDGE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE LAST

00:52:31.777 --> 00:52:35.647
NONVIOLENT PROTESTS.
AND ALL THESE MANY YEARS LATER,

00:52:35.648 --> 00:52:39.017
I DON'T RECALL HOW I MADE IT 
BACK UP ACROSS THE BRIDGE TO THE

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:45.693
BUT I REMEMBER BEING IN THE 
CHURCH, AND SOMEONE ASKED ME TO

00:52:45.694 --> 00:52:48.949
SAY SOMETHING, AND I STOOD UP 
AND SAID SOMETHING LIKE, I DON'T

00:52:49.296 --> 00:52:53.084
HOW PRESIDENT JOHNSON CAN SEND 
TROOPS  TO VIETNAM.

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:59.259
BUT CANNOT SEND TROOPS  TO SELMA
SELMA, ALABAMA, WHOSE ONLY

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:02.612
DESIRE IS TO REGISTER TO VOTE.
THE NEXT THING I KNEW, THERE ARE

00:53:08.121 --> 00:53:11.698
WHO WAS 
TRANSFERRED TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL

00:53:11.699 --> 00:53:13.706
WHERE A GROUP OF NUNS TOOK CARE 
OF US.

00:53:13.934 --> 00:53:19.013
AND LAST BEFORE THE ELECTION, 
LATE LAST OCTOBER, I WENT TO

00:53:19.014 --> 00:53:24.718
ROCHESTER, NEW YORK TO CAMPAIGN 
FOR ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES  IN NEW

00:53:24.833 --> 00:53:29.249
THEY TOOK ME TO THE OTHER HOUSE 
THERE, WHERE SOME OF THE NUNS

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:37.602
ARE RETIRED AND I SAW THE STAIN 
GLASS WINDOW THAT HAD BEEN IN

00:53:37.603 --> 00:53:39.982
THIS HOSPITAL IN ROCHESTER, NEW 
YORK AND SOME OF THE NUNS THAT

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:43.581
TOOK CARE OF ME, THAT WAS THERE,

00:53:43.582 --> 00:53:45.325
THAT REMEMBERED ME, THEY STARTED

00:53:45.326 --> 00:53:48.714
SAYING JOHN, JOHN, GOOD TO SEE 
YOU.

00:53:50.022 --> 00:53:52.841
AND WE ALL CRIED TOGETHER.

00:54:01.202 --> 00:54:07.459
KOJO NNAMDI:  WHAT STRUCK ME IS 
HOW JOHN LEWIS AND OTHERS

00:54:07.474 --> 00:54:10.558
TRAINED THEMSELVESES  TO 
THEMSELVES FOR NON

00:54:10.559 --> 00:54:15.205
NONRESPONSE TO VIOLENCE IN SOME 
OF THE MOST ATTACKS.

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:20.191
HOW DID THAT STRIKE YOU?
ANDREW AYDIN:  IT FELT LIKE THE

00:54:20.192 --> 00:54:24.413
MOST IMPORTANT FACT TO POSSIBLY 
CONVEY.

00:54:24.464 --> 00:54:30.712
I THINK MANY OF US UNDERSTAND 
THE BROAD STROKES OF CIVIL

00:54:30.713 --> 00:54:36.640
DISOBEDIENCE.
MAYBE WE HAVE READ THE ROW, OR

00:54:36.641 --> 00:54:41.039
EMERSON.
BUT REALLY, THE SELF-CONTROL IT

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.402
TAKES TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PRO

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:54.842
AS YOU READ THESE TEXTS, AS YOU 
READ THE ACTS, THE DEFINING

00:54:54.843 --> 00:54:56.349
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SUCCESSFUL

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:59.712
PROTEST IS HOW ORDERLY AND 
DISCIPLINED THEY WERE.

00:54:59.837 --> 00:55:05.341
SO FOR US, SHOWING THAT 
DISCIPLINE IS PART OF THE VISUAL

00:55:07.443 --> 00:55:10.058
MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE VISUAL 
MEDIUM.

00:55:10.136 --> 00:55:15.454
SHOWING THAT DISCIPLINE.
NOT JUST TELL SHOWING HOW MUCH

00:55:15.455 --> 00:55:18.875
DO THEY HAVE TO ENDURE.
WHETHER IT'S THE CIGARETTES IN

00:55:18.876 --> 00:55:21.201
YOUR HAIR, THE HOT COFFEE BEING 
POURED DOWN YOUR BACK.

00:55:21.511 --> 00:55:26.126
HAVING YOUR FRIENDS CALL YOU 
NAMES.

00:55:26.184 --> 00:55:28.682
IT WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
WE COULD CONVEY

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:32.881
.
KOJO NNAMDI:  ANY OTHER QUESTION

00:55:32.882 --> 00:55:38.466
QUESTIONS  FROM STUDENTS HERE?
RIGHT HERE.

00:55:38.467 --> 00:55:40.273
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER: THIS QUESTION IS FOR

00:55:40.274 --> 00:55:43.511
BOTH OF YOU ALL.
DO YOU SEE SIMILARITYIES  IN

00:55:43.512 --> 00:55:45.512
TODAY'S ACTIONS BY THE PROTESTS

00:55:52.533 --> 00:55:55.842
?
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  I SEE TODAY,

00:55:58.918 --> 00:56:04.484
JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO, IN 
WASHINGTON, IN ATLANTA, AROUND

00:56:04.485 --> 00:56:08.420
THE NATION, AROUND THE WORLD 
FEDERATION.

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.470
IF WE'RE USING AT THIS TIME SAME

00:56:10.471 --> 00:56:16.974
TECHNIQUES AND TACTICS, SOME OF 
THEM USE IT A LITTLE MORE UPBEAT

00:56:19.244 --> 00:56:21.999
UPBEAT.
ANDREW WILL TELL YOU, THE

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.254
RESEARCH, MUSIC IS VERY, VERY 
POWERFUL.

00:56:25.732 --> 00:56:28.666
I SAID ON OCCASION, IF IT HADN'T

00:56:28.667 --> 00:56:32.273
BEEN FOR THE MUSIC, THE CIVIL 
RIGHTS MOVEMENT WOULD OF COURSE

00:56:32.274 --> 00:56:34.978
LIKE A BIRD WITHOUT WINGS.
IT BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

00:56:35.281 --> 00:56:39.778
IT CREATED A SENSE OF FAMILY, A 
SENSE OF SOLIDARITY THAT WE'RE

00:56:39.779 --> 00:56:44.032
ALL IN THIS THING TOGETHER.
AND SOMETIMES DURING THE FREEDOM

00:56:50.277 --> 00:56:51.179
WE WERE ARREST
ARRESTED  IN JACKSON,

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:55.938
MISSISSIPPI, LATER, KEPT COMING.
WE FILLED THE COUNTY JAIL, THEN

00:56:55.939 --> 00:56:59.717
THEY TOOK US TO THE HEART OF THE

00:56:59.718 --> 00:57:02.094
DELTA TO A PURCHASE PEOPLE WOULD

00:57:02.095 --> 00:57:06.742
SAY, THE GUARDS, THE JAILERS 
WOULD SAY, DON'T STOP SINGING

00:57:06.743 --> 00:57:09.783
THOSE SONGS.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR

00:57:09.784 --> 00:57:12.957
MATTRESS AND PEOPLE WOULD MAKE 
UP SONGS.

00:57:13.907 --> 00:57:17.592
ANDREW WAS SINGING ONE OF THEM.
ANDREW AYDIN:  [LAUGHING] SO LOW

00:57:17.703 --> 00:57:21.799
LOW, YOU CAN'T HEAR ME.
CONGRESSMAN LEWIS:  TODAY, YOU

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:28.775
SEE PEOPLE COMING IN TO GATHER 
IN AN ORDERLY, PEACEFUL,

00:57:28.776 --> 00:57:30.674
NONVIOLENT FASHION.
I WAS SO PROUD TO MARCH WITH THE

00:57:34.488 --> 00:57:36.163
63,000 PEOPLE SHOWED UP AND 
HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS FROM

00:57:36.164 --> 00:57:40.944
ATLANTA CAME TO WASHINGTON.
PEOPLE SHOWED UP AT THE AIRPORT

00:57:40.945 --> 00:57:46.768
IN ORDERLY, PEACEFUL, NONVIOLENT

00:57:46.769 --> 00:57:49.520
FASHION.
THEY LEARNED THEY'RE STEADY IN

00:57:49.521 --> 00:57:51.026
THE MOVEMENT.
IT'S VERY SIMILAR.

00:57:51.027 --> 00:57:54.707
ANDREW, I KNOW YOU HAVE 
SOMETHING TO ADD.

00:58:01.141 --> 00:58:03.183
ANDREW AYDIN:  L I'M NOT GOING 
TO SING.

00:58:03.259 --> 00:58:05.427
BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BEING IN

00:58:05.428 --> 00:58:10.291
THE CLIMATE, CREATING THE 
ENVIRONMENT FOR CHANGE TO HAPPEN

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:18.573
POP CULTURE.
I THINK IT'S A DAY DAY AND AGE

00:58:18.574 --> 00:58:20.574
WE 
HAVE TO LOOK BEYOND

00:58:24.061 --> 00:58:24.866
FOR THE 
FACTORS.

00:58:24.867 --> 00:58:26.471
THEY PLAY A ROLE, BUT AT THE END

00:58:26.472 --> 00:58:31.421
OF THE DAY, IT'S PEOPLE OF 
CONSCIOUS, COMING TOGETHER FOR A

00:58:33.359 --> 00:58:37.281
I'M GOING TO BLOW YA'LL'S 
SPEAKERS AT THIS RATE.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:45.859
I MARCHED DURING D.C. AND I'VE 
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:47.974
IT.
[MICROPHONE FEEDBACK]

00:58:51.338 --> 00:58:55.032
I WALKED THROUGH THE CROWDS  AND

00:58:55.033 --> 00:58:57.413
IT WAS PEACEFUL AND IT WAS 
OPTIMISTIC.

00:58:57.642 --> 00:59:05.212
BUT THE SENSE OF REVOLUTION 
WASN'T -- IN 2009, WE THOUGHT WE

00:59:06.676 --> 00:59:09.804
RIGHT?
AND THAT'S WHY 2010 HAPPENED,

00:59:09.805 --> 00:59:15.668
THAT'S WHAT STARTED THIS TUMBLE.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED THE WOMEN'S

00:59:15.669 --> 00:59:18.713
MARCH, WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE 
SPACE WEEKS SINCE THEN.

00:59:18.928 --> 00:59:27.738
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT OPTIMISM.
IT'S ABOUT A SENSE OF DUTY THATS

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:31.095
THAT 
WE ALL RECOGNIZE.

00:59:31.096 --> 00:59:34.741
MAYBE WE DEPARTMENT AS MUCH AS 
WE SHOULD HAVE BEFOREHAND B. WE

00:59:34.742 --> 00:59:37.693
ALL SAY WITH A COLLECTIVE VOICE 
THAT STARTS NOW.

00:59:37.944 --> 00:59:42.857
WE ALL HAVE SOMETHING TO 
CONTRIBUTE AND WE ALL WILL

00:59:42.858 --> 00:59:45.158
CREDIBILITY.
I THINK THAT VERY MUCH PERMIT

00:59:45.159 --> 00:59:49.427
AITEED THAT SAME FEELING MAYBE 
IN

00:59:49.428 --> 00:59:54.879
THE LATTER DAYS T GOT LOST IN 
THE FREEDOMS,ENING LIKE THAT.

00:59:54.926 --> 00:59:58.727
THAT SENSE THAT WE ALL HAVE 
SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE.

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:05.076
AND THAT WE WILL RAGE AGAINST IN
INJUSTICE TOGETHER

01:00:08.645 --> 01:00:11.889
THE MOST 
POWERFUL DEVELOPMENT IN MY OWN

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:18.371
LIFE THAT I'VE EVER WITNESSED  
IN SOCIETY AND I HOPE YOU'RE

01:00:18.372 --> 01:00:22.295
PREPARED BECAUSE WE NEED YOU 
NEXT.

01:00:24.278 --> 01:00:27.644
AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY, I

01:00:27.645 --> 01:00:31.808
SPENT MOST OF THE TIME BEING 
AFRAID.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.618
AND THE CONGRESSMAN TELLING ME, 
NO, NO.

01:00:34.846 --> 01:00:40.255
THE BEST IS YET TO COME.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF WE WOULD FINISH

01:00:42.591 --> 01:00:46.638
ANY GOOD GOOD, I DIDN'T KNOW IF 
I WOULD DO A GOOD ENOUGH JOB

01:00:46.639 --> 01:00:49.772
HONORING THE CONGRESSMAN'S STORY
STORY.

01:00:51.278 --> 01:00:53.940
THAT WAS JUST ONE SMALL PIECE.
SO IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO BE

01:00:53.941 --> 01:00:56.844
AFRAID.
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE HOPEFUL AND

01:01:01.759 --> 01:01:05.267
THE PROGRESS OF THIS COUNTRY IS 
ON YOUR SHOULDERS INCOME.

01:01:06.683 --> 01:01:11.147
MY JENNATION, YOUR GENERATION, 
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN

01:01:11.148 --> 01:01:15.322
RIGHT NOW BUT WE FEED YOU.

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:24.841
KOJO NNAMDI:  ANYONE ELSE?
WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE

01:01:24.842 --> 01:01:28.464
QUESTION.
AND THERE ARE FOUR HANDS RAISED.

01:01:28.465 --> 01:01:30.469

I HAD TO PREACHALLY.

01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:59.029

CONGRESS TO, PRESIDENT OF THE

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:26.577
UNITED STATES, WE NEED TO PASS A

01:02:26.578 --> 01:02:34.313
VOTER RIGHTS ACT.
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED ON

01:02:34.314 --> 01:02:41.881
SUNDAY, MARCH 7, THE PRESIDENT,

JOHNSON CAME AND SPOKE TO JEFF 
SESSIONS OF THE CONGRESS AND

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:53.860
INTRODUCED A BILL.
WE COMPLETED THE MARCH, AND ON

01:02:53.861 --> 01:03:01.146
AUGUST 6, 1965, THE SO THEING 
ACTS RIGHT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW.

01:03:01.147 --> 01:03:04.332

REGISTERED TO VOTE FOR THE FIRST

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:07.592

, WOULD
WOULDN'T BE IN THE CONGRESS.

01:03:40.103 --> 01:03:44.786
WE STILL HAVE A DISTANCE TO GO.
THE SUPREME COURT ALMOST

01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:50.169
DESTROYED THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT 
TWO YEARS AGO.

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:53.434
SO WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO.
