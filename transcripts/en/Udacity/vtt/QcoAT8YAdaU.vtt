00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.430
Let's develop your intuition
a little bit more.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.640
We'll use this hypothetical dag.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.050
Now suppose the dag has work W(n) and
span D(n).

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.870
The ratio of work to span or w divided
by d has a special interpretation.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.680
It basically measures the amount
of work per critical path vertex.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.770
So, think about that for a second.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.930
At every critical path vertex,
there's an average amount of work.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.130
So this ratio basically tells you
the average available parallelism

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.619
in the dag.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.790
So imagine you're a critical
path vertex like this one.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.950
When that critical path vertex executes,
there's going to be a bunch of work

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.720
sitting around and on average, the
amount of such work is W divided by D.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.810
So what does that imply?

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.970
Suppose I give you a PRAM
with P processors.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.330
How many processors should you use?

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.500
It looks like it would be nice to
have about w over d processors.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.450
And if that's the case you can basically
keep the processors busy on average.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.900
Work and
span give us some more information.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.140
You know for example that the span is
a lower bound on the execution time.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.920
We are going to give
this a special name,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.880
we are going to call it the Span Law,
punishable by death.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.380
Now that's a lowerbound in terms of the
span but it's not the only lowerbound.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.380
Another scenario I could imagine
is taking all of the work, and

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.640
if there is no critical path,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.464
then I would just divide that work
evenly among the p processors.

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:30.740
And that would give me
another lower bound.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.880
Basically the ceiling of W divided P.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.870
And we'll give than
an ominous name as well.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.810
The work law.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.100
Now I have a pea-sized brain.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.610
I don't like remembering all these laws,
so

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.780
I'm going to write this more compactly.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.100
Both laws hold, so I can combine them.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.948
Basically the two laws have to be true
simultaneously so I can combine them.

00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:58.290
So remember, W/D tells you the average
available parallelism, and W and D

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.500
together given P gives you a lower bound
which is this combined work span law.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.440
Commit these to memory.
