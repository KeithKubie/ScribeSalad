00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.660
Match each function
with its graph.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.190
And we have graph
D, A, B, and C.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.166
And let's just start
with the graph of B

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.040
because, actually, this
one looks the closest

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.270
to the square root of x, which
would look something like that.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.600
But it's clearly shifted.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.072
And it's flipped over
the horizontal axis.

00:00:16.072 --> 00:00:18.530
The fact that it's flipped over
the square horizontal axis,

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.600
that means that we're taking
the negative square root.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.580
So it's going to be one of
these two cases right over here.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.210
We're shifting it down by 2.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.640
So we should have a negative
2, and both of these cases

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.290
have a negative 2 here.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.750
And we're shifting it relative
to the square root of x.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.985
We're shifting it
to the right by 1.

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:40.360
So if we're shifting
to the right

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.470
by 1, what we see under the
radical should be x minus 1.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.210
And both of these have
an x minus 1 on it.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.360
So which of these is B?

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.954
And which of these is C?

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:52.620
And I encourage you
to think about that.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.870
Pause the video if you'd like.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.630
Well, the difference between
these two is this one has

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.670
a scaling factor of 2 here
while this one doesn't.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.232
And of course, this
is going to turn

00:01:03.232 --> 00:01:04.690
into more and more
negative values.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.560
This is going to be
getting negative faster.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.580
And you see that graph C
here gets negative faster.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.350
And you could even
try some points.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.290
In either case, when
x is equal to 1,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.220
in either case, what we have
under the radical becomes 0.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.000
x minus 1 is 0. x minus 1
is 0 when x is equal to 1.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.220
And in either case, our
y value's negative 2.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.570
But then, you see,
as x increases,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.530
this one right over here
gets negative twice as fast.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.200
You see that right over here.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.100
This one right over here,
y has gone from negative 2

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.570
to negative 4 here.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.040
For graph C, y has gone from
negative 2 to negative 6.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.330
So it's gone down by 4.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.570
This has only gone down by 2.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.650
So it's pretty clear
that graph B corresponds

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.870
to the one that doesn't
have the 2 out front.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.400
So this is graph
B right over here.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.250
And graph C
corresponds to the one

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.860
that has a negative 2 out front.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.330
So let me try that.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.130
The negative 2 out front.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.390
So now we just have to think
about these two equations

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.460
and match them to
these two graphs.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.340
And so both of
these, they haven't

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.180
been flipped around
the horizontal axis.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.650
They've been flipped
around the vertical axis.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.380
And that's why whatever
we have under the radical

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.560
we've essentially taken
the negative of it.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.120
And actually, we
could figure out

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.820
which ones these are just by
looking at how much they've

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.480
been shifted in the y direction
relative to the square root

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.605
of x-- which would look
something like that.

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:42.800
I know I can't draw on
this one right over here.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.055
Well, this one has
been shifted up by 2.

00:02:45.055 --> 00:02:46.620
D has been shifted up by 2.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.780
This one over here, g of x
has been shifted up by 2.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.270
And you could also see that it's
been shifted to the left by 1.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.770
If you're shifting
to the left by 1,

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.978
normally, under the radical,
you would have x plus 1.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:03.105
But then, we flipped it over
around the vertical axis.

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:04.730
And so that takes
the negative of that.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.490
That's why it's
negative x minus 1.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.220
You could view this as
the negative of x plus 1.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.750
So either way, that
is D. Throw that

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.020
under the D. And just
deductive reasoning

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.630
tells us A. This is
A, and it makes sense.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.750
We see it has shifted up by 1.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.210
So it's plus 1.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:33.290
And we could view this as
the negative of x plus 4.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.380
So it's been shifted
4 to the left.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.290
And we see that is
definitely the case

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.790
relative to the
square root of x.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.620
We got it right.
