00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.520
Imagine tiny robots made of living heart cells
swimming towards you being guided by laser

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520
light.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.520
Well, now that’s a thing.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.330
We live in the future people!

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.540
Hello everyone!

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.250
I'm Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.660
In what seems like a plot from a science fiction
film, scientists have now created tiny swimming

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.380
robots shaped like jellyfish and stingrays.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.300
They claim to be using these mechanical copy
cats to study propulsion, test biological

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.730
materials, and find new vehicle designs, but
I can’t be the only one imagining swimming

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.629
armies of tiny robots, am I?

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:34.629
Didn’t think so.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.350
When mechanical objects like this mimic biological
systems it’s called “biomimicry”.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.749
Some scientists believe that since biomimicry
builds on millions of years of evolution it’s

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.750
a more effective and efficient approach to
engineering.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.159
In my favorite recent example of this, a team
of scientists lead by Kevin Parker at Harvard

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.989
created a 1/10th-scale version of a ray fish
with a tiny gold skeleton and a rubber body

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.920
that is powered by approximately 200,000 rat
heart muscle cells.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.290
This biological hybrid machine can swim through
an obstacle course in a salt solution with

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.920
a little help from lasers.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.689
It’s so creepy!

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.490
The reason they used heart cells is because
of the way they beat, contracting together

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.410
in response to stimuli.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.539
They started by placing the heart cells on
the top of the robot.

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.090
But these weren’t ordinary heart cells.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.020
They were modified to contain a light detecting
protein usually found in our eyes, making

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.479
them activate in response to light.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.479
This meant the researchers could signal the
cells to contract simply by flashing a light

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.570
at them.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.450
When activated, the cells contract down, bending
the skeleton, and when they release, the flexible

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.090
wings rebound to neutral -- just like a live
ray or...the beating of a heart.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.780
So now they could make the robot swim.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.170
But, since the contraction of the cells happened
on both sides of the mechanical ray at the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.140
same time, the robot was impossible to steer.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.799
So, they further modified the cells to make
the ones on the right and left wings responsive

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.979
to different wavelengths of light.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.710
Flashing both wavelengths at the same time
caused the ray to swim forward, but flashing

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.039
one or the other activated only one “wing”
of the ray and could turn the vehicle.

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.330
After accomplishing this, the team did what
anyone would do really, and started building

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.970
obstacle courses for their robot like they
were designing a biomimetic video game.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.890
Robot bio-hybrids are relatively new, and
others have mimicked aquatic animals like

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.790
sea turtles, jellyfish, and now stingray.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.080
Obviously this is all REALLY COOL, but why
do we want to build robots out of biological

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.659
materials in the first place?

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.720
Well Stanford Professor of Engineering John
O. Dabiri says it all comes down to energy.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.010
With traditional robotic systems, Dabiri says,
quote “the robots would run out of energy

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.500
before they took over the world.”

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.300
But biological systems are REALLY EFFICIENT
at using energy.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.810
If you want to make smaller, more powerful,
faster robots, improving energy use is a good

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.450
way to do that.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.530
Biomimetic jellyfish or stingrays don’t
require batteries, gas, or solar panels.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.319
They use the same source of energy as the
rest of the cells in our bodies do: Glucose,

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.439
a form of sugar, which scientists put in the
water to feed the cells.

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.069
So...at this point, the robot only swims if
it’s in a glucose and salt solution, at

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.190
body temperature, with particular lightwaves
flashing at it.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.599
But, it’s still an exciting step forward
toward making biomechanical robots that sense,

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.239
respond, and move on their own.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.049
In other words: Intelligent robots made from
live biological materials could be coming

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.049
soon.

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.620
What could possibly go wrong?

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.020
