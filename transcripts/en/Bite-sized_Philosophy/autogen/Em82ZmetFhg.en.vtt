00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.160
one of the things that's quite

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.170
one of the things that's quite
 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.990
one of the things that's quite
interesting about the gulag camps and

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000
interesting about the gulag camps and
 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.490
interesting about the gulag camps and
this is something that's very relevant

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500
this is something that's very relevant
 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.289
this is something that's very relevant
to understanding of modern Russia is

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299
to understanding of modern Russia is
 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.870
to understanding of modern Russia is
that so ordinary criminals were put into

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880
that so ordinary criminals were put into
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.129
that so ordinary criminals were put into
the camps and so we're political

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139
the camps and so we're political
 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.780
the camps and so we're political
prisoners prisoners but the ordinary

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
prisoners prisoners but the ordinary
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.759
prisoners prisoners but the ordinary
criminals is so those would be rapists

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769
criminals is so those would be rapists
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.129
criminals is so those would be rapists
and murderers let's say as well as

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139
and murderers let's say as well as
 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.410
and murderers let's say as well as
thieves who were engaged in theft as an

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420
thieves who were engaged in theft as an
 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630
thieves who were engaged in theft as an
occupation those were regarded by the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
occupation those were regarded by the
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.210
occupation those were regarded by the
Soviets as socially friendly element and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
Soviets as socially friendly element and
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.250
Soviets as socially friendly element and
the reason for that was that they

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260
the reason for that was that they
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.720
the reason for that was that they
assumed that the reason that these

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
assumed that the reason that these
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.429
assumed that the reason that these
people had turned to crime was because

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
people had turned to crime was because
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.529
people had turned to crime was because
the applause of the oppressive nature of

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
the applause of the oppressive nature of
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.860
the applause of the oppressive nature of
the previous Czarist / capitalist system

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
the previous Czarist / capitalist system
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.420
the previous Czarist / capitalist system
and that the only reason that these

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430
and that the only reason that these
 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.069
and that the only reason that these
criminals existed was because they had

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
criminals existed was because they had
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.110
criminals existed was because they had
been oppressed they were oppressed

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
been oppressed they were oppressed
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.869
been oppressed they were oppressed
victims of that system and so one of the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
victims of that system and so one of the
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.760
victims of that system and so one of the
convenient consequences of that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
convenient consequences of that
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.880
convenient consequences of that
absolutely insane doctrine was that the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
absolutely insane doctrine was that the
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.830
absolutely insane doctrine was that the
Soviets put the ordinary criminals in

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
Soviets put the ordinary criminals in
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.080
Soviets put the ordinary criminals in
charge of the camps and these were very

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
charge of the camps and these were very
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.260
charge of the camps and these were very
very seriously bad people and so you can

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
very seriously bad people and so you can
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.700
very seriously bad people and so you can
imagine the way that they treated the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
imagine the way that they treated the
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.650
imagine the way that they treated the
political prisoners who were regarded as

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
political prisoners who were regarded as
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.170
political prisoners who were regarded as

were regarded as privileged and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
were regarded as privileged and
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.020
were regarded as privileged and
therefore as enemies of the state and it

great-grandfather who happened to be
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.749
great-grandfather who happened to be
privileged but the mere fact that you

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
privileged but the mere fact that you
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.480
privileged but the mere fact that you
were a member of that group with

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
were a member of that group with
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.520
were a member of that group with
sufficient reason to put you into a camp

sufficient reason to put you into a camp
 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.889
sufficient reason to put you into a camp
and we're talking hundreds of thousands

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
and we're talking hundreds of thousands
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.330
and we're talking hundreds of thousands
or perhaps millions of people who

or perhaps millions of people who
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.310
or perhaps millions of people who
underwent that fate and so the idea in

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
underwent that fate and so the idea in
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.560
underwent that fate and so the idea in
the Soviet Union was just because you

consequence of your familial association
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.130
consequence of your familial association
you were immediately sufficiently guilty

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140
you were immediately sufficiently guilty
 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.530
you were immediately sufficiently guilty
to be put into a camp and punished in

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
to be put into a camp and punished in
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.149
to be put into a camp and punished in
the end the terms for the camps were

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
the end the terms for the camps were
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.300
the end the terms for the camps were
often 10 years 15 years long and if you

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
often 10 years 15 years long and if you
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.830
often 10 years 15 years long and if you
were very fortunate you've got to have
