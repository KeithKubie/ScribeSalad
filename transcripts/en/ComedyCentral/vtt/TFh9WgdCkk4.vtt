00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:06.373 line:0%
(instrumental music)

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:18.184
(monitor beeping)

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:22.789
- Doctor!

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.957
Doctor, get in here quick!

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:25.892 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Doctor] Is
everything all right?

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.360
- The coma patient, sir.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.761
He's woke.

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:29.696
- What?

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:30.530
No, he's not awake.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.464
- No, no, no.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.265
It's not that he's awake,

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.266
it's that he's woke.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.100
See.

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.303
Even though he's asleep,

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.805 align:start size:94% position:6%
he's somehow aware of
all the social injustices

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.373
black people are
facing everyday.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:41.407 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's why he's
wearing this sweet ass

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:42.875
Black Lives Matter shirt.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.911
- Actually, all lives matter.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:45.745
What, I'm a doctor.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:47.313
I took an oath.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.282
- Oh, wait a minute.

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:50.883
He's got a voting
ballot from 2014

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:53.920
and he wrote in Rachel Dolezal.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.955
Aw, you know, he didn't know,
none of us knew back then.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.323
(cellphone ringing)

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.591
Oh shit!

00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.892
He's getting a call
from Erykah Badu.

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.394
This dude is woke as fuck.

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.395
- Wait, I don't understand.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.595
How does he know
what's going on?

00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:06.265
- Well, I'm glad you asked that.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:08.635 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's not just about
(pensive music)

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.236
seeing and hearing.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.239
Being woke is a feeling,

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.575
deep inside the human heart.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.245
- He's right.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:22.248 align:start size:97% position:3%
Injustice anywhere is a
threat to justice everywhere.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:24.350
- Oh my God, you're awake!

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.686
And you you use to care
about such trivial shit!

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:27.920
But now,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.755
you probably don't care
that Girls just ended.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:30.924
- What!

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.324
Girls is ending?

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.959
You bastard!

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.928 align:start size:84% position:16%
(gasping)
(monitor flatlines)

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.296
- Why'd you have
to say that man?

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.265
Such a fucking morning.
