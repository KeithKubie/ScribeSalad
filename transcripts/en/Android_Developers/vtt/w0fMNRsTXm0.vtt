JOCELYN BECKER: If you want
to be a professional Android

00:00:02.673 --> 00:00:05.780
developer, it's critical to know
how many people use your app,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.855
and how they use it.

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:09.860
For that, you need
Google Analytics.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.300
Take this course, created
by Udacity in collaboration

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.860
with Google, to learn how to
integrate Google Analytics

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.150
into your Android app.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.790
Packed with practical
help and code samples,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.640
the course shows
just how easy it

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.740
is to find out
where in the world

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.570
people use your app,
which activities they use,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.330
and even how many people
are using the app right now.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.170
You'll discover that it takes
only a few lines of code

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.090
to track your users' locations,
languages, events, shopping

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.975
behavior, and much more.

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:43.405
You'll also learn how to use
Google Tag Manager to update

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:46.080
your app without needing
to redeploy the APK

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.495
and to manage all your
Google Analytics code tags.

00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:52.750
