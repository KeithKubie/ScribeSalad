there was no success in obtaining normal
development so of course that led to the

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000
development so of course that led to the
 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.949
development so of course that led to the
idea that as cells differentiate they

00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959
idea that as cells differentiate they
 

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:42.980

so looking again ahead a bit we started

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:28.290
so looking again ahead a bit we started
 

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.030
so looking again ahead a bit we started
using the intestine of a feeding larva

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040
using the intestine of a feeding larva
 

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.220
using the intestine of a feeding larva
so it's intestine cells were functional

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:34.230
so it's intestine cells were functional
 

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.970
so it's intestine cells were functional
and in this case we could use the GFP

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:37.980
and in this case we could use the GFP
 

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.560
and in this case we could use the GFP
marker to mark these nuclei transplant

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:42.570
marker to mark these nuclei transplant
 

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.300

of the egg can switch it back to the
 

00:15:12.619 --> 00:15:14.859
of the egg can switch it back to the
beginning of life and send it out in the

00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:14.869
beginning of life and send it out in the
 

00:15:14.869 --> 00:15:18.699

direction of muscle and nerve but at

00:15:18.699 --> 00:15:18.709
direction of muscle and nerve but at
 

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:23.319

this point this success rate of 30% also

00:15:23.319 --> 00:15:23.329
this point this success rate of 30% also
 

00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:25.929
this point this success rate of 30% also
means that 70% of the embryos do not

means that 70% of the embryos do not
 

00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:29.939
means that 70% of the embryos do not
achieve that and so in terms of this

00:15:29.939 --> 00:15:29.949
achieve that and so in terms of this
 

00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:33.249
achieve that and so in terms of this
conflict or battle we would say the

or the nucleus is both gene-specific and
 

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:54.359
or the nucleus is both gene-specific and
cell type-specific so there are two ways

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:54.369
cell type-specific so there are two ways
 

00:37:54.369 --> 00:37:57.599

these modifications genes have histones
 

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:17.969
these modifications genes have histones
and the histones have components on them

00:38:17.969 --> 00:38:17.979
and the histones have components on them
 

00:38:17.979 --> 00:38:20.249

transplant nucleon the second day and
then re isolate the transplanting nuclei

00:38:33.749 --> 00:38:33.759
then re isolate the transplanting nuclei
 

00:38:33.759 --> 00:38:36.960
then re isolate the transplanting nuclei
on day three and analyze what has

components on the transplanted nuclei
 

00:38:53.319 --> 00:38:56.959
components on the transplanted nuclei
and so see what effect they have and

00:38:56.959 --> 00:38:56.969
and so see what effect they have and
 

00:38:56.969 --> 00:39:00.120
and so see what effect they have and
this shows that this is quite effective

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:00.130
this shows that this is quite effective
 

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.150
this shows that this is quite effective
so normally you have high level of

overexpress the d methylase you

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:07.900
overexpress the d methylase you
 

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.670
overexpress the d methylase you
essentially remove all those so that's a

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:11.680
essentially remove all those so that's a
 

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.640
essentially remove all those so that's a
good way of changing these components

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:14.650
good way of changing these components
 

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:16.950
good way of changing these components
and hence determining what effect they

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960
and hence determining what effect they
 

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.890
and hence determining what effect they
have as a matter of fact he takes me

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:19.900
have as a matter of fact he takes me
 

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.709
have as a matter of fact he takes me
back to one of my few experiments that I

00:39:22.709 --> 00:39:22.719
back to one of my few experiments that I
 

00:39:22.719 --> 00:39:25.079
back to one of my few experiments that I
really found worked amazingly well when

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:25.089
really found worked amazingly well when
 

00:39:25.089 --> 00:39:27.329
really found worked amazingly well when
I a long time ago I wanted to try

00:39:27.329 --> 00:39:27.339
I a long time ago I wanted to try
 

00:39:27.339 --> 00:39:30.239
I a long time ago I wanted to try
injecting messenger RNA into eggs and

00:39:30.239 --> 00:39:30.249
injecting messenger RNA into eggs and
 

00:39:30.249 --> 00:39:32.609
injecting messenger RNA into eggs and
it's a proper a project which would

00:39:32.609 --> 00:39:32.619
it's a proper a project which would
 

00:39:32.619 --> 00:39:35.069
it's a proper a project which would
never have had any grant support at all

00:39:35.069 --> 00:39:35.079
never have had any grant support at all
 

00:39:35.079 --> 00:39:39.209
never have had any grant support at all
because it was known that if you take

00:39:39.209 --> 00:39:39.219
because it was known that if you take
 

00:39:39.219 --> 00:39:41.910
because it was known that if you take
eggs they are full or ribonuclease

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920
eggs they are full or ribonuclease
 

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.339
eggs they are full or ribonuclease
absolutely stuffed full and if you add

00:39:44.339 --> 00:39:44.349
absolutely stuffed full and if you add
 

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:46.380
absolutely stuffed full and if you add
right the nucleus to message it destroys

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:46.390
right the nucleus to message it destroys
 

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.870
right the nucleus to message it destroys
it immediately nevertheless it was the

00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880
it immediately nevertheless it was the
 

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.239
it immediately nevertheless it was the
kind of thing you think well we better

00:39:51.239 --> 00:39:51.249
kind of thing you think well we better
 

00:39:51.249 --> 00:39:52.109
kind of thing you think well we better
just try it

00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:52.119
just try it
 

00:39:52.119 --> 00:39:54.599
just try it
so we injected this precious message

00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:54.609
so we injected this precious message
 

00:39:54.609 --> 00:39:57.509
so we injected this precious message
which had been exhaustively purified by

00:39:57.509 --> 00:39:57.519
which had been exhaustively purified by
 

00:39:57.519 --> 00:39:59.849
which had been exhaustively purified by
people into the egg and

00:39:59.849 --> 00:39:59.859
people into the egg and
 

00:39:59.859 --> 00:40:02.460
people into the egg and
amazingly it worked perfectly so why

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:02.470
amazingly it worked perfectly so why
 

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.829
amazingly it worked perfectly so why
should that be and I suppose the lesson

00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:04.839
should that be and I suppose the lesson
 

00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:07.620
should that be and I suppose the lesson
you learn is that when you inject

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:07.630
you learn is that when you inject
 

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.690
you learn is that when you inject
something into an egg you do it almost

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:09.700
something into an egg you do it almost
 

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.430
something into an egg you do it almost
no damage at all you don't break open

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440
no damage at all you don't break open
 

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.979
no damage at all you don't break open
all these nucleus containing components

00:40:13.979 --> 00:40:13.989
all these nucleus containing components
 

00:40:13.989 --> 00:40:16.650
all these nucleus containing components
and message injection has turned out to

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:16.660
and message injection has turned out to
 

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.809
and message injection has turned out to
be an extraordinarily useful technique

00:40:18.809 --> 00:40:18.819
be an extraordinarily useful technique
 

00:40:18.819 --> 00:40:22.440
be an extraordinarily useful technique
and I reflect on the fact that if I had

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:22.450
and I reflect on the fact that if I had
 

00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.390
and I reflect on the fact that if I had
not had just enough funding to try it

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400
not had just enough funding to try it
 

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.819
not had just enough funding to try it
anyway the extremity never have been

00:40:26.819 --> 00:40:26.829
anyway the extremity never have been
 

00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:29.309
anyway the extremity never have been
done and so how lucky it is when you

00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:29.319
done and so how lucky it is when you
 

00:40:29.319 --> 00:40:31.289
done and so how lucky it is when you
sometimes have a little bit of extra

00:40:31.289 --> 00:40:31.299
sometimes have a little bit of extra
 

00:40:31.299 --> 00:40:33.569
sometimes have a little bit of extra
cash to try something a little little

00:40:33.569 --> 00:40:33.579
cash to try something a little little
 

00:40:33.579 --> 00:40:38.509
cash to try something a little little
exotic so when you do these experiments

00:40:38.509 --> 00:40:38.519
exotic so when you do these experiments
 

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:42.239
exotic so when you do these experiments
though they are quite effective you can

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:42.249
though they are quite effective you can
 

00:40:42.249 --> 00:40:44.870
though they are quite effective you can
see that here we have the

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880
see that here we have the
 

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:47.970
see that here we have the
heterochromatin one which is a nuclei

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:47.980
heterochromatin one which is a nuclei
 

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.630
heterochromatin one which is a nuclei
when you demethylate the lice in it they

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640
when you demethylate the lice in it they
 

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.390
when you demethylate the lice in it they
completely disappear and as a control

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.400
completely disappear and as a control
 

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.339
completely disappear and as a control
this doesn't work with another

00:40:56.339 --> 00:40:56.349
this doesn't work with another
 

00:40:56.349 --> 00:41:00.239
this doesn't work with another
particular form of heterochromatin one

00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:00.249
particular form of heterochromatin one
 

00:41:00.249 --> 00:41:03.479
particular form of heterochromatin one
and this this approach is proving useful

00:41:03.479 --> 00:41:03.489
and this this approach is proving useful
 

00:41:03.489 --> 00:41:06.739
and this this approach is proving useful
because it's now we've begun to identify

00:41:06.739 --> 00:41:06.749
because it's now we've begun to identify
 

00:41:06.749 --> 00:41:09.870
because it's now we've begun to identify
some of the components that actually

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:09.880
some of the components that actually
 

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.269
some of the components that actually
create resistance and there's a

00:41:12.269 --> 00:41:12.279
create resistance and there's a
 

00:41:12.279 --> 00:41:16.769
create resistance and there's a
particular enzyme called d ubiquity

00:41:16.769 --> 00:41:16.779
particular enzyme called d ubiquity
 

00:41:16.779 --> 00:41:20.130
particular enzyme called d ubiquity
neighs which takes the ubiquitin away

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:20.140
neighs which takes the ubiquitin away
 

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.460
neighs which takes the ubiquitin away
from histones and you can see that when

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:23.470
from histones and you can see that when
 

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:25.950
from histones and you can see that when
you do this at time zero there is no

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960
you do this at time zero there is no
 

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.829
you do this at time zero there is no
increase in gene activity two days later

00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839
increase in gene activity two days later
 

00:41:28.839 --> 00:41:31.109
increase in gene activity two days later
it's very strongly activated and that

00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119
it's very strongly activated and that
 

00:41:31.119 --> 00:41:34.579
it's very strongly activated and that
doesn't work if you use D mythili's so

00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:34.589
doesn't work if you use D mythili's so
 

00:41:34.589 --> 00:41:37.200
doesn't work if you use D mythili's so
we're beginning to identify those

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:37.210
we're beginning to identify those
 

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:39.900
we're beginning to identify those
components on the chromosomal proteins

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:39.910
components on the chromosomal proteins
 

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:43.559
components on the chromosomal proteins
that confer resistance or defense on the

00:41:43.559 --> 00:41:43.569
that confer resistance or defense on the
 

00:41:43.569 --> 00:41:45.329
that confer resistance or defense on the
nuclei and I'm sure there's a great deal

00:41:45.329 --> 00:41:45.339
nuclei and I'm sure there's a great deal
 

00:41:45.339 --> 00:41:47.670
nuclei and I'm sure there's a great deal
of more work to be done in this area but

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680
of more work to be done in this area but
 

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.069
of more work to be done in this area but
it's one way forward and it's some

00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079
it's one way forward and it's some
 

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:52.650
it's one way forward and it's some
really only possible to do that if you

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:52.660
really only possible to do that if you
 

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:56.069
really only possible to do that if you
have these very favorable cells which

00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079
have these very favorable cells which
 

00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:58.410
have these very favorable cells which
can be injected with almost anything you

00:41:58.410 --> 00:41:58.420
can be injected with almost anything you
 

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:00.289
can be injected with almost anything you
like

00:42:00.289 --> 00:42:00.299
like
 

00:42:00.299 --> 00:42:03.479
like
so that begins to answer this question

00:42:03.479 --> 00:42:03.489
so that begins to answer this question
 

00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:05.940
so that begins to answer this question
but it doesn't entirely answer the whole

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:05.950
but it doesn't entirely answer the whole
 

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.999
but it doesn't entirely answer the whole
problem because it turns out that even

00:42:08.999 --> 00:42:09.009
problem because it turns out that even
 

00:42:09.009 --> 00:42:13.520
problem because it turns out that even
if you remove almost all proteins

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:13.530
if you remove almost all proteins
 

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:16.220
if you remove almost all proteins
from a nucleus from the chromosomes from

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:16.230
from a nucleus from the chromosomes from
 

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:19.220
from a nucleus from the chromosomes from
nucleus nevertheless the nucleus still

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:19.230
nucleus nevertheless the nucleus still
 

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:22.610
nucleus nevertheless the nucleus still
has defense so that's rather amazing and

00:42:22.610 --> 00:42:22.620
has defense so that's rather amazing and
 

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.090
has defense so that's rather amazing and
one would say well in that case how sure

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:26.100
one would say well in that case how sure
 

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.190
one would say well in that case how sure
are you that this defense isn't

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:28.200
are you that this defense isn't
 

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.550
are you that this defense isn't
something like the methylation of DNA

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560
something like the methylation of DNA
 

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:33.820
something like the methylation of DNA
well known to prevent genes being

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:33.830
well known to prevent genes being
 

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.430
well known to prevent genes being
reprogrammed and that's easily disproved

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440
reprogrammed and that's easily disproved
 

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.850
reprogrammed and that's easily disproved
in many cases because you can remove all

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:40.860
in many cases because you can remove all
 

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:44.000
in many cases because you can remove all
of the proteins from a nucleus every

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.010
of the proteins from a nucleus every
 

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:46.760
of the proteins from a nucleus every
single one but leaving of course the

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:46.770
single one but leaving of course the
 

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.030
single one but leaving of course the
methylation of DNA and when you do that

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040
methylation of DNA and when you do that
 

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.700
methylation of DNA and when you do that
the the defense disappears so you've

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:52.710
the the defense disappears so you've
 

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:55.400
the the defense disappears so you've
taken something away which was creating

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:55.410
taken something away which was creating
 

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:58.250
taken something away which was creating
this defense so what could that be

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260
this defense so what could that be
 

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.840
this defense so what could that be
and the problem then is to find a way of

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:01.850
and the problem then is to find a way of
 

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.850
and the problem then is to find a way of
removing components progressively from a

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:04.860
removing components progressively from a
 

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:07.070
removing components progressively from a
nucleus while you can still keep it

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:07.080
nucleus while you can still keep it
 

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.810
nucleus while you can still keep it
alive enough to be transplanted and this

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:11.820
alive enough to be transplanted and this
 

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:15.160
alive enough to be transplanted and this
was done finally by finding a way of

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:15.170
was done finally by finding a way of
 

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:18.590
was done finally by finding a way of
wrapping the nuclei in a kind of cage so

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:18.600
wrapping the nuclei in a kind of cage so
 

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.450
wrapping the nuclei in a kind of cage so
that you can take molecules away from

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:20.460
that you can take molecules away from
 

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.640
that you can take molecules away from
them and nevertheless they do not

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:22.650
them and nevertheless they do not
 

00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:25.820
them and nevertheless they do not
explode and they can be injected and the

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:25.830
explode and they can be injected and the
 

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:27.980
explode and they can be injected and the
first obvious test here is to ask about

a Dornan a back and so the RNA is still
 

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:53.030
a Dornan a back and so the RNA is still
functional but so then you have RNA

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040
functional but so then you have RNA
 

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.270

depleted nuclei and when you do this you

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280
depleted nuclei and when you do this you
 

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.220

and you will know that we don't have
brain cells in our liver or we don't

00:46:22.090 --> 00:46:22.100
brain cells in our liver or we don't
 

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.550
brain cells in our liver or we don't
have skin cells in our muscle so once

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560
have skin cells in our muscle so once
 

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.270

cells embark on a pathway they remain
 

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.940
cells embark on a pathway they remain
very stable and that's really why the

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:30.950
very stable and that's really why the
 

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:33.370

so let me start with this topic my early
 

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:14.260
so let me start with this topic my early
days in science I have to say I was

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:14.270
days in science I have to say I was
 

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:18.980
days in science I have to say I was
extremely lucky in two ways when I was a

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:18.990
extremely lucky in two ways when I was a
 

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.560
extremely lucky in two ways when I was a
graduate student and I was a

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:21.570
graduate student and I was a
 

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:27.320
graduate student and I was a
postdoctoral fellow the fast track was

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:27.330
postdoctoral fellow the fast track was
 

00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:30.410
postdoctoral fellow the fast track was
that I had multiple opportunities to

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.420
that I had multiple opportunities to
 

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:35.240
that I had multiple opportunities to
observe totally unexpected results that

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:35.250
observe totally unexpected results that
 

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:39.730

that we this is what we should observe
 

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.920
that we this is what we should observe
so we shouldn't observe any decrease in

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:35.930
so we shouldn't observe any decrease in
 

00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:40.309

unexpected in the beginning it looks
 

01:00:08.959 --> 01:00:12.150
unexpected in the beginning it looks
like the from box on a 2 inhibitor

when I looked at this I got so excited

01:00:41.019 --> 01:00:41.029
when I looked at this I got so excited
 

01:00:41.029 --> 01:00:44.880
when I looked at this I got so excited
that I rushed into dr. Mira's office and

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:44.890
that I rushed into dr. Mira's office and
 

01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:50.229
that I rushed into dr. Mira's office and
take him to the talk although this

so I generated knockout mice and also

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:37.449
so I generated knockout mice and also
 

01:08:37.449 --> 01:08:40.499
so I generated knockout mice and also
knockout year cells to prove my own

01:08:40.499 --> 01:08:40.509
knockout year cells to prove my own
 

01:08:40.509 --> 01:08:44.560

ES cells have two important properties

01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:58.450
ES cells have two important properties
 

01:09:58.450 --> 01:10:01.720
ES cells have two important properties
the first one is the rapid proliferation

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:01.730
the first one is the rapid proliferation
 

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:16.450

um oh my god I I promise I didn't do

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:25.830
um oh my god I I promise I didn't do
 

01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:34.840

the other important property is

01:10:49.650 --> 01:10:49.660
the other important property is
 

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:52.720
the other important property is
important see their ability to

important see their ability to
 

01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:55.420
important see their ability to
differentiate into virtually all types

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:55.430
