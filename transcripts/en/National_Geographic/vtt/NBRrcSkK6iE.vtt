JEDIDAH ISLER:
<i>Studying science changed me</i>

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:05.505
<i> and it allows me to make
contributions into the world.</i>

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.274
<i> And everyone,
regardless of their identity,</i>

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.976
<i> should have that right.</i>

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:14.446
<i>We cannot get to the best
 possible exploration,</i>

00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:16.582
<i> whether it's on this
 planet or beyond,</i>

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:19.919
<i>if we don't have the totality
 of people in the room</i>

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.754
<i> to contribute to
 the conversation.</i>

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:24.290 line:0%
( audience applauding )

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.759
( audience laughing )

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.129
I am going to be
an astrophysicist.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.733
Now, it wasn't quite that loud
and probably not that confident

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:37.336 line:0%
when I was sitting in a
library as a 12 year old girl,

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:40.373 line:0%
and I figured out what I
wanted to be when I grew up.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:42.308 line:0%
I wanted to be an
astrophysicist.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:45.211
And, with such an
earth-rending discovery,

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.648
the first thing I had to do
was run back to base camp

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.283
and tell everyone there.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:52.452
So, I ran home,
burst in the door.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:55.154
I said, "Mom, I'm going
to be an astrophysicist

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:57.189
"when I grow up!"
( audience chuckling )

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:58.458
I was so excited.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.993
It was one of the
first times in life

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:01.627
that I had
compellingly connected

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:04.196
my identity and my interests.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.699
So, I looked up at her and
I waited with bated breath

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.236
to hear what she was gonna say,
and she said...

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:14.473
"Huh, okay.
( audience laughing )

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:17.944
"Well, let's do it then,"
and we were off to the races.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:20.612
That was one of the most
critical moments in my life

00:01:20.612 --> 00:01:22.682
because she confirmed
right in that moment

00:01:22.682 --> 00:01:25.785
with her unflinching,
unwavering support

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:28.621
that who I was and
what I wanted to be

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.523
were perfectly compatible

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:32.858
and that they were well within
the realm of possibility.

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:35.462
<i> And sure, I've had
 role models since then,</i>

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:38.397
<i> like Doctor Mae Jemison
 and Doctor Beth Brown,</i>

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:41.334
<i> both black women,
astronaut and astrophysicist.</i>

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.536
But that first
moment with my Mom,

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.605
I'm sure is what
set me on the course

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.675
from that moment to this.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.344
Now, it wasn't until much
later that she told me

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.413
that when I ran in and told
her what I wanted to be

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:57.249
that she had zero idea
what an astrophysicist was

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.185
or what they did, but she knew

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.721
that if anyone
could do it, I could

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.890
and I'm so thankful
for that moment.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.461
Now, it's been roughly
a couple decades

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:12.064
and I did ultimately
become an astrophysicist.

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:14.233
So, I'm very excited
to report that.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.467
So, I'll tell you
a little bit today

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:17.169
about my research on blazars.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.473
<i>So, blazars, what are they?</i>

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.776
<i> Supermassive,
 hyperactive black holes</i>

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:26.011
<i> that sit at the
 center of galaxies.</i>

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.446
<i>I'm showing you, here, real data</i>

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:30.282
<i> from the Hubble Space
Telescope, Ultra-Deep Field.</i>

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:32.952
<i> Everything you see
 here is a galaxy.</i>

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:35.354
<i> Every single galaxy,
 we now believe,</i>

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:38.424
<i> has a supermassive
 black hole at its core.</i>

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:39.859
<i> Pretty much, you know,
most of these black holes</i>

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.027
<i>are going about the business
 of being black holes,</i>

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:44.763
<i> eating things, doing the
normal black hole things.</i>

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:47.866
But, there is a
special class of them

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:50.103
that's doing a little bit more.

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:52.371
These are called quasars.

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.775
They are gargantuan
championship eaters

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.610
in the black hole taxonomy.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.880
They're millions to billions
the times of our own sun,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.081
and are taking on a
thousand times more

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:04.750
than the "humdrum" black holes,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.120
like the ones
at the center of our galaxy.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.721
So, they are bringing in
tons and tons of material.

00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:12.024
And, while the black
hole itself is black,

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.792
nothing is escaping it,

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.395
what you see around it
are the SOS signals,

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:17.729
the death gasps of material

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:21.267
as it's being pulled
into that black hole.

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:24.703
Beyond that, some of these
quasars have these jets,

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:26.605
we'll talk about that
in just a second,

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:28.674
have these jets that
are ejecting material

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:31.743
out of near the central source,

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:34.147
that are going roughly
the speed of light.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:35.981
So, these are really
the championship,

00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:39.485
most powerful sources
in our universe.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:43.355
I study blazars, which
are blazing quasars.

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:46.258
So, you take this quasar
that's doing the th... You see?

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:49.028
We're building a story here,
come along with me. ( laughs )

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.030
( audience laughing )

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.565
We do the blazing
quasars, right?

00:03:52.565 --> 00:03:54.100
So, now you take this jet

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.636
that's moving at 99.99%
of the speed of light

00:03:57.636 --> 00:04:00.172
and you point it at the Earth.

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:02.175
It got really quiet.
( audience laughing )

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.409
You point it at the Earth.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.544
You should not be
afraid, though.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:05.711
These are cosmological
distances,

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.279
so we are not in any danger.

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:10.416
This is just a benefit of the
observational positioning.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:13.119
So, we care about these
because they are pointed at us.

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:17.356
So, what you want to do is
understand how these jets work.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:20.092
So, I'm gonna show you a
video, in just a second,

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:22.295
about how the
blazar system works,

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.130
how a black hole
pulls on material

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.998
and then, how we think
it creates a jet.

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:28.134
Now, this is not real data,
this is magic.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.635
It's an artist conception

00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:31.871
but I wanted you to see so you
have a picture in your mind

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.306
as we're going
through this story.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.674
<i> So, what you're gonna
 see is a black hole</i>

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:37.310
<i> with an accretion
 disk surrounding it,</i>

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.078
<i>that's how material falls
 onto the black hole.</i>

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:41.180
<i> Then, the jet
 shoots out material</i>

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.615
<i> and then, we're gonna
 zoom out of that</i>

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.750
<i>and we'll see that we're sitting
in the middle of a galaxy.</i>

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.985
<i> And, the thing that
 I want you to notice</i>

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:48.221
<i> about that jet is that
 it's not continuous.</i>

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:51.190
<i>It's sort of got particles
 and material in it.</i>

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.360
<i> So, the idea, the thing
we want to figure out, is:</i>

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.761
<i> How does this jet work?</i>

00:04:55.761 --> 00:04:59.665
<i>How do we understand nature's
 particle accelerator?</i>

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:01.533
<i> How do you get things
 moving that fast?</i>

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:03.536
They start off moving
relatively slow,

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.171
like water going
down a dish drain,

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.039
and then they start to
speed up to these speeds.

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.908
<i> That's the question.</i>

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:11.911
<i>So, what we've found in our
group is that on some level</i>

00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.613
<i>and in some of these huge
 ejections of material,</i>

00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:16.515
<i> the technical term
 is actually, "blobs,"</i>

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:18.317
<i> which I think is the
 coolest thing ever,</i>

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:21.220
<i> you can constrain
 the kind of physics.</i>

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.189
<i>You can decide... You can
limit what kinds of physics</i>

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.824
can actually be possible.

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:27.927
So, that's the actual,
like, research that I do.

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:29.428
But, in doing it, I realized

00:05:29.428 --> 00:05:31.931
that research is
not done in a vacuum

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.901
and that, in fact,
it was sort of an oddity

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:37.336
that I was the one
doing the work.

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.739
So, I started to think
about that and wonder,

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:41.907
"How is it that
we can make STEM,

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:44.744
or Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics,

00:05:44.744 --> 00:05:46.345
more inclusive?"

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:48.947
Studying science changed me

00:05:48.947 --> 00:05:51.851
and it allows me to make
contributions into the world,

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.620
and everyone,
regardless of their identity,

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.589
should have that right.

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.090
So then, I started
thinking about,

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.192
"Well, how could I do this
and who would I start with?"

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:01.560
And, I decided to start

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.130
with those with
intersectional identities,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.498
that is, identities
that overlap.

00:06:06.498 --> 00:06:09.434
So, I chose to look
into women of color

00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:11.270
who want to pursue STEM degrees.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.205
So, I started an
online web series,

00:06:13.205 --> 00:06:14.707
which you can go and check out,

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:18.711
called<i> Vanguard: Conversations
with Women of Color in STEM.</i>

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.345
<i>We meet about once a month</i>

00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:22.682
<i> and we talk about
 all kinds of things.</i>

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:24.684
<i> It's a pretty informal
 place, but the idea is</i>

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:28.354
<i> to confirm and affirm
 identity and interest,</i>

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:30.790
so that there's no preferred
combination of those two

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.526
and that anyone could
be anything they want.

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:38.097
So, I host the show and it's
a group of rotating panels.

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:39.732
So, we have a bunch
of women of color

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:41.234
in all kinds of
different fields,

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.435
from graduate all the way
up to Deans of colleges,

00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:45.238
that tell us about
their experience.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.805
They tell us about
their expertise

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:48.073
and they give us advice

00:06:48.073 --> 00:06:50.776
about how to do this
process even better.

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:53.879
In this way, we're trying
to form and cement community

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:56.249
so that no one
feels alone or othered

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.217
because of who they are
and what they want to do.

00:06:59.217 --> 00:07:01.787
We decided that there
was so much interest

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:03.422
that we wanted to do even more,

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:06.192
so not just meet once a month
and have this conversation,

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.427
but really start
to build community.

00:07:08.427 --> 00:07:09.428
And, it would be important that

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:11.130
that community be virtual

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.066
because we're spread so many
places across the country

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:15.734
and across the globe.

00:07:15.734 --> 00:07:18.637
So, now we built a team,
and we are planning

00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:22.474
to make Vanguard STEM the
go-to, premier destination

00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:25.678
for STEM identity in
women of color in STEM.

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:28.080 line:0%
<i>So, here is an example of
some of our recent content.</i>

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.849 line:0%
<i> It's created and curated
by women of color in STEM,</i>

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:32.351 line:0%
<i>so we get their vantage point.</i>

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.219 line:0%
<i> You are welcome to come
 join us, come visit,</i>

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.455
<i> support, any way
 you want to engage,</i>

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:37.856
<i> but this is a safe space</i>

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:39.658
<i> for us to investigate
 those things</i>

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:41.293
<i>that come up in our minds.</i>

00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:45.931
This idea that interest
and identity are related

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:49.868
and can be in any combination
is an important concept,

00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:55.374
but I'm not saying this by way
of asking to join the club.

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:58.377
I'm saying it
because we cannot get

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:01.180
to the best possible
exploration,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.282
whether it's on this
planet or beyond,

00:08:03.282 --> 00:08:06.686
if we don't have the totality
of people in the room

00:08:06.686 --> 00:08:08.387
to contribute to
the conversation.

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:12.657
So, if we want to get to
our best possible successes,

00:08:12.657 --> 00:08:14.660
our best possible discoveries,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.462
then everyone has
to be at the table.

00:08:17.462 --> 00:08:18.931
So, let's explore.

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:19.865
Thank you.

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:21.400
