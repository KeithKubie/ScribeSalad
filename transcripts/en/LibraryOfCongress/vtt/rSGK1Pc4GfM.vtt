&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.600
&gt;&gt; Sasha Dowdy: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.320
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.830
[Inaudible] for all.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.190
Welcome, welcome, to the
historic Coolidge Auditorium,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.050
the Library of Congress
After Hours.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.180
It's going to be a
really good panel.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.970
So to introduce myself,
my name is Sasha Dowdy.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.920
I work here at the library
as program specialist

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.220
at the Young Readers Center.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.740
So I do programming for
kids who are under 16,

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.500
but sometimes I do
programming for kids over 16.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.790
So that's why we're all here.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.970
We have had a series of
events in conjunction

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.590
with Otakon here at the library.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.250
So we're really excited
to present

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.310
to you a very, very
special guest.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.500
And now we're going to have a
panel with two library staff,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.650
and they're going to speak to
an incredible person that we're

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.920
so excited to have here:
Mister Hirokatsu Kihara.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.090
He's a writer and
producer formally involved

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.650
with the production
desk at Studio Ghilbi ,

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.360
and he was involved in the
hit anime such as "Laputa:

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.210
Castle in the Sky," and
"My Neighbor Totoro,"

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.630
and "Kiki's Delivery Service."

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.470
Any fans of these
movies in here?

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.920
[ Applause ]

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.520
So now he writes ghost stories,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.710
and he MCs at monster
conventions.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.090
So there's a lot going on here.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.790
His most famous work is "Tales
of Terror: Haunted Apartment."

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.800
So -- And he's been
a crucial contributor

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.900
to many other hits in the genre.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.320
And he's going to be interviewed
by two library staff members.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.800
Maureen Cohen Harrington.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.730
She's a senior counsel
in the library's office

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.030
of the general counsel.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.530
That's lawyers.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.560
And she feels fortunate
that her law gig allows her

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.380
to explore and expand interests.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.390
She has an undergrad degree
in radio, television, film,

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.800
and has been to many comic
and pop culture conventions.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.440
So when she's not here,
she's at San Diego Comic-Con

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.700
and Awesome Con and on and on.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.700
She's kind of new to anime so
she is going to learn about it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.090
as she talks with her coworker
in general counsel's office,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.570
Anthony Dunn, where
he goes by Ant.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.810
He is a lover of food,
design, cool socks,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.290
anime, and all things nerdy.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.870
So he's one of us.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.380
They're both fans of pop
culture, and inline skating,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.470
and they discover
lots of new things.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.290
And, in the spirit of Library
of Congress being an institution

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.110
of learning, we're all going to
learn something new together.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.890
So let's welcome Mister
Kihara, Maureen, and Ant.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.690
Come on out.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:51.630

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.970

Harrington: Hello.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.570

&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen Harrington: Hi.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.750
Welcome. And welcome to
the Library of Congress.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.500
We are very honored
to have you here.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.800
&gt;&gt; Hirokatsu Kihara:
Nice to meet you.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.630
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen: And we
are glad you were able

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.370
to take a tour of the
library before our event now.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.220
What do you think
of our library?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.390
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: First let
me introduce myself.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.200
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I want to
thank Otakon and the Library

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.510
of Congress for having
me here today.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.110
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm truly
grateful that I was able

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.940
to meet everybody today.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.330
Thanks to them, I'm very happy.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.830
Okay. Now ask me anything.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.130
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen
Harrington: Well,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.950
what do you think
of the library?

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.510
What did you think of
what you saw today?

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.240
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Great.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.900
[ Laughter ]

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.640
&gt;&gt; Hirokatsu Kihara: Amazing.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.110
Marvelous.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.690
Fantastic.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's unbelievable.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:22.510
You never see this
kind of thing in Japan.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.260
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The powers
of books made in to art.

[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was very moved.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.550
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen
Harrington: Thank you.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.850
Thank you.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You guys --

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.140
You don't know how
great you have it.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.480
&gt;&gt; Anthony Dunn: Yeah.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.950
[ Applause ]

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.260
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen Harrington:
I loved watching when you went

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.560
to the main reading room.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.860
You just looked up.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.510
It was so beautiful to watch.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:06.840
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He read about this
place when he was very little.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.180
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He looked at
the pictures of this building,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.350
and said he wanted to
visit this place one day.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:27.130
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He never
imagined, and is truly surprised

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.510
that the first time
he's here he's on stage.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.280
[ Applause ]

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.010
It took 50 years,
you know to get here.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.030
It was my goal.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.050
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He's very honored
to be here, to meet everybody.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.640
Okay. How about anime questions?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.940
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen Harrington: Oh.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.240
Anime. Yes.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.540
Yes. Okay.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.840
&gt;&gt; Anthony Dunn: First
of all, we're honored

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.140
to have you here, Mister Kihara.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.130
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.410
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen Harrington:
So, for anime questions, I'm --

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.610
Unlike Anthony, I
am new to anime.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.420
So where do you start?

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.070
What -- As I am just
learning for the first time,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.620
what in your words, in
other people's words,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.850
do you think is a good
thing to see or to study

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.510
or to enter this world?

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:45.900
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think it's true
for everybody that you want

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.510
to see something that's
made in your own country.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:07:19.920
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.480
I think that you
should see what people

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.370
in your country have made.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.840
Walt Disney's, you know,
"Steamboat Willie," [inaudible]

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.280
and Betty Boop and Popeye.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.160
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.510
It's created for kids, but
not by children, of course.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.050
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.510
Grown ups made something
for the children.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:58.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.700
So I think it's the best to
see something that was made

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.510
for children in your
own country.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.050
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.840
If you think that's
amazing, the next step is

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.010
to see something
from other countries.

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.310
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.550
Definitely it is I grew
up on Disney cartoons.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.850
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen
Harrington: Really?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I loved
the [inaudible] brothers.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:32.860
I think it's the same
as everybody, right?

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.610
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen Harrington: So
what about your work, though?

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.770
When we're ready to move
to your work or if we want

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.360
to just skip a step
and go there,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.510
what would your favorite be?

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.190

the 30th anniversary

when it came out
in the theaters.

It's truly an honor to come
here to D.C on that special year

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.970
to talk about "Totoro."

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:26.300
You know, the place that I
had imagined since childhood.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:33.510
I was 28 years old at the time.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:38.040

me, "You can do it.

know the inside information

It hasn't actually been
announced yet in Japan

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.370
so I think it's a miracle
that I can talk about it

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.900
in a library, of all places.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.310

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.510
I feel that I was born
to be doing this today.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.810
It's really an honor that I can
be here in front of everybody,

and say the word "Totoro."

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.730

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:53.620
So you started to
talk about this a bit.

What led you down
this career path?

Either personal experiences
or artistic, cultural,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:18.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just watched
a lot of TV when I was little.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.090
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen
Harrington: We all do.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.190
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Then I started
to read books and manga.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:36.240
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.020
I think it's true for everybody,
but I started to get curious

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.510
about how is this made.

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:48.220
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.400
And then I started to think that
I wanted to be part of that too,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.510
and bring joy to everybody.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:12:03.750
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.660
So I went through phases when
I was little that I wanted

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.920
to create movies, I
wanted to create manga,

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.360
and I wanted to write.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.710
All those things.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.760
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:23.030
At one point I wanted to create
[inaudible] and "Godzilla."

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:27.510
And then my friend Anno Hideaki
finally created "Godzilla."

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.510
[ Applause ]

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:46.000
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then when I
was eight years old I watched

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.450
"Horus, Price of the
Sun" by Isao Takahata

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.650
and Hayao Miyazaki, and
I wanted to become --

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.510
join the animation industry.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:05.050
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.360
So I worked hard so that
I could work side by side

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.660
with these great people.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.610
And then, 20 years
later, it came true.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:12.510
&gt;&gt; Hirokatsu Kihara:
Don't give up.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:18.040
[ Applause ]

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.310
&gt;&gt; Anthony Dunn:
So you said you --

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:23.000
How'd you meet Mister Miyazaki?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.950
Like did you -- You said you
worked hard to get there.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:30.990
So how did you like, you
know, actually meet him?

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:35.510
And become a member
of Studio Ghilbi.

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:52.910
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So I joined
[inaudible] a company,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.030
the studio that created
"Nausicaa

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.830
of the Valley of the Wind."

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:05.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.750
I didn't join because it
was making "Nausicaa,"

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.340
but because it was a company
that was producing animation

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.170
in collaboration with
the United States.

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:18.140
Have you ever heard of Topcraft?

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:19.940
Topcraft?

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:26.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.400
I used to -- It's a studio
that created animation for the

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.510
"Hobbit" and "The Last Unicorn."

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:43.300
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:49.510
Also [inaudible] who was
a producer at the time.

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.680
They were working
in collaboration

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.510
with Topcraft in Japan.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.020
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.310
When I was in high school
I took a studio tour,

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:07.010
and I wanted to --

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.310
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:15.510
But then Hayo Miyazaki liked
me, and then we made "Nausicaa."

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.070
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:22.010
Then I graduated college, and
then officially joined Topcraft.

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:23.440
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.510
But a year and a half later
this studio collapsed.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:38.320
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.510
And then the president of
the studio at the time said

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:43.480
that we were making this
movie called "Nausicaa."

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.510
So please, you know,
work on that.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:50.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:53.390
[Inaudible] is the --
[Inaudible] is the person,

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:59.010
the president, of
Ghibli at the time.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:00.310
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:06.510
So he was boss of -- my boss
at the time at Topcraft.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:20.890
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.290
So he said that, "I saw
your work at Topcraft,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.600
and admire your endurance
and your fighting spirit."

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.510
And he thought that he
could control Miyazaki.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:50.060
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.310
It sounds unbelievable,
but I really wanted to work

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.520
with Miyazaki so I showed
up to work every single day.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.040
The very first one in office,

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.290
and left after the
very last person.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:01.590
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen
Harrington: Wow.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.390
&gt;&gt; Anthony Dunn: Wow.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:07.290
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So I told
myself, "Hard work.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:09.890
Hard work.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.690
Hard work."

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:26.900
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.200
[Inaudible] Miyazaki
told [inaudible]

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.480
"Don't let this guy quit."

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.410
And he had to make
this guy keep going.

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.190
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.510
At the time he didn't know why.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.330
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.620
And then one day he patted me on
the shoulder and turned around,

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.600
and he -- Miyazaki was there.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.510
&gt;&gt; Hirokatsu Kihara: What?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:57.060
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And he told
me, "You and I are going

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.820
to make Totoro together."

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:08.510
And that is how "Totoro"
was made 30 years ago.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:16.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:21.020
After making "Castle in the
Sky," they were producing

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.510
"Grave of the Fireflies."

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:32.680
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:35.740
So I don't know if you guys
noticed, but "Totoro" and "Grave

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.200
of the Fireflies" was
shown as a double feature.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.510
"Grave of the Fireflies"
started production first.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:49.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.950
But it was good that when
we started working --

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:53.250
I started working with Miyazaki,

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.170
but then the studio
told us to leave.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.510
&gt;&gt; Hirokatsu Kihara: Get out.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:03.060
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because they had
to use the studio to produce

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.860
"Grave of the Fireflies"
so they told us to leave,

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.510
and build a new studio.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:20.140
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.820
So we're doing a long history

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:25.100
of Ghibli during this
production stage of "Totoro"

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.660
and "Grave of the Fireflies."

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.510
There were two studios.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.140
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.590
"Totoro" was created in this --

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:38.340
the second studio that was
only created for that time.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:43.600
And after "Totoro" it
was consolidated back

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.010
in to a single studio again.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.310
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:52.170
And that was "Kiki's
Delivery Service."

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:59.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.420
So if you have a special
fondness for "Totoro,"

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:07.510
that was born under
special circumstances.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:20.160
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.010
So you can imagine how insane
it was to be producing "Totoro"

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:29.030
and "Grave of the
Fireflies" at the same time.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.320
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen Harrington: Is
there a character that you --

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.350
You are so animated yourself

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.720
that I can see why you
are drawn to animation.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.120
Is there a character who
you relate with most closely

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.510
or feel the most bonded?

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:47.580
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.510

[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:05.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:10.010
Always laughing all
the time in the studio.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.350
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.010
And then became the
model for the cat voice.

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.510
[ Screeching ]

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.510

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.230
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Hayao Miyazaki
told me that his happiness is

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.510
to be laughing and running.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:38.150
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.380
But saying you're sad when
you're sad, and being upset

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.700
when you're upset doesn't
really change anything.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:47.030
Then why don't we just
laugh with everybody?

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.510
Being able to laugh at
work will bring you hope.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:22:01.110
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.940
We were rushed in production.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.370
We were not making
anything on time.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.000
We had to do all this painting,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.510
and nothing was being
made on time, but --

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:17.110
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:20.200
And then we would
all get together and,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.510
okay, it's thinking time.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:28.940

They say that when
you're laughing,

then you can create
better ideas.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:40.470

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:44.110
There's only a 10 day

"You're not going
to make it on time."

they refused to cut corners.

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:41.510
That's why they tried hard.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.780
That means 75,000 individual
pieces of [inaudible]

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.510
that got painted by hand.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:58.070
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:02.510
And that was -- This was
all completed in 10 months.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:06.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.020
And this is incredible work.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.320
It's all hand drawn.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.620
Not digital.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:17.510
There was no software back then.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:26.020
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.320
Unimaginable.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.550
Clicking, you know,
each person that had

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.510
to be hand photographed.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:36.920
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.510
People who give up
can't do animation.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.190
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:48.260
So people who love animation
are people who don't give up.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.180
So that's why he has --
They have his respect.

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.510
That is true for everybody here.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.240
[ Applause ]

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.980
&gt;&gt; Anthony Dunn: So what was
your favorite movie to work at,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:08.510
work on, at Studio Ghibli?

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:20.360
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: "Castle
in the Sky" was --

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.510
created the most hardship
for everybody, though.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:31.250
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.850
"Kiki's Delivery
Service" was the one

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:36.570
that had the hardest schedule,
and everybody had to, you know,

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.510
be rushing from the start.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:45.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.770
"Totoro" looks so fun on screen,

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:53.510
but in the very beginning
Miyazaki gave me one order.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:27:02.130
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.430
This is a fun movie.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.160
You have to be having
fun making it.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:09.510
That is my only order to you.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:16.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.290
So I felt that somebody had
to be, you know, smiling

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.030
and laughing somewhere
in this idea.

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:27.200
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.630
I mean that's an ideal, but
it's hard to do when you --

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:34.010
You know, it's a tough schedule.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:35.310
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:40.510
But I think it was
possible just for "Totoro."

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:46.260
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.580
"Castle in the Sky" was tough
because I had to manage a studio

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:52.510
at the same time as
working on the production.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:58.880
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.640
"Kiki's" was behind schedule
from the very beginning.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.510
So that's why it was tough.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:18.190
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:21.090
I think it's amazing that
Miyazaki continues to be loved

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.750
around the world after 30 years.

00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:30.250
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.370
Because I never gave up,
and always worked hard,

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:36.560
the result is that I'm here
today in front of all of you.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.510
And grateful to every
single one of you.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:44.710
[ Applause ]

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.510
&gt;&gt; Anthony Dunn: So what
made you leave Studio Ghibli?

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.140
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That
is a tough question.

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:07.270
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:11.510
So it was "Kiki's" that
finally became profitable.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:16.750
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.510
Financially, "Castle in
the Sky" was not a success.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.210
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:28.070
It just wasn't a failure.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.120
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:36.510
But Kiki's was a big success.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:41.420
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:47.510
And sold a lot of laser disks
which was unknown at the time.

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:53.120
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.160
When a studio becomes
financially profitable,

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.510
it attracts a lot of people.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:02.420
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:08.270
And they don't necessarily
love the medium.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.510
&gt;&gt; Hirokatsu Kihara: It's money.

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:18.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It becomes hard
to work when there's a lot

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.250
of people who don't feel love
for what they're creating.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:39.170
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.720
I'd become like a
hindrance to the people

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.510
who were trying to make money.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.710
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.180
Because I'm thinking about the,
you know -- every single worker.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:58.510
I want to be on the side of
the staff and the director.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:07.150
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.910
For people on the
business side of things,

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:14.480
that's not necessarily
a good thing.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.510
That's why I left.

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:23.890
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.950
Before that, I had to
manage the schedules

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:30.510
and audio of 200 people.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:34.150
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:39.310
So I just wanted to take
care of myself from then on.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.510
And that's how I
became a writer.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:32:09.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.350
So then since a lot of animists
use new media, they started

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.470
to call on me for
uncredited help

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.510
with various stages
of production.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:27.410
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.710
So [inaudible] first --

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.520
Eventually they went on
to create [inaudible]

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.090
but on the first
animated they worked on,

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:38.510
I did a lot of work for them.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:47.620
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.200
And there was also a
movie called "Gundam F91"

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.870
which I did a lot of work on to
get them to release on schedule.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.880
I just told them
to not credit me.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.200
I didn't want it.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:09.050
Because I got my, you know,
fame through Miyazaki.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.080
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.600
Because if I put my name
out there, then there's only

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.900
like three other people

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.010
who don't get their
work appreciated.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.310
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:25.510
So I shouldn't take their,
you know, spot [inaudible].

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:28.080
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.040
So it looks like my work

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:35.040
in animation just stopped
after I left Ghibli.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.070
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.200
But there's a lot of people

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.070
in the animation
industry right now who,

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:44.510
you know, started work with me.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:50.080
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.540
So I'm very happy that so many

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.720
of my friends are still
continuing in making anime

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.510
in the industry right now.

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:13.300
There's a movie right now called
"In the Corner of this World."

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:18.970
Mister Katabuchi used to work on
-- On "Kiki's Delivery Service?"

He was an assistant director.

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.370
And the super hit "Your Name,"
the art director for that work,

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:52.040
Mister [inaudible] was one
of the very first people

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.390
who got hired by Ghibli.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.110
It was "Code Geass."

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.410

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I personally chose
Mister [inaudible] who worked

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.250
on "Code Geass," and he --

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:26.510
hand picked him to
be working on Ghibli.

[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:38.360
So all these seeds that were
planted along the way has been

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:45.510
[inaudible] to find trees,
and he's very proud of that.

on the animation of "Code Geass"

or just the entire story?

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.750

introducing the people

who worked on it for working
at Ghibli at the time,

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:05.380
who were working on these
other different works.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.060
He can answer that.

about your book series,

the "Tales of Tokyo
and All of Japan."

How -- What was your
inspiration behind it,

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.500
to start like writing
this series, ghost series?

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:52.560
There wasn't as much, you know,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.550
very brightening
things back then.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:58.430
So it was very dark.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:02.510

were very old.

[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:09.180
So just like "Totoro," there
were these strange things

in the corner of your vision.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:20.760

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.850
Like these glowing
things suddenly appeared,

and then disappeared
in to the wall.

[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.210
I was working on "Castle in
the Sky" and I was driving

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.340
down the street at 3 AM.

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.510
It was 3 AM, and pitch black.

And in the cross walk ahead

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.860
of him there was a
kindergartner walking

00:37:54.860 --> 00:38:00.940
across the street wearing
the stereotypical yellow hat

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.150
that kindergartners wear
with a yellow satchel.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:07.230
On the knees and below.

So you can experience
these things even

when you're growing up.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:30.960
So I took these mysterious
things,

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.510
and put them in to books.

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.580
Sure. Sure.

00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:58.040
I can sign.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:07.250
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:14.390
They do have an autograph
session at Otakon, right?

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:17.320
He doesn't [inaudible].

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.610
Can I do this here?

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:23.880
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen Harrington:
We'll talk afterwards.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.180
Yeah.

00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:26.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He says
he can sign things

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.450
for you anywhere if you want.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:37.950
&gt;&gt; Maureen Cohen
Harrington: Next question.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:40.250
&gt;&gt; Anthony Dunn: Yeah.

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:44.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: My question
is what do you think are the

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.110
qualities that make
a good story.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:53:15.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:19.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The most important
thing is basic human emotions.

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:23.510
Not bad ones, but positive ones.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:42.470
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:49.300
[Inaudible] people who feel sad
to be doubtful about things,

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:53.510
to be in conflict
with other people.

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:56.810
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:53:56.810 --> 00:54:00.580
If it's just "The Avengers,"
you can't make a movie.

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:03.010
You need Thanos.

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:05.510
[ Laughter ]

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:10.310
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:15.080
You need, you know, the very
bad people to become, you know,

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:18.030
in conflict with somebody.

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.040
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.130
But you need a straightforward
somebody with a true heart

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:29.510
of justice to be -- to
stand up against them.

00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:32.240
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:38.510
That heart does exist in the
very young, and the very old.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:46.260
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:49.310
He thinks it's very awesome
when an old man, you know,

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:53.180
can say thank you to a champion
of justice, but refuses to bow

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:57.510
down against the evil.

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:00.290
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:04.510
I think that's a common
thread among all humanity.

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:13.930
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:15.230
Film is just, you know,

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:19.490
one medium of communicating
that kind of thing.

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:23.510
A panel is the same thing too.

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:26.340
[ Foreign Language Spoken ]

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:30.290
You know, if I don't give you
my heart, then you don't --

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:31.590
you think it's boring.

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:32.890
&gt;&gt; Hirokatsu Kihara: Enjoy?

00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:34.190
