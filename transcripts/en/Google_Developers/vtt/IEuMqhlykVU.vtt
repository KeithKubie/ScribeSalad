00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.950
ALTAN ACIKGOZ: BiTaksi
is a mobile application

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.650
that is connecting taxi
drivers with customers.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.700
We have more than
one million customers

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.740
in Istanbul and Ankara.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.540
And also we have taxi
drivers, more than 10,000.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.520
HALID OZSOY: We receive
a feedback from our,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.660
one of our visually
impaired client.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.530
And they blogged about it.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:34.050
And then we understand that
the challenges for that people

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.150
to hail a taxi.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.690
BiTaksi is using Android's
TalkBack feature.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.810
And we improved our service
by using that feature,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.340
and support visually
impaired people

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.390
to hail taxis on the street.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.260
By TalkBack option, they
can know the driver that's

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.670
coming to them, what is the
plate, how far is the driver,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.350
and when the driver comes,
the driver helps them also.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.820
Because they know that their
client is visually impaired.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.190
ALTAN ACIKGOZ: We
started with cash,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.470
and then one year later, we
added credit card payment.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.520
After some time, we added three
more mobile payment systems

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.640
inside of the application.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.230
These are [? Tuksum ?]
Mobile payment,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.040
Paypal and [? PayCom ?] Express.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.910
We will accept the [INAUDIBLE]
payments in the next month.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.310
And this will be the
first application

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.600
that can accept contact-less
card by using NFC in Turkey.
