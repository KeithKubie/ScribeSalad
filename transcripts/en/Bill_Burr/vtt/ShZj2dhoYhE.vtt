1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.680
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.950
<v 1>Bonjour tout le monde et bienvenu à la Jeudi</v>

3
00:00:06.141 --> 00:00:11.141
après midi just avant vendredi podcast et lundi matin et

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.260
je just checking in sur vous.

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.560
What's up mother fuckers bonjour,
uh,

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.730
je m'appelle Guillaume et je suis dans le Paris and I'm a little buzzed.

7
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.451
I'm not gonna lie to you.

8
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:32.150
I had a couple of does seize soixante quatre s'il vous plaît oui monsieur.

9
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.210
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.300
<v 1>Um,

uh,
um,
la même chose,</v>

11
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.510
uh,
monsieur or whatever the fuck,
I don't know.

12
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.240
You want to use one of my completely shit faced right now is because I have a

13
00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:49.600
kid.
That's another good reason for becoming a parent.

14
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.350
It's not because you want to raise a good person and experience a level of love

15
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.360
that you've never felt before.

16
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.600
It's really because you failed in your own attempts at sobriety and you're too

17
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:10.330
much of a loner and your two antisocial to ever go to Aa.

18
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.790
That's the time to have long fall to have a kid,
a baby,
right.
Way,

19
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.520
a way that media,
ah,
yeah.

20
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.400
That way you said in the wig,
you sound like some dumb tourist,
right?

21
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.160
Yes.

22
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.550
If it's funny over here is I've been just fucking torturing these people with my

23
00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:33.880
French and I don't give a fuck when they start speaking English back to me.

24
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:34.930
I don't switch you over.

25
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.950
I'm going to fucking sit there and search for the word and you're going to sit

26
00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:40.240
there and fucking take it.

27
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.980
Like you have the biggest fucking more on ever sitting across from you on the

28
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:49.981
$10,000 pyramid and the clock's ticking and you ain't went in mayard baby.

29
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.380
MMM.
I fucking love it over here.

30
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.190
I love the people.
I love the food.
I,

31
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.470
I could literally lose the next 20 years of my life staying over here pretending

32
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.770
that I'm an intellectual.

33
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.730
There's just something about getting shit faced in a cafe.

34
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.210
You just don't feel like,
you know,
we don't do it right in America where they,

35
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:18.310
they make it go inside where it's all dark and you got a hunch down and fucking,

36
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.300
it takes you like 20 minutes just for your eyes to adjust to see if does anybody

37
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:26.880
else in there,
right?
The person you've been hitting on is,
hey,
Mira,

38
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.030
her amen.
And Ressa.
Here comes pat.
Um,

39
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.200
out here they let you be a drunk in public.

40
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.010
You just sit there on the side of the new rule the street,
right?

41
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.800
And you fucking sit there with a sport coat on a little pocket square and you,

42
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:46.120
if you feel like you're reading,

43
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.950
I have not improved myself at all as a human being over here.

44
00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:55.450
And I could not be having more fun.

45
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.760
I've eaten a fucking bag at every God damn day.
Uh,

46
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.190
I've gone to know museums.

47
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.070
I went to the Notre Dam a way that went over there.

48
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.620
And finally I was just,
we went over that goal.
Let's take a fucking picture.

49
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.740
And what I love about my Klaff Mo proper fam is that,

50
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.140
uh,
she doesn't give a shit about that stuff either.

51
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.680
I told you that story when we went to [inaudible],
right?

52
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.130
And we did what everybody who doesn't give a fuck about art does.

53
00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:29.630
We went in there and we were like,
hey,

54
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.460
fuck the other 900 million square feet of art.
Where is the

55
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.040
Mollys Mona Lisa.
Right.

56
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.260
And they told us where it was and we went in there and we like,

57
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.680
there it is little bit bigger than a stamp.
You good?
I'm good.

58
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.430
Let's get the fuck Outta here.
And that was it.
That's it.

59
00:03:46.431 --> 00:03:50.780
We left thought,
oh gosh,
I don't know how we get out of there,
but we,

60
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.820
I don't remember the exact directions.
Okay.

61
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:56.060
But we've just fucking got out of there.
And,
uh,
you know,

62
00:03:56.061 --> 00:04:00.980
when we were coming into town,
oh,
which I used to know that word.
Um,

63
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.650
I wish I could've taken a video if I was ever teaching a class on creativity.

64
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.340
Okay.
First of all,
who the fuck would ever have me teach anything?
And secondly,

65
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.700
where do I get off acting?
Like I'm creative.

66
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.470
I'm a curmudgeon and I'm good at criticizing shit.
All right?
However,

67
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.650
I'm going to criticize this.
There was like,
fucking,

68
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.500
I think I already talked about this.
We would passing in front of,
uh,
uh,

69
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.430
the Lou and,
uh,

70
00:04:28.431 --> 00:04:33.431
they said stupid fucking glass pyramid that they made that I think a lot of

71
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:36.920
Parisian didn't like,
you know,
they don't like anything new.

72
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.190
Anything new is fucking,
you know,
I don't know.
I don't know what they call it.

73
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.800
A vulgar.
That's one of the best insults ever,

74
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.210
you know,

75
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.600
to describe something you just did and unless someone just said a bunch of f

76
00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:55.250
bombs,
then it's,
it's whatever.
But if you'd like to make fun of somebody's shirt,

77
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.730
the design of it and described it as vulgar.
Um,
I dunno.

78
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.770
It's about as deep as it gets for someone who doesn't curse I think.
Right.

79
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.770
So it was a sport coat on stage,
right?
Standing up there

80
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.590
like Johnny Carson still hosting the tonight show and they're working on their

81
00:05:12.591 --> 00:05:16.520
five minutes set.
I don't fucking know.
Anyways,
we would drive in.
You cut through

82
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.170
and at Blatt is a bunch of fucking tourists all standing up.

83
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.360
Having somebody else take the picture is they pretend to be like holding the top

84
00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:31.790
of the pyramid.
I swear to God,

85
00:05:31.791 --> 00:05:35.240
we drove by and it was like nine people all doing it at the same time,

86
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.160
you know?
And if I was ever a lip professor,

87
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.700
I would take a video of that and he'd go,
you see this shit right here?

88
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.030
If you want to be creating,
don't do that.

89
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.840
This is a difference between being inspired.

90
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.700
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.660
<v 1>By seeing somebody doing something and then just going up and doing exactly what</v>

92
00:05:56.661 --> 00:06:00.260
the fuck doing.
Yeah.
It's still going to be a great picture.

93
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.500
But what's going to happen is that's going to be the fucking hacky thing that

94
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.970
you do,
right?
Until somebody switches it up.
And this is what kills me.

95
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:12.560
This is going to be one person that switches up what you do with yourself in the

96
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:17.250
foreground of that stupid fucking glass pyramid in front of that.
You move,

97
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.950
right?
And if it gets enough hits and Lolz and uh,

98
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:23.030
oh my God,

99
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.560
this is the greatest Instagram photo ever than everybody will do that.

100
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.130
You know?
I don't know.
Someone will plank on it.

101
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:34.370
If people remember that the fucking moment of creativity,

102
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.620
laying face down on something.
I'm not laying face down and not doing anything.

103
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.570
I'm planking,
oh Jesus.

104
00:06:41.571 --> 00:06:44.710
Bill a couple of beers and you become even more [inaudible].
Huh?

105
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.830
Why don't you order a side order a templates here?
Um,

106
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.360
anyways,
I resent the fact that I have to still do these fucking things.

107
00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.150
All right.
I'm on vacation.
Do you go to work when you're on vacation?

108
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.520
I don't think you'd do.
Um,

109
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.090
my relatives came out to that show when I was in England and they bought me a

110
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.620
bottle.
I don't know why,

111
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.270
but they have salted caramel.
Oh my God.

112
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.060
Coco vodka liquor

113
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.320
and um,

114
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.850
it's just been sitting here staring at me and I gotta be honest with you.

115
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:25.760
I'm just wondering,
I got to know what that hangover feels like.

116
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
It's like you have a watch one of those as far as hangovers go,

117
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.020
you ever watch a sounds like it's almost nap time.
You have a hit.

118
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:38.390
You ever watched one of those things?
I'm like,
what the,

119
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:42.130
the army ranger training or navy navy seal trading.
Yeah.

120
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.480
This is like the hang like you think you had a fucking hangover?

121
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.880
Like you'd think you're out there,
right?

122
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:51.200
You think you're working out doing your little crossfit Shit and run up down the

123
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:53.960
street while I sit there and fucking cafe getting hammered,

124
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.380
wearing my little sport coat.
You know,
like you're fucking showing me up.

125
00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:01.670
Like I'm impressed with you and you think you're a bad ass.
Um,

126
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.650
then you watch that shit.

127
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.400
You watch what fucking army rangers and all those special force people,
right?

128
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:09.441
I mean,

129
00:08:09.441 --> 00:08:13.910
just next level fucking be the two people that Matt Damon plays in a movie.

130
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.643
You know what I mean?

131
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.760
Not The people that get applause as they trudged through the airport in their

132
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:24.080
fatigues to go sit and do a cubicle to order grenades that they're never going

133
00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:24.830
to throw.

134
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.660
These are the fucking people that a list movie stars play,
right?

135
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.630
Well,
this bottle here,
this is la.

136
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:36.890
I don't know if this is the fucking this hangover,
right?
You know what,
they,

137
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:38.450
when they lift up that fucking log,

138
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.730
those army ranges and there's like fucking 20 of them.

139
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.120
And then when somebody fucking falls over and pukes and they got to pick up

140
00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:46.700
their own puke can take it outside the zone and then they're out.

141
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.940
And now there's 19 year and then he got to hold up his wake.

142
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.610
Whatever that fucking metaphor is.
Oh my God.
You know,

143
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.980
fast would be out of that pit.

144
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.353
<v 0>Okay.</v>

145
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.780
<v 1>[inaudible] I like,
dude,
I need my back for the rest of my life.
Okay.</v>

146
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.710
And I don't need the pressure of everybody else's defendant on me and I'm the

147
00:09:06.711 --> 00:09:08.210
weak link in the chain.
I understand this.

148
00:09:08.211 --> 00:09:11.060
I'm barely surviving standing out here in the fucking Sun.

149
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.840
Forget about going over there and picking up a fucking telephone pole with

150
00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:18.740
fucking nine other people who,
who have the genetics of a fucking pit bull.

151
00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.160
Okay.
I don't,
I'm a lapdog.
Okay.

152
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:27.060
I'm the kind of dog that could go on a plane before they had that bullshit where

153
00:09:27.061 --> 00:09:29.930
you could say all this thing is like helping me emotionally.

154
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.540
Um,
I dunno.
I don't even want to talk about,
does that fill up enough time?

155
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.310
Fuck nine minutes.
This is like when I'm bombing on stage and I'm like,
Oh God,

156
00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:41.230
I just got to end this set.
I've got to do a half hour.

157
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.020
It's gotta be like 28 minutes,
right.
Nine minutes

158
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.420
Hamata fucking material.
Um,
so anyways,

159
00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:54.320
we are staying uh,
in the,
uh,
these what going I might say,

160
00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:57.190
what the fuck we gotta be some Weirdo.
Somehow we'll find me.

161
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.560
Then I got to fucking sit there and answer questions about how to start a

162
00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:04.460
podcast in Paris.
Excuse him.
Uh,
uh,

163
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.210
Mister Gamba is how you stay

164
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.570
only
Ellis D.
MMM.

165
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:20.850
Anyways,
plowing ahead.
So,
uh,
my condolence to my fellow Americans right now,
uh,

166
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.140
if you're not into baseball,
cause that's the only game in town baby.

167
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:27.980
And don't even talk to me about the w and NBA,
NBA.
I know it's much better.

168
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:32.050
The level of play is much better.
I understand that.
Okay.

169
00:10:32.051 --> 00:10:36.280
But that's like a,
you know,
it's very rare.
UFC did it.

170
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.230
You have [inaudible] you have see dead it and they went.

171
00:10:41.231 --> 00:10:44.350
Not only did they start after the big four or big three really,

172
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.890
and then hockey comes along,
but when you wait,
you wait until they had Seattle.

173
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.230
You wait till the ad Seattle and all this fucking rain drenched lumberjacks.

174
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.620
Okay?
Who are tired of all of those?

175
00:10:56.621 --> 00:10:59.740
Fucking ridiculous Harry fucking muffs up there.

176
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.950
Have another thing that they can focus their attention on.

177
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.490
You wait till the NHL is going to start nipping at the heels of a,

178
00:11:06.491 --> 00:11:10.360
I'm gonna say baseball.
I'm going to go with baseball.
All right?

179
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.640
They built a bunch of new stadiums.

180
00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:16.900
The steroid era is over and it just sort of settling into like,

181
00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:19.450
this is what we do.
You know,

182
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.720
if I were the owners in the MLB right now,
I would say,
all right,

183
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:27.520
we need some sort of synthetic fucking steroids.
All right?

184
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.120
We'll do it just like the pharmaceutical companies did with heroin.
Okay,

185
00:11:31.121 --> 00:11:36.100
we'll make a synthetic version of steroids and we'll just sort of leak it into

186
00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:36.700
a,
I dunno,

187
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.130
sunflower seeds and then all of a sudden all the fucking numbers are going to

188
00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.850
start going up.
Right?

189
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:44.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

190
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.890
<v 1>I mean,
didn't you like wrestling better when everyone was on roids?
I mean,</v>

191
00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:51.530
if they just would just let them work a five day work week,
you know,

192
00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:54.400
not work them into the ground.
What they fucking,
I mean,
writes a great,

193
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.600
aren't they at this point,
don't they have them like it?
Like the,
you know,

194
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:02.260
like weed,
you can have like the uh,
what do they call that thing there?

195
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:06.040
The little mister there,
you know,
little weed aroma thing.

196
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:07.630
You can buy the fuck.

197
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:10.930
Do you call that thing breathalyzer not on a breathalyzers for drinking and

198
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.210
driving bill.
Um,

199
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:17.490
you should have seen what the fucking breathalyzer it look like.

200
00:12:17.491 --> 00:12:20.310
When I took it at the police station when I got busted for drinking driving

201
00:12:20.311 --> 00:12:24.460
almost 30 fucking years ago.
It looks like a fucking,

202
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:27.520
like a bag pipe in a mixed with a Douche bag.

203
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.730
It's just giant rubber fucking hoes.
I blow into it,

204
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.330
I would just puffing up my cheeks.
Try not to blow into it.
Cause I knew,

205
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:38.380
I knew I had a big number.

206
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.400
I knew I had a number that even if I had a f Lee fucking Bailey,

207
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:44.650
I wasn't getting out of it.
You know,

208
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.400
might have to have a last name like Bush,
Kennedy,

209
00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:50.170
one of those fucking royalty names,

210
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.240
one of those regal fucking names that everybody in England refuses to recognize

211
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.900
that not only are they on par with the royal family,

212
00:12:58.901 --> 00:13:03.880
I would dare say that they're a little bit beyond were taken collars.
Um,

213
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.230
by the way,
I want to thank the country of Ireland.
All right,

214
00:13:09.231 --> 00:13:13.520
but coming up with a fucking jumpers.
All right.
This thing has been the shit.

215
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.510
Late night in Paris,
walking around smoking a cigar,
you know,

216
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:20.630
with my stupid fucking Brian Johnson ACDC hat on.

217
00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:25.100
I really look like the old man that I am and uh,
I'm enjoying it.

218
00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:30.290
You know,
God,
I was thinking this morning,
laying in bed,
not being able to sleep.

219
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:34.670
I was thinking back to some shit when I was a kid and I was thinking like,

220
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.390
oh my God,
that's like 45 fucking years ago.

221
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.900
<v 0>Okay,</v>

222
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.900
<v 1>45 years ago was 1973 now in 1973 if I ran into a 50 year old guy and he said I</v>

223
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:52.200
was here 45 years ago,
what year would that be everybody?

224
00:13:52.201 --> 00:13:56.790
That would be 1928 according to my couple of beers.
Math,

225
00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.190
that's how fucking old I am now.

226
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.630
Like to a five year old kid right now.
1973 was what?

227
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:09.430
1928 was to meet when I was five years old.
Not that I really contemplated.

228
00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:11.770
I used to think the 1950s were the olden days.

229
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.070
That's what really fucking kills me.
When I was five years old.
Second,

230
00:14:15.071 --> 00:14:18.550
I could still could've son Elvis.
Yeah.
I think he wasn't even fat yet.

231
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:24.340
You know,
could have gone into Vegas and watch them treat me a lot.
Oh,

232
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.700
boo
crew.

233
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:32.701
Watch him sing that song for the 9,000 time that fucking week out in Vegas.

234
00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:37.540
You know?
I think the mob killed him.
I really do.

235
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.670
He probably signed the colonel,

236
00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:42.940
probably send him to some lifetime contract and then when he just got all fat

237
00:14:42.941 --> 00:14:47.080
eating those peanut butter fucking banana sandwiches,
they are just like,

238
00:14:47.081 --> 00:14:51.170
all right,
we've got to get rid of this guy.
Isn't that what happens in the mob?

239
00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:52.670
Does anybody like die of old age?

240
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:56.260
I know you can die of a heart attack sitting around eating all that fucking,

241
00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:01.390
you know,
was it linguine as,
that's the one that's bad for you,
right?

242
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.130
It's like a fucking butter base cream sauce.

243
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.920
Jesus Christ just sitting there slurping it up,

244
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:12.730
having to look at the door every two seconds and nobody comes in and wax Ya.

245
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.450
I've never understood it beyond the cars and the pinky rings in the great suits

246
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:21.190
in the fucking hottest women in the fucking town.
You know,

247
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.530
you can't sit down and eat a bowl of pasta without staring at the fucking door

248
00:15:26.531 --> 00:15:31.300
every two seconds.
Is it really fucking worth it?
Maybe it is.

249
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.111
I Dunno.
You know,

250
00:15:32.111 --> 00:15:35.350
at some point I should start taking college rather than just asking fucking

251
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:37.620
questions that float out into the fucking Urbis

252
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.700
15 minutes.
That's it.
Jesus.

253
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.330
I feel like I'm in fucking math class back in,
back in high school.

254
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.490
Oh my God.
Sine cosine.
Tangent.
Just fucking flunk me.

255
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.240
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

256
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.560
<v 1>Is that so hard to do?
We really have to go to 180 days of this shit.</v>

257
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:02.370
Keisha tell right from the beginning.
You don't do any scouting.
Um,

258
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:04.490
they didn't.
It was public schools and you know what?
It was all free.

259
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.730
It's all free or not now.
Not now.

260
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:11.510
Cause every fucking kid out there need to goddamn tablet and 15,000 other

261
00:16:11.511 --> 00:16:15.980
fucking things.
Okay.
And public schools can't afford to do that anymore.

262
00:16:15.981 --> 00:16:18.140
Now can they?
Oh,
they could.

263
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.310
They could if we weren't fighting fucking 3,500 fucking jerk offs without

264
00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:25.700
uniforms that train on a fucking jungle gym acting like that.

265
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:27.800
Somehow going to overthrow this country.

266
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.123
<v 0>Huh?</v>

267
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:35.190
<v 1>Despite the fact we've done battle with first world nations and beat their</v>

268
00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:36.024
asses.

269
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.640
Do you want to stand that this is the team that's not even in the fucking
league?

270
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:42.960
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

271
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:43.890
<v 1>This is a friendly,</v>

272
00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.620
it was sitting there acting like this is going to go up against their fucking

273
00:16:46.621 --> 00:16:47.730
record.
Unbelievable.

274
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.680
And meanwhile these poor fucking kids in America going to school right now and

275
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:56.640
we were not even decent enough with their own tax money to provide them tablets

276
00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.820
that they can go onto to ignore this assignments and watch when watching free

277
00:17:02.071 --> 00:17:02.970
online porn.

278
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:05.090
<v 0>Okay.</v>

279
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.910
<v 1>That's why I'm actually thinking about sending my kid to public schools because</v>

280
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:12.560
they can't afford any of that shit.
Right.
And then maybe my kid can,

281
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.030
can go,
you know,

282
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:18.450
actually have a childhood before,
you know,

283
00:17:18.451 --> 00:17:23.160
some other fucking degenerate kid comes up and shows them God knows fucking what

284
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.690
on their phone or their tablet or the,
all of that shit.
You know what I mean?

285
00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.630
I know I've talked about this shit before.

286
00:17:30.631 --> 00:17:34.080
I know that I've said already on this podcast that I've talked about this shit

287
00:17:34.081 --> 00:17:37.470
before.
I don't care if this is like,
I'm going down memory fucking lane.

288
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.273
All right.

289
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:40.470
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

290
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.370
<v 1>This is my,
my,</v>

291
00:17:41.371 --> 00:17:46.371
I think this is my first podcast officially like pass the hangover of turning 50

292
00:17:46.831 --> 00:17:49.050
I'm in my,
I'm in my fifties and let me tell you,

293
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.340
when you get your 50s you think you'd know shit.
What are you talking about?

294
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:54.960
You fucking little whippersnappers.
Okay.

295
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:57.240
I've been around the block for half a fucking century.

296
00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.960
You how many times I've been around the sun?

297
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.513
<v 3>MMM.</v>

298
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.350
<v 1>Without even noticing.
Somebody actually sent me that as a birthday thing.</v>

299
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.830
Congratulations for like your 10000th trip around the fucking sun or something

300
00:18:09.831 --> 00:18:11.270
like that.
I think it was like 10,000 right?

301
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:15.320
Isn't that how many times you go around the sun?
50 years.
I hope that's,

302
00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:20.180
I hope I way over exaggerate just just for that person that knows the answer so

303
00:18:20.181 --> 00:18:24.640
they can feel better about themselves to those and will be you take to you.

304
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.650
Do you,
you,
you,
you like staring to deter dental?
Oh really good.

305
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.450
Why don't you go fucking spew that out in a bar and see if you get any fucking

306
00:18:32.451 --> 00:18:36.530
pussy out of it.
Oh,
Bill.
Is that what it's all about?
All right.

307
00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.200
<v 3>Um,
I'm not going to look that up.</v>

308
00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.750
<v 1>How long does it take for the earth?
Oh wait,
once a year.</v>

309
00:18:43.751 --> 00:18:46.300
It goes around the sun once a year,
doesn't it?
I think I remember that.

310
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.860
I think I got that right on a science test.
All right,
here we go.

311
00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:55.150
How long does it take for the earth to go around the sun?

312
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.120
I know this fucking thing,
right?

313
00:18:59.121 --> 00:19:02.780
It takes 24 hours for the thing to spin around and it takes a year for it to go

314
00:19:02.781 --> 00:19:07.000
around.
It's visual.

315
00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.170
They won't even answer me.

316
00:19:08.171 --> 00:19:11.380
That's how dumb this question wasn't immediately goes to this visualization

317
00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.460
visible is visualization shows how fast you're spitting around earth access.

318
00:19:18.731 --> 00:19:22.750
I don't care if I can't feel it.
Why do I want to know it?
I don't give a shit.

319
00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.453
<v 3>MMM.</v>

320
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.570
<v 1>Fucking earth spinning on its axis is like eating iceberg lettuce with nothing</v>

321
00:19:29.571 --> 00:19:33.140
on it.
You know what I mean?
How does that taste?
Ah,

322
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.170
like I don't know nothing.

323
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.460
How the earth moves,
um,
publish,

324
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:45.390
this is how dumb this quite the answer is not even here.
Oh.

325
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.700
And Somehow Joe Rogan's on this.
Uh,

326
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.990
this is the thing that nobody really considers you know as much about.

327
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.560
I don't even want him worried that the fucking state I'm in right now.

328
00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:57.623
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

329
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.750
<v 1>Joe Rogan.
Yeah.
Joe Rogan reads people.
Okay.</v>

330
00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.580
That's the podcast you're looking for.

331
00:20:03.581 --> 00:20:06.760
I suggest you go to the Joe Rogan experience.
Um,

332
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.900
I think the earth goes around the sun once a year.
I'm going to say once a year.

333
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:14.440
I feel like that last family member on family feud,
you know,

334
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.920
everybody can somehow scraped together for smart brothers,

335
00:20:17.921 --> 00:20:21.460
sisters and maybe a random cousin Booney got you.
Try to get that fifth person,

336
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.210
you know,
it's,

337
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:29.890
it's the drop off is tremendous.
Okay.
So what do you do?

338
00:20:29.891 --> 00:20:30.671
You always stick him there.

339
00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:35.671
The last fucking one and they'll just nay nay a name us at type of dog,

340
00:20:36.011 --> 00:20:40.090
but you know,
and that'd be like fuck it.
Uh,
a German shepherd,

341
00:20:40.091 --> 00:20:43.810
German shepherd number one you guys want to play yet and then they go to the

342
00:20:43.811 --> 00:20:48.811
next person and all and they fucking throw out a and the Daddy,

343
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.790
the daddy get all of way down.
Let the fifth guy named type of dog,
uh,

344
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.880
uh,
just fuck.
It's,
I can't even think of a dumb answer for type of dog.

345
00:20:57.881 --> 00:20:58.714
That's too easy.

346
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.950
How many times as yours go around the sun?
How long does it take?
Three go around.

347
00:21:04.951 --> 00:21:05.784
The Sun.

348
00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:08.083
<v 3>Uh,
Bill,</v>

349
00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.550
<v 1>how long do you think it takes for the earth to go around the sun?
Um,</v>

350
00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.880
if you get this,
you guys will be playing for all the money.
If not the drink.

351
00:21:16.881 --> 00:21:18.800
Water,
family has a chance to steal.

352
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.433
<v 3>Uh,</v>

353
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:25.890
<v 1>what'd he say,
Bill?
Uh,
could you,
could you repeat the question?
Uh,
yeah.
No,</v>

354
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.980
I can't.
I fucking said it four times.
All right.

355
00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:33.510
How long does it take for the earth?
Just spin around the sun.

356
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:40.230
Um,
Richard,
please don't kiss me.
I'm going to say a year and a half.

357
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.160
Right.
Which is the dumbest fucking,
at least you know,
you know,

358
00:21:44.161 --> 00:21:47.760
it's a solid fucking year.
You know,
it's a round number.

359
00:21:47.761 --> 00:21:51.000
You're not going to say fucking it.
18 months.
Right.
And then,

360
00:21:51.001 --> 00:21:53.940
but then all your other four family members as a staring daggers at,

361
00:21:53.941 --> 00:21:57.420
you have to fucking stand there and start clapping and sake.
Good answer.

362
00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.130
Good answer.
Good answer.
And in the 40 fucking years at that show's been on,

363
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.280
nobody has ever just stared at another family member

364
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:11.530
and be like,
what the f?
What the fuck did you just say?
Oh,

365
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:13.710
looked at a number of family and another family of mine said,

366
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:17.350
I told you we shouldn't have brought this dumb fuck.
That has never happened.

367
00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:22.180
Well,
you know why bill?
Because it's a game shop when people are having fun,

368
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:23.530
something you don't know how to do.

369
00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.293
<v 3>MMM.</v>

370
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.730
<v 1>All right.
Hey,
you know,
I never,
I never like pre uh,</v>

371
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.450
what do you call it,
promote a podcast coming up.

372
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.270
But I've got a podcast coming up on June 28th,
uh,
the Thursday afternoon,

373
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:42.340
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

374
00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:46.930
And my guest will be none other than the one and only Dave Ilitch,

375
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.270
uh,
one of the great drummers in the world.
And uh,

376
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.950
also my drum teacher and he has a new,
um,

377
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.350
drum instructional website.
Awesome.

378
00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.400
Fucking all of the shit that he's been showing me and everybody else,

379
00:23:00.401 --> 00:23:03.790
everyone from my level all the way up to some of the best drummers in the world.

380
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:08.440
And uh,
he's going hard on this thing and uh,

381
00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:10.990
he's going to show you guys all this shit that he's shown me.

382
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.330
So he's going to be coming on promoting that,

383
00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.250
talking drums and all that type of stuff.
Just giving you guys a heads up.
Um,

384
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:20.650
because I think is a,

385
00:23:20.651 --> 00:23:24.220
I think that whole educational thing is going to be fucking insane because I

386
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:28.400
know from first hand experience working with that guy over the last couple of

387
00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.400
years is it has been a monumental shift in my playing and I'm just some fucking

388
00:23:34.661 --> 00:23:37.570
comedian that likes playing drums.
Having said that,

389
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.300
having said that,

390
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:44.110
the amount of fucking people that showed me that,

391
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.850
that eight year old Asian girl playing good times,

392
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:49.880
bad times and absolutely destroyed.

393
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.250
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

394
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.800
<v 1>That's one of my favorite videos of all time,</v>

395
00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:58.580
despite the fact I've been trying to play that song for 30 years.

396
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:03.530
Just the way she attacks the kit,
the whole thing.

397
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.010
Total rocks that comes out of the field hits the crash is coming out of the

398
00:24:07.011 --> 00:24:10.280
chair.
Not only did she crush it,

399
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.540
that only did she hit the drums like a fucking monster.
Um,

400
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.590
she was unbelievably entertaining and it was kids like that.

401
00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.470
They didn't have kids like that one.
I was a kid.

402
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.650
That's like some fucking youtube shit in the whole world,

403
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:28.010
showing you how to do stuff.
I don't know what,
Oh,
maybe that's just a prodigy,

404
00:24:28.011 --> 00:24:32.010
but that,
but it was cousin kids,
you know,

405
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.330
gifted kids like that.

406
00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.440
Why I shifted away from drums and ended up being a comedian because I would go

407
00:24:37.441 --> 00:24:40.110
into the,
you know,
not every time,

408
00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:45.111
but it felt like almost every time I would go into the local music store,

409
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.200
you know,
before fucking guitar center was just the one everybody went to.

410
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.210
I used to go to a place,
a Norfolk,
Connie,

411
00:24:51.211 --> 00:24:53.700
music county music on route one in Dedham,

412
00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.080
I believe is where I bought my drum kit way back in the day.

413
00:24:58.081 --> 00:25:02.970
Back then when the child world was down there.
You know what I mean?
Uh,

414
00:25:02.971 --> 00:25:06.330
I forget what else was down there before toys r us fucking took over everything

415
00:25:06.331 --> 00:25:10.710
that was child world.
You went by leach mayors and fucking dead.

416
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.310
I'm all of that area right over there and a great Chinese restaurant,

417
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:15.841
the movie theater,

418
00:25:15.841 --> 00:25:19.230
all of that shit that I remember as a kid that's now fucking long gone,
I assume.

419
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.670
Um,
I would go in there and they would always just be,

420
00:25:23.671 --> 00:25:27.180
some kid would pick up something,
a guitar,

421
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.300
a fucking Xylophone,
a goddamn triangle,

422
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.720
and would not be just sitting down going,
Duh,
Duh,

423
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.100
Duh,
Duh,
Duh.
No,
like,
you know,

424
00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:40.890
saying something somebody else said,

425
00:25:40.891 --> 00:25:45.891
they'd come in there and they would just start fucking playing and you could

426
00:25:46.231 --> 00:25:50.670
tell that it was coming from them,
that or if they played something,

427
00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.100
they would then add,
you know,
that you'd heard on the radio.

428
00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.800
They then add something,
their own little thing to it.

429
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.860
And they just had ideas and they were creative and all that.

430
00:25:58.861 --> 00:26:01.380
And I was musically,

431
00:26:01.381 --> 00:26:04.820
I was those people outside the fucking,
uh,

432
00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.650
Lilou at standing there,
you know,

433
00:26:07.651 --> 00:26:12.150
putting my finger on top of the goddamn whatever the fuck you call it.

434
00:26:12.151 --> 00:26:15.990
The pyramid.
Well that was depressing.
Jesus.
Bill,

435
00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:18.180
wait a bum yourself up.
Um,

436
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.640
maybe let some of that vodka do shock a lot.
Uh,

437
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.850
I apologize for my growling stomach,
by the way.

438
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.060
So what happens when you're on a liquid diet?
Um,

439
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.000
and then I'm gonna just going to come back to the states here in about a week or

440
00:26:30.001 --> 00:26:33.840
so,
and I'll be right back on the wagon.
See,

441
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.010
that's what I can do.

442
00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:40.740
I can drink like an alcoholic and then just step off the fucking wagon,
the bus,

443
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.270
whatever you call it,
the party wagon,

444
00:26:42.271 --> 00:26:44.700
and just start walking down the street like nothing happened.

445
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.390
Like a fucking Hitman,
right?
Like Barry,

446
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:54.050
like bill Hader and Barry just fucking walk away like nothing happened.
Anyway,

447
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.650
so let me read some of the,
uh,
advertising here for this week.
Okay.
All right.

448
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.990
Um,
I have this opening note.

449
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:04.620
The mushroom coffee dude ass that you don't say it tastes like mushrooms.

450
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.390
Other than that,
say anything.
Thanks.
Well,
that's fucking easy.
All right.

451
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.760
What would you think mushroom coffee doesn't taste like mushrooms.

452
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.480
I like mushrooms.
All right.

453
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.700
I actually had a fucking crepe today.

454
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:24.930
You have a day,
crepe crepe.
Wherever the fuck it is.
Okay.

455
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.180
Jumbo a fromage way.
Uh,

456
00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.760
sorry.
I apologize.
Anybody remotely French.

457
00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:41.330
Um,
alright.
Quip.
Sorry.
The truth is most of us are brushing our teeth wrong.

458
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.990
That's all I fucking stabbing yourself in the eye.
Not,

459
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:49.550
not for long enough and forget to change our brush on time.

460
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:56.140
That's because most brands focus on selling flashy gimmicks rather than better

461
00:27:56.181 --> 00:28:00.200
brushing,
but not quip,
not these fucking guys.

462
00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:04.160
So what makes quip so different you may not have asked?
Well,
for starters,

463
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.470
quip is an electric toothbrush.

464
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.680
That's a fraction of the cost of a bulk of bulkier brushes while still packing

465
00:28:12.411 --> 00:28:16.730
just the right amount of vibrations to help clean your teeth,
your teeth,

466
00:28:16.731 --> 00:28:21.460
ladies,
your teeth keep the vibration above your neck there.

467
00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.790
Uh,
quips built in timer helps you clean for the dentist.

468
00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:30.740
Recommended two minutes with guiding pulses that reminds you when it's time to

469
00:28:30.741 --> 00:28:32.930
switch sides.
You don't even have to think anymore.

470
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.970
Next quip subscription plans are for your health,
not just convenience.

471
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.880
They deliver new brush heads on a dentist.

472
00:28:40.881 --> 00:28:45.881
Recommended schedule every three months for just $5,

473
00:28:45.891 --> 00:28:50.891
including free shipping worldwide on a dentist recommended schedule that they

474
00:28:51.531 --> 00:28:56.220
paid the dentist probably to say sooner than you needed so they could sell barn

475
00:28:56.221 --> 00:28:59.780
brush heads.
And that's how the world works.
And God dammit quip.

476
00:28:59.781 --> 00:29:02.030
God bless you for fucking play in the game.

477
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.370
Quip also comes with a mount that's suctions right to your mirror and,

478
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.660
and sticks when you break up with that chick to use as a cover for a hygienic

479
00:29:11.661 --> 00:29:15.800
travel,
wherever you take your teeth.
And finally,
everyone loves quip.

480
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:21.110
Everybody does.
Everybody loves it.
They were on Oprah's all list.

481
00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.490
Oprah's all list.
Oh,
I need a paint my mansion.
Yeah,

482
00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.540
I'll fucking see you got a good toothbrush named one of Time's best interview

483
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.790
invention.
Sorry.
Not An intervention.

484
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.480
And it's the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the American

485
00:29:35.481 --> 00:29:37.190
dental association.
I got to tell you guys,

486
00:29:37.191 --> 00:29:39.230
you know why I love it in an electric toothbrush.
Okay?

487
00:29:39.231 --> 00:29:42.490
And this is some serious shit is I used to use the handheld ones.
I was like,

488
00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:44.530
fuck electric toothbrushes.
Those things that bullshit.

489
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.820
And I ended up brushing my gum away along my fucking tooth line.

490
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.370
Ended up having,
you know,
a borderline,
uh,

491
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.880
ginger Vitus type of situation.
Not that,

492
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:59.540
what do they call it when you're a receding gum,
whatever the fuck you call that.

493
00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.790
But what's great about these electric toothbrushes,

494
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.170
you don't have to move back and forth.
He just put it on there.

495
00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:05.760
It does all the God damn work.

496
00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:10.260
I stand by this despite all the negative shit I said,
I stand by this product.

497
00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.910
Plus they're backed by a network of over 20,000 dentists and hygienists and

498
00:30:14.911 --> 00:30:19.680
hundreds of thousands of happy brushes,
uh,
who use quip everyday.
Quipped uh oh.

499
00:30:19.681 --> 00:30:24.510
I hope they do animals.
Quip starts at just $25.
And if he go to get

500
00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.213
quip.com/bar right now,

502
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.140

503
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.200
free@getquipdotcomgtquipfuckingstomach.com slash burr uh,
spelled,

504
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.360
I just did that.
I just spelled it out.
All right,

505
00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.120
four sigmatic mushroom coffee man,

506
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.860
four sigmatic comes from Finland.
So you know,
it's good.

507
00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:01.360
The F the fins defeated fucking the Russians in World War II.

508
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.970
You think they can make you a cup of coffee?

509
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:08.490
The same crunchy that gave us Santa Claus.
Angry birds.
Tuco Rask,

510
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:12.690
the goaltender for the Boston Bruins and mushroom coffee finish.

511
00:31:12.691 --> 00:31:17.460
People consume more coffee per capital per capita than any other country.

512
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.370
Almost three times more than Americans.
Our right.
You know,

513
00:31:20.371 --> 00:31:22.910
I've got to get all competitive.
Uh,

514
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.190
during World War II when there was a shortage of cottage,

515
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.370
the finish boiled mushrooms that grow on trees to make coffee.

516
00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.850
Mushroom coffee has half the caffeine of regular coffee,

517
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:37.020
but it's twice as magical.
I don't know why I want to drink this stuff so bad,
uh,

518
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:38.070
easy on the gut,

519
00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.450
less acidic and you don't get the jittery feeling you get from regular coffee.

520
00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.930
It is a very smooth,

521
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.580
earthy flavor with some sweet notes in there for people who drink their coffee.

522
00:31:49.581 --> 00:31:50.414
Black

523
00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.133
<v 4>called</v>

524
00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.610
<v 1>adaptogenic.
What about for people who like their women black?
Well,</v>

525
00:31:56.611 --> 00:31:57.990
I enjoy the coffee a little more.

526
00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.890
It gives you extra energy without more caffeine or sugar.

527
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.790
Perfect for creativity.
Hey man,
let's start.

528
00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:08.910
A band helps when you need to get work done.

529
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.910
Think of it as supercharged instant coffee.

530
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:16.360
That sounds like some weed people talk about comes in easy to use and carry

531
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:20.280
single serving packets.
Just add water perfect for travel and when you,

532
00:32:21.210 --> 00:32:23.910
when you're on the go,
cost us a dollar 50 per cup,

533
00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:29.010
get 15% off your first purchase with code burn.
How much money would that be?

534
00:32:29.011 --> 00:32:33.990
Everybody would be 15 cents in the dollar,
seven and a half on the 50 cents a,

535
00:32:33.991 --> 00:32:38.730
I would say it's 22 and a half cents.
How the fuck do you do that?
Just go to four

536
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.830
coffee.com and try it for yourself.
All right.

Who the fuck was I just imitated it and yet one of those talk talking head

558
00:34:12.541 --> 00:34:14.760
fucking people in one of those mindless,
oh,

559
00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:19.620
it was one of those mindless fucking youtube shows.
Hi.

560
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:23.850
I forget what that show was called.
I have no idea.
Anyways,
people,
I think that's,

561
00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:27.480
I think I did it.
I think I did 34 minutes.
All right.
Um,

562
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.600
we're going to do something interesting here.
Uh,

563
00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:35.250
last week I went to the finals of Roland Garros,
Sarah and Patty.

564
00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:38.640
And um,
for those of you who didn't get to watch it,

565
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.620
for those of you who've never been there alive,

566
00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:43.830
I would like to close this Thursday afternoon just before Friday,

567
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:48.830
Monday pointing podcast with the sounds of the French Open as done by most Yogi

568
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.030
bear.
All right,
this is,
this is a point.
All right.

569
00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.130
And this is um,
this is the two guys there.
I forget who.
So at this point,

570
00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:07.900
alright,
here we go.
This is what it sounded like.
Serve to point.

571
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:10.360
<v 5>All right.

<v 1>Oh Hey.
Yay.
That one,</v>

577
00:35:25.031 --> 00:35:29.250
that miss was the drop shot that fucked up the other guy.
All right,
I'll see you.

578
00:35:29.251 --> 00:35:33.440
That's the,
that's the Thursday afternoon.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Have a great weekend.

579
00:35:33.441 --> 00:35:38.040
You can enjoy the music and we've got another half hour of this of bullshit from

580
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.730
<v 0>one that I did,
I don't know.
While ago.
Say</v>

581
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.870
[inaudible] [inaudible] just want to eat

582
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.930
[inaudible] I don't want you wash.

583
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.920
<v 6>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built birds.
The Monday morning podcasts for Monday,</v>

584
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:25.050
June 14th,
2010 how the hell are you?
Are you good?

585
00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.340
Did you have a good weekend?
Did you,

586
00:37:28.341 --> 00:37:32.900
did you go down to that place with the thing I heard it was nice.
What's it nice?

587
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:38.120
It is nice.
Oh,
that's nice.
My son,

588
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.020
he had a recital this weekend and we were so nervous.

589
00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:45.680
He was all flustered and more suburban.

590
00:37:45.681 --> 00:37:50.210
Talk about shit that nobody cares about because frank was in the back with the

591
00:37:50.211 --> 00:37:53.180
garden hose.
It froze up.
Oh,
by the way.

592
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:58.280
So we have to buy a new one of those.
So you know frank,

593
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.540
he goes on the Internet and he just starts researching all about those hose

594
00:38:02.541 --> 00:38:06.840
hoses.
Yeah,
I can't,
I don't know.

595
00:38:06.841 --> 00:38:10.560
Can you imagine just these sitting there at the end of a culdesac like that is

596
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:15.160
your fucking reality.
Rather than having a wine cellar,

597
00:38:15.161 --> 00:38:18.050
I would have just have a secret room of fucking porn.
Okay.

598
00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.300
With Kleenex for media.

599
00:38:19.301 --> 00:38:23.770
The rub one out or just sit there crying at what became of my life.

600
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:28.510
I need,
can you go out and fix his bicycle?
Yeah.
No.

601
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:33.310
Why does he go climb a fucking tree?
Jesus Christ.
What did,

602
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.350
what did they do in the 18 hundreds?
You want to,

603
00:38:35.351 --> 00:38:37.840
why the environment's so fucked up.
That's it right there buddy.

604
00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:43.210
You just go when I go out and be a part of your kids' lives.
I don't,

605
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:47.590
that's why I told you I enjoyed condoms.
I didn't enjoy condoms.

606
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:51.640
I just didn't want to bust one in you without one on and now I did.

607
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:55.690
And now look at it.
Look at my face sweetheart.
Can't you see the misery?

608
00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.760
Fuck him.
Well,
he half looks like Yo,

609
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:04.750
you go fix his fucking bike.
I'm not yelling.
I'm,
no,
I'm not.

610
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:10.810
All right,
so this is he a,
this is the podcast for this week.
Uh,
I got to admit,

611
00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:14.620
this is like the 15th time I've tried to start it.
I don't know what's going on.

612
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:15.550
I'm in my bedroom,

613
00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:20.580
it's fucking hot out because the sun shines on this part of my apartment during

614
00:39:21.071 --> 00:39:21.881
this time of the day,

615
00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:25.090
which is why usually I do this in the morning cause it's nice and cool.

616
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:29.140
And then the podcast is cool as opposed to now where it's stressed and a little

617
00:39:29.141 --> 00:39:31.030
sweaty.
You know.

618
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.630
Speaking of sweat and you guys been watching the NBA finals,

619
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:38.680
have you been watching that shit?
This series?
I can't call it.

620
00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:42.220
Lakers won the first game.
And I was like,
God,
Jesus Christ said,
look.

621
00:39:42.221 --> 00:39:46.030
Unbelievable.
Then the Celtics come back and I still wasn't believing in him.

622
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.700
And I was like,
you know what?
Whoever wins game three,

623
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.880
they're going to win the series.
That's,
that's the pivotal fucking game.

624
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.330
And then the Lakers winning and I'm like,
I fuck,
we're done.
We're done.

625
00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:00.310
And the Celtics win the next game to to,
yeah,
but what the fuck?
You know,

626
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.250
Lake as a when the next one,
cause that's how it's going.

627
00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:04.810
And then ban the Celtics win again.

628
00:40:04.811 --> 00:40:08.020
So there were up three to now logic would say,

629
00:40:08.021 --> 00:40:10.450
well they going to do is win one out of two of the were evenly matched.

630
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.200
They've got to fucking do it.
But there's nothing logical about this series.

631
00:40:14.201 --> 00:40:14.620
It's been,
uh,

632
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:18.550
it's been a war and I hope you guys have been watching because it has been a

633
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:22.120
classic and a people stepping up.

634
00:40:22.450 --> 00:40:24.130
Not Too many bonehead mistakes,

635
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.780
although Laker fans might say a thing or two about Ron,
our test,
uh,
you know,

636
00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:31.330
I could pick it,
some of my fucking players,
but you know,

637
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.320
it's been a classic goddamn series and usually,

638
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:40.780
usually I trashed the other team,
but I got nothing but respect for the Lakers.

639
00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:44.050
I got another mister fucking great team and a,

640
00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:45.340
I don't know what's going to happen.
I don't have to,

641
00:40:45.341 --> 00:40:46.870
we're going to close it out the next game.

642
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.410
Will we win seven games with the Lakers win the next two?
I don't fucking know,

643
00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.520
but I don't understand why they can't play a game on Saturday night.

644
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.520
What does the NBA afraid of?

645
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:04.420
You know we have t vose I don't,
I already fucking examined this shit.

646
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:09.010
I was just glad we swatted Pau Gasol a couple of times last night.
You know,

647
00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.290
gave them a nice cold bucket of water to remind them of what a fucking bitch we

648
00:41:14.291 --> 00:41:18.550
think he is now.
He's been playing great.
The whole God damn serious and Colby is,

649
00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:23.580
is that guy is he is unfucking Gardall guys unguardable that third quarter yet

650
00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:29.440
game five last night was unbelievable.
You see that fucking three pointer?

651
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:34.400
Was he like 15 feet behind the line and then would've killed is he threw it like

652
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:39.200
it looked like a shack foul shot except it went in,
it was like a frozen rope.

653
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.420
It was like barely any arc on the ball and there was still nothing but net.

654
00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:48.950
It's like he'd fucking defies the laws of physics and there's a lot of people

655
00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:53.090
out there as my voice cracks a little bit because I've been screaming for seven

656
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:56.150
successful shows at Caroline's this weekend.

657
00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:00.080
I fucking raped the crowd this weekend.

658
00:42:00.081 --> 00:42:04.040
I was in his own baby is having a great fucking time out that way.

659
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:07.610
But let's stick with the Lakers.
People keep fucking a

660
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.050
comparison saying,
you know he's the next Jordan a isn't.

661
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.330
This is how you know somebody isn't.

662
00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:17.480
The next Jordan is there compared to Michael Jordan.

663
00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:21.580
They say he's the next Jordan.
All right,
so they'll,

664
00:42:21.581 --> 00:42:25.820
all that means is that you're playing at this is is he playing at the same level

665
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:30.710
as Michael?
Yes,
he is.
Well it if you shaved playing shape fucking levels.

666
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:34.600
Michael Jordan,
there are [inaudible] American.
What am I going to join?

667
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:38.210
I'll tell you why.
This is the fucking difference.

668
00:42:38.211 --> 00:42:42.410
Michael Jordan changed the fucking game and I keep telling you sports cons this

669
00:42:42.411 --> 00:42:45.020
and you don't fucking listen to me.
It's like you don't hear me.

670
00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:48.500
You don't understand.
All right.

671
00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.010
It's like,
ah,
what do I say?
It's like fucking Christopher Columbus.

672
00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:00.500
Before that guy came along,
everybody thought the world was flat.

673
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:04.250
Then if you sale too far,
you'd go right off the edge of it,

674
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:10.270
but Columbus realize that it was round and there was people to be massacred on

675
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:12.020
the other side of the fucking globe.

676
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:17.230
He realized that and he became the first fucking guy to go over where they

677
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:20.840
didn't think while it maybe become,
some people say the vikings,
but whatever.

678
00:43:20.841 --> 00:43:23.300
Let's just go with him getting the fucking credit.
All right.

679
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:28.330
Just so I can make my example work here now after he fucking does it,

680
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:31.910
if another guy comes along and he does it too,

681
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.780
he sailed at the level of Columbus,

682
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:40.370
but he didn't do some groundbreaking shit,
which is what Jordan did.

683
00:43:40.371 --> 00:43:42.800
Jordan changed the fucking game.

684
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:48.110
Colby is just playing the game at the same level as,
as as as a Michael Jordan.

685
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.040
He's playing the game,

686
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.760
but he's not doing shit that I know that I haven't seen Michael already do.

687
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:58.400
You know?
So there you go.
That's what I'm saying.
The same way Dr

688
00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.240
Jay Changed Basketball before Dr Jay came in the fucking league.

689
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.020
Everybody in the league look like basically half the league look like they,

690
00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.790
they had my ability to play,
you know,

691
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:15.920
and then all of a sudden he comes along and the game gets elevated above the

692
00:44:15.921 --> 00:44:20.600
fucking rim and he's doing shit in the Aba that nobody even thought about doing.

693
00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:25.010
All right?
And then everybody sees him do it and it's like,
oh,

694
00:44:25.011 --> 00:44:26.270
that's fucking possible.

695
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.040
And then they practice his fucking moves and now they're doing it and it becomes

696
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.010
a part of the fucking

697
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.010
<v 7>game.
That's the difference.
Right?</v>

698
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.630
And before fucking Jordan came along,
everyone's like,
you got to have a center.

699
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.330
You can't win without a big man.

700
00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.440
And Jordan was the first guy to come along and says,
you know what?

701
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:51.150
Fuck you a big man and fuck your power forward and fuck the fact that I don't

702
00:44:51.151 --> 00:44:54.330
even have a goddamn center and we do it.
He did have a center,

703
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:59.070
but the guy sucked Luc Longley or cart,
right?
He's like,
fuck it,
I,
you know what?

704
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.090
I don't need any of them.

705
00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:03.870
I'm going to jump over all of them and fucking throw it down.

706
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:07.740
That's what I'm doing.
Stuck it to the next level.

707
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.690
Nobody dunked the way he fucking dunked until he did it.
All that shit.

708
00:45:12.691 --> 00:45:16.590
You know what I'm saying?
So stop with this shit.
All right.

709
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.570
But I will tell you this without a doubt.

710
00:45:18.571 --> 00:45:22.410
I think he's the most unbelievable fucking player,
uh,

711
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.410
that I've seen since Jordan,
but there's still a major gap.

712
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:29.160
Do you know what I mean?
You guys understand what I'm trying to say here.

713
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.510
It's like miles Davis Change fucking music.
Okay,

714
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:37.920
you buddy Billy down the street.
He plays the trumpet.
There's a difference.

715
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:40.620
He's going to play in it.
I'm not saying he's not good at playing it.

716
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.410
I'm not saying he can't play the songs that miles Davis made,

717
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.360
but he's not fucking miles Davis.

718
00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.880
Who the fuck goes from sports to Miles Davis?

719
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.090
Is it any wonder this podcast is free?
Do you know?

720
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:57.990
My Web guy told me the other day,
I have over 250,000 downloads of my podcasts.

721
00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:01.920
Not in a week.
I don't know exactly how much time or how many people.

722
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.510
Maybe that's what,
that's 14 listeners downloading it 58 fucking times each.

723
00:46:06.511 --> 00:46:08.940
Does that come out to 250,000?
I don't know what it does,

724
00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:12.030
but I was impressed and I was just thinking,
you know what?

725
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:16.830
What if I actually sold it for a buck?
A whack?
That'd be 250 grand,

726
00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.470
right?
Government comes in,
man,

727
00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.670
they knock it down to a buck 25.
Right?

728
00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:27.090
Or maybe I can't get to keep a buck 40 of it,

729
00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:29.910
but I got to fucking throw it on the crap table.
That is Wall Street.

730
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.870
Then they fucking come along.
They shake up the economy like an ant farm.

731
00:46:33.871 --> 00:46:37.950
Now I'm down to 30 grand right there.
I still got 30 grand.

732
00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:41.190
I can go out and go buy another Prius.
See how that works?

733
00:46:41.191 --> 00:46:45.840
That's how America works.
Speaking of that Shit,

734
00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.660
how was on the plane yesterday?
Okay.
And this fucking dude comes on,
uh,

735
00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:55.880
you know,
with,
with what I described as game seven [inaudible]

736
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.810
one of these dudes where he walks down,
he doesn't smell,

737
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:07.830
and then the second he goes to put his luggage into the overhead compartment.

738
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:12.090
It's just like,
you have got to be fucking kidding me.

739
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.840
How did this guy make it?
Through security,
you know,

740
00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.110
I can't bring water through security,
but he can bring this,

741
00:47:19.111 --> 00:47:22.980
this fucking stench onto the plan.
Of course he fucking sits right behind me,

742
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.330
you know,
and I'm just like,
please just keep your fucking arms down.

743
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.130
Fortunately he did,
but it's,
those guys always get on the cross

744
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:34.890
<v 6>country fucking flights.
So anyways,
there was this adorable,
uh,</v>

745
00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:38.880
woman next to me and uh,
she was from Australia,

746
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:42.630
had the little fucking a accent and all that type of

747
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:46.040
<v 7>the shit.
So whatever.
Long story short,</v>

748
00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:49.340
we're taken off from JFK and one of the runways is shut down.

749
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:52.150
So it's taken for fucking ever right?

750
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:56.020
A couple people on the plane or in wheelchairs.
So that takes more time.
You know,

751
00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.040
your proverbial fat fucks,
you know,
the whole deal.
So,
uh,

752
00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.810
we take off like an hour and a half late.
That's just the whole fuck it.

753
00:48:03.811 --> 00:48:07.940
Then by the time we land,
we land,
there's no gate.

754
00:48:07.941 --> 00:48:10.370
And then we've got to sit there and wait to get towed in and the whole thing's

755
00:48:10.371 --> 00:48:14.150
taken forever.
And she just does this shit where she just goes,
she says,
she goes,

756
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.330
is everything in America slow?
Yeah.

757
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.770
So I let it slide

758
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.610
<v 6>and then the plane lands and we're all trying to see who won the Celtics and the</v>

759
00:48:24.611 --> 00:48:28.150
Lakers cause we all miss the fucking game.
Thank God ESPN showed the replay.

760
00:48:28.151 --> 00:48:32.410
I caught the second half and it goes around the plane like wildfire fire,

761
00:48:32.411 --> 00:48:35.050
you know the Celtics won,
Celtics won and this girl,

762
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.140
my mural was joking about how much people gives a shit and then this girl makes

763
00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:40.870
comics something like,
you know,
Americans fucking Blah Blah Blah Blah.

764
00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:42.670
And it's just like,
you know what?

765
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.540
<v 7>I let it slide with the first fucking water,
but it's just really like,</v>

766
00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:49.460
they always talk about the ignorant American.

767
00:48:49.461 --> 00:48:53.390
What kind of a fucking asshole comes here from another country and shits on the

768
00:48:53.391 --> 00:48:58.370
country to somebody who is from this country.
When I was over in England,

769
00:48:58.371 --> 00:49:02.570
I didn't walk around saying to English people how fucking awful their torsos

770
00:49:02.571 --> 00:49:06.920
where I didn't do that.
They said,
I enjoy in England.
I'm like,
it's fucking great.

771
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:10.340
I can't believe I'm over here.
Royal Albert Hall,
it's beautiful.

772
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.080
I can't wait to come over here again.
Phenomenal fucking city.

773
00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.080
I didn't say you food sucks.
You guys all have will.
Pharrel mushy.

774
00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:21.700
Torsos I didn't say any of that shit.

775
00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:23.680
I didn't talk about your teeth being fucked up.

776
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.440
I didn't talk about the weird inbred look because you've all been fucking each

777
00:49:28.441 --> 00:49:32.880
other and the same goddamn strip of land for fucking thousands of years.

778
00:49:32.881 --> 00:49:33.870
I didn't do that shit.

779
00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:37.510
I was on my best behavior and here I am sitting next to this fucking clam is

780
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:40.110
everything in America's slow as opposed to what?

781
00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.850
That beacon of speed that fucking Australia is

782
00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.980
fucking people.
You know I went to Australia,
I was there for like three days.

783
00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.430
I had a good time down there,
but you know,
I could have picked that place apart.

784
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:56.200
All the unemployed people just sitting in bars drinking.

785
00:49:59.060 --> 00:49:59.730
Okay,

786
00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:04.160
<v 6>I fucking hate you know.
Same fucking cunts.
Same God damn just cunts.</v>

787
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:08.030
That's all it is.
Everybody taking pot shots in American now.
That's what it is.

788
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.570
Because we've been on top and we've been exploiting their labor and I guess

789
00:50:11.571 --> 00:50:14.030
maybe that's,
maybe we deserve a little bit of that shit.
But you know what?

790
00:50:14.031 --> 00:50:16.340
Take a look in the fucking mirror Australia

791
00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:22.040
<v 7>or a woman from Australia.
The fuck I went there,</v>

792
00:50:22.041 --> 00:50:27.010
I was like,
wow.
Like I was going into the future.
Can I have a,

793
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:28.303
and then the fucking

794
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.290
<v 6>sandwiches right in my hand before I even finish it.</v>

795
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:35.150
I didn't find them to be overly fast over there either.
You wait,

796
00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.060
you fucking wait.
You think it's not coming your way?

797
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:43.280
Our corporations are just ahead of the curve of where,

798
00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:44.570
where your corporations are.

799
00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:49.810
Are corporations have basically exploited every last legal way that they can

800
00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:52.850
make more fucking money over here.
So now they're just stealing.

801
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.070
They're just stealing and they're cutting fucking staff members.

802
00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:02.210
I actually had to wait like a half hour,
40 minutes to get my bag last night.

803
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:07.460
I think it was that Sunday thing.
Once again,
it's Sunday,
it's Sunday.

804
00:51:07.461 --> 00:51:12.170
So we just have like a skeleton crew.
I don't know.
All I'm saying,
you know,

805
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.690
it's just bugging me.
It's like,

806
00:51:14.691 --> 00:51:17.480
do you think I know that that shit isn't a little fucked up over here?

807
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:22.340
Do I need you to come over here?
I would never be in Australia and go like,

808
00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:26.630
yeah,
Australians to another fucking Australian.
You know?

809
00:51:26.631 --> 00:51:30.040
That's the type of shit I should felt like fucking stuffing her in a Goddamn

810
00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:33.710
boogie board bag.
Boogie board bag.
Why did I pick that?

811
00:51:33.711 --> 00:51:38.690
Because I saw that documentary of that stupid fuck from Australia who's put 200

812
00:51:38.691 --> 00:51:43.220
pounds of fucking weed into a boogie board bag.
Right alliteration for you.

813
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:47.870
And then it goes to like Bali,
you know with even have cold medication,

814
00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:51.710
they hang you by your balls in the public square and she gets life in prison.

815
00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:56.990
Well that's what you get your dumb fuck.
That's what you get.

816
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:01.190
That's one of my thenot fuck Australia.
That's how it works.
You see?

817
00:52:01.191 --> 00:52:02.360
And that's how it works right there.

818
00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:04.880
This is a lot of people in Australia right now.
Maybe listen to this shit going.

819
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:08.150
You know,
I would never say that.
I would never do that if I went.
Yeah,

820
00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.670
well one of you did.
So there you go.

821
00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:14.450
Do you think Germany likes to be judged by Hitler alone?
They don't.

822
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:16.640
I bet there's a lot of sweethearts over in Germany.

823
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:22.970
Look at all those fucking fat jolly people during Oktoberfest,
running around,

824
00:52:22.971 --> 00:52:25.760
dressed like they're in Hansel and Gretel,
you know,

825
00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:29.090
shitting on each other or whatever weird fetishes they're into over there.

826
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.010
All right.
What Anna just fucking bugs me.
Anyways,
it was my,

827
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.450
it was my birthday this weekend.
I had a wonderful birthday.

828
00:52:38.451 --> 00:52:43.130
I did a two to a sold out shows,
ads live.
The first show was sold out.

829
00:52:43.131 --> 00:52:47.810
The second one was like 90% show sold out on a Thursday,
by the way.

830
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.540
And a afterwards I had a,

831
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:55.850
I had a slice of cake and a shot of whiskey and then another shot of whiskey.

832
00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:58.010
And I'll tell you right now,
if you want to fucking hang over,

833
00:52:58.610 --> 00:53:01.540
have a slice of birthday cake with a little bit of makers and uh,

834
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:06.080
you're going to be in business.
I was wronged me guys.

835
00:53:06.081 --> 00:53:09.470
I really fucking abuse my body this weekend.
I really did.

836
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:15.800
And I blame you.
I blame,
I blame Joe to Rosa.
I just blame him.

837
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:20.900
It's just something about him.
You know,
he comes down,

838
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:24.950
he's got that stupid look on his face.
He already has a drink in his fucking,

839
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.770
and you know,
I don't want to drink with them,
but it's like,
I know he's,

840
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:31.680
I know he was adopted.
It's like,

841
00:53:31.681 --> 00:53:34.950
what am I going to be yet another person who rejects this poor bastard.

842
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:40.590
That's the only reason why I drink.
Uh,
hang on a second.

843
00:53:40.591 --> 00:53:45.330
I got to turn the fan up.
His fucking
all right.
Well,

844
00:53:45.331 --> 00:53:49.140
how far are we into with 16 pathetic minutes into this podcast.

845
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:53.820
This is really been a lackluster podcast and I want to apologize.

846
00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:54.690
I gotta tell you something guys.

847
00:53:54.691 --> 00:53:59.550
I've started this thing like fucking six times already.
And uh,
I don't know,

848
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:01.860
I'm just,
I'm off this week.
Look at me.
I'm tacking,

849
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:05.700
I'm attacking my good friend Joe to Rosa.
You know,

850
00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.710
it's a good friend of mine.
Loved the guy.
I respect him.

851
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:14.280
Even though when he sits down,
he looks,

852
00:54:14.281 --> 00:54:18.720
I look at him and he looks like he has wheelchair legs
exam.

853
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:21.870
If you guys ever go out and you see Joe to Rosa sitting at the back of a club

854
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:25.920
just low and he sits down,
tell me,
it looks like his legs work,

855
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.490
you know,
every time he stands up you get like that excitement,

856
00:54:29.491 --> 00:54:33.660
like you're seeing a miracle happening.
And I was allowed to see what I'm doing.

857
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:37.740
I'm,
I'm,
I'm attacking Joe.
He's not even here to defend himself.
Ah,
Geez there.

858
00:54:37.741 --> 00:54:40.200
Bill,
what are you doing?
Um,

859
00:54:40.201 --> 00:54:42.780
it was my birthday this weekend and I got a lot of birthday,

860
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:44.310
well wishes on my birthday.

861
00:54:44.311 --> 00:54:48.750
I want to thank everybody and then I also got a lot of a happy belated birthday

862
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:52.710
and uh,
I really don't,
I don't enjoy that.
All right.

863
00:54:52.711 --> 00:54:56.430
If he didn't remember then fucking man up and just say,
yeah,
hey,

864
00:54:56.431 --> 00:54:59.670
I forgot your birthday.
Sorry about that.
You know,

865
00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.980
I was busy in my own life or,
you know,

866
00:55:01.981 --> 00:55:05.310
maybe I don't give a fuck about you enough to remember it.
Just say that.

867
00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:09.270
Say happy belated birthday.
I don't like that.
That's like Mary [inaudible]

868
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:14.430
taken all the fun out of it.
All right.
If you forgot my birthday,

869
00:55:14.431 --> 00:55:16.560
do you think I actually remember that?
You didn't,

870
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:19.110
that you didn't fucking say happy birthday to me.

871
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.220
I was totally fine with whoever said happy birthday to me on my birthday and

872
00:55:25.221 --> 00:55:28.200
then then you,
you got to come the next fucking day.

873
00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.250
You know I'm still smiling.
I still got frosted on the side of my mouth.

874
00:55:32.251 --> 00:55:36.090
I'm having a great God damn time and you've got to come up to me and wished me a

875
00:55:36.091 --> 00:55:39.420
happy belated birthday to remind me that you didn't give a fuck enough to

876
00:55:39.421 --> 00:55:43.410
fucking wish me happy birthday.
Right before you said that.
I didn't know.

877
00:55:43.411 --> 00:55:46.440
I didn't know that you didn't wish me happy birthday.
Nor did I give a shit.

878
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.790
Actually looked up the lady cause I didn't know what it meant.

879
00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:56.070
I know what belated birthday means.
You miss my birthday.
Sorry about that.

880
00:55:56.730 --> 00:55:57.990
But belated is one of those,

881
00:55:58.020 --> 00:56:02.880
those weird words in the English language that is used,
but it's only used then.

882
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:08.640
Do you,
do you ever hear belated at any other point during the year?

883
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:13.800
Jesus Christ?
Look at that fucking belated pizza,
son of a bitch.

884
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:20.250
You don't,
this is like a bad eighties bit was do the word polluted.

885
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:26.730
A bladed actually means later in relation to the proper time something should

886
00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:30.130
have happened.
So like when I finally get,

887
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:34.510
get like married connect to connect with,
will I have a belated wedding?

888
00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:39.460
You know,
if a woman carries a baby for fucking 10 months,

889
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:45.580
do they have belated giving birth cards?
Jesus,

890
00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:48.970
I really should be wearing a fucking 80 sports coat right now with the sleeves

891
00:56:48.971 --> 00:56:52.450
pulled up.
One of those Miami vice tee shirts underneath.

892
00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:55.600
It's spiking up what's left in my hair,
you know,

893
00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:00.640
coming up on stage to like some sort of rip off of the top gun theme.

894
00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.380
Ben At the tank tank tank,
a Dan,

895
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:08.330
Dan and good evening ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the funny bone.

896
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:15.220
Um,
I wish I did stand up in the 80s.
It just seems so much easier.

897
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:15.960
And you could,

898
00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.360
you could like literally do coke and go on stage and nobody had a fucking

899
00:57:19.361 --> 00:57:23.740
problem with it
could be absolutely out of your fucking mind.

900
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:28.930
And it was considered okay because it was the 80s.
I tell you what,

901
00:57:28.931 --> 00:57:30.850
why don't we just actually jumped to the,
uh,

902
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:33.880
some of these segments that I have here.
Let's,

903
00:57:33.881 --> 00:57:36.910
let's recommend some youtube videos for the week.
Okay.

904
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.690
And why don't we just settle in that this isn't going to be one of the good

905
00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:41.620
podcasts.
Okay.

906
00:57:41.621 --> 00:57:45.520
Why don't we just take the pressure off me and just realize that this isn't

907
00:57:45.521 --> 00:57:48.820
going to be one of the good ones.
You know,
look at the Cohen brothers.

908
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:53.230
Every one of their movies.
Good.
Are they?
I don't fucking know.

909
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.110
I just had to pick somebody really successful.
I bet they made a bad one.

910
00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:02.260
So whatever.
This is my fucking bad one.
Uh,
we're kind of like a,
what's his face

911
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:07.390
that I am night Shama lemme lemme Ding Dong,
right.

912
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:09.370
He made the sixth sense.

913
00:58:09.371 --> 00:58:13.240
Everybody went crazy and then he made that movie where the guy takes the nap and

914
00:58:13.241 --> 00:58:17.140
the lawnmower runs over him.
You know,
they can't all be gems.
People

915
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:22.450
look at ACDC,
my favorite band of all time,

916
00:58:22.451 --> 00:58:26.230
they make like nine good records in a row and then they made,
they make a,

917
00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:31.600
what was it?
Blow up your video.
They're that bad period.
Fly on the wall.

918
00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:36.990
Who made who
blow up your video bump?
Edit,

919
00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:39.080
edit.
Bet.
Bet at it.
Edit it.

920
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:45.460
Um,
yeah,
they,
you know what it is.
They got outside their wheelhouse.

921
00:58:45.461 --> 00:58:48.370
They were actually trying to make a statement where it's like,
no,

922
00:58:48.371 --> 00:58:52.390
you guys are ACDC.
You talk about balls,
the devil and fucking,

923
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:53.950
okay.

924
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:58.030
Don't start making social commentary about what's happening to the art of music

925
00:58:58.210 --> 00:59:01.310
because it's going to go off the rails.
And that's exactly what happened.
Do I,

926
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:05.710
do I actually have the nerve to try to drag ACDC into this,

927
00:59:05.711 --> 00:59:10.480
this tailspin of a podcast?
I apologize.
Fuck is wrong with me.

928
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:16.600
Okay,
let's,
let's recommend some youtube videos for the week.
Um,

929
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:22.460
videos.
All you got to see this one look up a 21 foot rule,

930
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:27.440
less talk,
more action.
And it's basically,

931
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:30.270
it's a psycho who,
um,

932
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.210
he's basically saying he's talking to gun people,
I guess this guy,

933
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:40.270
a knife soared guy and he's talking about the 21 foot rule that in the amount of

934
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:44.180
times going to take you to pull out a gun and I guess or whatever and squeeze

935
00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:45.014
off a shot.

936
00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:50.440
He's going to close the distance and stab your cardboard toe a torso.

937
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:56.120
So check that out.
21 foot rule and a less talk,

938
00:59:56.121 --> 00:59:59.330
more action.
And then,
um,
there's a couple of good parody ones.

939
00:59:59.331 --> 01:00:04.331
Does the 121 foot rule where it's a fat fuck doing the 21 foot rule,

940
01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:10.010
21 foot rule from 121 feet and then there's the 21 foot rule lightsaber.

941
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.670
And by the way,
all of these,
if you don't want to search for these videos,

942
01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:15.470
if you want them right at your fingertips,

943
01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.460
if typing is too much of a bother because you're too busy,

944
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:24.680
all you have to do is go to the MM podcast.com and uh,

945
01:00:24.681 --> 01:00:27.830
all the videos will be up there and a right,
right,

946
01:00:27.831 --> 01:00:32.030
right at the tip of your fingers.
You can select them,
you can watch them.
And uh,

947
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:33.730
and that's what you can do.

948
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:35.600
And I could actually come up maybe with something else.

949
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.080
Good to say about the page if I wasn't so fucking off this week.

950
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:44.090
I'm just off people.
All right.
I'm fucking,
we know it built.
We know it sucks.

951
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.970
Okay,
we got it.
All right.
Here's another one to watch.
Uh,

952
01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:51.971
watch one crazy red sox fan and it's basically about a red sox fan who goes to a

953
01:00:52.851 --> 01:00:57.851
Yankees game and start serving clam chowder outside the stadium during a red sox

954
01:00:58.881 --> 01:01:01.550
Yankees game,
but only two red sox fans.
And if you,

955
01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.300
if you just want to see what you look like when you're drunk at the game,

956
01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:10.190
just watch this video because it's pretty much equally embarrassing on both

957
01:01:10.191 --> 01:01:14.420
sides.
The level of fucking morons,
although I have to say,

958
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.310
uh,
a bunch of Boston CIC show their tits on it,

959
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:21.501
but then again,

960
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:24.440
that's because they're happy women don't show their tits when they're mad at
you.

961
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.000
So I guess none of the Yankee skanks showed their tits on it,
but definitely,

962
01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:30.980
definitely check that shit out.
But uh,
oh,

963
01:01:30.981 --> 01:01:35.720
here's one I should have talked about when I was talking about the Celtics

964
01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:37.940
Lakers.
I was talking last week about why do you,

965
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.660
why do we care so much about sports?
You know,

966
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:45.350
why was I on the plane flying across the country?

967
01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.190
Absolutely livid that I wasn't going to be able to watch the game,

968
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:53.240
but part of me was relieved that when I got off the plane,

969
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:56.750
I was just going to hear the results and know one way or the other,

970
01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:57.643
you know what I mean?

971
01:01:59.030 --> 01:02:02.690
Just get fucking one right to the back of the head rather than sitting there

972
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.890
slowly at her.
No,
slowly getting something,

973
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:11.990
something that slowly fucking happens.
That's funny,
right?
If you're not fucked,

974
01:02:11.991 --> 01:02:13.370
I'm about,
you know what?
I am fucking,

975
01:02:13.371 --> 01:02:17.240
if I fucking say one more thing that's not funny on his Goddamn podcast,

976
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:20.010
I'm going to fucking erase it.
25 minutes in,

977
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.830
which would be an unprecedented move.
Okay.

978
01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:27.300
I bail out of these things like a fucking test pilot.
Three minutes in,

979
01:02:27.301 --> 01:02:29.460
five minutes in six months,
even 10 minutes in.

980
01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:34.170
I've never been less funny for fucking 25 minutes that I'm going to scrap this

981
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:37.500
God damn project.
This is pathetic.

982
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:41.700
This is like that fucking plane that took off like a helicopter and kept killing

983
01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:45.360
people and was so fucked up.
Even Dick Cheney finally said,
you know what?
Fuck it.

984
01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:50.430
It's not worth it,
but we spent $4 billion.
Yeah,

985
01:02:50.431 --> 01:02:53.280
but they keep fucking going in the ground like a God damn lawn dart.

986
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.950
That's what's happened in this week.
Fucking sweat my ass off my bedroom.

987
01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:03.880
That's what I'm saying.
I'm going to blame them.
I blame the climate.
All right.

988
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.260
I had a little temper tantrum.
Let's talk about sports here.

989
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.850
Why we care.
This is what you know.
I was asking last week,
why?

990
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:15.930
Why do people give a fuck about sports?
Why do you care to this level?

991
01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.950
Why do you cheer on these guys?
Half of whom would blow you off if you saw him.

992
01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.420
You know Mike,
you seen maybe seen her that fucking Douche bag.

993
01:03:24.421 --> 01:03:25.920
He doesn't even smile during a game.

994
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:29.310
He think he's going to give you a fucking autograph as even in the League

995
01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:31.590
anymore.
Why don't you bring up vital blue bill?

996
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.390
There's a nice uptodate fucking reference.
Okay,

997
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.420
why we care.
This guy is a great,
great theory.
Thank God.

998
01:03:39.421 --> 01:03:41.010
I'm going to be really somebody else's words.

999
01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:43.800
I hope he has something funny to say.
All right.
First off,

1000
01:03:43.801 --> 01:03:47.450
I want to say I love the podcast,
not after this one,
sweetheart.
Um,

1001
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:49.770
you're doing God's work anyway.

1002
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.880
I might not be able to explain why all sports fans care about their respective

1003
01:03:53.881 --> 01:03:54.630
teams.

1004
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:59.280
But I thought I'd tell you why I care and see if you or anyone else can relate.

1005
01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:02.730
There are two main reasons why I not only watch sports,

1006
01:04:02.731 --> 01:04:07.731
but actually allow events that are usually happing happening nowhere near me

1007
01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:11.100
involving a bunch of people I never have,

1008
01:04:11.130 --> 01:04:16.050
nor will I ever meet affect my mood in either a positive or a negative way.

1009
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:21.000
First off is the sheer unpredictability,
unpredictability of it.

1010
01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.390
Okay,
no worries.
Okay.
So,
uh,

1011
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:30.270
so you were surprised when you found out the kid in sixth sense was already dead

1012
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:34.260
or when Kevin Spacey started walking straight in the end of you have the usual

1013
01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:35.670
suspects.
We're,

1014
01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:39.900
neither of those were worth a shit compared to a guy catching a pass with his

1015
01:04:39.901 --> 01:04:44.610
helmet while being dropped on his fucking head in the last minute of a fucking

1016
01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:49.080
Superbowl to keep the winning drive alive.
What a great fucking point.
That is.

1017
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.620
A great game.
And a major sport.
Football,
basketball,
baseball,

1018
01:04:52.621 --> 01:04:56.520
and I'll even throw in hockey as a courtesy to me.
Oh,
thank you,
dude.

1019
01:04:56.521 --> 01:05:00.360
Thank you for,
uh,
thank you for actually thinking about me.
Um,

1020
01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:04.770
is okay watching a great game and either one of those major sports is a,

1021
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:09.960
is for me better than the best movie or TV show.
It's the ultimate fucking drama.

1022
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:14.040
And as far as I'm concerned,
oh,
as far as I'm concerned,
second,

1023
01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.980
Jesus Christ,
I can't fucking read.
The font is too short.

1024
01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:24.100
Second,
following teams and players,
over time,

1025
01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.470
you can see some inspiring shit.

1026
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.370
I love this guy talks right when you think he's going to be intelligent,

1027
01:05:30.371 --> 01:05:32.770
he starts cursing.
This sounds like my act.

1028
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:35.560
You can see some inspiring shit.

1029
01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:40.600
This guy's really a motivational fucking dickhead.
Um,

1030
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.850
as a Yankee fan,
I watch Derek Jeter go from some skinny kid I'd never heard of,

1031
01:05:46.990 --> 01:05:49.930
to arguably the greatest shortstop of the modern era.

1032
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:55.080
I watched Andy Pettitte go from an okay rookie to a fucking Jesus freak who did

1033
01:05:55.181 --> 01:06:00.160
steroids.
Sorry,
that was me.
Um,
go from and,
okay.

1034
01:06:00.161 --> 01:06:04.690
Rookie to a guy who has an outside Charlotte at the hall of fame.
Why?

1035
01:06:04.691 --> 01:06:06.550
Because he admitted that he fucking did.

1036
01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:10.300
I like how he just came out and admitted that he cheated and that makes it okay.

1037
01:06:10.301 --> 01:06:13.300
Is that all the bankers had to do?
Yeah.
Sorry.

1038
01:06:13.301 --> 01:06:17.860
We actually took all the money and now old people are eating dog food so they

1039
01:06:17.861 --> 01:06:19.900
have a chance of being in the hall of fame of bankers.

1040
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:22.000
Is that what you're suggesting,
sir?

1041
01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:25.090
I really should start peddling this because I actually agree with what he's

1042
01:06:25.091 --> 01:06:25.924
saying here,

1043
01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:30.310
so now you have to go back tiny typing on a smaller scale.

1044
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:33.100
I've seen a guy like Phil Hughes go from rookie,

1045
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:37.720
a rookie who look overrated a couple of years ago to a guy who's tearing up the

1046
01:06:37.721 --> 01:06:38.560
League right now,

1047
01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:44.050
I'm sure for all the faggy Laker fans seeing Pau Gasol finally step,

1048
01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:49.210
finally step up and show some testicles instead of allowing the cells to punk

1049
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:54.420
him again is inspiring on some level a watching players and teams overcome these

1050
01:06:54.921 --> 01:06:55.391
struggles.

1051
01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:59.350
Make me thinks that if these guys have it in themselves to go from just

1052
01:06:59.351 --> 01:07:04.090
believing they can achieve great things to actually doing it.
I can too.

1053
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.510
Maybe it sounds corny or like it came out of a Disney movie,

1054
01:07:07.511 --> 01:07:10.240
but that's why I give us fuck about sports,
you know?
And I mean,

1055
01:07:10.241 --> 01:07:13.090
how can you argue that shit?
I mean,

1056
01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:16.420
how many times do you watch your movie and within the first 10 minutes you can

1057
01:07:16.421 --> 01:07:20.200
figure out where it's going.
You know,
there's the dude,

1058
01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:24.820
he's a fucking loser.
There's the fucking cool guy.
He's the shit.

1059
01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:28.330
He's treating the guy like shit.
He's got the hot girlfriend.

1060
01:07:28.331 --> 01:07:31.810
The lose of guys actually ended the toy if you need to finish it.
Chee,

1061
01:07:31.811 --> 01:07:33.670
how's that one going to end?
Let me guess.

1062
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:39.480
The fucking good looking girl finally realizes that her dick dickhead boyfriend

1063
01:07:39.611 --> 01:07:42.960
who treats her like shit from the beginning of the movie is actually a dickhead.

1064
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:47.970
Boyfriend dumps him and then she actually gets with this guy the fucking loser.

1065
01:07:48.671 --> 01:07:50.440
How many times did they make that God damn movie?

1066
01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:54.580
You know how many fucking movies?
All of a sudden the uh,
you know,
vampires,

1067
01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:57.880
they just keep movies making movies about vampires.

1068
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:01.720
Don't they are TV shows where all of a sudden vampires are sexy.
Now.

1069
01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:05.470
Is that what's going on?
See that?
That was a bad example.

1070
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.470
I thought I got the podcast back on on fucking track.

1071
01:08:08.471 --> 01:08:09.700
That was a terrible example.

1072
01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:14.860
I went from being able to predict how a movie is going to go to talking about

1073
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:18.560
trends and movies,
that they're making a bunch of fucking vampire movies.

1074
01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:22.610
What I should be saying is that they're predictable.
Actually.

1075
01:08:22.611 --> 01:08:25.370
They are predictable.
All right?

1076
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:29.450
Some cool new kid with a gray face is going to move to school and everyone's

1077
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.240
going to look like,
let's say the guy looks like he's fucking dead,

1078
01:08:32.241 --> 01:08:35.480
but there's something about them that everybody kind of likes and all the girls

1079
01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:38.780
pussies are going to get wet because there's something about his extra long

1080
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:39.890
fucking canines.

1081
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.870
Number six and number 11 to all you fucking dental douche bags out there,

1082
01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.750
you know?
Then he fucking bites their neck,
sucks their blood out.

1083
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:52.430
Then they become fucking maniacs,

1084
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:57.150
but it takes three times and somehow that fucking whore it,

1085
01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:59.570
you know is actually going to have a regular boyfriend,

1086
01:08:59.571 --> 01:09:03.170
but she can't resist his gray phase Douche bag with the giant fucking teeth.

1087
01:09:04.190 --> 01:09:06.680
She's going to bang them one other time.
She bangs.
One more time.

1088
01:09:06.681 --> 01:09:09.950
She's going to become a vampire and her boyfriend who should just say,

1089
01:09:09.951 --> 01:09:10.790
fuck that bitch.

1090
01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:14.600
If she wants to hang out with that big tooth junky cont let her become a
vampire.

1091
01:09:14.601 --> 01:09:16.730
I don't give a fuck.
For some reason he saw pussy whipped.

1092
01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:20.870
He's got to go save her and the only way to save her is to drive a stake through

1093
01:09:20.871 --> 01:09:25.100
that fucking assholes,
heart and g.
Do you think he's going to do it?

1094
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:29.420
Do you think he's somehow going to save her in the end?
Now,

1095
01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:30.680
can you do that with sports?

1096
01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.490
What is predictable in sports other than people are going to get absolutely

1097
01:09:34.491 --> 01:09:38.960
fucking hammered and that they're going to be out of shape and a,

1098
01:09:38.961 --> 01:09:41.440
that they're going to love their team when they're good and that they're going

1099
01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.820
to hate them when they're bad.
But as far as the outcome of the game,

1100
01:09:43.821 --> 01:09:47.010
you have no fucking idea.
You know deep.

1101
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:50.690
Don't you think right now as a Celtics fan that I want to sit here and I want to

1102
01:09:50.691 --> 01:09:55.040
start talking shit and say that it's a wrap.
You know what?

1103
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:57.710
It's never a Rep.
Look at the Bruins

1104
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.680
up three games to none against the fucking Philadelphia flyers.

1105
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:07.850
Go on and we lose,
by the way,

1106
01:10:07.851 --> 01:10:12.830
congratulations to the Chicago Blackhawks and my condolences to the flyer fans

1107
01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.750
and I'm dead serious when I say it.

1108
01:10:14.751 --> 01:10:18.170
A lot of people think that I fucking hate Philly because of that rant when in

1109
01:10:18.171 --> 01:10:19.620
reality I was,
you know,

1110
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:24.650
just doing a show and I was trying to piss people off from Philly.
All right.
Um,

1111
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.710
that was a great thing to see,
but I got to admit,
man,

1112
01:10:27.711 --> 01:10:32.711
that was the worst winning of a championship I think I've ever seen.

1113
01:10:32.901 --> 01:10:35.120
Just for the,
just for those of you who don't watch hockey,

1114
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:41.050
Patrick Kane in overtime and overtime goal to win the Stanley Cup.

1115
01:10:41.991 --> 01:10:43.160
He shoots the puck.

1116
01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:47.870
And this is really funny because people always see who hate hockey on to watch

1117
01:10:47.871 --> 01:10:49.910
it on TV.
Always say they can't see the puck.

1118
01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:54.230
This fucking guy is shot the puck and it somehow it went into the net.

1119
01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:58.880
It was from,
from the side.
He was almost parallel with the goal,
the goal line.

1120
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:59.900
And he shot it in,

1121
01:10:59.901 --> 01:11:04.340
in a disappeared into the side of the net and no one could knew where the puck

1122
01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:06.380
was except for Patrick Kane who shot at.

1123
01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.910
So he starts celebrating running down with his hands in the air,

1124
01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:13.230
doing the jazz hands,
you know,

1125
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:17.880
and all this fucking teammates are kind of like a,
well,
Patrick's freaking out,

1126
01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:23.070
dead silence in the spectrum or wherever the fuck you guys play.

1127
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:27.470
The Wacovia center dead fucking silence.
And then they have,

1128
01:11:27.471 --> 01:11:31.800
the reps had to go and do a review of it and five minutes later they like,

1129
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:33.450
oh yeah,
yeah,
you won the Stanley Cup.

1130
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.380
And then they had to regroup and get happy again.
I was so,

1131
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:37.770
it was such a fucking buzz kill.

1132
01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:43.140
But a congratulations to the Black Hawks and uh,
hey maple leaf fans.

1133
01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:46.350
Let me ask you something.
Were you rooting for the flyers?

1134
01:11:46.351 --> 01:11:51.351
I bet you were because now you guys are the saddest fucking sacks in the league.

1135
01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:54.360
Isn't that right away?
Does it?

1136
01:11:54.370 --> 01:11:58.620
1967 is that the last time you guys want it?
And I believe it is,

1137
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.300
but if you want it the last time in 1967 than that and then you would actually

1138
01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.270
be be tied with the expansion six.

1139
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:09.150
Anybody in the expansion six who didn't win it and that will be the California

1140
01:12:09.151 --> 01:12:12.150
seals where think went on to become the Cleveland Barons,

1141
01:12:12.151 --> 01:12:14.460
but they folded so they tapped out.

1142
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:18.300
Saint Louis Blues had never won it out of the expansion six.

1143
01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:21.390
Neither have the La Kings,
Minnesota north stars.

1144
01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.670
One is the Dallas Stars in 1999

1145
01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.390
penguins won it last year.
They wanted two times 91 and 92 look at this.

1146
01:12:30.391 --> 01:12:35.100
Why do I have this meaningless fucking information in my head?
Flyers.

1147
01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:39.840
One at 74 75
is that six right there.
One,
two,

1148
01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:42.060
three,
four,
five,
six.
There you go.

1149
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:47.910
Let me look this up.
Toronto.
Why don't I stop and just look this up.

1150
01:12:47.911 --> 01:12:49.920
God knows I'm not being fucking funny this week.

1151
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.600
Toronto Maple leafs.

1152
01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:57.930
That's actually a city I want to do a fucking stand up in,

1153
01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:02.590
but they never seem to fucking pony up any goddamn money.
All right.

1154
01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:07.920
1966 Stanley Cup final was the best to seven series between the Montreal

1155
01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.300
Canadiens,
Toronto Maple leafs.

1156
01:13:10.450 --> 01:13:13.890
Montreal may believes when the Stanley Cup and they'd never fucking went another

1157
01:13:13.891 --> 01:13:17.250
one.
So there you go.
So now it's a threeway fucking tie

1158
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:23.430
for the longest futility in hockey.
Toronto Maple leafs,

1159
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.390
the Los Angeles kings in wherever the fuck else I said,
cause I can't remember.

1160
01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.150
And the St Louis Blues

1161
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:36.000
and I'm praying all you guys don't win because the next person on that fucking

1162
01:13:36.001 --> 01:13:41.001
list is then I believe going to be the Bruins in 1970 and less Vancouver came in

1163
01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:45.510
and like 70.
Is that what happened?
Calgary flames capitals.

1164
01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.650
They all came in the early seventies right?
Isn't this interesting?

1165
01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:52.560
I don't think it is.
Jesus Christ.

1166
01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.380
Let's go back.
Let's go.
Let's,
let's go to some questions.
Maybe this will help me,

1167
01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:02.400
um,
questions for the week.
You know what?

1168
01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:04.170
I'm literally looking at the clock this week,

1169
01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:07.860
the way I do when I have a bad set and I'm looking down at my watch.
Like,

1170
01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:12.430
how many more minutes do I have to do?
How many more?
God Damn minutes.
All right.

1171
01:14:12.431 --> 01:14:15.250
Question a bill.
If you had enough money to quit,

1172
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:20.251
stand up and had the balls to give up your dream of becoming Ernest Borgnine,

1173
01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:26.590
where would you live in?
What would you do with your time?

1174
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:31.510
All right,
I have enough money and I can quit.

1175
01:14:31.511 --> 01:14:35.800
Stand up and I don't want to become an actor.
All right.
Uh,
where would I live in?

1176
01:14:35.801 --> 01:14:39.820
What would I do with my time?
I would live,

1177
01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:47.010
I think I'd live back east and I would live on a big piece of land where I could

1178
01:14:47.981 --> 01:14:52.840
grow my own food.
I'd get a pistol.
I get all the sports fucking channels.

1179
01:14:52.841 --> 01:14:54.880
I think I would live in a,

1180
01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:02.530
I dunno,
I'd want to live right outside of New York City,
one of those places.

1181
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:07.960
Terry town or an uh,
Jersey above the wash,
George Washington bridge,

1182
01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:11.920
all those fucking ritzy places,
but out out in the sticks a little bit.

1183
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:17.410
I'd lived there and I enjoy the four seasons to get a dog,

1184
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:21.520
a couple of horses I never ride.
To me,
that's one of my goals in life.

1185
01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:22.930
I want to get a couple of horses in a,

1186
01:15:22.931 --> 01:15:27.760
and I want them never to be written in their lives.
You know,

1187
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:32.140
after I found out what you have to do to make a fucking horse want to be
written,

1188
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:36.700
you got to break them
the same way they break those fucking,

1189
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:40.900
those people who work at hardware stores in slash terrorists.

1190
01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.250
Dan in Guantanamo Bay,
you know,

1191
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.480
you got to do that to a fucking horse.
And even then the horse,
she never quite,

1192
01:15:49.630 --> 01:15:53.650
cause I,
I noticed a couple,
the one or two times I've ridden a horse,

1193
01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:57.550
they still kind of are rebellious.
They do shit.

1194
01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.090
Like a friend of mine actually used to work with horses and said when you go to

1195
01:16:01.091 --> 01:16:03.550
put the saddle on him,
you got to tug it real.

1196
01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:06.190
You've got to tug the belt underneath.
You gotta Tuck it real tight.

1197
01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:10.930
Cause what they'll do is they'll take a big inhale.
All right?

1198
01:16:10.931 --> 01:16:12.310
And then when you go to in a new,

1199
01:16:12.311 --> 01:16:14.260
tie it on and then when you go to get on top of it,

1200
01:16:14.261 --> 01:16:18.610
they exhale on the saddle slides down.
You fall off the fucking horse.
I mean,

1201
01:16:18.611 --> 01:16:22.030
right.
If I,
if I ever had a horse and it never did that shit right there,

1202
01:16:22.031 --> 01:16:26.700
I would look into its big brown,
beautiful horse size and I would be like,
you,

1203
01:16:26.701 --> 01:16:30.340
you don't want to be written.
Do you?
You know whether that's it.

1204
01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:34.480
It's fucking over fucking over.
I'm not writing anymore.
All right,

1205
01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:40.360
go ahead.
Go run around in this fenced in area and don't fucking complain.

1206
01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:44.840
I'm fenced in to
this areas I can't go to.

1207
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:49.420
Why can't just cross borders you everything I've fucked up that is with like

1208
01:16:49.421 --> 01:16:52.750
countries and that type of shit.
I'll just where you're born,

1209
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:56.350
you're just all of a sudden on that team,
you know,

1210
01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:02.650
like why we're not allowed to just wander,
you know,

1211
01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:04.420
why can't I just walk to Brazil

1212
01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:11.450
like the old days and fucking go in and wash some dishes at a saloon,

1213
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:13.070
make a little bit of money,

1214
01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:17.540
and then jump on a fucking stage coach and right out of town to some bullshit,

1215
01:17:17.541 --> 01:17:18.374
right?

1216
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.060
Just fucking head down to Brazil and chill out down that you can't fucking do it

1217
01:17:23.061 --> 01:17:26.990
anymore.
God have all these goddamn identifications,

1218
01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.480
microchips and all this shit.

1219
01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:34.010
I've got to worry about roving bands of fucking gorilla terrorists

1220
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.903
arrested abroad.

1221
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.800
You guys ever see that fucking show arrested abroad makes you like you never

1222
01:17:42.801 --> 01:17:46.740
want to travel again?
I have to tell you,
even even this last time when I went,

1223
01:17:46.770 --> 01:17:50.720
when I went out of the country and I went to England,
Ireland and Scotland,

1224
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:56.120
uh,
not only ridiculously white,
not only do they all speak English,

1225
01:17:56.121 --> 01:17:59.690
but I'm actually have ancestry in all those parts of the country.

1226
01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:03.750
I still couldn't quite relax until I got back,
uh,

1227
01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.670
on my own turf.
You know,
I saw a spiral.

1228
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:12.170
I saw somebody with dirty toes and flip flops.
I was like,
America,
I'm back.

1229
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:13.760
I'm fucking back.

1230
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:18.410
Can you do that in in a,
no,

1231
01:18:18.411 --> 01:18:21.500
you can't even even in like a like how does that work over in Europe when you,

1232
01:18:21.501 --> 01:18:25.130
you know those dirty American college kids all of a sudden decide to get on a

1233
01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:28.340
fucking,
I'm
that guy.

1234
01:18:28.341 --> 01:18:31.130
They become dirty because I want to do it that you get on a train,

1235
01:18:31.131 --> 01:18:34.760
just go around Europe.
How does that work?

1236
01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.120
Do you have to show your passport,
your papers?
Please do you have to do that?

1237
01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:43.250
Or You guys so advanced in the new world order that you're all on the same

1238
01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:48.050
fucking currency and you just have one DMV making you a fucking driver's license

1239
01:18:48.051 --> 01:18:49.640
with a barcode in the back.
Have you seen that?

1240
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:51.500
You guys seen the new creepy commercial

1241
01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:55.040
way where I don't even know what the fuck's going on.

1242
01:18:55.041 --> 01:18:57.120
They have a baby in the middle.
It and the Al Volleys.

1243
01:18:57.190 --> 01:19:01.730
This electronic shit like examining every inch of the bay and that IBM

1244
01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:06.530
commercial,
the way they're selling microchipping the entire world with,
um,

1245
01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:11.060
become a smarter planet,
become a smarter planet.
Right?

1246
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:12.860
Who's gonna argue with that?
No one wants to know,

1247
01:19:12.861 --> 01:19:14.390
wants to become a dumber planet.

1248
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:18.650
Watch those commercials and read between the lines and see what the fuck they're

1249
01:19:18.651 --> 01:19:22.590
setting you up for.
They're already getting you comfortable with all the,
the,

1250
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:26.990
this,
this,
this robotic laser shit.
Looking at your,
your naked little baby,

1251
01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.440
they're going to fucking just like a goddamn dog.

1252
01:19:30.441 --> 01:19:33.380
They're going to stick a microchip right in the back of fucking Barcode,

1253
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:37.220
right on that soft part of his fucking I,
that's where they're going to stay.

1254
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:41.090
This third eye soft part of his skull to where they're going to bury them.

1255
01:19:41.091 --> 01:19:42.200
Microchip.
Right.

1256
01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:48.380
I give it one more generation and the only job that there's going to be as a

1257
01:19:48.381 --> 01:19:52.760
fucking human being other than wiping the ass of the Illuminati is to be the guy

1258
01:19:52.761 --> 01:19:57.260
who oils the fucking robots.
Other than that,
the rest of us,
we're going down.

1259
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:58.670
We're all getting processed.

1260
01:19:59.090 --> 01:20:04.090
That's my message on this happy fucking horrific car crash of a fucking podcast.

1261
01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:11.280
Um,
next question.
So that's why I do,
I would live back east and I,

1262
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:14.730
I would like to live on a big piece of property and I'd like to learn how to

1263
01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:19.300
grow my own food.
Um,
even if I wasn't into that conspiracy theory,
um,

1264
01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:24.120
type of shit.
I just,
uh,
there's just something about it.
I,

1265
01:20:24.121 --> 01:20:27.030
I think you should know how to live off the land.

1266
01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:31.110
I think you should know how to survive,
um,

1267
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:33.670
in the wild.
I just think that stuff,

1268
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:35.880
I think you should know how to defend yourself.
All of this stuff,

1269
01:20:35.881 --> 01:20:37.860
I don't know how to do,
you know,

1270
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:41.060
and I know how to defend myself as you put me in a headlock,

1271
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:43.530
I put you in a headlock and then we both,
shit,

1272
01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:46.590
they're tugging on each other going quit.
You quit,
you quit first.

1273
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:49.530
Like that's all I know how to do,
you know,

1274
01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:52.530
sit on your chest and fucking punch you.
That's,
I know how to do that.

1275
01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:56.010
If you're my little brother,
I know how to beat you up.
Um,

1276
01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.940
I don't know how to survive in the wild.
I was actually on the,
uh,

1277
01:20:59.941 --> 01:21:03.270
the Internet the other day and I was trying to learn how to hot wire a car and

1278
01:21:03.271 --> 01:21:07.080
pick a lock just in case just in case this shit happens.

1279
01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:12.620
And I'm that guy running around with cargo pants and a backpack like that

1280
01:21:12.871 --> 01:21:13.531
fucking show.

1281
01:21:13.531 --> 01:21:18.390
They have you seen that show after the apocalypse and the guy goes through the

1282
01:21:18.391 --> 01:21:22.140
garbage and he somehow finds
you know,

1283
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:24.960
stuff to eat and how to start a fire.
I don't know how to do any of that shit.

1284
01:21:25.530 --> 01:21:28.920
I want to learn how to do that shit so I don't take the coward way up and just

1285
01:21:28.921 --> 01:21:32.430
kill myself.
You know,
a lot of people have that as a plan.
That's it.

1286
01:21:32.431 --> 01:21:36.900
Backup PLO up.
Shit goes down.
I'll just kill myself,
you know?
Next.

1287
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.990
Next problem.
All right,
next question.
Here we go.
Dear Bill,

1288
01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:42.300
I'm 19 and I do stand up in New York City.

1289
01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:44.310
Well at least I did until I ran out of money,

1290
01:21:44.311 --> 01:21:49.311
paying for all the open mics and transportation of Troy show yawning here of

1291
01:21:50.401 --> 01:21:54.450
trying to get a job to pay for what I love doing.

1292
01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.200
Sounds like a plan.
Right?
Absolutely.
Sounds like a plan.

1293
01:21:58.201 --> 01:22:02.340
But of course the shit will eventually hit the fan.
Uh,

1294
01:22:02.341 --> 01:22:03.630
in about a month and a half,

1295
01:22:03.631 --> 01:22:08.220
my mom is going to move back to New England and I'm definitely not going back

1296
01:22:08.221 --> 01:22:10.470
because one,
that shit sucks.

1297
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:14.700
And to New York is the best place to do stand up every day.

1298
01:22:14.701 --> 01:22:19.290
My mom and my older brother give me shit for every little thing every day.
My,

1299
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:24.780
uh,
what,
sorry,
my fucking,
I just jumped the line.

1300
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:30.090
I'm trying to get a job,
but I look like a hippie.
So that shit ain't easy.

1301
01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:31.430
No Way.

1302
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:34.980
Every day my mom and older brother give me shit for every little thing I do.

1303
01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.840
I'm trying to get a job,
but I look like a hippie.
So that shit ain't easy.

1304
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:44.450
Um,
now for the part that leaves me make,
making,
uh,
leads me looking like,

1305
01:22:44.490 --> 01:22:48.780
like a pussy.
I feel like no matter what I do,
I'm wasting time.

1306
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:54.050
I should do stand up every night and my carefree attitudes does nothing but piss

1307
01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:58.380
off the stressed out bastards in my house.
If you were in this situation,

1308
01:22:58.381 --> 01:23:00.540
what would you do?
A well,

1309
01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:03.900
you didn't give me enough of your situation to fully tell you.
Um,

1310
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:09.760
I don't know how old you are.
Oh,
19.
Yeah.
19.
Uh,
what do I do?

1311
01:23:09.761 --> 01:23:11.650
I would get a fucking job.
That's what I would do.

1312
01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:16.660
I would get a job that would allow me to stay in the tristate area.

1313
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.470
I would continue to do stand up down there.

1314
01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:26.110
That's what I would do if you don't want to move to Boston,
but,

1315
01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:29.170
um,
you know,
if you want it to move to Boston,
I mean,
that's where I started.

1316
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:33.010
I can't really comment on the scene.
The scene was great when a,

1317
01:23:33.011 --> 01:23:36.970
when I was up there and I had a day job and I did spots at night,

1318
01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.450
came to work sleepy or whatever,
and I got myself to the point,

1319
01:23:40.451 --> 01:23:44.740
I just saved up a ton of money.
Um,
I could give you this advice.
Whatever you do,

1320
01:23:44.741 --> 01:23:48.220
don't get a fucking credit card and get yourself into some ridiculous debt

1321
01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.260
because that is the,
uh,

1322
01:23:50.261 --> 01:23:54.430
that's the modern day slavery is the loaning of money at interest.

1323
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:58.870
And you need to avoid that at all fucking costs.
So what I would do,

1324
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:02.200
get a reliable car.
All this shit requires money,

1325
01:24:02.201 --> 01:24:05.980
but I would not go out and buy a brand new fucking car,
get a job,

1326
01:24:05.981 --> 01:24:09.730
and get all this fucking debt to quote unquote build up your credit.

1327
01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:15.210
I wouldn't do any of that shit.
All right?
I would keep myself,
um,

1328
01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:21.310
I wouldn't be in a relationship,
you know,
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't,
I would keep it.

1329
01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:23.740
Um,
I keep it real light.

1330
01:24:23.741 --> 01:24:27.850
Travel light is what I would say travel like,
dude,
you're 19 years old.

1331
01:24:27.851 --> 01:24:30.610
You ought to be able to sleep on the sidewalk.
All right?

1332
01:24:30.611 --> 01:24:33.790
Your body is still brand new.
It's brand fucking new.

1333
01:24:33.791 --> 01:24:38.380
You don't have any aches or pains.
If you want to stay there,
you just stay there,

1334
01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:41.980
find a fucking job,
whatever you gotta do,

1335
01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:45.310
just get a Goddamn job out there.
And then I would continue on and then,
uh,

1336
01:24:45.311 --> 01:24:49.180
just think positive,
think positive in his bat.

1337
01:24:49.181 --> 01:24:50.800
And no matter how bad it fucking gets,

1338
01:24:50.801 --> 01:24:54.420
just think this is just a funny chapter in a,
in a,

1339
01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:58.000
in a book that I'll write some day or a funny story to tell if I'm sitting on

1340
01:24:58.001 --> 01:25:00.760
the couch on Conan one day,
just look at it that way.

1341
01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:04.930
Don't listen to the negative fucks around you and uh,
just keep going.

1342
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:08.530
That's what I would do.
If you want to stay in the New York area and do stand up,

1343
01:25:08.531 --> 01:25:13.120
then that's exactly what the fuck I would do.
Do that.
That is my advice to you.

1344
01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.900
Good luck to you,
sir.
And I hope it all works out for you.

1345
01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:18.730
And if by the time you make it,

1346
01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:23.440
I've already made it and then have a fucking brutal drug habit,
uh,
helped me out,

1347
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:28.150
trust me,
tossed me and opening gig.
I'll open for you.
Um,
all right.

1348
01:25:28.151 --> 01:25:30.520
This is one of the last things.
There's gonna be a short podcast this week.

1349
01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.300
I apologize.
I just don't fucking have it this week.
I really don't.

1350
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:37.780
I got a million things on my fucking mind.
I got a bunch of bills I have to pay.

1351
01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:41.740
I got all this shit.
I'm running around,
hey,
you know,
it's fucked up.
They,

1352
01:25:41.741 --> 01:25:45.490
I got I a,
I thought it was gonna be doing Letterman again next week.
Uh,

1353
01:25:45.491 --> 01:25:48.190
I got bumped again.
I got bumped again.

1354
01:25:48.191 --> 01:25:53.191
So at least that stress is taken off is kind of cool though,

1355
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:57.790
because the set has been ready since May.
So,
um,

1356
01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:59.800
rather than the panic that I usually have,

1357
01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:03.840
usually when they asked me to do Letterman,
uh,
they call me up,
they go,

1358
01:26:03.841 --> 01:26:08.270
what do you got?
You've got five minutes ready.
And as always,
I lie and I go,

1359
01:26:08.271 --> 01:26:11.690
yeah,
I got five minutes clean material.

1360
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:18.060
Um,
and then I frantically try to put it together and uh,
you know,

1361
01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:22.360
I stressful like fucking 14 days before I finally start to get it.

1362
01:26:22.361 --> 01:26:25.450
I feel like I have it and then it always ends up going well,

1363
01:26:25.451 --> 01:26:27.540
but there's an unbelievable amount of stress.
But the thing is,

1364
01:26:27.541 --> 01:26:30.800
is I already went through that bullshit in April,

1365
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:34.920
getting ready for the beginning of May.
And then,
um,
you know,

1366
01:26:34.921 --> 01:26:36.960
then it went away and then,
uh,

1367
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:40.140
started to build up again and all of a sudden June,
I'm ready to go on the today.

1368
01:26:40.141 --> 01:26:43.150
Boom,
you're out.
You fucking out.
So,

1369
01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:48.230
so I'm ready to go.
I don't know what the point of that fucking story was.

1370
01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:57.260
Okay.
You know what,
I just am I allowed to take a week off people?
Am I,

1371
01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:04.330
how about this?
We just,
um,
we just got the final copy of my new special is ready.

1372
01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.470
We,
we uh,
just locked the master or whatever they say.

1373
01:27:08.471 --> 01:27:10.600
Technically it's ready to go.

1374
01:27:10.601 --> 01:27:13.960
I got extras and one of the extras actually is the Monday morning podcast,

1375
01:27:13.961 --> 01:27:16.930
which would have been a great thing to bring up if,
uh,

1376
01:27:17.790 --> 01:27:17.950
<v 7>yeah,</v>

1377
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:21.100
<v 6>if this was actually a decent podcast,
but one of the extras is we,</v>

1378
01:27:21.101 --> 01:27:23.840
I filmed one of my podcasts,
um,

1379
01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:28.150
another extras is some people heckling me in a club,
a couple episodes of that

1380
01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:33.160
<v 7>and uh,
whatever.
The rest of it,
you'll find out when you buy the thing.</v>

1381
01:27:33.161 --> 01:27:34.780
And considering this thing is free.

1382
01:27:34.781 --> 01:27:39.760
I'm letting you guys know right now when I get an actual release date for this,

1383
01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:41.290
uh,
for the podcast,

1384
01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:46.100
I'm going to be coming at you guys hard and heavy with the guilt.
Okay?

1385
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:50.090
And if you think you're only going to be required to buy one DVD,

1386
01:27:50.091 --> 01:27:53.460
I got news for Ya.
I got,
I'm,
I'm going more than that.

1387
01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:57.030
<v 6>All right?
I'm not going to say how many I think you should buy,</v>

1388
01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.560
but it's more than one and it's less than three.

1389
01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:05.290
But I'm not going to say what that number.
Behavior.
All right,

1390
01:28:05.310 --> 01:28:08.580
let's read the last thing here.
Overrated for this week.
Overrated sprint.

1391
01:28:08.581 --> 01:28:10.920
Customer service.
I swear to God,

1392
01:28:10.921 --> 01:28:13.740
these people are just there to Piss you off bill.
It's like,

1393
01:28:13.741 --> 01:28:14.850
no matter what you say,

1394
01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:19.490
they have some textbook comeback to make you seem like an asshole of funny.

1395
01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:22.230
Is that a,
what?
Do they explain the phone and you don't get it.

1396
01:28:22.231 --> 01:28:25.290
So now you're blaming them.
Actually know what you're saying.
Um,

1397
01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:28.760
I have been with sprint for years now and I'm always bitching to them about this

1398
01:28:28.761 --> 01:28:32.460
shitty phones.
But can you blame me?
Either the screen,

1399
01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:36.120
either the screen breaks or the fucking thing doesn't charge.

1400
01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:39.990
Like two days ago I went and yet again to get my phone looked at because when I

1401
01:28:39.991 --> 01:28:42.330
plugged in the charger,
the phone wouldn't charge.

1402
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:44.870
So I bring the phone up and the charger,

1403
01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:48.560
I bring the phone and the charger up into the store and the Douche bag behind

1404
01:28:48.561 --> 01:28:51.980
the counter says the charger port in the phone is bad.

1405
01:28:51.981 --> 01:28:55.790
We will order you a new phone,
come back in two days and it'll be here.

1406
01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:59.350
It'll be here for you.
Keep in mind,
uh,

1407
01:28:59.430 --> 01:29:03.930
they looked at both the phone and charger.
So I say,
that's fine with me.

1408
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:08.160
I'm ordering a phone.
Takes some time,
two days,
no,
no big deal.

1409
01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:12.900
Two days later I pick up the phone and bring it home to find out the fucking

1410
01:29:12.901 --> 01:29:15.810
thing.
Doesn't charge some sitting here thinking,

1411
01:29:15.811 --> 01:29:18.530
what the fuck did they order me a new what?
The,

1412
01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.430
what the fuck did they order me a new phone for?

1413
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:24.330
So I go back to the sprint store and I very calmly explained that the charger

1414
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:28.590
was the problem the whole time.
Like I had said since the beginning.

1415
01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:33.750
So they go back and fuck around the things some more and this comes back to me

1416
01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:38.370
and tells me that I was right.
Um,
and here's where I get pissed.

1417
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:43.400
She tells me that I need to buy the new charger myself because apparently a full

1418
01:29:44.341 --> 01:29:48.630
insurance doesn't cover accessories.
I swear to God,
I never would have,

1419
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:53.070
I would never hit a woman,
but this bitch got me so angry.
Um,

1420
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:56.790
I explained that,
that uh,
they were the ones,
they were the ones who diagnosed,

1421
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:58.950
diagnosed the fucking problem,
not me.

1422
01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:01.770
They're the ones who ordered a new phone when I didn't even need one.

1423
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:06.330
Plus I had to wait two days to find out all this to find all that shit out and

1424
01:30:06.331 --> 01:30:10.860
they still charge me $40 for the fucking thing.
No discount or anything.

1425
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:15.810
Sorry.
Just had to vent.
Yeah.
That's one of those deals where you have to,
um,

1426
01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.750
you have to stop talking to the person at the counter.

1427
01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:21.510
The first thing you have to do is you got to keep your temper in check.

1428
01:30:21.511 --> 01:30:26.310
I did a whole segment on this about a year ago about the magic of the word

1429
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:31.340
unacceptable in whatever wisdom I learned was fleeting because I've gone right

1430
01:30:31.651 --> 01:30:34.290
back to flipping out and screaming at people.

1431
01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:39.210
And I can tell you from personal experience that that is not,

1432
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:43.260
it's not,
does not get you the desired results.

1433
01:30:43.261 --> 01:30:45.480
So what you should have done was say that

1434
01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.430
I need to talk to somebody above you.
I understand you don't make these rules.

1435
01:30:50.431 --> 01:30:52.020
You just keep complimenting the person.

1436
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.510
And he just keeps saying it's unacceptable,
unacceptable.

1437
01:30:54.511 --> 01:30:58.590
Eventually that you're going to get to the highest person in the store and what

1438
01:30:58.591 --> 01:31:01.860
they're going to do is tell you that you then have to jump through a couple of

1439
01:31:01.861 --> 01:31:05.010
fucking hoops,
email people,

1440
01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:08.400
something involving the Internet and they're all just hoping you're going to tap

1441
01:31:08.401 --> 01:31:10.350
out.
But if you never fucking tap out,

1442
01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:14.400
you're going to get what you have coming to you.
That's just what they do.

1443
01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:19.620
That's just how it works now.
And,
uh,
you know,
I don't know what to tell you.

1444
01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:23.010
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't even know what to say.

1445
01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:25.140
God knows it won't be anything funny.

1446
01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:28.680
This fucking piece of shit of a fucking podcast,

1447
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.820
this fucking podcast.
Where was it?
Was was a car.

1448
01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:36.060
Here's some questions for you this week of this podcast was a car.

1449
01:31:36.061 --> 01:31:40.260
What would it be
if it was a comedian?
Who would it be?

1450
01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:45.360
If it was a president?
Who would it be?
Go to the [inaudible] podcast people,

1451
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:48.330
the [inaudible] podcast.com.
Go to that page.

1452
01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:51.960
We'll have the questions up there and you can fucking send in your answers and

1453
01:31:51.961 --> 01:31:55.860
I'll read them next week.
If you want to trash me,
go right ahead.

1454
01:31:55.861 --> 01:32:00.160
I fucking deserved
that.
You know what?
This is the,
this is the first

1455
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:04.120
<v 7>time of podcast is really seem like work.
Usually I'm in here,</v>

1456
01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:06.580
I'm having a good time.
Maybe I'm,
I'm fucking jet jetlagged.

1457
01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.450
What if I just ran out of funny?
You know,

1458
01:32:10.451 --> 01:32:13.090
they always say that you've got to worry about that shit as a comedian.

1459
01:32:13.091 --> 01:32:15.910
You just dry up.
Maybe I'm drying up.

1460
01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.480
I turned 42 years old and that's it.
That was the magic number.

1461
01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:25.180
First 18 years of his career,
man,
a tay.
The gay fucking just steadily improved.

1462
01:32:25.930 --> 01:32:28.780
He just kept getting better and better and better.

1463
01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:33.040
And then he hit 42 and I dunno what happened.
He started regressing.

1464
01:32:34.150 --> 01:32:37.510
First thing he did,
he started doing the podcast in the afternoon.
It was hot.

1465
01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:42.220
He started sweating.
Cooking is fucking brain,
you know,

1466
01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:45.400
just fucking all went downhill from there.
See right there.

1467
01:32:45.401 --> 01:32:48.100
I thought I was going to go on some sort of a riff and it just fucking ended.

1468
01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:53.500
I got nothing.
Why would I think after 55 minutes of mental torture

1469
01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:58.090
dead,
all of a sudden I was just going to pull this fucking gem out of my ass.

1470
01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:03.730
Is that what I thought was going to happen?
It didn't.
I got fucking news for you.

1471
01:33:03.731 --> 01:33:04.564
It didn't.

1472
01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:08.980
My brain would just started thinking of the oil spill.

1473
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:11.290
Like I was going to riff on that.

1474
01:33:11.410 --> 01:33:13.930
I got nothing to say about it cause I'm fucking watched a second of it because

1475
01:33:13.931 --> 01:33:16.750
there's nothing I can do about it.
All right.

1476
01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:22.410
Put a picture up when when you clogged the fucking hole.
By the way,

1477
01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:26.560
if they ever going to be able to clean that up,
are we so in trouble that,

1478
01:33:26.630 --> 01:33:30.070
that you realize that they actually listened to Kevin Costner.

1479
01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:33.790
Kevin Costner actually got a meeting with the government.
That's how dumb I am.

1480
01:33:33.791 --> 01:33:35.290
I don't even know what branch of the government.

1481
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:39.520
He went to Washington and he met with the government,
you know,

1482
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:40.631
whatever the fuck he did.

1483
01:33:40.631 --> 01:33:44.020
He went to one of those buildings that's painted white and as pillars out in the

1484
01:33:44.021 --> 01:33:47.740
front and he went in there and there was fucking five old people sitting there

1485
01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:51.910
in suits and he,
you know,
he did the usual,
I didn't come here as an actor.

1486
01:33:51.911 --> 01:33:54.700
I came here as a blah,
blah,
blah.
He has got some side company

1487
01:33:57.250 --> 01:34:00.070
that I guess vacuums oil off the top of the water.

1488
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:06.120
How did even get that meeting?
What are they?
Well,

1489
01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:10.090
he was in waterworld.
I mean there's water right there.
Shit.

1490
01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:16.030
But the,
fuck me,
he and he did fucking play odd.
John F.
Kennedy.
Actually,

1491
01:34:16.031 --> 01:34:16.780
no sir.
He didn't.

1492
01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:20.770
He played the guy investigating it while he was in contact with the president.

1493
01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:25.870
There you go,
right there.
He fought in the civil war.

1494
01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:30.250
He fucking played baseball.
He built a Goddamn stadium.

1495
01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.640
What more does this guy have to fucking do to get a God damn meeting with us?

1496
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:36.670
He finger bag meg Ryan in the back of that Limo.

1497
01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:42.350
What else did he do?
I can't.
I can't remember any of his.
I know.

1498
01:34:42.351 --> 01:34:43.240
I'm fucking all these up.

1499
01:34:43.241 --> 01:34:46.660
He was fucking with the guy from the breakfast club when they went skydive and

1500
01:34:46.661 --> 01:34:49.750
Fandango.
Hey,

1501
01:34:49.751 --> 01:34:53.500
remember that one kid who had that part in the movie and Fandango who just slept

1502
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.760
in the back of the car?
The entire fucking movie.
I had my,

1503
01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:01.160
my part in date night was one level above that,

1504
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:10.000
that actor and Fandango called me and the guy from weekend at Bernie's called me

1505
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:14.060
to see how did you get eight lines?
Dude,
you're,
you're blowing up.

1506
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:18.440
You fucking blowing up.
So anyways,
fucking,
uh,

1507
01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:20.240
Kevin Costner,

1508
01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:26.090
who liked Jack Nicholson is gonna take forever to go bald.
You know,

1509
01:35:26.091 --> 01:35:29.680
I don't know what those guys dump on their fucking heads,
but they,
they,

1510
01:35:29.681 --> 01:35:33.620
they really,
they stave it off.
They really stave it off.
I,
on the other hand,

1511
01:35:33.621 --> 01:35:36.560
I'm not using any of that shit.
I'm just letting it fucking happen.

1512
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:39.650
And then what I'm going to do is in 10 years,

1513
01:35:39.651 --> 01:35:44.651
I figured the fact that they can grow a fucking colon outside of the human body,

1514
01:35:47.271 --> 01:35:49.750
if they can fucking do that in,
in 10 in it,

1515
01:35:49.770 --> 01:35:52.490
and then take out the old one and stick the new one in.

1516
01:35:52.491 --> 01:35:55.850
Like he just got a new exhaust system.
There's no fucking way.

1517
01:35:56.660 --> 01:35:59.420
They're not going to have a cure for this shit in 10 fucking years.

1518
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:05.840
I'll just fucking pop a pill and she'll just start growing back like magic,

1519
01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:09.890
like fucking magic.
I learned that.

1520
01:36:09.891 --> 01:36:12.650
I learned that the other day when I was watching one of those shows for,

1521
01:36:12.651 --> 01:36:17.330
you know,
it,
it's not a,
it's not out to pay at your actual fucking hair.
Right.

1522
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:21.500
And they got that 50 year old guy running his hands through his,

1523
01:36:21.501 --> 01:36:24.470
his Jay Leno had a hair now and he's going,

1524
01:36:24.471 --> 01:36:28.070
you know I wish I did this 10 years ago and it's like dude,
no you,
no you don't.

1525
01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.880
No you don't.
If you go back and look at what hair plugs look like 10 years ago,

1526
01:36:31.881 --> 01:36:34.820
sir,
you're going to say I'm really glad I waited.

1527
01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:39.470
It's like people will go in and get their tattoos removed and then they just

1528
01:36:39.471 --> 01:36:42.800
have that permanent Indian sunburn because they fuck it up because it's new.

1529
01:36:42.801 --> 01:36:47.540
Just wait a few years,
wait a few years.
It's all going to be great if you,

1530
01:36:47.541 --> 01:36:49.730
if that's,
that's my advice for you.
If you can wait.

1531
01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.720
I had a buddy of mine who did crystal meth and a bunch of fucked up drugs and he

1532
01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:59.040
dried out his joints and had to get like hip replacement surgery at like 36 and

1533
01:36:59.061 --> 01:37:02.990
he's needed it for like six years and the doctor says just wait,
just wait.

1534
01:37:02.991 --> 01:37:06.920
Just wait.
Cause when I was younger,
if you got hip replacement church surgery,

1535
01:37:06.921 --> 01:37:11.000
you are fucked unless you got it at like 60 or 70.

1536
01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:13.490
Because it only lasted for like 10 years.

1537
01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.540
And people used to die in their sixties John Wayne,

1538
01:37:17.541 --> 01:37:22.541
all of them fucking rump roast hanging out of the fucking your anus.

1539
01:37:23.150 --> 01:37:26.670
He just collapsed one day.
Just fuck.

1540
01:37:26.671 --> 01:37:31.430
I was just rump roast and Geritol pills under the undigested Geritol pills.

1541
01:37:31.690 --> 01:37:32.440
That's,
that's all.

1542
01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:35.930
You just died to that and everybody dropped in there fucking sixties.

1543
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
But whatever I'm going,
I'm trying to say is you're fucking,

1544
01:37:41.530 --> 01:37:44.660
you hip only lasted for 10 years and then then you were in a wheelchair.

1545
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:48.680
Like what's his face?
Earl Campbell.
Earl Campbell now was in a wheelchair,
but,
uh,

1546
01:37:48.681 --> 01:37:52.300
my buddy has needed it for like five,
six,
seven years in,

1547
01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:57.450
in a s five,
six,
seven years ago,
the said of stuttering again said,

1548
01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.310
uh,
that he needed this hip replacement surgery.

1549
01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:04.090
And he's just told him if he can wait,
if he could deal with the pain that,
uh,

1550
01:38:04.130 --> 01:38:08.140
the advancements that they were having,
he would be so much better.
And he waited.

1551
01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.500
And I hadn't seen the guy in a minute.
One of those friends we showed up,

1552
01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:15.280
you only went to a fucking hockey game or something and he had handicap plates

1553
01:38:15.281 --> 01:38:18.120
and I couldn't understand why he's walking normally said,
oh,
I had,

1554
01:38:18.170 --> 01:38:20.540
I had hip replacement surgery and I was like,

1555
01:38:20.541 --> 01:38:23.690
when he said like six months ago and he's fucking walking around all normal,

1556
01:38:25.110 --> 01:38:26.400
get the fuck outta here.
He goes,
yeah.

1557
01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:30.420
And he explained the whole thing how now they used to like just cut your whole

1558
01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:35.740
leg open almost from my hip down to your knee and just remove your entire hip

1559
01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:41.160
and like,
I dunno,
like half your fucking femur
now.

1560
01:38:41.161 --> 01:38:45.550
I don't know what they do.
I Dunno what they do,
but it's working people.

1561
01:38:45.551 --> 01:38:48.190
Is this interesting me explaining fucking hip surgery.

1562
01:38:48.490 --> 01:38:52.560
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
Maybe that will work with the oil spill

1563
01:38:55.100 --> 01:38:55.341
you want.

1564
01:38:55.341 --> 01:39:00.341
The big deal is is I like how Kevin Costner has actually has a side business

1565
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:04.790
that's so fucking smart because if you listen to this fucking podcast,

1566
01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:08.810
shouldn't I really have a side business?
Should I have something to fall back on?

1567
01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:11.510
Ah,
fuck.
That's it.
All right.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1568
01:39:11.630 --> 01:39:15.400

Don't judge me.

1569
01:39:16.410 --> 01:39:18.490
Okay.

1570
01:39:18.491 --> 01:39:21.560
