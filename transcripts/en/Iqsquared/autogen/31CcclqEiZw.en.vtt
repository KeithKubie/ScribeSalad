a little bit here surely this point that
the questioner made about surveillance

01:29:40.890 --> 01:29:40.900
the questioner made about surveillance
 

01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:43.590
the questioner made about surveillance
is indeed one of the strongest cases for

01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600
is indeed one of the strongest cases for
 

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.490
is indeed one of the strongest cases for
1984's

01:29:44.490 --> 01:29:44.500

01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:47.110
prescient the notion that there is CCTV
 

01:29:47.110 --> 01:29:49.110
prescient the notion that there is CCTV
everywhere we're constantly surveilled

01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:49.120
everywhere we're constantly surveilled
 

01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:52.320
everywhere we're constantly surveilled
all well got that right yeah but who are

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:52.330
all well got that right yeah but who are
 

01:29:52.330 --> 01:29:55.530
all well got that right yeah but who are
we being surveilled by I mean the thing

01:29:55.530 --> 01:29:55.540
we being surveilled by I mean the thing
 

01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:57.810
we being surveilled by I mean the thing
is the back door that was opened by the

01:29:57.810 --> 01:29:57.820
is the back door that was opened by the
 

01:29:57.820 --> 01:30:01.890
is the back door that was opened by the
NSA in cahoots with Google Microsoft etc

01:30:01.890 --> 01:30:01.900
NSA in cahoots with Google Microsoft etc
 

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:05.280
NSA in cahoots with Google Microsoft etc
is if you think about it much more to do

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:05.290
is if you think about it much more to do
 

01:30:05.290 --> 01:30:07.470
is if you think about it much more to do
with consumption than it is to do with

01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:07.480
with consumption than it is to do with
 

01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.930
with consumption than it is to do with
surveillance and actually the people in

01:30:09.930 --> 01:30:09.940
surveillance and actually the people in
 

01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:12.180
surveillance and actually the people in
the NSA I mean sociologists call it

01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:12.190
the NSA I mean sociologists call it
 

01:30:12.190 --> 01:30:14.850
the NSA I mean sociologists call it
professional closure their surveillance

01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:14.860
professional closure their surveillance
 

01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:17.040
professional closure their surveillance
is really only a concomitant of that

01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:17.050
is really only a concomitant of that
 

01:30:17.050 --> 01:30:19.800
is really only a concomitant of that
commercial surveillance so yeah I think

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:19.810
commercial surveillance so yeah I think
 

01:30:19.810 --> 01:30:22.919
commercial surveillance so yeah I think
Orwell got it right in some ways that we

01:30:22.919 --> 01:30:22.929
Orwell got it right in some ways that we
 

01:30:22.929 --> 01:30:25.200
Orwell got it right in some ways that we
were going to live if you like in our in

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:25.210
were going to live if you like in our in
 

01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:26.970
were going to live if you like in our in
a world in which we were permanently

01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:26.980
a world in which we were permanently
 

01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.310
a world in which we were permanently
surveyed but I would argue that the

01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320
surveyed but I would argue that the
 

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.800
surveyed but I would argue that the
purposes of that surveillance is more to

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:31.810
purposes of that surveillance is more to
 

01:30:31.810 --> 01:30:34.080
purposes of that surveillance is more to
make us good little tractable consumers

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:34.090
make us good little tractable consumers
 

01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:36.540
make us good little tractable consumers
than it is to confirm our ideological

01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:36.550
than it is to confirm our ideological
 

01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:39.360
than it is to confirm our ideological
purity and also if I could just say the

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:39.370
purity and also if I could just say the
 

01:30:39.370 --> 01:30:41.100

you didn't talk about China and I'd
argue that you didn't mention China in

01:30:47.459 --> 01:30:47.469
argue that you didn't mention China in

precisely because of what you're saying
it's mutating into brave new world why

01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:53.320
it's mutating into brave new world why
 

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.180
it's mutating into brave new world why
don't you come back with that and then

01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:54.190
don't you come back with that and then
 

01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:55.260
don't you come back with that and then
we're gonna have closing remarks all

01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:55.270
we're gonna have closing remarks all
 

01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:58.740
