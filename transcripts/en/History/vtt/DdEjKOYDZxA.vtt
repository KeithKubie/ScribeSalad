00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.330
RICK: What do we got here?

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.210
I found-- in a foreclosed
house that I bought,

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.710
I was kind of cleaning out a
bunch of junk in there and came

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.710
across this book
in a closet, kind

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.540
of stuffed in the back corner.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.880
And boom, that's
what I came across.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.380
Whoa-- a Martha
Washington $1 bill.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.000
This is pretty amazing.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.710
COREY: She looks really like
George Washington, though,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.710
doesn't she?

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.580
RICK: Show a little respect.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.880
I'm just saying
that her hair sucks.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.500
That's all.
WOMAN: Hm.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.920
Coming the pawn shop today to
sell this dollar that I found

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.380
with Martha Washington on it.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.250
Hoping to sell the
dollar for about $1,500.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.420
It'll be a nice little cushion.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.830
I'll probably buy
something cool,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.380
you know, maybe a hot
tub or a pool table

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.000
or something like that
to go with the house.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
RICK: This is back when
we used to care about what

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.250
our money looked like.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.420
BRYAN: Yeah, this is gnarly.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.750
This is technically the only
woman that's been on a US bill.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.330
I mean, they just
announced that they're

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.500
most likely going to put a
woman on the $10 bill now.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.830
I heard that.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.080
No, it's just an
incredibly good shape.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.250
Luckily it was in this book.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.420
How much are you looking
to get out of it?

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.120
You know, I looked
online a little bit.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.960
And what I could see is it, you
know, was worth around $1,500.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.460
COREY: I mean, it's
in really good shape.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.580
Do we need to get it graded?

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.960
Well, that's the weird thing.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.420
When it's in this good
of shape, you really

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.790
do need to get it graded.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.460
And there's 10 grades
of a pristine bill.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.790
I mean, this thing
could be worth

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.620
anywhere from between
$1,000 and $10,000.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.710
$10,000?

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.960
Oh, my gosh.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.460
It all depends
on how it grades.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.960
Out and there's a
lot of variables

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.750
when it comes to paper money.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.790
I have a friend who's in town
right now, and he grades bills.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.420
I'm going to get him down here.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.960
He'll tell me what grade
it is and help me out

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.250
with the price a little bit.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.290
And we'll go from there, OK?
- Perfect.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.880
Sounds good.
Thanks.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.580
Be right back.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.460
So hearing that could be worth
$10,000, I'm pretty stoked.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.460
That'd be amazing.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.830
Grading paper money is a
really, really tricky business.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.000
So I'm calling it
a friend of mine

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.420
who does this for a living.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.920
How's it going, buddy?
Hey, Rick.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.580
Nice to meet you.
Peter.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.920
Bryan.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.330
This is the, you
know, Martha $1 bill.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.750
It's in great shape.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.330
And-- but we are
[inaudible] with paper money

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.620
and you guys and your
little grading weirdness.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.460
Sure.
Sure.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.790
This is fantastic.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.500
My name is Peter Treglia.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.830
And I work for a company called
Stack's Bowers Galleries.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.670
I'm an expert in rare United
States paper currency.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.000
Well, this is an 1891
$1 silver certificate.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.750
Well, the overall condition
is pretty fantastic, actually.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.330
- Grab yo a tray real quick.
- Yeah, please.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.500
Thank you.
I brought my light here.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.830
OK, so as you know,
paper currency

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.880
is-- it's very fragile.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.040
Unlike coins, you can
kind of fool around.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.380
You can iron.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.880
You can enhance the
condition of a bill.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.040
But-- well, this is
actually really--

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.620
this is really,
really high grade.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.880
At first glance, appears
to be flawless, and if so,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.500
could be worth
upwards of $20,000.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.040
Wow.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.170
It is in absolutely
awesome condition.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.790
The best a bill can be is
gem crisp uncirculated.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.880
And the worst is a poor.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.920
This is kind of towards
the top end of the range.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.540
BRYAN: OK.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.420
PETER TREGLIA: However, it
does have a slight, very

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.170
slight, centerfold,
which takes it out

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.250
of the uncirculated category.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.880
It is not in the top range.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.080
As far as value, I would put
a conservative retail value

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.540
around $1,500.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.750
OK.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.710
- But it's a cool find here.
- Yeah.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.210
I mean, I'm stoked.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.250
I just love the fact
that you're seeing Martha

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.830
Washington is on a centerfold.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.080
[laughter]

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.000
Thanks, man, appreciate it.
- [inaudible], Rick.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.080
- Thank you, buddy.
- Corey.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.210
It's a pleasure.
- Thanks, Peter.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.580
Nice meeting you.
- Take care.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.830
If the shop is able
to acquire this bill,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.330
I think it's a
fantastic buy for them.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.210
They should have no
issues selling it quickly.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.580
So the man said to $1,500.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.080
What do you say, man?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.960
Yeah, he said $1,500 was
a fair retail value, OK?

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.460
And I have to make a living.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.710
So I'll give you $800,

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.210
$800?

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.580
Oh, man, you're killing me.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.040
You just got offered
$800 for a $1 bill--

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.460
--that you found.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.790
Yeah, I get you guys
got to make a living.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.620
But come on, man.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.960
$1,400.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.460
Tell you what, I'll
have a grand for it.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.210
I think it'll sell really
quick because they're

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.290
talking about putting Harriet
Tubman on the $10 bill now.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.960
So there's some more
interest in this bill.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.250
Can you do $1,200, man?

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.120
I will go $1,100.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.290
I won't go a penny more.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.960
That's what I can do.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.170
I did find it in
the book, so I can't

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.080
really complain about that, so.
- All right, deal.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.420
Thank you guys, man.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.920
Come with me, and
we'll do some paperwork.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.960
Walked in the shop with
a book and a dollar bill,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.960
and now I'm leaving with
$1,100 in my pocket. his.
