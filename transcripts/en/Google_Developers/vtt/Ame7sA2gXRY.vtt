TODD SHAIMAN: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.820
Thanks for your patience.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.370
First of all, I'm Todd Shaiman.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.410
I am the Head of Content
Strategy for Google VR.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.780
It's so amazing to see
so many people here,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.050
and I'm so excited
for all the interest,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.660
and I choose to believe
that this is just

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.410
a sign of great,
great things to come.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.420
I am going to
talk-- I was trying

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.790
to think about what would be
an interesting topic as it

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.880
pertains to Jump.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.271
First of all, who
knows what Jump is?

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:37.770
OK.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.060
Cool.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.750
Well, I'll start to
explain it for those

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.320
whose hands didn't go up.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.730
But I-- oh, whoa.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.132
Why is this taking
off without me?

00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:48.590
AUDIENCE: It's jumping.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.715
TODD SHAIMAN: It's jumping.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.870
All right.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.360
I guess I'm-- All right.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.860
All right.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.400
There we go.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.250
All right.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.440
So what I thought I would
do is talk about a project

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.320
that one of my colleagues,
Jessica Brillhart,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.170
did that was to create some
original content when we

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.680
announced Jump back in
May at Google I/O. Jessica

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.640
is a terrific filmmaker, and
when we originally put Jump

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.240
together, she took the
camera around the world

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.330
and filmed something that
we could demonstrate at I/O.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.990
So a lot-- these insights
that I'm gonna talk about are

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.620
Jessica's-- I'm
merely the messenger.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.440
But I think they're
really interesting,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.580
and I think that
hopefully they'll

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.280
create some good fodder
for conversation.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.020
So what is Jump?

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.570
We announced it
at I/O this year,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.300
and it's basically three things.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.810
It's a 360 stereo
capture rig that

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.590
has 16 cameras in a circle.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.350
We're working on
that with GoPro.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.680
And the second thing
is the assembler.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.830
And this is part of the
magic of this pipeline.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.980
It basically takes
computer vision,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.060
lots of Google computers, and
stitches the footage seamlessly

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.260
together in an
insanely fast way.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.220
And it takes a
significant pain point out

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.570
of the process of
having to manually

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:40.140
massage all of these different
cameras into a seamless image.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.620
And then the third thing,
which we've heard a bunch

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.610
about already, is YouTube.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.420
And basically, we
want anyone, anywhere,

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.460
to be able to experience all
of these amazing stereo 360

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.430
experiences.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.510
And there's no better platform
than that in the world,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.620
we believe, than YouTube.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.120
So when we step back--
and when Jessica went out

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.890
to make this first
piece of content

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.870
using the prototype Jump rig--
the state of editorial in VR,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.770
she describes as
something like this.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.840
It's really all over the place.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.430
And this talk is really
designed to kind of highlight

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.865
some of the things that we've
learned through this experience

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:30.770
and some other ones.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:39.750
And the first thing that we
did is came up with a name.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.350
Probabilistic
Experiential Editing.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.065
We know that the
acronym needs some work.

00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:48.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.290
But we think that
it actually touches

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.630
on a lot of how you might
think about editing in 360.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.310
So let's break it down.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.110
First, probabilistic.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.480
How likely a viewer is to see
something, and to do something.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.860
So this is basically, like, how
likely is a person experiencing

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.130
this particular scene likely
to look in a particular way,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.029
or act a particular way?

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.420
And the reality is you
don't totally know.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.740
But what you do know is there
are various points of interest

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.910
around, and you can use
that as a way to bet

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.100
on where someone is looking.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.070
You don't know for
sure, but you can guess.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.650
So here's an example.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.780
This is a bunch of rocks.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.870
When Jessica went
around the world,

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.415
she went to amazing places.

00:04:45.415 --> 00:04:50.020
This was not a bad gig--
to Iceland, Japan, Puerto

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.180
Rico-- a lot of places
to film with the rig.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.410
So this was one of those places.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.660
Is there anywhere that you
might probabilistically bet

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.260
that someone might be looking?

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.910
Not necessarily.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.167
There are a few of these
things-- little peaks--

00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:06.250
but you don't really know.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.320
However, here--
this scene has what

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.030
you could consider a definitive
point of interest, right?

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.100
The climber.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.710
And in addition to the
visual point of interest,

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.200
the sound emanating
from the environment

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.950
is coming from him
too, which you probably

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.290
won't be able to
hear, but trust me.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.030
So you can't be assured that
someone's going to look there,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.420
but you can have a
reasonable guess.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.030
So here's another
one, where here, there

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.650
are four points of interest
that are all the windows.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.350
And you'd expect someone to
be looking through windows

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.910
like you would in real life.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.840
And then from an
audio perspective,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.600
the announcer is
speaking, so you

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.870
can see her speaking
in this scene,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.476
and hear the output
from that speaker.

00:06:00.476 --> 00:06:01.476
that's circled up there.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.360
So back to the mountain climber.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.470
It's very likely that someone's
looking at this climber,

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.300
although you can't count on it.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.930
But you can use that
to your advantage,

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.820
and you can cut from
him to something else

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.320
that you want the
viewer to witness.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.050
And so this can be
called-- it's a match cut,

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.510
but instead of a visual match,
it's an attention match.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.410
That's the way you
might think about it.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.140
So you can cut
from here to here.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:41.090
OK.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.020
And there are a lot of
examples in this, right?

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.520
All right.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.200
Next word.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.710
Experiential.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.610
So this is the notion of the
interaction between the viewer

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.370
and the scene.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.400
And really what
this means is there

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.605
are contexts for
different environments

00:06:56.605 --> 00:07:01.404
that you can kind of anticipate
how someone might experience it

00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:02.820
just like they
would in the world.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.410
So it's determined by the
viewer and by our experiences.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.660
So how long do
you expect someone

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.160
to want to stay in
a certain place?

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.195
Or how long will certain things
hold someone's attention,

00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:19.290
and why?

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.300
And these are, again,
not determinant,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.690
but there are things
you can play with.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.900
So here, back to the tram.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.210
So you know where someone
most likely look, but why?

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:34.950
And how?

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.240
And probably they're
going to be doing

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.760
the same thing that
they'd be doing while

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.760
in a tram in real life.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.226
Not looking at a
window, but looking out

00:07:44.226 --> 00:07:47.140
of a window, which
means you can motivate

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.410
a cut by reciprocating, or
extending, that experience.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.740
So here's an example of that.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.090
So if you're looking
through that window,

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.799
you are rewarded
by, well, I guess,

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:05.340
either that window
or these windows--

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.400
so if you're looking
through the deep window,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.017
you're rewarded by
the corridor there.

00:08:11.017 --> 00:08:12.850
And if you're looking
out the other windows,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:17.650
you're rewarded by a
horse looking back at you.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.680
So, again, none of this
is 100% determined,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.784
but you can really use
this, and play with it,

00:08:22.784 --> 00:08:24.700
and really be kind of
experimental and playful

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.200
with it.

00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:29.486
All right.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.090
Bear with me as I'm flipping
between these computers.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.539
So sometimes the
kind of environment

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:42.880
can inform the interaction
just as much as

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.169
what the viewer brings to it.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:47.710
So here's an example of that.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.235
This is back to the rocks.

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:51.110
So these rocks are
actually pretty important.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.410
And when Jessica
initially cut this,

00:08:54.410 --> 00:09:00.290
she used the rocks as an on
ramp for a new experience.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.260
It's relatively
calm, and the viewer

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.580
can get a sense of the
rules of the experience

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.730
without being thrust
into things too quickly,

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.815
before moving into
the next shot.

00:09:10.815 --> 00:09:14.530
And so once you establish
that comfort level,

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.380
you can play with
it, and then you

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:25.380
can jump into a new shot
that has more to it.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.830
And, in this case,
what the next shot had

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.500
was an audio base that
was on a different side,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.310
and caused the viewer
to turn and take

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.700
advantage of the 360ness
of this whole thing.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.740
All right.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.650
Editing.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.770
So how is traditional
editing done?

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.037
Clip to clip, kind of
in a linear way, right?

00:09:51.037 --> 00:09:53.370
There's one scene, and another
scene, and another scene.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.150
And so how do you think
about it in 360 space?

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.350
Well, one way just visually
to think about it is not that,

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.720
but from the center and out.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.296
And so what does that mean, and
what are implications of that?

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:09.086
I mean, one general
implication--

00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:10.460
which a lot of
people talk about,

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.520
but it's true-- is you
think more about crafting VR

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.130
like a game than a film.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:21.450
It's more like MYST than it
would be like "The Godfather."

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.124
And there a lot of other
things there, too, but I'm

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.290
going to skip ahead to this.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.820
So this is sort of the notion
of playfulness with this stuff.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.780
And this is all-- and I'd love
to hear if others have thoughts

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.890
and experiences around
what has worked what

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.010
hasn't-- but the notion of
rebelliousness and playfulness

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.350
around what the expectation
is in cutting to something,

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.000
or cutting around
to something else,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.375
and when those
transitions should happen.

00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:48.250
And have fun with it.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.200
So here's an example of that.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.170
So this was a ferry ride
that was in the world tour.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.840
And if you're looking where
the kind of expected place

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.582
was to look, you're looking
out forward on the ferry.

00:11:00.582 --> 00:11:02.290
But then if you turn
around, you actually

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.590
see Jessica, the filmmaker,
in the background.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.360
And she put herself
in there intentionally

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.140
in sort of a reward to
look around like that.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.670
And there's a lot
of ways you can

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.290
surprise your viewers that way.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:21.990
Here's another one
where-- as opposed

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.880
to a smooth transition,
when the ferry ride ends,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.230
you jump an entirely new, quiet
scenario where a guy's working

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.560
on a motorcycle.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.450
And play with your
audience that way,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.464
and see what the
impact of that is.

00:11:37.464 --> 00:11:38.630
So it's all about discovery.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.510
You can plant things in
a scene in such a way

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.970
that the viewer discovers them,
and discovers new elements.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:55.270
And you keep them surprised
and inline, but also guessing.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.300
So and if you get--
I think it is,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.500
it's kind of like a dance--
dance with the viewer.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.370
And if you think about
the discovery environment,

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.660
you really start to
make some amazing stuff.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.480
And this obviously varies
by the type of content

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.540
that you're creating.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.230
In this case, this is disparate
pieces, and how you weave them

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.548
together, but I think it has
implications more broadly,

00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:18.790
and it's pretty interesting.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.290
All right.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.750
So this is the creed--
the working creed.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.400
So that's the challenge
and the excitement of this,

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.160
and how it might be different
than what we see elsewhere.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.390
So in the near
future, the squiggle

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.630
becomes something more uniform.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:48.130
That's it.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:49.318
Thank you.

00:12:49.318 --> 00:12:51.230
