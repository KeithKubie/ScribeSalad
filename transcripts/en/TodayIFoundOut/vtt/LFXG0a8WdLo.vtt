00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.350
Who is Little Debbie?

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.350
The simple answer is that she’s the straw-hat-wearing,
blue-eyed little girl on the front of the

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.350
box of delicious confectioneries like Oatmeal
Creme Pies, Honey Buns and whatever Star Crunches

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.350
are.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.350
However, that’s not all she is.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.350
“Little Debbie” is also the Executive
Vice President of McKee Foods, the eight-decade-old

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.350
still family run company that makes all of
these treats – plus Zebra Cakes and Cosmic

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.350
Brownies.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.350
Her real name is actually Debbie McKee-Fowler
and here’s how she became the face – and

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.350
Executive Vice President – of the company
that makes Swiss Rolls.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.350
It was 1933 and the country was in the throes
of the Great Depression.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.350
Nearly a quarter of the nation was unemployed
and bread lines went blocks; in short, many

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.900
were desperate, including O.D. and Ruth McKee
who had lost most of their money due to a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.930
bank failure.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.170
What the couple did still have, however, was
a 1928 Whippet car.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.619
According to McKee Foods’ official history,
this was when O.D. started selling five-cent

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.910
Virginia Dare Cakes made by Becker’s Bakery
out of the back of said vehicle.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.530
By the next year, business was good enough
that they were able to purchase a Chattanooga,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.589
Tennessee bakery, Jack’s Cookie Company.

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.789
In what was a unique arrangement for the time,
Ruth became a full managing partner in the

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.460
business with her husband.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.460
While O.D. traveled the state making sales
and coming up with some innovative ways to

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.460
produce new product, she baked, managed the
office and took charge of the few employees

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.460
they had.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.479
They were, as the company’s official history
put it, “ideal business partners because

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:04.840
her cautious, conservative nature was the
perfect complement to his risk-taking, adventuresome

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.840
spirit.”

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.039
Years later, Jack McKee would explain that
his parents had “a unique opportunity during

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.090
the Great Depression and they took a risk.”

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.140
A few months later, the bet seemed to be paying
off with the bakery moving to a larger location

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.320
down the street.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.430
But all wasn’t perfect.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.120
In 1934, they took on Ruth’s father, Symon
King, as a partner.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.979
It’s not clear why they did this, perhaps
they needed an infusion of capital or maybe

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.880
they trusted King’s business instincts.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.940
Either way, it doesn’t appear to have been
a match made in cake heaven.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.650
In 1936, over a business disagreement, the
company split with the couple selling their

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.500
share and moving to Charlotte, North Carolina
to found a new bakery, while King took over

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.320
the Tennessee shop, which he renamed King’s
Bakery.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.390
McKee’s official history leaves a giant
gap between 1936 and 1952.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.079
However, it seems each bakery operated with
moderate success, though with little known

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.740
about them other than that it was during this
period that O.D. invented what is today the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.880
company’s oldest continuously sold product-
the oatmeal creme pie.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.330
By the mid-20th century, O.D. and his wife
decided to sell their bakery and reportedly

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.030
mulled over retiring, but at the request of
Ruth’s brother, Cecil, who at this point

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.400
was running King’s Bakery, returned to help
out managing it.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.360
Rather than run someone else’s company for
them, not long after, O.D. and Ruth decided

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.040
to buy the bakery back and rename it McKee
Baking Company.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.760
The company quickly flourished under their
management, which included the then innovative

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.030
idea to sell their product in “family packs”-
individually wrapped baked goods sold as a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.030
package deal.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.140
Specifically, in the late 1950s, McKee Foods
began producing “family packs” of 12 individually

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.640
wrapped cakes in one unit.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.650
Thanks to essentially selling them in bulk
to customers, it allowed the company to drop

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.700
the price per unit slightly, while enjoying
a significant boost in product sales at the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.700
same time.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.290
According to Jack McKee (one of the couple’s
sons), most other snack companies didn’t

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.430
begin packaging items this way for another
decade or two.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.810
This all brings us to how a straw hat clad
smiling girl named Debbie ended up on the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.570
front of the boxes of mini treats.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.780
There are slightly conflicting stories on
how O.D. came up with the idea to use “Little

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.390
Debbie,” but the general tale goes that
a packaging salesman, Bob Mosher, told O.D.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.590
that the McKee name was boring and that he
needed something better to juice sales.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.750
Casting about, O.D. supposedly noticed a picture
of his granddaughter, Debbie (daughter of

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.090
his son Ellsworth and daughter-in-law Sharon
McKee), on his desk and a light bulb went

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.130
off in his head.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.930
Still wanting to use a family name, O.D. decided
on naming the company’s new line after Debbie

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.940
and to use the picture on his desk of her
in a straw hat as a logo.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.070
Whether that’s exactly how he came up with
the idea or not, we do know definitively that

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.540
he had said picture in his office and that,
after inspiration struck, he didn’t tell

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.370
Debbie’s parents before going through with
final printing.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.290
Not long after, famed pin-up artist Pearl
Frush Mann used that picture off of O.D.’s

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.280
desk to create a colored rendition of the
little girl that still graces boxes to this

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.280
day.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.910
McKee Foods is still family-owned by second
and third generation McKees.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.580
As for “Little Debbie,” Debbie McKee-Fowler,
she’s now all grown up and is the current

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.630
Executive Vice President of the company and
runs the “Little Debbie” brand.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.840
While other snack cake companies may be struggling,
McKee Foods keeps thriving.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.810
In 2015, they announced an over hundred million
dollars investment in their Collegedale factory.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.470
In addition, they recently acquired Drake’s
cakes – who make Devil Dogs and Yodels – for

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:37.069
$27.5 million from bankrupt Hostess.
