00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.950
As we mentioned previously, in journal, the editors may lie in the knowledge,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.890
in the reasoning, or the architecture of a nation. And therefore, learning and

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.030
correcting errors might be applicable to any one of those.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.690
However, in this lesson, we will be focusing only on errors and

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.660
knowledge. In fact, in particular, we'll be focusing on errors and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.500
classification knowledge. Classification, of course,

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.590
is a topic that we have considered this class repeatedly. Let us

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.870
consider an air agent that has two examples of executing an action in the world.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.620
In the first experience, the agent will use this object as a cup and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.470
gets the feedback, this indeed was a cup. So this was a positive experience.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.080
This, on the other hand, is a negative example. Here, the agent viewed this as

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.070
a cup and got the feedback that this should not have been viewed as a cup.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.870
We can visualize the problem of identifying what knowledge element led the agent

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.470
to incorrectly classify this as a cup. As follows. This left circle here consist

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.350
of all features that describe the positive example. The circle on the right

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.910
consist of all features that describe the negative example. So features in this

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.640
left circle might be things like this is a handle, there is a question mark,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.450
there is a blue interior and so on. The circle on the right consist of features.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.210
That characterize a negative example. It has a movable handle.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.060
It has a red interior. It has red and white markings on the outside.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.940
There's some features that characterize only the positive experience and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.370
not the negative experience. There are those that characterize only,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.750
the negative experience, and not the positive experience.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.990
There are also many features that characterize both the positive and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.840
the negative example. For example they are both concave, they both have handles,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.490
and so on. In this example, it is these features that are specially important.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.670
We'll call them fault suspicious features. We call them fault suspicious

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.990
features because first they identify only the negative experience. Secondly,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.990
one or more of these features may be responsible for the fact that the agent

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.340
classified this as a positive example when in fact it was a negative example.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.550
As an example suppose that this features corresponds to a movable handle. This

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.900
is a false suspicious feature. It is false because this experience was false.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.170
It is suspicious because it does not characterize the positive experience.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.940
And thus it may be one of the features responsible for the fact that this was

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.104
a negative example. But now there's an additional problem. There are number

00:02:40.104 --> 00:02:44.122
of false suspicious features here. So how will the agent decide which false

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:49.370
suspicious feature to focus on? We've encountered this problem earlier,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.690
when we were talking about incremental costs of learning. At that point we had

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.960
said that we wanted to give examples in an order, such that each succeeding

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.540
example referred to the current constant definition, and exactly one feature.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.340
So that the agent knows exactly what the focus that feature is on.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.660
The same kind of problem occurs again how might the agent know which feature to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.780
focus on. One possible idea is that it could try on of the feature at a time and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.570
see if it will work. That is it could select this feature to repeat the process

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.291
get more feedback and either is accepted or eliminated. An alternate method is

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:29.880
that the agent perceived not just two experiences. But many such experiences. So

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.050
there were other positive experiences that covered this part of the circle.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.480
That would leave only this as a false suspicious feature, and then the agent can

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.680
focus attention on this feature. As an example, just like this circle may

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.290
correspond to a movable handle, this may correspond to red interior. Because red

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.070
interior is one of the features that characterizes a negative example and

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.540
not a positive example. But later on, there might be another positive example

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.070
that comes of a cup, which had a red interior in which case agent can

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.050
exclude this particular feature. The reverse of this situation is also possible.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.020
Let us suppose that the agent decides that this is not a cup,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.720
perhaps because its definition says that something with a blue interior is

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.200
not a cup. And therefore, it doesn't bring water to you inside this cup and

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.029
tells you there is no cup available in the kitchen. You go to the kitchen.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:26.010
You see it and you say, well, this is the cup. Now, the agent must learn

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.860
why did they decide that it was not a cup. In this case, the relevant features

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.880
are these three features. These are the three features that define this cup, but

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.740
do not define the other experiences. So this dot may correspond to a blue

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.810
interior, this dot may correspond to a question mark on the exterior, we'll call

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.800
this feature true suspicious, just like we call them false suspicious.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.700
These are the features that prevented the agent from deciding that this was

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.790
a positive example of a cup. One or more of these features may be

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.650
responsible for the agent's failure to recognize that this was a cup
