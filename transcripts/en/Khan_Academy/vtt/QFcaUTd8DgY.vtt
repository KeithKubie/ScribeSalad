00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:02.501
- [Voiceover] Hello
grammarians, and hello Paige.

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:03.334
- [Voiceover] Hi David.

00:00:03.334 --> 00:00:04.714
- [Voiceover] So today we're
going to be talking about

00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:09.628
the appositive, which is
just a monster of a word.

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:13.111
I can tell you that from
my limited study of Latin

00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:17.111
it comes from ad positio,
which is "putting on",

00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:23.212
which doesn't really necessarily help.

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:25.467
What is this thing?

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.155
What is this device, how do we use it,

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:30.080
and what does it have to do with commas?

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.238
- [Voiceover] That is a great question.

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:35.261
The definition itself is
also kind of confusing,

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:37.799
but it'll make a lot of sense
when we see some examples.

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.966
My older sister, Griselda, is
going to college in the fall.

00:00:44.353 --> 00:00:47.884
- [Voiceover] Okay, so, an appositive,

00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:50.730
what is the definition
of an appositive then?

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.844
- [Voiceover] So it is a
noun phrase that clarifies

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:58.010
or redefines its antecedent.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.568
- [Voiceover] And an antecedent
is just something that comes

00:01:00.568 --> 00:01:04.671
before, so what we're doing
here with Griselda is,

00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:08.838
we are redefining or clarifying
who my older sister is,

00:01:09.877 --> 00:01:11.203
so in order to do that,
we're putting it between

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:15.491
these commas like so, and
we're just saying it again.

00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:18.576
My older sister, Griselda, is
going to college in the fall.

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:19.767
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:21.929
- [Voiceover] But it
doesn't always have to be

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.878
in the middle like this, right.

00:01:23.878 --> 00:01:26.862
- [Voiceover] That's true,
it can be say, at the end.

00:01:26.862 --> 00:01:31.407
So, they stopped selling my
favorite snack, the Cookie Cat.

00:01:31.407 --> 00:01:32.291
- [Voiceover] I am so sorry.

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:35.124
- [Voiceover] I know. It's so sad.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.286
- [Voiceover] So we've got
this apposition then at the end

00:01:39.286 --> 00:01:43.392
of the sentence, so my favorite
snack is being redefined

00:01:43.392 --> 00:01:45.642
or clarified by Cookie Cat.

00:01:47.253 --> 00:01:49.043
Or rather, Cookie Cat is clarifying

00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:51.704
or redefining my favorite snack.

00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:52.537
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:01:52.537 --> 00:01:54.709
I could just say, "They stopped
selling my favorite snack."

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.706
- [Voiceover] That could just
be its own sentence right.

00:01:56.706 --> 00:01:57.539
- [Voiceover] Totally.

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.419
- [Voiceover] They stopped
selling my favorite snack.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.270
My older sister is going
to college in the fall.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.925
This stuff isn't essential

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:04.630
to the understanding of the sentence.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.944
- [Voiceover] Right, but if you don't know

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:11.253
what my favorite snack
is, then it's helpful

00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:12.825
for me to say, the Cookie Cat.

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:15.020
- [Voiceover] So you can use
them as in the first sentence,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.966
my older sister comma Griselda
comma is going to college

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:20.594
in the fall, or you can use
it as in the second sentence,

00:02:20.594 --> 00:02:21.971
they stopped selling my favorite snack

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:24.556
comma the Cookie Cat period.

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:25.389
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.885
You don't need another comma.

00:02:26.885 --> 00:02:28.076
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:28.076 --> 00:02:29.040
- [Voiceover] At the end.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.247
- [Voiceover] Let's change
that back into a comma.

00:02:31.247 --> 00:02:32.493
- [Voiceover] So this is
just another illustration

00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:36.369
of the separating power of
the comma, cuz we're using it

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:40.562
to set off this explanatory,
clarifying element

00:02:40.562 --> 00:02:42.730
in the middle or at the
end of these sentences.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.743
- [Voiceover] Yeah, exactly,
that's what the comma does.

00:02:44.743 --> 00:02:47.023
Man, it seems like commas can do anything.

00:02:47.023 --> 00:02:48.548
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
it's pretty incredible.

00:02:48.548 --> 00:02:50.383
You know what else can do anything?

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:51.216
- [Voiceover] What?

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:52.257
- [Voiceover] The viewer, you the viewer,

00:02:52.257 --> 00:02:54.869
you can learn anything.

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:57.300
That's the appositive and
how it relates to commas.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.133
David out.

00:02:58.133 --> 00:02:59.463
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
