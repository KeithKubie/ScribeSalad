00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.039
So we've said a lot about light.

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:04.830
It turns out the light
is actually only one

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.360
of the waves in
the same spectrum.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.200
The electromagnetic spectrum.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.140
Well what else is
in that spectrum?

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.920
I have here my model
which shows us.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.329
Here we have light
in the centre.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.300
This is frequency
going along here.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.130
Number of oscillations
per second.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.540
As we go up in frequency,
we get ultraviolet.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.670
Well, that's what
makes us go brown

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.310
or in my case red in the sun.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.850
And if I go up further in
frequency, we see x-rays.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.250
Very high frequency,
very short pulses,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.160
can see things within the body.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.951
Still further we have
cosmic rays and gamma rays.

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:46.930
If I go down in frequency,
we have infrared--

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.740
which actually we know is heat--

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.500
and radio waves.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.260
So television waves.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.780
The waves from mobile phones.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.760
They're all part of
the same spectrum.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.370
They're all the same waves.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.810
They all travel
at the same speed.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.016
And that speed is
the speed of light.

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:04.099
That speed's very special.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.130
I'll tell you a bit
about that in a moment.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.760
But first of all, we're going
to have a go at measuring

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.570
the speed of light.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.140
And I need a
volunteer to help me.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.410
Could you come up please?

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.290
And your name is?

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.790
Helen.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.160
Helen.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.900
Could you come and
stand here, Helen,

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.501
while they bring on the speed
of light measuring equipment?

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.000
That's it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.083
Just stand out of the way.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.340
Helen, just come
around this side.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.440
Because, Helen, you're
going to be data collector.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.870
This is the data we need.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.892
We need the wavelength and
the frequency of the light

00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:45.850
because we need to multiply
these two together.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.426
Are you good at
multiplying, Helen?

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:48.180
Not too bad.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.850
Not too bad.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.480
OK.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.300
We always got the
calculator here.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.490
That will give the speed.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.240
OK?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.906
So let's start measuring
the wavelength.

00:01:57.906 --> 00:02:00.030
What do we need to measure
the wavelength of light?

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.490
A microwave and a
dish of marshmallows.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.200
And here they are
arranged in a line.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.180
And we're going to bung them
in the microwave and cook them.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.790
OK?

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.350
So let's just close the door.

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:21.000
Now, don't try this at home.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.050
Now what's going to happen
to these marshmallows?

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.910
Well they're going to
cook, but they're actually

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.180
not going to cook evenly.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.540
Microwave ovens, particularly if
you've turned off the rotating

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.800
table, don't cook evenly.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.780
And what happens is if you
remember back to the wave

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.000
machine when there
was a wall and we

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.180
sent a wave against the wall,
we set up a standing wave.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.190
A wave that didn't
move anywhere.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.290
It just stood still.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.950
Well that's our key for
measuring the wavelength.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.090
Because in the points
where the wave is actually

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.170
moving up and down a lot, it
has a lot of energy there.

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.000
And so there the marshmallows
should actually melt first.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.770
So let's have a look, Helen.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.780
Let's take out
these marshmallows.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.030
And yes.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.200
We have a look at them.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.260
You see some of them are
melted, others haven't.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.230
Then they've melted,
others haven't.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.630
There's actually a pattern.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.590
So just like on this card here.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.780
If we take this point
is the point where

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.210
the marshmallows have
melted and this point,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.292
it will actually give us a
measure of half the wavelength.

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:42.000
So let's do that.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.500
Helen.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.620
Let's close that door.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.660
Let's take out a tape measure.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.330
I'll have a ruler here.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.450
And Helen, if you'd just like
to help me measure the distance.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.520
We need the separation
of these two melted bits.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.440
About 6.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.720
About 6.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.260
OK.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.160
So that's half of
the wavelength.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.740
So 6 centimetres.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.580
So Helen, if you
could write down here

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.689
12 centimetres as
the wavelength.

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:18.230
That's right.

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.500
Just write centimetres here.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.000
That's great.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.290
Now we need the frequency.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.520
Frequency is on the back.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.790
Come around and
have a look with me.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.050
Come and have a look here.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.510
It says 2450 megahertz.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.290
Now megahertz is
a million hertz.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.430
A million oscillations
per second.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.547
So let's write down 2450.

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:42.130
Now we need to put
a million after it.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.050
So it's six zeros.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.540
That's great.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.780
Now we need to just multiply
these things together.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.280
Except we should
really convert this

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.060
into metres because this is
oscillations per second times--

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.490
we'd like it to be metres.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.729
So let's turn 12 centimetres
into 0.12 metres.

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.020
And we're going to multiply
these two numbers together.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.290
Well, let's put an
equal sign here.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.232
And write down here 6 zeros.

00:05:14.232 --> 00:05:15.440
So we take care of the zeros.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:34.650
And now I want you, Helen,
to multiply 0.12 by 2450.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.114
That gives 294.

00:05:39.114 --> 00:05:41.280
So let's put in some commas
here because I can never

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.904
rate these things
with all those zeros.

00:05:42.904 --> 00:05:44.070
There we go.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:51.270
So what we've got is 294
million metres per second.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.620
And here we have the
number that physicists

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.010
use for the speed of light.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.497
And it is 300 million
metres per second.

00:06:02.497 --> 00:06:04.080
So you've measured
the speed of light.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.350
Thank you very much, Helen.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.700
[APPLAUSE]
