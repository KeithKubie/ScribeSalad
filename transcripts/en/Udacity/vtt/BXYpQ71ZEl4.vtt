The computer renders a 3D scene by determining how much light comes from each

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.548
direction. There are a few elements that go into this calculation. First, we

00:00:08.548 --> 00:00:12.536
have to define a world. For example, take this scene. Here, there are many

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:17.154
different objects defined in different ways. Each object is described by some 3D

00:00:17.154 --> 00:00:21.324
geometry. It also has some material description that says how light interacts

00:00:21.324 --> 00:00:25.655
with it. Objects can also be animated over time. The red cube is obviously

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:29.815
spinning and if you take a closer look at the metallics sitting man on the left

00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:33.428
you'll notice he moves. There are also lights in this world which in this case

00:00:33.428 --> 00:00:36.702
are not animated. As the view changes, some materials look different as the

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:39.925
light reflects off of them at a different angle while others don't change.

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:44.488
Finally, a camera is also defined for the scene and interactively changes under

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:48.757
the user's control. To sum up, a scene consists of objects, which are typically

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:53.493
described by geometry and material. Along with lights and a camera.
