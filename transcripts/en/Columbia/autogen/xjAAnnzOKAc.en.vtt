capital gets allocated not just in this

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200
capital gets allocated not just in this
 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.060

country but around the world

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070
country but around the world
 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.190
country but around the world
increasingly and if you think about the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200
increasingly and if you think about the
 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.990
increasingly and if you think about the
u.s. in particular you know capital

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000
u.s. in particular you know capital
 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.900

the banking system we have probably the

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470
the banking system we have probably the
 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.640
the banking system we have probably the
best mix of any economy in the world and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650
best mix of any economy in the world and
 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.360
best mix of any economy in the world and
I think it's actually been a really

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370
I think it's actually been a really
 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.330
I think it's actually been a really
important element to you know the

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340
important element to you know the
 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.520
important element to you know the
sustained growth of us over the last

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530
sustained growth of us over the last
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.380
sustained growth of us over the last
hundred years and so I think getting

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390
hundred years and so I think getting
 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.870
hundred years and so I think getting
this right if you will is is really

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880
this right if you will is is really
 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.270
this right if you will is is really
really important so just a couple of

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
really important so just a couple of
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.420
really important so just a couple of
words of background as bill said we at

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430
words of background as bill said we at
 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.980
words of background as bill said we at
vanguard managed a little over three

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990
vanguard managed a little over three
 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.480
vanguard managed a little over three
trillion dollars which makes us the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490
trillion dollars which makes us the
 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.010
trillion dollars which makes us the
largest mutual fund company in the world

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020
largest mutual fund company in the world
 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.220
largest mutual fund company in the world
and if you think about the mix if you

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230
and if you think about the mix if you
 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.140
and if you think about the mix if you
will roughly two trillion dollars in

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150
will roughly two trillion dollars in
 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.140
will roughly two trillion dollars in
equities of that about 1.7 is managed in

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150

billion in active so we do both active

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580
billion in active so we do both active
 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.780
billion in active so we do both active
and indexed and I think the most

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790
and indexed and I think the most
 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.400
and indexed and I think the most
important point though rather than the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410
important point though rather than the
 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.560
important point though rather than the
asset size there are really two

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570
asset size there are really two
 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.370
asset size there are really two
important points 1 it's who these assets

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380
important points 1 it's who these assets
 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.070

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.029
independent so again you can quantity
you can quantify that so that's the

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039
you can quantify that so that's the
 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.010
you can quantify that so that's the
quantifiable aspects you know on the

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020
quantifiable aspects you know on the

you know I I think if you're an investor

00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919
you know I I think if you're an investor
 

00:22:14.919 --> 00:22:17.590
you know I I think if you're an investor
you you actually have a responsibility

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600
you you actually have a responsibility
 

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.330
you you actually have a responsibility
in this regard I think it's actually

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:19.340
in this regard I think it's actually
 

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.669
in this regard I think it's actually
part of the investment equation and so I

00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679
part of the investment equation and so I
 

00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:24.250
part of the investment equation and so I
think when it comes to outsourcing that

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:24.260

you got to do so very carefully and you

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919
you got to do so very carefully and you
 

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:30.460
you got to do so very carefully and you
know I would you know we've taken the

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:30.470
know I would you know we've taken the
 

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:31.779
know I would you know we've taken the
other side of a number of issues with

00:22:31.779 --> 00:22:31.789

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:41.529
and I don't think that's necessarily
pertinent but i do think if you're if

00:22:41.529 --> 00:22:41.539
pertinent but i do think if you're if
 

00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:43.899
pertinent but i do think if you're if
you're if you're an investor you

00:22:43.899 --> 00:22:43.909
you're if you're an investor you
 

00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:45.310
you're if you're an investor you
actually from you you have a

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320
actually from you you have a
 

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.909
actually from you you have a
