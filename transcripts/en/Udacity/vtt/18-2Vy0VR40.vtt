00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.940
So, my name is Ryan, I'm, live in Palo

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.580
Alto, but I'm from Maryland and I am lactose intolerant.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.020
&gt;&gt; For everybody out there, who doesn't know what lactose

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.115
intolerance is, tell us briefly what being lactose intolerant means.

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:15.260
&gt;&gt; in briefly, it means I can't have

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.485
milk or other dairy products without experiencing some discomfort.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:19.667
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.960
&gt;&gt; I see. Discomfort and can you elaborate a little bit on discomfort?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.730
&gt;&gt; Sure. discomfort typically means it's digestive discomfort.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.910
So it's gas, bloating, diarrhea, that sort of thing.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.556
&gt;&gt; is anyone else in your family lactose intolerant?

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:35.476
&gt;&gt; Yes, my younger sister is, but I have

00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:37.690
a brother who is not and my parents are not.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.408
&gt;&gt; Okay so do you, do you have any experience with this being a genetic trait?

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:48.685
Like do, does this run in your family, being lactose intolerant?

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:51.335
&gt;&gt; I actually don't know because most of my family lives in the

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:53.404
Philippines and they don't drink cow milk.

00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:55.308
They have, they drink powdered milk and

00:00:55.308 --> 00:00:59.061
all this and not dairy products. Because it's not as popular there, so it

00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:01.135
wasn't until I discovered I was lactose

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:03.532
intolerant that I learned anything about it.

00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:05.960
&gt;&gt; And when did you discover that you were lactose intolerant?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.290
&gt;&gt; I would say that would be about two or three years ago. So.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.340
&gt;&gt; Really? That

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.210
late in life, huh?

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.850
&gt;&gt; Yes. But then when I found I was lactose

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.240
intolerant, it kind of explained some things from when I was

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.800
younger. because there were times like, when I would have

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.250
dairy products and I'd be fine, but then there were times

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100
if I had too much, I'd felt, I felt a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.440
little gassy. But when I discovered I was lactose intolerant, it

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.256
kind of made sense that if I was young and overloaded

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:33.760
on it, it made sense that, that I would feel discomfort.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.410
&gt;&gt; I see so when you were young though, you felt like you

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.420
could have normal amounts and you were okay.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.430
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Right. It wasn't until graduate school. Until, yeah

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.440
about two years ago, that I discovered that I was

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.750
lactose intolerant. And I think it's because that's when it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.360
kind of just, when it really just kind of shut off.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.400
&gt;&gt; Right, right. How did that make you

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.480
feel to sort of discover this about yourself?

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.980
&gt;&gt; Well, I guess that it kind of made

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.510
sense to me because I, it explained a lot

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.550
of things about why I'd randomly feel sick some

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.700
days. And why I wouldn't other days, just depending

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.030
on my breakfast. But, it was kind of annoying to find out

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.690
mostly, because I knew I'd have to either change my diet or.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.910
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.990
&gt;&gt; Other things also

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.370
&gt;&gt; So, what are the kinds of food you actually

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.465
have to avoid if you are a lactose intolerant person?

00:02:15.465 --> 00:02:17.570
&gt;&gt; if you are lactose intolerant and you're not

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.310
taking any type of supplement. Then you basically have

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.880
to avoid anything that has appreciable amount of dairy

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.749
products in it. So, obviously I'm not going to to be

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.519
drinking a lot of straight milk, ice cream, pizzas with a lot of cheese on it.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.790
taco, taco, American-style tacos, oreos, all those things, cake, cheesecake.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.560
&gt;&gt; so what you're saying is that there's a lot of food restrictions?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.684
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is there's a lot, a huge part of the diet that is, has diary

00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:52.059
products in it. And so discovering lactose intolerant kind of, makes it more

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.160
difficult to get that so.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.136
&gt;&gt; So do you find yourself in situations, I

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:58.268
guess social situations where you see a food come

00:02:58.268 --> 00:03:00.140
out and you're like oh gosh, I really want

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.100
that. And you're like oh gosh I can't eat it

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.790
&gt;&gt; Yes. especially I do, I do try to carry around lactase

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.840
pills lactase enzyme pills, but if I don't have them then yes.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.790
If someone's like. Let's go out for ice cream. I go, oh,

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.250
I guess I can't. Or you know. Or if there's pizza. Especially if

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.710
people you know, at the last minute want to get

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.100
pizza or certain, go out for dinner and we haven't

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.510
decided. If they suggest pizza, I got, I have

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.590
to go, oh, I don't, I can't really eat that.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.705
&gt;&gt; Are people receptive to this when you tell them, like

00:03:28.705 --> 00:03:30.806
if you tell a group of friends or even new people. Like

00:03:30.806 --> 00:03:33.214
hey, I'm lactose intolerant, you know, can, you know, can we

00:03:33.214 --> 00:03:36.180
do something else, can we get something else? Are people normally receptive?

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.750
&gt;&gt; Yes. especially in California actually, because in California

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.680
a lot of people are, know people with various

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.729
dietary restrictions or go on different diets and so. It's definitely, it hasn't

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.860
really effected my social life. It just means that we do something else.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.850
&gt;&gt; You mentioned lactase pills. What exactly is a lactase

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.310
pill? Where do you get it? How much does it cost?

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.180
&gt;&gt; A lactase pill is just a little pill about a little less than an inch big,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.706
by a quarter inch, that is just a number of units of lactase enzyme. So lactose

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:11.482
intolerant means my body doesn't produce lactose any more, which is

00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:14.938
the enzyme that breaks down the lactose sugar into two different

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:17.714
sugars. So this pill I eat it, I always buy the

00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:20.406
fast act pill, so I can just eat it with my first

00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:23.501
bite of food and it kind of dissolves. And has to break

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:26.191
down all the sugars in my stomach. And so I take

00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:29.115
that with my first bit of dairy and then I'm usually

00:04:29.115 --> 00:04:32.750
good for about 45 minutes before I have to take another one.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.310
&gt;&gt; Well how much do they cost?

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.466
&gt;&gt; I would say it's about $0.10 a pill. So

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:42.060
120 would be about $12 to $13 at Safeway, for example.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.970
&gt;&gt; is this a trait you would ever want to change about yourself at all?

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.549
&gt;&gt; Definitely. I just feel I mean, being lactose intolerant just means,

00:04:49.549 --> 00:04:52.410
I can live my same life and eat the same amount of. Eat

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.600
the same foods and do the same things I want to. But I

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.872
just have to spend more money to do it, because I buy the

00:04:57.872 --> 00:04:59.490
lactase, lactose free milk and I buy

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.560
the lactase pills to supplement other meals.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.100
&gt;&gt; Have you ever gotten your own personal

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.400
genetic information done from a company like 23andMe?

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.520
&gt;&gt; Yes I have.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.660
&gt;&gt; And did, what did that tell you about

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.173
you being lactose intolerant? Did it confirm this or?

00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:18.490
&gt;&gt; it confirmed I have the geno-type that is likely lactose

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.810
intolerant. Because since lactose intolerant

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.850
can also depend on environmental factors,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.450
like your actual gut bacteria that breaks down the lactose.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.050
It means I have the tendency to be lactose intolerant, but

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.350
it doesn't mean I am. The only way you can confirm

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.690
that you are is to kind of know that you are.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.690
&gt;&gt; What would you say if you could give advice to

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.510
somebody who is, let's say we're talking to Ryan three years

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.900
ago before he found out he was lactose intolerant. And he,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.920
you know, just discovered that you're lactose intolerant, what advice would

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.910
you give that person?

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.780
&gt;&gt; I think the first advice would be to

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.040
test your limits on lactose tolerance. So I can have

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.380
a bite of ice cream, or one nacho with cheese,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.960
or, but then won't bother. So, like, knowing your limit

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.970
on what you can have without any kind of supplement

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.510
is useful. And also to just make the decision whether

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.240
you're going to change your diet or buy the pills,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.670
or some kind of combination of both. Just kind of,

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.910
figure it out. Or I'm looking to lactose free alternatives

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.380
to milk, or they even have lactose free ice cream now, but it's very expensive.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.560
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.610
&gt;&gt; So it's like Is it worth it to buy the ice cream? So you

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.300
don't have to take pills, or do you want to take pills every single time you

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.990
eat ice cream, sort of thing. It's kind of just, decide all the different ways

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.950
to manage your lactose intolerance and figure out which way is the best for you.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.085
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for coming in and chatting with us.

00:06:41.085 --> 00:06:43.794
&gt;&gt; Yeah thanks for talking with me, I don't get to talk about this that often.

00:06:43.794 --> 00:06:44.244
[LAUGH].
