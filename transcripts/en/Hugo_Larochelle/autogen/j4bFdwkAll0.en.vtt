00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 this capsule we will see an example of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.890
 the execution of alfa pruning algorithm 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.910
 beta so I hope with this example that 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.139
 it will become a little clearer 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.210
 commented what the algorithm runs 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.460
 and stone eagles this is an example that I 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.279
 encourage you to see her more than once 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.170
 if you wish to strengthen a little more 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.170
 your understanding of the algorithm 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:31.920
 so let's suppose we have a game that 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.760
 the search tree we see here so 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.239
 we have so much in who are each 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.610
 take a walk sorry who are each going 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.200
 do two rounds 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.680
 after which we will arrive at the end of 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.110
 the part 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.539
 what are we gonna do is we go 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.640
 simulate the execution of the sentry box 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.399
 pruning alfa beta to identify 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.500
 what are the paths of the tree that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.640
 are the two languages ​​that are going to be 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.989
 actually cut that will never 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.409
 explored by the rookie research 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.570
 thanks to the alfa beta pruning so we 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.479
 start with initialize note interval 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.880
 alfa-beta upstream and finishes over the infinite to 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.479
 the root and so called 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.460
 recurring yves the mines tour then the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.869
 volume access so on until that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.119
 we get to a final algorithm to 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:31.079
 this moment returns them the value of 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:33.990
 utility then visited the final in 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.600
 returning the utility of 6 the nominee 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.140
 just above updates its value of 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.299
 beta so we see that now the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.780
 new alfa beta has become less and 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.210
 finished at 6 and the worship value is 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.170
 currently considered 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.580
 flu has formed both at the level of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.800
 no one sees here so the value of 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.810
 the EU currently affected are 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.490
 to be that's the figure we're going to see the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.369
 day next to the triangles camps go 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.630
 do the simulation to those of that one 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.489
 look at the other we successor 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.890
 from our mine it's a final place 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.660
 again so we see this draw 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.390
 will return the utility of 11 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.610
 it does not change the utility value they 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.560
 have been returned by mine since we are 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.300
 bigger than six what makes that one 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.030
 urine that now has to explore everything 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.800
 it is a successor can return his 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.330
 utility its min max value to its parent 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.260
 his parent who is an imac what to him 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.900
 this moment then did an update of 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.820
 its interval alfa beta so less 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.800
 defined becomes 6 since if it's more 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.730
 great than me the infinite and the nude max 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.380
 exploit his second success that they 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.930
 also pass its alpha values 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.600
 beta which is 6 plus infinity so 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.130
 after updating his interval he 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:04.320
 has passed its alpha and beta value to 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.780
 his successor to this so our 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.280
 neck and a mine he also goes 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.420
 start exploring his successors 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.769
 so the expert his first one is then to 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:19.140
 a final draw that a utility of 4 so to 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.630
 we will go back to the parents 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.120
 a utility of 4 the utility that 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.880
 returned was then compared to the value 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.130
 of alpha in the interval fabre and a 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.500
 so the mines to find out if we stop 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.620
 exploration it makes a comparison 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.540
 with their alpha values ​​and we stop 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.579
 exploration if the utility that 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.420
 returned by a child by one of 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:46.410
 successors is smaller or equal to the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.170
 value of alpha so that's the insult of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.510
 successful little sand cover of alpha that's 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.980
 the case in this case four future 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.109
 stations at 6 which means we can 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.049
 stop exploring other successors 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.230
 at this draw so we can cut that 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.810
 participates in graffiti 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.520
 hasni too we will then go back on 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.180
 could go back 4 too that'll give 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.730
 the same thing 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.980
 so either return the alpha or return 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.599
 and utility in their codes we've seen 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.820
 in another capture we return the 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:19.430
 utility 4 so the num axis observes a 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.889
 utility of four wells which maximizes 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.210
 it does not change its utility value 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.240
 internal so its minimal value axis that goes 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.720
 to be returned and so he returns to his 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.760
 parent mines worth 6 mines sets to 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.840
 day for comparing shares alfa who 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.419
 is the one girl less the infinite 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.300
 so there is nothing smaller or 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:43.200
 equal to less finite so up to 6-6 and 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.090
 papeete at the gala - finish so we continue 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.419
 exploration and we update the value 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.850
 of beta so we have not updated 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:55.530
 the beta value of the internate the fab 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.630
 so is the upper bound at 6 on 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.669
 continue the exploration right on the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.270
 second our successors passing 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.520
 the interval alfa beta who think that 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.890
 if the interval favetta to the nominees 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.979
 maybe less finished at 6 so we go 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:16.530
 minus the finishes at 6 as an interval 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:19.110
 successor then of this one is teen so 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.570
 an imac what will consider the first 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.890
 action that brings him to a mini last year 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.530
 once again these values ​​of alfa 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:29.400
 beta we do that until we get 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.320
 return to 1 in the end this draw to you 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.440
 return an insult and 14 to his 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.020
 sponsor his parent to whom a mine mine 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.490
 because if we wait for a graph a 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.440
 only action that mines to exist 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.880
 executed so search in this 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:49.080
 part of the graffiti is finished so 14 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.970
 is going to be shot in imax by a now 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.970
 a max what it does not hurt is that 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.030
 it compared with its beta node utility 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:00.660
 returned by a successor and in this 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.910
 this case we have that utility return 14 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.700
 and greater or equal than the terminal 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.860
 higher than our interval alfa beta 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.409
 and that's the condition to stop 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.520
 the exploration of the clouds is unraveling 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.900
 successor 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.759
 a max but also and so we can cut 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.009
 the research does not explore the others 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:26.190
 we success in search is cut off 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:28.940
 the max will return its internal utility 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.190
 which is 14 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.409
 back on his parent even mine who 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:38.699
 minimize by observing 14 it does not change 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:43.319
 its internal value of utility which is so 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:47.099
 set at 6 is the only mine the supply is going 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.210
 return a utility of six now 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:52.409
 at the root 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:56.819
 at the very top first thing that a max 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:59.099
 does it is that it compares with its beta 

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:01.500
 is the utility received from a 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:04.050
 successor and greater rigor to his 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:07.080
 beta the beta and is becoming one ends up 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.270
 so if it's not bigger than the most 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.039
 great treat to + infinity and thereafter 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.639
 he updates his alfa by taking the 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:16.500
 maximum to return utility and the 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:17.819
 alpha so in this case also his 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.979
 sighers that less infinity 

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:21.979
 so we have a new al fath of a 6 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:27.360
 then from its contents the recursive pair 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.699
 but for the second child from a max to 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.569
 the root that passed alpha value 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:35.909
 and beta so we at alfa 2b todd 6 and over 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:39.479
 infinity at its second price our 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:41.909
 successors mines who will call him his 

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:43.680
 first our successors who is one of 

00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:46.560
 maxilly spend his values ​​alfa beta 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.310
 it's more the infinity we continue like that 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.139
 until we arrive at an endpoint 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:55.199
 the final name that happens to be here 

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:57.960
 with a utility of 3 so having a 

00:07:55.199 --> 00:08:03.090
 utility of you that will be returned to 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.830
 parents max the parent max in this case 

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:05.580
 also to identify who could continue 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.590
 his research 

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.360
 the first thing he did was that 

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:11.940
 compare it the utility that had been 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:16.860
 returned here that was 3 with his 

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:20.820
 beta which was more infinity so more 

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:22.949
 the infinite and not the three most epoch 

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.940
 bigger or equal to plus infinity so 

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:29.320
 we can continue his parents against 

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:32.560
 our interior alfa beta and norma same 

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.780
 update its alpha by comparing 

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.060
 with the utility turn three dances 

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:40.479
 that if the law is already bigger than 

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:43.810
 three so the lower bound and not 

00:08:40.479 --> 00:08:45.580
 change then rest 6 that's what got us 

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.080
 led to explore the second of the 

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.890
 successor that had a utility of 

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:53.260
 so that had gone back to the parents 

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:55.750
 and dance only if we have an update 

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.220
 of alpha since the utility it 

00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:00.580
 returns by the second successor 

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:04.300
 of a max at this level too and more 

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:12.690
 large or equal to the previous value of 

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:17.200
 alpha so the value a mini max honor 

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:22.360
 to this one is from 7 to 6 who returned 

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.640
 au par amine and in this case our 

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.680
 nomine life what makes it 

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:29.610
 first he compares the value 

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:32.890
 of utility that returns and 7 with its 

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:37.270
 alpha the min for comparison purposes with 

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:39.520
 the alpha and in this case also we have that 

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:42.130
 there will return to contradict 

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.840
 with our interior alfa beta 7 is beautiful 

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:46.920
 and well in the meantime if that anymore the 

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:49.150
 girls much more serious and she 

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.080
 had the goods much bigger gala 6 

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:54.070
 and subsequently he updates his beta 

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.660
 which is bigger than the value 

00:09:54.070 --> 00:10:01.300
 of returned utility which is so the 

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:05.250
 new beta value of gears is on 

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:08.530
 then continue our draw here 

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:13.530
 exploits are second of the successor in 

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:18.760
 passing his values ​​of alfa beta 6 and 7 

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:20.710
 years 8 of that our max does consider his 

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.630
 first our successors we think it's 

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.060
 alfa beta we continue like this until 

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:28.450
 reach a final we reach the final 

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:30.730
 that a utility of nine so it was at 

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.180
 final returns utility of 9 to his parent 

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.310
 mines 

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:35.030
 we can make a comparison with the 

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.980
 hall once at the level of a 

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:38.180
 it is useless in fact since 

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:43.010
 anyway there are no others our 

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:45.080
 successors so to his parent he's going 

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.600
 still returned his local usefulness 

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.880
 which is 9 

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:52.580
 we are then at 1 hour max so 

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:55.220
 if we are at max the nude max makes him 

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.800
 a comparison with his beta in 

00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:02.270
 checking what utility that is 

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.770
 returned to this part if they are also 

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.320
 of the part is what it is in 

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.310
 contradiction with but alpha and beta 

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.950
 specifically with my upper band 

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:14.330
 for the max so my set 

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:16.310
 actually I have a part that me 

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:18.380
 would return a minimum value of nine 

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.930
 which is bigger than I know at 

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.880
 to be the greatest value that I 

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.730
 can reach in all the part to 

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:28.070
 from the beginning of the game and because of 

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:33.770
 of that because the value of everything is 

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:36.530
 returned is larger than the terminal 

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:40.150
 superior beta for world max i'm going 

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:43.420
 stop searching and I'm going to cut 

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:48.290
 donges will not explore the second the 

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:50.480
 successor of my humax the tilter 

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:55.300
 local the 2.9 which is just returned 

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:57.950
 at the top we do not undermine this insult is 

00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:01.100
 returned by the second successor 

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:04.760
 of a mine which uselessness of nine is in 

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:07.640
 is smaller than the other utility that 

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.500
 were returned by the first child 

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:14.030
 the first successor who is to have been 

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:16.550
 so the utility to this part ci of 

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:22.760
 graff or the mini max value and this 

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:25.430
 city ​​that went back to the parents is 

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.730
 returned to parents who give the max on 

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:30.980
 that the utility of the second child who 

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:32.960
 is 7 is bigger than 6 

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:36.320
 which makes the decision that is going to be 

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.240
 taken here is going to be the one to take the 

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:42.400
 second action and that's going to be associated 

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.400
 in min max value of 7 

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.310
 so as we can see the cave to loud 

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:51.290
 beta is not always 

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:53.810
 super intuitive I encourage you so 

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.490
 strongly to revisit this example 

00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.110
 more than once to be sure that you 

00:12:55.490 --> 00:13:02.200
 understand the different parts 

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:02.200
 execution of alfa beta algorithm
