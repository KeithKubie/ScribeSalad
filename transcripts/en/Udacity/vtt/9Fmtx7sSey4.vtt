00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.019
Deoxynucleotides are the basic building blocks of

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.760
DNA. We can string them together to

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.170
get a single stranded DNA molecule. Although

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.060
we can keep adding many deoxynucleotides in

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.090
a row, there are only a limited

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.540
number of different types of deoxynucleotides. Based

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.520
on the DNA single strand that you

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.260
see here. How many different types of deoxynucleotides

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.140
are here? Enter a number in the text box right here.
