00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:10.589
We may have found the key to marital peace!

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:16.750
It’s green, it’s pungent, and it’s the
cause for nearly 1 million arrests every year.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.910
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.890
The notion that people who smoke weed are
non-violent peace lovers may be more than

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.890
just a stereotype.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.339
A new study in the journal Psychology of Addictive
Behaviors has found that couples that smoke

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.070
weed together have staggeringly lower levels
of domestic violence.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.610
Couples where both spouses smoked at least
a few times a month -- which was the highest

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.289
end of the researchers’ scale -- had the
lowest levels of violence in the study.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.829
The study looked at 638 newly-wedded couples
over the course of 9 years.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.780
The couples each did an initial interview
and then subsequent interviews after one year,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.320
2, 4, 7, and then 9 years.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.149
Part of the data collection included reporting
their marijuana usage and instances of aggression

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.430
within the relationship.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.040
The researchers say that this means marijuana
use can help predict violence levels over

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.760
the next year - but they don’t know if smoking
weed has the power to influence violence levels

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.200
on any given day.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.350
The sample is also limited to straight couples
in their first marriage.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.560
Veeeery interesting.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.890
Of course, the temptation is to jump to the
conclusion that weed makes people more peaceful

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.320
- but there may be other reasons why this
connection exists.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.900
They’ll need to do more research to know
for sure.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.130
One reason that couples that smoke together
are more peaceful may because they’re more

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.310
likely to share core values and social circles,
making them less likely to fight.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.720
The researchers also describe the possibility
of a “positive effect” - which is basically

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.400
science-speak for “people feel happy when
they’re high so they’re less likely to

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400
fight.”

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.820
Another mechanism on the table builds on previous
research - we know that marijuana users have

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.450
dulled reactions to threats and aggression,
making them less likely to initiate aggressive

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.450
behavior.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.040
What’s even more interesting is that this
study was funded in part by the National Institute

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.970
for Drug Abuse - an institution that is well-known
for it’s strong position against recreational

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.030
marijuana use.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.110
The study adds to the growing body of research
about the effects of marijuana on individuals,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.160
their relationships, their lives and work.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.940
Here in the US, we really are amidst a giant
green flurry.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.170
Some of you may recall last month the New
York Times did a huge marijuana issue which

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.610
called for legalization on the front of the
Sunday paper in big, bold letters.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.370
About half the country now allows medical
marijuana with a prescription, in 2 states

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.980
it’s fully legal.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.530
Researchers are watching Colorado like a hawk
- AND the federal government has upped its

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.040
marijuana research quota.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.030
Now they’ll be growing 650 kilograms of
weed.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.690
Last year they grew 21.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.920
I expect the research will continue to avalanche
in the coming months and years and perhaps

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.070
more policies will be changing in response.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.440
Thanks for joining me for Dnews, we’ll see
you next time.
