[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.094
SUBJECT 1: Tonight I'm headed to
a dinner party in downtown San

00:00:03.094 --> 00:00:03.800
Francisco.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.200
It's going to be a very
intimate affair, outdoors

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.406
with 16 people in a dumpster.

00:00:11.406 --> 00:00:12.531
This should be interesting.

00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:14.862
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:16.320
SUBJECT 1: Our host
for the evening

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.010
is Josh Treuhaft, who
designed these events as part

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.990
of his master's thesis, to
try to start a conversation

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.121
about food waste.

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.418
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.457 --> 00:00:29.040
JOSH TREUHAFT: The
Salvage Supper Club

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.140
is about inspiring
and empowering people

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.584
to make the most of the
edible food in their lives.

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:36.250
There's untapped
potential in their food

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.270
that for some reason,
not to their own fault,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.260
is going to waste.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.860
What we do is host multi-course
dining experiences,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.430
where every course is made out
of food that would commonly

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.334
go to waste.

00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:50.750
It's prepared by chefs who
really know what they're doing.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.985
And it's food that people could
make on their own, oftentimes.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:55.860
SUBJECT 1: Proceeds from
these dinner parties

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.610
go to organizations that
are feeding people in need

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.620
with food that would have
otherwise gone to waste.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.230
JOSH TREUHAFT: It
seems strange to me

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.730
that we have people
who can't always

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.104
put a square meal
on their table,

00:01:06.104 --> 00:01:08.982
and we're throwing away
40% of our food supply.

00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:11.754
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:11.754 --> 00:01:14.640
JOSH TREUHAFT: About
62.5 million tons of food

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.600
is wasted annually in the
U.S. About 16% of that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.110
is at the farm, so
that's food that doesn't

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.470
pass cosmetic standards.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.320
And then the other 84% is food
waste that's going to landfill.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.200
So that's in the food supply.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.050
It's been harvested,
but then somewhere,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.410
either at the consumer's
home, at a restaurant,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.210
at a grocery store, have food
that's not getting eaten.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.260
SUBJECT 1: What is ugly food?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.160
JOSH TREUHAFT: It
doesn't look the way

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.550
the retailer or the
distributor or the consumer

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.960
needs or wants it
to, and so it's not

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.050
worth investing the time
to harvest it and put it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.360
into the food supply.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.547
Because they don't think
somebody's going to buy it.

00:01:55.547 --> 00:01:57.380
There's a spectrum that
exists, which I call

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.100
the spectrum of desirability.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.280
At one end of that spectrum
is the perfect shiny apples.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.950
And at the other
end of that spectrum

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.190
is something that
you and I would not

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.370
consider to be edible.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:15.170
And most people tend to focus
and eat at the very front end.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.490
But in reality, the majority
of that spectrum is edible.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.240
SUBJECT 1: To prepare
for tonight's event,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.220
Chef Pesha Perlsweig
visited various markets

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.090
to see what ingredients she
could transform into a six

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.640
course dinner.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.340
JOSH TREUHAFT: She
finds ingredients

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.880
that are going to go
to waste, and then she

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.160
turns it into these intricate,
amazing, interesting dishes

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
that people love.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.490
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.260
SUBJECT 1: This is
Imperfect Produce.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.660
It's a business that
specializes in selling

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.270
imperfect, or ugly fruits and
vegetables that might otherwise

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.320
be thrown away.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.480
PESHA PERLSWEIG: So it's
things like sweet potatoes

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.250
that might have been
a little bit broken.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.320
Maybe the pluot or the
plum is a little too small.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.110
And I'm trying to
take those ingredients

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.596
and turn it into something
palatable and really wonderful.

00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:09.470
This kale, for instance--
this one at the top

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.720
actually looks kind of pretty.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.179
But if you go down, you'll see
that there's some yellowing,

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:15.261
there's some spotting, and
it's really going limp.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.525
And we'll probably pickle them
in a little bit of this citrus.

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:20.150
And I'm going to make
a roll out of It.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.780
We're about to serve
the next course, which

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.750
is wilted kale rolls.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.350
They are stuffed with sweet
potatoes and chickpeas, as well

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.450
as a romesco sauce,
but instead of tomatoes

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.986
I decided to use stone fruit.

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:38.610
In front of you, you
have a ratatouille

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.820
that has been comprised out of
summer squash from our friends

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.050
at Surplus.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.080
And tomatoes from our
friends at Imperfect.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.850
And eggplant from our
friends at Buyrite.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.750
It has been cooked down with
garlic and spent red wine.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.500
You have a banana doughnut.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.260
Then you have three different
types of ice creams.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.550
One actually is a sorbet,
it's a pineapple sorbet.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.050
SUBJECT 2: That one's delicious.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.175
PESHA PERLSWEIG: Thank you.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:04.060
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.320
SUBJECT 1: Trying all of
this delicious food made

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.300
from what the industry considers
trash really blew me away.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.620
It made me think about how
much food waste I produce,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.802
and our society's obsession
with cosmetic perfection.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.790
Do you think that
this experience

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.130
has inspired you to think
differently about your own food

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.164
consumption and waste?

00:04:30.164 --> 00:04:31.080
SUBJECT 3: Absolutely.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.490
Most definitely.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.430
Before this evening, I think,
just like creature of habit,

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.261
so maybe it doesn't look good,
then throw it away, toss it

00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:39.760
away.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.100
But after tonight, and
seeing what chefs can do,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.434
or just home cooks can do.

00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:46.225
A great experience.

00:04:49.124 --> 00:04:50.790
JOSH TREUHAFT: Just
think for one minute

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.480
when you have
something, is there

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.040
a reason that I don't eat this,
or do I just throw it away

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.730
because I've always
thrown it away?

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.790
Somewhere around $218 billion
is the economic impact

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.535
of that food.

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:06.500
It's a lot of money's worth of
food that is not getting eaten,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.290
that we are investing in
growing and transporting

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:10.210
and distributing.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.430
And that is ending
up in a landfill.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.407
There are huge consequences
to the current system.

00:05:16.407 --> 00:05:19.540
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.690
SUBJECT 1: What do you hope for
the future of this movement,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.530
or the issue of food waste?

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.310
JOSH TREUHAFT: A
food system where

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.160
we don't have people
who are struggling

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.290
to get a square meal.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.730
That's an aspiration that we
should constantly fight for,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.800
because everybody needs to eat.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.637
My hope is that in my lifetime,
I will see that that changes.

00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:44.220
SUBJECT 1: Check out
this next episode

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.120
to see how this
major U.S. City is

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.360
striving to become zero waste.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.720
SUBJECT 4: When I started
at Recology 23 years ago,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.670
the recycling rate
was around 38%.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.990
Today we've more
than doubled that.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.260
SUBJECT 1: So far San Francisco
has diverted 80% of its waste

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.770
away from landfills.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.660
And its success has been
getting global attention.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.570
