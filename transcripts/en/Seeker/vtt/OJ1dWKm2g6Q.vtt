00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.330
The idea of being able to get around space
as easily as we get around in our cars is

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.840
a dream many have grasped at, but none have
achieved so far (although not for lack of

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.570
trying: Elon, I’m looking at you).

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.720
We’ve covered the so-called impossible drive
several times on this channel.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.770
And according to some recent updates, it looks
like it might really be impossible.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.680
The impossible drive, also known as the EM
drive, was originally conceptualized in the

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.680
early 2000s.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.869
It’s a hypothetical form of space travel
that wouldn’t require any fuel.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.279
The drive works--again, hypothetically--by
bouncing microwaves around a conical metal

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.279
chamber.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.430
Conventionally, you’d need to push against
the matter around you to move anywhere--that’s

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.280
how physics, as defined by Newton’s third
law of motion, works.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.060
You know, like the conventional rocket thrusters
we have, that’s how they work.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.060
This drive, were it to really function, would
break our fundamental understanding of Newtonian

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.060
physics.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.970
And for a hot second there, it looked like
we may have measured the drive working-

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.970
In 2016 a team of NASA researchers detected a
tiny amount of thrust while testing the drive

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.649
in a vacuum, although they were hesitant to
attribute that thrust to anything except experimental

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.649
error.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.390
And it turns out they may have been right.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.260
Research in this area has been largely underfunded
up until this point because, as the name of

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.340
the technology states, most people think it’s
quite literally impossible.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.820
But a research team in Germany just conducted
an experiment with some seriously sick resources,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.080
like an extreme vacuum and specialized shielding.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.320
If the EM drive worked, it would mean that
space travel would be significantly cheaper

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.260
and faster and more efficient...so who won?

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.260
Physics?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.900
Or the impossible?

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.280
Definitely physics.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280
Physics still wins.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.869
These latest, most sophisticated tests conclude
that the tiny amount of thrust that NASA’s

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.350
team detected in 2016 was most likely due
to interaction of the metal drive with the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.350
earth’s magnetic field.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.790
Even though more teams around the world will
probably continue to verify this work by conducting

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.051
tests of their own, it would seem that for
the most part, this spells RIP for the EM

00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:52.051
drive dream.

00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:55.670
But, just to cover all their space bases,
the team also looked into a different kind

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.440
of drive called the Mach Effect thruster,
whose concept assumes that if a mass vibrates

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.369
enough, it interacts gravitationally with
the rest of the universe.

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.549
This drive, made out of a stack of piezoelectric
crystals attached to a mass of brass (which

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.659
is fun to say), showed a little more promise
in tests from the German lab.

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:16.530
The researchers still concluded that any thrust
detected from these tests is most likely interference,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.370
or noise from the rest of the physical world
interacting with the set up.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.620
So, that’s our latest update on the state
of the EM drive.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.400
A little disappointing that we won’t all
be jetting around space on vibrating crystals,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.340
but the researchers make a good point at the
end of their paper, saying that these experiments

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.850
were highly educational in that they required
very demanding experimental conditions, and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.939
this will help them in testing further potentially-transformative
space drives.

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:41.299
Ah, humans.

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.139
Ever hopeful, experimenting our way into the
future.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.680
And hey, fun fact, the metal used to shield
the Em drive in this experiment is called

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.109
mu metal, which creates a region containing
only a TINY fraction of the Earth’s magnetic

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.109
field.

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.109
And there was STILL interference.

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.109
Damn.
