00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.420
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: All right.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.420
Well, good afternoon everyone.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.160
Thank you
for stopping by another Google talk.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.220
We're very pleased
and honored to have with us today Chris Fedak

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.860
and Josh
Schwartz the co-creators and co-producers

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.980
of the hit NBC show Chuck hit..

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.940
&gt;&gt;Josh: Hit
&gt;&gt;Chris: Whoa

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.279
&gt;&gt; Josh: You guys can do anything at Google.

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.010
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Which is on its final season

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.080
this week.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.000
For those of
you that are watching the archive footage,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.460
our talk today will
cover spoilers up until the final three episodes

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.300
with the
last ones airing next week.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.070
And we also solicited
questions on Google moderators.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.879
So thank you to all the
fans who submitted some extra questions.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.589
We'll get those in as well.

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.760
Chris and Josh what I wanted to start out
with is just

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.799
talk about the characters on Chuck.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:48.539
That's one of the center
parts of the show is the character development

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.929
that's
happened over five seasons.

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.829
&gt;&gt;Josh: I'm Josh by the way.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:52.829
That's Chris.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.219
Just to clarify.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.420
Well, I
think for us character was always the most

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.199
integral part
of the show.

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.389
By the way, should I be looking at the
camera or the room.

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:03.579
What's better for the â€“.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.780
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: You can look at the camera
be then you can like scan the room

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.270
&gt;&gt; Josh: Seduce the camera or just passing
glances?.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.520
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Well, you can make sure

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.520
everybody is.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.950
&gt;&gt; Josh: Little wave, okay.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.119
&gt;&gt; Josh: So yeah, for us character was always
kind of the most

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:18.670
integral element to the show.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.212
Because obviously there was
this high concept of a show with a guy who

00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:23.479
gets a computer downloaded in
his brain.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.479
There was going to be action and there was
going to be all that kind of

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.479
fun.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.890
But for us it was always a character story.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.840
It was always the story of an
Underdog guy who felt like his whole life

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.620
-- he had all this
potential that he had never really fulfilled.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.679
What do you do
when you are given the opportunity to finally

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:41.799
live up
to that potential?

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.289
The sort of outsider-underdog element to Chuck's
character.

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.119
For us the litmus test was always if you pull
out of the story a

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.479
guy gets a computer downloaded into his brain,
are these

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.329
still a group of characters you want to hang
out with.

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.399
And that was really the challenge we had for
ourselves in

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.200
starting out with the show.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.729
Chuck's home life, his family
life, obviously the weirdos who work at the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.729
Buy More.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.969
All those people really wanting to feel like
these are

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.479
characters you want to hang with and see evolve
regardless

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.729
of what bad guys of the week they're dealing
with.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.770
&gt;&gt; Chris: Absolutely.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.960
I think the other thing, too, when we first
stat down to talk about this show, we were

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.800
all going
through that late quarter life crisis.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.400
You're on the
cusp of being an actual legitimate adult.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.760
I think Chuck
kind of echoes that in a way especially his

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.950
growth over the years.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.430
We started off in season one as a guy who
didn't know

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.560
what he wanted to do with his life.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.510
And, for each season
of the show, Chuck has changed from the guy

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.680
who didn't
know -- couldn't figure it out -- to figuring

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.760
he does want
to be a spy.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.959
That evolution was something we did want to
track.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.260
In a way being a spy echoed people being on
with

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.500
their lives at this point.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.099
And that was a lot of fun.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.241
&gt;&gt; Josh: We talk about your question evolution
of characters

00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:51.500
over the series.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.680
Obviously, you know, one of the biggest
things was Chuck's secret and as his friends

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.599
and the people in his life started
to find out about it and get pulled into that

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.470
world that would obviously have
a tremendous impact on Chuck.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.489
But also on people like
Captain Awesome.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.489
Nice T-shirt by the way.

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.489
&gt;&gt;Male Interviewer: Thank-you.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.489
I came prepared.

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.489
&gt;&gt;Josh: Plug your T-shirt.

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.489
We did not give that to him.

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.560
He was wearing
that when we got here.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.120
And Morgan and his sister Ellie.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.600
So I think that was a key part of the show
when they have

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.510
that information leak out, when to have people
find out.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.860
The other big thing obviously was the sort
of Chuck/Sarah

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:22.880
love story.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.420
And as Chris said, at the beginning of the
show,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.099
Chuck didn't know what he wanted to do.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.930
But he had this
group of friends.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.450
He had his family.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.470
He had his
personal life pretty well figured out.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.069
His professional
life not so much.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.280
And Sarah was someone who was going to
come into his world who had her professional

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.580
life
completely figured out but had no personal

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.580
life.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:41.819
And
actually, when we met her in the pilot, Bryce

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.719
Larkin was
her ex-lover, had just been murdered.

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.670
And you know she was
someone who was always kind of the kick ass

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.890
CIA agent who
never really had a family, never really had

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.020
friends.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.519
Chuck was always going to be kind of envious
and excited

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.810
looking up to her world and Sarah was always
going to be

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.609
looking up to his world as well how nice it
would be just

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:07.110
to be a human and relax and have friends and
hangout.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.980
And
so, watching Chuck kind of become more of

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.200
a bad ass spy
as you were saying and watching Sarah become

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.691
more human and reconnect
with her family, be okay with feelings and

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:17.680
having
emotions -- those were two of the main, I

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.810
think, kind of
character spines that ran through the show.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:21.810
&gt;&gt;Chris: Absolutely.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.230
I think the other thing too it's really
two people from two different TV shows running

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.440
into each
other wanting to be in each other's television

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.440
show.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.950
So
it's always been a mash up in that way.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.500
And I think that
because Sarah Walker should be the star of

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.070
the television
show in her own right.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.971
&gt;&gt; Josh: And John Casey obviously thinks he
should be the star

00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:37.971
of his own show.

00:04:37.971 --> 00:04:38.971
&gt;&gt;Chris: Exactly.

00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:39.971
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Josh: He feels like that Jack Bauer guy

00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:40.971
was a huge pussy.

00:04:40.971 --> 00:04:43.840
If it had been John Casey on 24, it would
have gone 12 hours.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.560
John Casey wouldn't need 24 hours.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560
[laughter]

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.080
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: That's very shining.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.541
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: And also one thing I noticed
in the character

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.880
development was the relationship between Morgan
and Ellie

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.880
as well.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.780
They started out as basically enemies with
Morgan as this creepy stalker person.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.710
[Josh and Chris laugh] Towards the ends
Morgan came into his own as a mature adult.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.730
&gt;&gt;Josh: He sure did
&gt;&gt; Josh: He grew into that beard.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.730
That's for damn sure.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.930
[laughter]
Somebody coming in.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:09.930
Join us.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.060
No, I think.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.060
Morgan was
interesting.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.100
We've actually done a little bit looking
back on Morgan because Josh Gomez is this

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.260
tremendously
likable guy, with a tremendously likable beard.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.000
And we
always felt like he was going to be this great

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.750
comic
energy on the show and the first season people

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.750
really
hated him.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.750
[chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Chris: They hated him

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.780
&gt;&gt;Josh: They're like who's this dip shit Morgan?

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:28.780
Hello.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.840
&gt;&gt;Chris: And
Ooh -- that looks tasty.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.970
&gt;&gt; Male #1: So good.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.920
&gt;&gt; Josh: For us?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.530
No.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.810
And so, one of the things that we knew
we needed to work on after the first season

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.001
was how do we
get people to like Morgan as much as we like

00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:44.670
Josh Gomez
and we knew people were going to like Morgan.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.430
Part of
the issue was Morgan was always in the way.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.770
It was like
Chuck was trying to go on a mission and bumbling

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.750
Morgan
was kind of stopping him from being able to

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.910
do that.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.460
And
once Morgan started to get a little swagger

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.890
of his own.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.241
Got to be
assistant of the bar manager which is, you

00:05:57.241 --> 00:06:00.250
know, it's a
good way to feel your oats.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.250
&gt;&gt; Chris: [laughing].

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.180
&gt;&gt; Josh: And be more like the Alfred to Chuck's
Batman.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.870
That
became a role for Morgan that really allowed

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.260
Josh's comic
gifts to flourish and for the character to

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.860
really click
with the audiences.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.140
&gt;&gt; Chris: But there's a real fear when you
work in TV especially

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.260
when somebody has a secret like Chuck's secret,
especially in these first

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.030
couple of seasons, was that the whole show
is dependent on

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.040
people not knowing.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.600
I think one of the realizations we
had was the show kind of got better and better

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.960
the more
people who found out kind of became part of

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.380
the Carmichael
team.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.460
It really started with Josh Gomez in season
3.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.540
We
knew halfway through the season, I think episode

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.020
9, we are going to
have Josh found out.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.020
&gt;&gt;Josh: Awesome found out.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: Awesome found out at the end of the
season too and

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:42.910
that's great and it was fun.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.250
&gt;&gt; Josh: I just make sure you've seen the
show.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.920
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Chris: I watch it from afar.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.190
Yeah, and that was important.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.021
That was a big part of why, you know, the
show -- we were

00:06:53.021 --> 00:06:55.620
able to go for five seasons and 91 episodes
was because it

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.280
was fun to bring people into that world.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.350
What was great
about Gomez was he was a fish out of water.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.150
By that
point, you know, Chuck had become somewhat

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.390
knowledgeable,
somewhat good at being a spy, kind of good.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.900
So Gomez was
our new guy.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.289
Our new wide-eyed participant.

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.100
&gt;&gt; Josh: He became the new Chuck.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.970
Also in terms of letting
people know about the secret.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.870
We always thought we were
getting canceled.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.930
So you know you're always like, well, we
could be getting canceled.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.800
Somebody should find out
before we get canceled.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.800
It'd be awesome.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.800
Hey, we didn't get canceled.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800
Somebody else should get find out.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.550
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Then Jeff Found out everything.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.050
&gt;&gt; Josh: Yeah with yeah.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.410
Which we always joke from the
beginning is Jeff would find out everything

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:31.550
and then
forget the next day.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.410
&gt;&gt; Chris: Which I think we did.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.920
&gt;&gt; Josh: From the very beginning.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.180
But actually a lot of people
didn't know when we first started working

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.790
on the show
Chris had this great idea at the time that

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.140
Captain Awesome was going
to turn out to be bad guy.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.240
You were going to find out
later on he was like a spy he was planted

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.240
there.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.310
He was
the enemy and the whole relationship with

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.310
Ellie had been
a fraud.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.810
And I always thought that was super-cool.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.920
That was a bomb we were going to drop at the
end of

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920
season one.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.470
And then, we cast Ryan McPartlin as Captain
Awesome and

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.900
everybody loved him from the get-go the first
time he said

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.900
'awesome'.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.420
&gt;&gt; Chris: Three lines and you love the guy.

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.510
&gt;&gt;Josh: "Way to go; awesome" and people were
like I'm in with

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.510
that guy.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.510
&gt;&gt; Chris: He's going to be the bad guy.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.510
He can't do that.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.030
&gt;&gt; Josh: We very quickly realized we should
not make one of our

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.390
most likable people the villain.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:14.330
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Maintain that family.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.180
&gt;&gt; Josh: Exactly.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.370
And once Morgan got a love life of his own,
he became much less creepy to Ellie.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.370
&gt;&gt;Chris: True.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.370
True.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.190
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: And then also I really liked
the development that

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:24.480
happened with the minor characters, with Buy
More.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480
I was wondering--

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.620
&gt;&gt;Josh: I would not refer to them as minor
if they're watching

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.620
this at all.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.720
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Well, for people like Fernando

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.969
and Skip
&gt;&gt; Josh: Oh, Fernando and Skip -- minor is

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:33.969
fine.

00:08:33.969 --> 00:08:35.199
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [inaudible] Impromptu Jeffster!
performance?

00:08:35.199 --> 00:08:37.390
&gt;&gt;Chris: No, no, that's gonna be scary

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.390
&gt;&gt; Josh: Tonight?

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.250
You will see Jeffster! again before the show
is done.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.650
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yes, you will see them again

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.680
&gt;&gt;Josh: Yeah, those guys have been part of
the show for five

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.870
years and they get their due as well.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.439
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah, they also get lines in the
final episode --

00:08:50.439 --> 00:08:54.529
Fernando, Skip, and some of the guys from,
who have been in the Buy More back there will

00:08:54.529 --> 00:08:56.610
actually have lines from the final
episode.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.170
&gt;&gt;Chris: That's part of the discovery.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.779
I think when we first
started working on the show, we shot our first

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:03.569
episode
the pilot was shot in CompUSA which was going

00:09:03.569 --> 00:09:04.569
out of business.

00:09:04.569 --> 00:09:05.759
So
we could only shoot in the middle of the night.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:07.300
&gt;&gt; Josh: It was very sad.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.300
&gt;&gt; Chris: Very sad.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.430
Then when we built the Buy More, once we got
the pick

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.060
up, we built the actual stage.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.790
We had to populate it with
people.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.970
As the show went on, we started to write to
them

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:20.970
in the background.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.839
So we would write to Fernando or to Skip
making sure we were always folding them into

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:27.279
the story in
odd ways even though they didn't say anything.

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:29.069
Always
kind of imagine they're having their own stories

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:30.069
back
there.

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:32.100
&gt;&gt; Josh: Yes Sarah's high school reunion when
there was the big rager at

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.100
the Buy More.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.769
&gt;&gt;Chris: That's right
&gt;&gt; Josh: He got some on the couch.

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:36.399
&gt;&gt;Chris: He did get something on the couch

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:41.269
&gt;&gt;Josh But even in terms of Jeff and Lester,
who are the stars

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:46.220
of Chuck if you ask you know Jeff or Lester,
that when we

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.220
were shooting the pilot they didn't have much
to do in

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.220
that episode.

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.500
They had a couple of lines.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.610
But they were
so weird and they had such an interesting

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.400
chemistry that
we were like we have to keep writing for these

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400
people.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.810
But when we tested the show, you always have
to test your

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:02.670
pilot, --the network and the studio do--,
people thought they

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.200
were the bad guys just based on three lines.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.860
So we had
to work very hard to make them not become

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.860
the
super-villains.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:15.319
&gt;&gt; Male presenter; I also want to transition
to the fan following, the cult following of

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:16.319
Chuck.

00:10:16.319 --> 00:10:18.860
I think that was one thing that continued
and

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.490
grew from the Subway sandwiches to the campaigns
to the

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:23.490
napkins.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.180
I wanted to ask how much attention did you
pay

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.680
to the fan revolution and will that affect
your future

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.700
work as well.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.610
&gt;&gt; Josh: Oh, we 100 percent pay attention
to it.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.990
I think we've
been very vocal in our gratitude towards our

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.249
fans and I
think our cast has done an amazing job of

00:10:41.249 --> 00:10:44.670
any time the fans
have events those guys are -- every single

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:45.689
one of them is
there.

00:10:45.689 --> 00:10:47.600
Everyone is so appreciative.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.630
The fans really did
mobilize in a very unique and clever way.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:53.649
You reference the
sandwiches.

00:10:53.649 --> 00:10:55.730
100%; that was unheard of.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.579
No one had eaten
sandwiches as a sign of protest before.

00:10:58.579 --> 00:11:00.519
&gt;&gt; Chris: Just a savvy way.

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:02.910
Our fans have always done I mean
just like our fans have always been very clever

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.310
and smart
when it comes to -- you know, we've done product

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.310
integration.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.910
The show started to latch on to that.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.850
And
it was a great idea because it's great when

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.230
NBC is
deciding should they pick up the show or not

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.019
and the CFO
Subway is giving them a call, "hey, we like

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:17.810
that show
where we're getting all this kind of sandwich,

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.010
you know,
excitement about."

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.180
[laughter] It's like that's only a helpful
thing.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.879
It just speaks to the savviness.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:26.350
&gt;&gt;Josh: It's amazing that subway wanted to
stay in business

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:29.620
with us after Jeff revealed his sandwich of
choice was

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.620
the Tunaroni.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.339
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh yeah, that was amazing
&gt;&gt;Josh: Tuna and pepperoni.

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:35.600
That was Jeff's Subway sandwich.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.480
You felt right there
Subway should have ended their relationship

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.480
with us.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.540
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Have some secret menu.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.329
&gt;&gt; Josh: But it was a show for the fans.

00:11:42.329 --> 00:11:45.949
I mean, we were fans
of the kind -- there were certain movies and

00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:48.690
shows we
grew up on that inspired us and influenced

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.690
us.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:52.670
I think there was kind of a
common language in the DNA of the show just

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:56.170
in terms of,
you know, the genre of the show, the tone

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.730
of the show,
the references that were built into the show,

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.329
episodes
inspired by things and guest stars that we

00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:04.189
had on the show
that spoke to those things so there was a

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:07.540
common language
and lore that we had talking about the show

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.259
and it became
a conversation that extended to the fans.

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:13.029
The fans, you
know, I think loved the same references that

00:12:13.029 --> 00:12:16.139
we did and
were excited about those same things and got

00:12:16.139 --> 00:12:17.139
everything.

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:20.360
There was never an homage, never a guest star,
never anything

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.149
that the fans didn't pick up on and also appreciate
it

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:24.149
was part of the same conversation.

00:12:24.149 --> 00:12:28.260
And I think ComiCon
was also a huge thing for the show.

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:31.250
Again, we were
very -- you know, we weren't necessarily high

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.380
on the
radar on NBC when we premiered.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.952
I don't know that we've
ever been high on the radar at NBC.

00:12:35.952 --> 00:12:38.740
But we got to ComiCon for the
first time and is it like anybody's going

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.070
to come to this
panel?

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.070
Does anyone care?

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.740
The room was full.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:43.930
The show
got a standing ovation.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.149
It was the greatest feeling in the
world.

00:12:45.149 --> 00:12:46.949
I think we were hugging each other and we
do not

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:50.310
like to touch each other very, very often.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:53.170
And the
following year we went back and the room was

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.170
bigger.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.140
And
the following year Jeffster! performed.

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.089
It was like very
disturbing.

00:12:59.089 --> 00:13:00.279
The euphoria people had for.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.999
People were
taking their shirts off.

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:03.999
Mostly men.

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:07.959
[laughter] For them and they
were really -- you know, and so just having

00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:09.080
that
opportunity.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.080
When you make a TV show.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.440
It's not like
making a movie when you get to sit back in

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.870
the theater
and watch the movie with the audience.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.880
There's very few
opportunities where you get to watch the show

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.209
with an audience.

00:13:17.209 --> 00:13:20.600
I think ComiCon, WonderCon, what's the one
in New

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.730
York?

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:22.730
ComiCon New York?

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:23.730
&gt;&gt;Chris: ComiCon New York.

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.730
&gt;&gt; Josh: Very creatively named.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.920
[laughter] I think all of those
opportunities for us to get with the fans

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.559
and watch the
show with them and interact with them has

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:31.740
always been
tremendously rewarding.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.519
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: It's something you can't
build either.

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:36.010
&gt;&gt; Josh: It's 100 percent organic.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.160
You can't fake that.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.069
Believe me if we could within we would have
tried.

00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:41.869
But
it's something that just took on a life of

00:13:41.869 --> 00:13:42.869
its own.

00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:45.129
I
think we just kind of stood back and watched

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:48.670
as, you
know, it really took form and the network

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.840
had to acknowledge
it.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.840
It could not be ignored.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.660
They made a statement that
was very powerful on behalf of the show.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.800
&gt;&gt; Chris: Absolutely.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:01.330
I think that experience at ComiCon was
really a moment for us when we felt like we

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:05.220
had kind of
tapped into something in the sense Chuck,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.309
Chuck the character, was a great way
to kind of bring people into this world, into

00:14:08.309 --> 00:14:09.740
this show and to
meet these people.

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.370
And I remember by the point you got
to the end of the episode and you saw Casey

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.809
and Sarah at
the Buy More, you saw what this show was going

00:14:14.809 --> 00:14:17.879
to be.

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:19.369
People were just really jazzed to see what
was going to

00:14:19.369 --> 00:14:21.129
happen next.

00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:24.250
For us that theatrical experience you just
don't get that.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.420
Usually you send the show off; people people
watch it home and have

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.959
their own personal experience with it.

00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:29.939
But the weird
thing about our show is, -- we found this

00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:32.339
in San Francisco as
well--, it plays great with a theater.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:33.610
Plays great with an
audience.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.470
It's probably because we always designed it
in

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.800
a way as a little summer blockbuster each
week.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.800
And
yeah.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.629
&gt;&gt; Josh: So we're going to take the show on
the road now that it's over.

00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:44.459
&gt;&gt;Chris: Exactly
&gt;&gt; Josh: Vaudeville production of Chuck.

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:45.459
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: In theaters.

00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:46.459
On Broadway

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:47.459
&gt;&gt; Josh: Yes.

00:14:47.459 --> 00:14:48.459
Exactly.

00:14:48.459 --> 00:14:49.459
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: That would be cool.

00:14:49.459 --> 00:14:50.459
I would go see it.

00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:51.459
&gt;&gt;Chris: Season 6 on stage.

00:14:51.459 --> 00:14:52.459
&gt;&gt; Josh: Yeah.

00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:53.649
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: So transitioning.

00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:54.899
&gt;&gt; Josh: Ice Capades.

00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:56.579
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Josh: Or Chuck-aPades.

00:14:56.579 --> 00:14:58.670
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Or an opera.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.350
Just like dramatic opera.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:03.320
&gt;&gt;Josh: Wow
&gt;&gt; Josh: Pavarotti as the new villain.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.930
&gt;&gt;Chris: I can see Jeff and Lester right in
the middle

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.930
[laughter]

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:10.430
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: And also looking over across
the four seasons, five seasons I should

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.220
say yeah what would you say was your favorite
Chuck

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.160
moment across the episodes?

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.250
&gt;&gt; Chris: Thanks for that.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:22.439
[laughter] Yeah, you know, it's for the life
of

00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:24.759
me -- every episode in the show kind of turns
into a

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:25.829
child in a way.

00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:28.950
Some of the loved a little bit, you know a
little less than others.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.189
&gt;&gt;Josh: Some of them cuter than others
Chris: Some of them definitely cuter than

00:15:30.189 --> 00:15:31.189
others.

00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:32.740
But I
think that there's been some -- you know,

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.929
I think the
moment of Sarah and Chuck coming together

00:15:34.929 --> 00:15:37.540
for the first
time in episode 13.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.689
I think that there's an episode called
Chuck versus the Colonel.

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:43.889
These are all romantic almosts.

00:15:43.889 --> 00:15:45.870
Over the years when we first started talking
about the

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:46.870
show.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.470
I loved action movies and it's kind of what
I focus

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.470
on.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.389
I've turned into a big softhearted romantic
turning

00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:53.389
into Chuck..

00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:54.389
&gt;&gt; Josh: That's what I did to Chris.

00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:57.600
I was the teen soap guy and he was like girly
guy.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600
He
was John Casey.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.649
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah, I walked around calling you

00:16:00.649 --> 00:16:01.649
the girly guy.

00:16:01.649 --> 00:16:03.899
Over the years I've found
those big romantic moments to be my favorite.

00:16:03.899 --> 00:16:06.279
So
and Sarah and Chuck in the hotel room in the

00:16:06.279 --> 00:16:08.490
Colonel episode making out in the bed.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:09.490
It's
just like these great.

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.720
What you find in television it's
about relationships and I think that's something

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.029
we
didn't understand when we first got into the

00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:17.439
show you
start working on a pilot it's very much like

00:16:17.439 --> 00:16:21.269
a little movie, but
really television is about people and families

00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:23.259
and those
interactions.

00:16:23.259 --> 00:16:25.639
I think for me it's those big moments.

00:16:25.639 --> 00:16:26.899
In
our finale we're going to have a couple of

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:29.680
moments that
are definitely, you know, some of the best

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.970
of the series
as well.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.350
Because it's about the characters.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.559
It's about
these people interrelating.

00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:39.179
I think those Sarah-Chuck
moments are always my favorite.

00:16:39.179 --> 00:16:43.470
&gt;&gt; Josh: I'd say yeah, the end of season 2
where the wedding and

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.429
Chevy Chase is marching through the wedding
and there's

00:16:45.429 --> 00:16:47.740
paratroopers crashing through the Skylights
and Jeffster!'s

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:52.050
there performing and Chuck downloads the
new Intersect and suddenly knows kung fu.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.759
I think for us
that had been something we'd wanted to do.

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:57.410
Even before season 1
but we couldn't because the writer strike

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:59.459
hit halfway through season one.

00:16:59.459 --> 00:17:03.430
And so,
there was just so much anticipation and buildup.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.760
And so,
the opportunity to do that and those episodes

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:07.760
really came
together.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.959
It was also the last time we had any
money to make the show.

00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:10.959
[laughter]

00:17:10.959 --> 00:17:14.390
&gt;&gt; Chris: Season 2 was the end of the money.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:15.690
But that was the
great moment.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.660
We always said from the get-go our show is
not about some guy with super power.

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:19.660
It's not about a
guy with ability.

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.640
It's the computer only gives him
information.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.160
And then, somewhere along the process Josh
was like what happens if we give him abilities?

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.260
And then
from that point on, that was a great way into

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.070
the second
part of the show which was Chuck wanting to

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.320
be a spy.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.210
So
that moment was a huge moment for us.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.180
It's like, you
know, can we pull it off and can Zach Levy

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.180
do it?

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.170
And he could we realized the show is possible
from that point out.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.650
Zach Zach could do all these amazing spy skills.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:46.290
&gt;&gt; Josh: There's also a moment in season 3
where Chuck and

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.700
Sarah are tied up or season 4 -- remind me.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.700
It's all a
blur.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.700
&gt;&gt; Chris: Which one?

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:52.700
Which one?

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.830
&gt;&gt;Josh: With
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Oh with the battle like.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.450
&gt;&gt; Josh: Where Dalton is standing over him.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:01.040
Volkoff and Mary
are standing over him

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.380
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh yeah, yeah
&gt;&gt;Josh: and we just looked at each other

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.150
it's like James Bond and Sarah Connor kicking
our

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:06.270
character's asses.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.480
This is amazing.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.810
[laughter] This is everything
we'd ever wanted when we were like 12-year-olds.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:12.450
That was
pretty exciting.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.810
&gt;&gt; Chris: Chuck versus First Flight, which
is one of our

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:15.810
best episodes.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:18.330
I mean yeah, you work Timothy Dalton.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.200
It's just super-amazing.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.180
Because, you know, it's like he
takes that energy you see on screen, is like

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:26.820
that all the
time.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:31.200
So Timothy would actually come to the writer's
offices and sit down with us and go through

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.330
the script
which is just amazing.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.090
There's James Bond and he's
acting it out here in the office.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.610
So we're like sorting
out the story.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:37.610
It's amazing.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:43.090
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: And also, looking at Google,
we have a big, I'd say a

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.140
cultural following and cultural resemblance
to the Buy

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.140
More.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.420
We have our own nerd herd here.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.110
&gt;&gt; Josh: Much nicer here from what little
I've seen.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.530
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: And we focus a lot on really
designing great products

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.570
too.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.820
Thinking about the Intersect one thing that
struck

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:58.820
my mind.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.820
&gt;&gt; Josh: You guys building that here?

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.820
Can't talk about that I
understand.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.000
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: I haven't been on the complete

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.140
tour in Los Angeles so
I can't answer that.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.140
But there's other.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:09.031
&gt;&gt;Josh: I understand
&gt;&gt; Chris: For those of you at home there's

00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:10.270
a big cut right there.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.370
Something was
just discussed and I'm just coming back into

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.370
the conversation.

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.370
&gt;&gt;Josh: We've been tranqed.

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:15.370
We've been reprogrammed.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:16.880
&gt;&gt;Chris: But we're back&gt;&gt; Male presenter:
Back to the Intersect.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.640
So what was the product
development life cycle like for the Intersect.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.680
First it
was the thing.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.350
&gt;&gt;Chris: Oh Jesus Christ
&gt;&gt;Josh: This is a Fedak question.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.350
&gt;&gt;Chris: Aw geez.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.350
Thanks a lot.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:26.350
That's like a government question.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.350
Yeah, thanks.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:29.140
[Chris and Josh talk over each other]
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Tips.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.530
How do we get from killing a person to frosted
tips.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:32.750
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Chris: How do we get from killing a person

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.750
to frosted
tips.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:38.450
I think the first one -- there's been a couple
different durations of the computer.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.230
God I'm not going
to go through them because I need a flowchart.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:45.120
&gt;&gt;Josh: If you put on these sunglasses, you
will get a

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.120
download.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:49.590
&gt;&gt; Chris: Which also works much faster than
when Chuck first did

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.590
it.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:54.500
But I think when we first talked about the
Intersect

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.600
it was something that we didn't quite know
what it could

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.090
do and how it could affect Chuck, but he was
somehow

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.960
perfect for it and in some ways chosen by
his father.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.691
But
this season season 4 we thought about the

00:20:05.691 --> 00:20:08.900
Intersect in a
different way in the sense we saw Shaw had

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.780
had uploaded
the Intersect into his head and it had a certain

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.860
affect.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.090
But what would happen if the Intersect had
a different

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.250
effect on each person you brought in.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.550
What if it was
more like the ring of power, you know?

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.220
What if you
actually made it into something that when

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.980
someone up
loaded the Intersect it would affect their

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.190
personality as
well.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.570
And so, for Morgan, we thought wouldn't it
be great

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.310
to see Morgan as the Intersect and wouldn't
it be also

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.730
great if it turned him into a gigantic douche,
you know?

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.870
So
that was the thing that we began to think

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.340
about as season
4 is the Intersect is a scary thing that you

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.340
don't want
inside your head.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.880
And maybe only one person can have it
inside their head and be able to handle it

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.010
and that's
Chuck Bartowski.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.530
And he doesn't have it this year.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.380
Always winds
up in somebody else.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.790
So if it's not Morgan it's Shaw.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.020
And now, as we see at the end of the last
episode it's in

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.020
Sarah's head.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.720
And in these final couple of episodes we're
going to see what effect is on Sarah Walker.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.090
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Does she flash or zoom?

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.480
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Chris: Well, she certainly flashes.

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.610
&gt;&gt; Josh: Whoa, Sarah Walker flashes.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.060
That could really get
people to watch.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.660
&gt;&gt;Chris: Yes, please.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.660
[ laughter].

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.800
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Nice.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:14.020
Along those lines we had a question from FJed
85 from

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:15.020
YouTube.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.020
Thanks for writing in.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:20.690
He or she wanted to know the most dangerous
stunt Yvonne has ever done.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:22.050
How about the rest of the
cast.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.450
&gt;&gt;Josh: Well the most serious thing Yvonne
has almost done is

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:26.660
almost kissing Lester.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.880
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Chris: True

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.770
&gt;&gt;Josh: That was dangerous for both of
them.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:31.860
&gt;&gt; Josh: I don't know Yvonne is such a sport.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.590
I remember
Michael Clarke Duncan who's like 7 feet tall

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.550
and
outweighs her by several hundred pounds just

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.820
walloping her on top of
a rooftop.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.620
That must have been pretty dangerous.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.900
&gt;&gt; Chris: That was an amazing sequence.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.051
They also had to wire
her for that sequence because he would hold

00:21:46.051 --> 00:21:47.051
her up in the
air.

00:21:47.051 --> 00:21:49.620
So she was up on the rooftop wired into a
rig.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.860
&gt;&gt; Josh: She's fearless.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.100
&gt;&gt; Chris: They're fearless.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.940
Zach and Yvonne are -- it's amazing
what they will do.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.540
In many of those instances when
you're watching something, it was actually

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.630
them doing it.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.050
You know, the Thai fighting scene.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.980
All those sequences
are what's amazing about them is just how

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:05.980
close they get.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.790
It's like when they're working on a fight
sequence we

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:13.670
have an incredible stunt coordinator Merritt
Yohnka and he

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:16.350
can really get Zach Zach and Yvonne into those
sequences in a

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:18.980
very close and intimate way.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.870
And it's an amazing group.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.750
So it's very controlled.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.710
It's very safe.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:26.710
But it's.

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.940
&gt;&gt; Josh: Probably for Morgan his most dangerous
stunt is

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:30.940
&gt;&gt;Chris: walking anywhere.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:31.940
&gt;&gt;Josh: Walking anywhere
&gt;&gt; Chris: He's Gomez.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.650
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Josh: In one season he was grabbed around

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:36.930
the throat by
former New York giants Michael Strahan and

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.180
then he was
line-drived to the ground by Jerome Bettis

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.820
AKA "the bus" formerly with the Steelers.

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.460
So I think we probably put him through the
ringer that

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.460
year.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.460
&gt;&gt; Chris: That's probably it.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.600
That's probably the most dangerous.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.180
But for Zach, we
started season 3 I think no season 2 with

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.300
Zach hanging out
a window.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:00.380
And that's Zach hanging out a window of a
downtown warehouse here in Los Angeles, six

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.380
stories up.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.630
And it's one of those moments where you are
thinking to

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.380
yourself, "we're going to hang the star of
the show off

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.460
the side of the building."

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.780
And one -- Zach wants to do
it.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.520
He's a director at heart so he wants the shot
to be

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520
amazing.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.290
And then 2 -- you have to trust your team.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.490
You
have to know there's a bunch of invisible

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:24.300
things that are
protecting your crew, but it's -- it's still

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.240
six stories
up.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.790
For me, it was -- I sat there the most nervous
person on the set.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.470
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Cool.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:37.260
And we also like going back to fans paying
extra special attention to every nuanced detail.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.470
So we
have a person.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.880
&gt;&gt; Josh: That sounds like mistake -- finding
every mistake.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.370
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Jonas Life Ten says in the
pilot episode of Chuck every

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:47.040
time Chuck flashes he sees a picture of a
slice of pie.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040
&gt;&gt;Josh: Uh-huh.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.670
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Is there deep symbolism
in the pie or is the cake a lie

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:52.570
&gt;&gt; Chris: There was a lot of meanings on that.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:53.810
&gt;&gt; Josh: There's a lot of pie meanings.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.850
&gt;&gt;Chris: When we first started working on
the show, we were

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.960
trying to imagine how exactly the Intersect
would work.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.820
And so, each episode would have a different
mission.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.670
Would have a different set of flashes.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.170
And each flash
would have an album cover.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:11.620
And so, the apple pie was the
album cover.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.740
&gt;&gt; Josh: And it would have an image that was
very innocuous,

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:17.490
very kind of nonthreatening.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.780
And what's less threatening
than apple pie unless you're allergic to apples.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.410
&gt;&gt;Chris: And so, there would be the apple
pie and then inside of

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.750
it would be all this spy data and then at
the very end of

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.720
it you would close it off with the apple pie.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.330
And we did
that for the pilot.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.950
And I don't know if we did it ever
again.

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.940
I don't know if we need that.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.940
&gt;&gt; Josh: I think we tried.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.800
I think there's always some weirdly innocuous
image at least in the beginning.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.800
&gt;&gt; Chris: That's right.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.030
At least there was a wall in the
editorial department which was filled with

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.030
these album
covers

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:49.200
&gt;&gt;Josh: --like a puppy, a baby, whatever it
was.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.450
And that
inside that image, the mission was encoded.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.620
And so, when
they're flashing, like Chris was saying, they're

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.080
opening the album cover and
playing the contents of the album which was

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:59.080
the mission.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.530
&gt;&gt; Chris: Which would all link up to what
was downloaded in

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.770
Chuck's head in the pilot episode.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.430
But once we got into
the spy abilities everything changed.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.120
We came up with a
different format for that.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.710
So that was the original
idea.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.500
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: And in terms of names for
episodes does that come

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.500
early in the process?

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.500
How do you choose?

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.960
&gt;&gt;Josh: I think Chris named the first episode
Chuck versus the

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.270
Helicopter.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.800
And then after that it was like let's just
go with

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.900
versus, every week.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.919
So it became, it's always Chuck versus something.

00:25:26.919 --> 00:25:27.919
&gt;&gt; Chris: That's right.

00:25:27.919 --> 00:25:28.919
&gt;&gt; Josh: At the out set.

00:25:28.919 --> 00:25:32.220
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: And one final question
I had on the plot is,

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:34.930
especially with the episodes in Chuck versus
the Baby

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:38.480
when some of the pre-story the origin story
of Chuck

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.600
shifted a little bit in terms of Sarah's involvement
and Bryce Larkin so forth.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:49.010
Looking back in the series what's the
role for free will in the show like was Chuck

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.010
chosen?

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.600
&gt;&gt; Josh: We've debated that a lot.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:58.810
Once you found out that,
you know, that his father had kind of, you

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.040
know, built it
for him and was kind of searching for him

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.690
and he was
searching for his dad without knowing it and

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.260
that he had
downloaded once when he was a child we definitely

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.950
had a lot of
debates about free will and was he selected.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.710
Was he Luke Skywalker or was he Spiderman,
like Peter Parker.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.510
Was he bitten by a random spider or was he
always meant to be a hero?

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.700
&gt;&gt;Chris: I think that for us especially going
into the show we

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.130
started as a Peter Parker story.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.060
We started as the guy
there was a mistake.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.940
The first versions of the pitch
it's like Bryce Larkin was trying to send

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.559
an e-mail to really
important spies.

00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:33.940
&gt;&gt; Josh: The CIA but instead he was one letter
short.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.270
So it
went to Chuck.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.230
Chuck was right above CIA in his smart
phone.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.490
&gt;&gt; Chris: But I think as the show went on
I think the mythology

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.760
we wanted to build up the family story because
we found

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.100
it was really a family story.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.850
So we began to build it
along the lines of Luke Skywalker as opposed

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.680
to Peter
Parker there would be that the family would

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.990
have been in
some ways tangentially related to the spy

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.660
world and that
Chuck would be discovering more.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.690
That was a realization
of the first six episodes from the pilot on.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.960
We were
kind of seeing that there was going to be

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.960
a darker, deeper
world there.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.590
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Yeah, and even when the
decision comes to either kick

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.160
ass or save your family, Chuck's going to
save his family.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.160
&gt;&gt;Josh: Every time.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:16.960
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: That's pretty I think one
of the best messages of the

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.960
show.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.960
&gt;&gt; Josh: Always save your family.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.720
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Josh: And then kick ass.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.610
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Does the show match what
you initially envisioned as

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.750
well when you first cast the pilot to writing
the final

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:32.120
episode, has your thoughts on the show changed.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.581
&gt;&gt; Josh: Well, I think as Chris was saying
one of the great

00:27:34.581 --> 00:27:37.990
things about television is you have the opportunity
to

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.430
continue to explore characters.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.650
So obviously in your
head the pilot is a movie.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:43.860
You want the movie to succeed well
enough to have a sequel.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.790
You actually want 100
sequels -- that's the goal.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.900
[laughter] And, but as you start to get
to know your actors better and you start to

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.480
kind of know
their voices and you know things evolve.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.930
And I think
there's just a natural evolution to how the

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:58.930
series goes.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:01.190
So I feel like it's still very true to where
we started

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:04.180
but yet it's kind of had all these great offshoots
and

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:09.160
tangents and characters that seem like supporting
characters getting huge storylines of their

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.540
own.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.690
Romances failing and coming together.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.050
John Casey's got a daughter and Morgan's dating
her.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:18.180
Those are things that you know
are possibilities when you're first planting

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.660
those seeds
during the pilot but you really need to be

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.070
able to have
enough episodes to be able to let all that

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.070
stuff grow
evolve.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:27.900
&gt;&gt; Chris: I think there are certain things
-- certain pillars --

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.850
we want to get to throughout the show.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:32.380
One we wanted to
give Chuck's abilities at the end of season

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.380
2.

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.830
And then
this was also a thing which was metamorphosis

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.400
we wanted
to build the team.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:40.590
We kind of had in idea of Carmichael Industries
at the end of season 3 that we wanted to put

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.280
into a motley team that would go out and get
into

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.280
trouble.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.280
And we liked that idea.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.170
So bringing people
into the spy world was kind of a part of it.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.600
You're
right -- it's like discovery.

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.050
It's kind of like there's
a certain point when you're sitting in the

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.780
editing bay
and we're just like we got it.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.360
We have to explore that more.

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.090
We have to figure out
that episode is.

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.990
And that's something you just don't know
until you see it.

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.860
&gt;&gt; Josh: Anybody who tells you who's done
a television show "I

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.570
had the entire series in my head" from the
pilot is lying.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:01.570
Because you
can't.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.270
Because there's just so many things you don't
know.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.000
Characters are going to take off that you
didn't

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
expect.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.230
Other characters you thought were, don't.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.101
You lose an
actor because they're a recurring guest star.

00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:12.410
Or they get
booked on another show.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.620
Whatever -- there's so many
variables in the life of a series you have

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.230
to be able to
be flexible and run with what's working and

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.590
cut what's
not and make do if you lose somebody.

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.550
&gt;&gt;Chris: We have an actor, Mekenna Melvin,
that plays John Casey's daughter on

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:25.550
the show.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.860
And the first episode that she appears in
she

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.860
has one line.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.120
She was cast off the line "dad"!.

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.670
&gt;&gt; Josh: That's a good reading.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:34.850
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Chris: Thank you very much.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.750
There's a point where the actors
actually act out the entire show.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.710
It's not a pretty
thing -- the writers.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.470
But when she was cast off that one
line.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.470
When we brought her back into the show we
knew

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:47.670
that she was a very gifted actress but we
didn't know how

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:48.670
it's going to work out.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.920
And it was one of those great
discoveries that she's fantastic.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.920
She's not only
fantastic with Josh Gomez, but she has a great

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.640
relationship with her dad.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:00.310
That's something that's
discovery this is an actor that we want to

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.310
write to.

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.820
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: And G 38 had a follow up
question.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.450
&gt;&gt;Josh: I like your, [inaudible], G 38.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.840
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: We only select the best
here on YouTube moderator.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.770
Chris are you going to continue to cast on
the Scott Krinsky and

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.090
whatever future projects you do.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.300
&gt;&gt;Chris: I very much hope so.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.010
&gt;&gt; Josh: By the way can I tell the Scott Krinsky
story?

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.500
&gt;&gt;Chris: Please
&gt;&gt;Josh: Because I feel like, -- no offense

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.570
to what's his name G, 38--.

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.570
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: G 38
&gt;&gt;Josh: I'd like to take credit for Scott

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.830
Krinsky if I may.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.930
In the OC --
the second to last episode, the show right

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.910
before Chuck was the show the OC, Scott Krinsky
played a

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.940
homeless man.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.890
He actually showed up before Thanksgiving.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.140
Summer Roberts became very altruistic decided
she was going to

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.290
homeless people come to the Cohen house for
Thanksgiving.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.080
Scott
was amongst the homeless; I don't even know

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.310
if he had a line.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:42.550
And you just look at that man's
face and you're like that man is a star.

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:45.300
In the
penultimate episode of the OC, there's a big

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.340
earthquake that hits Orange County.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.610
Ryan Atwood is injured.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:50.090
Seth Cohen
needs a car.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:51.650
And their car breaks down.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:55.140
He trades â€“ Seth
Cohen runs into Scott Krinsky as homeless

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.420
man with a shopping cart and
trades him the Cohen Range Rover for the shopping

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.240
cart so he can
push Ryan to the hospital.

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240
Okay.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.190
Scott Krinsky ended up
with the Cohen Range Rover.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.140
And then, when we were
casting the pilot, we had this -- again, they

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.810
weren't big parts and I said
to Chris I got a guy.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.490
When you see his face you're going
to know this man is a star.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.240
And I think you fell in love
almost as instantly.

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.540
&gt;&gt; Chris: Ah, it's an amazing face.

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.930
There's also a scene in the pilot where he
has to

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.930
wink.

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.060
He winks at Chuck and it's the strangest wink
that I've ever seen.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.370
&gt;&gt;Josh: It was one eye if and then the other.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:27.100
Very slow like
he was having a stroke.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.470
&gt;&gt; Chris: It was an amazing wink.

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.830
So we were just like we had a
little bit of gold there.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.720
He's a great guy to work with.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.330
He's so much fun to write to.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.130
&gt;&gt; Josh: And replicated in the Buy More unveil.

00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:37.480
&gt;&gt;Chris: Exactly, yes.

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.840
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: So how do you keep track

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.300
of all the callbacks in the
series.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.090
These recurring themes of sizzling shrimp
and Eiffel Tower.

00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:51.380
Is there this huge dossier in your
studio waiting for little chestnuts to draw

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.380
out.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.600
&gt;&gt;Chris: You mean callbacks to previous episodes
and stuff like

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.600
that.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.600
Like little homages.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.050
&gt;&gt;Chris: So sizzling shrimp was something
that that was a early

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.050
episode.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.050
It was a very challenging episode.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:02.980
I think it
was one of the first episodes that we thought

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:04.190
we didn't
have enough show.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.630
&gt;&gt; Josh: We also had a bad guy who was in
a wheelchair which we found

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.070
very early on was not that intimidating.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.300
[laughter] He wasn't going to
do a lot of damage.

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.910
He was in Big Trouble with Little China.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.300
We were excited about that.

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.300
That actor.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:15.300
&gt;&gt; Chris: Right, right.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.590
But so definitely we also brought it
back with the menu and whatnot.

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:22.800
I think once you have your
ninety-first episode you've built up a lot

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.900
of references
to your own show.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.570
And so, you guys were kind of working
on the finale.

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:30.480
The finale is going to be designed as a
love letter to people who love the show.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.650
And so,
there's going to be references to things we

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.300
haven't seen
in awhile.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.830
And that's a fun part for us.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.690
Also I think
that, if there's ever a chance to build out

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:39.770
the world of
your show.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:41.730
We weirdly built a show world.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:45.160
It's got its
own set of spies, its own box store in the

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.160
Buy More.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.160
And

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.160
&gt;&gt;Josh: There's the Large
Mart.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160
There's the Buy More Beverly hills.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.130
There's all
this stuff that's the mythology of the show.

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:54.720
&gt;&gt;Chris: And next week's
episode is our bullet train episode.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.370
We also have this
whole sequence that plays in the Buy More

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.370
parking lot.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:00.780
We shot it on the lot which of course looks
like a lot.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.220
So our viz effects guy we have an amazing
team.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:06.040
They go
in and they add the store signs in the background.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.220
So for this episode, we're kind of
sitting there imagining the

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.900
Large Mart sign should be here.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.480
It's a weird thing you
kind of know where those things are even though

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.650
we never
actually gone there.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:17.080
You know the Large Mart is two
stores down from the Buy More.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.564
&gt;&gt;Josh: Underpants Etcetera is right next
to it.

00:33:18.564 --> 00:33:20.940
&gt;&gt;Chris: Exactly so we had to build up all
the backs of those

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.940
signs.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:22.940
That was a fun part.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:26.500
I'm glad in a weird way this is the very nerdiest
side of me we're building out that side of

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.500
the show.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:32.400
It's
kind of like the spaceship in the what's -- Galaxy

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.320
Quest
where somebody actually knows where the engine

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.320
room is.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.160
In the spaceship it's actually fun we've been
behind the

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.549
Large Mart sign in the Buy More Complex.

00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:42.860
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Cool, cool.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.620
And you've also had quite a litany of
guest directors as well from Zach himself

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.000
to Robert Duncan McNeill.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.820
&gt;&gt;Josh: He's our resident director.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.790
He's been our producing
director on the show for five years.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:57.320
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Any anecdotes from working
with such a diverse crew

00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320
or?

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.320
Different styles that they bring.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.640
&gt;&gt; Josh: I mean, the show is very director
driven.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.250
Every
director that comes -- it's a very hard show.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.770
Other
directors who have worked on the show calls

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.120
it a director
killer, because you don't have.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.019
You have 7 days, you're doing
action, you're doing comedy, you're doing

00:34:11.019 --> 00:34:14.999
romance, you're
doing, you know, coming of age stories with

00:34:14.999 --> 00:34:16.069
real emotion.

00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:18.820
There's always a sci-fi element at times.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:20.869
So it's a really
tricky show.

00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:25.519
And I think the directors that really
worked for the show were people that really

00:34:25.519 --> 00:34:26.780
were able to
blend all of those genres.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.470
&gt;&gt; Chris: It's kind of like the writers, too,
on our shows.

00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:33.220
The
people that enjoyed comedy and genre.

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.280
You couldn't be
one or the other.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.690
You couldn't be hard sci-fi on our
show and also enjoy it.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:38.690
You had to be both.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.270
You had to
enjoy both sides of it.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.889
You had to enjoy the comedy as
well.

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.950
I think for guys like Robert who came from
the

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.730
sci-fi side, he really enjoyed the character
and the

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:47.730
drama side.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:48.730
He enjoyed the comedy too.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.210
&gt;&gt; Josh: And he directed like the Samantha
Who?

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.210
pilot.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:52.589
He done a lot of
directing in comedies before.

00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:57.089
We found we did better if we
had to choose guys who had comedy background

00:34:57.089 --> 00:34:59.390
tended to be
better fits for the show tonally than people

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:04.150
who had done
CSI Palm Springs, because they just had like

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.520
those
guys -- it's a little bit more of a straight

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520
ahead.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.980
And
this show was never straight ahead.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.130
&gt;&gt; Chris: Guys like Jay Chandrasekhar from
Broken Lizard.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.549
Those are really
important directors to us.

00:35:15.549 --> 00:35:17.099
Jeremiah Chechik.

00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:18.660
Jason Ensler.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:22.180
And I think that -- but it
was a show that we depended on our directors

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.180
to make it
cool.

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.881
I think a lot of shows have a house style
and you

00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:27.730
know what that show is going to look like.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:28.839
For the most
part looked the same.

00:35:28.839 --> 00:35:34.950
We would always go to our directors, "we want
this to be the Muay Thai episode and they're

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:35.950
like what the
hell is that."

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.190
It has to be cool this way.

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:38.950
Or if we're going
to do like a Murder on the Orient Express

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:42.450
type episode we
want the train to be -- to evoke those old

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:43.700
movies we
love.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:44.730
The lady vanishes.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.809
So we really looked to our
directors to make it cool.

00:35:47.809 --> 00:35:49.700
We were kind of
annoying in that way.

00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:50.700
Make it hot or make it cool.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.700
You
know?

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.700
And yeah â€“

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:57.059
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: We have question from Patricio
Rose in New York City.

00:35:57.059 --> 00:36:02.610
If you had no budgetary limits, no scheduling
issues in

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.779
[laughter] this ultimate world what's one
story that you would have

00:36:04.779 --> 00:36:08.499
loved to write for Team Bartowski besides
Jeff and Lester on the lam

00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:10.089
which in itself is kind of cool.

00:36:10.089 --> 00:36:11.089
&gt;&gt; Josh: Yeah.

00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:12.160
I guess we implied that story.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.789
&gt;&gt;Chris: We implied a
lot of stories.

00:36:13.789 --> 00:36:16.339
&gt;&gt; Josh: There's a lot that happened off camera.

00:36:16.339 --> 00:36:18.099
It's very
theatrical that way.

00:36:18.099 --> 00:36:21.700
There's always been a big action
sequence happening just off camera.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.700
Oh please.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.700
&gt;&gt; Josh: No you go.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.630
&gt;&gt; Chris: For the longest time we wanted to
do a ComiCon.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.160
We
never could get the timing to work out because

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.180
ComiCon would actually let us in before they
allow people to film there.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:37.059
But we wanted to do a ComiCon
episode where we had something like another

00:36:37.059 --> 00:36:42.039
show Chuck and him and Morgan
having a mission there but also having other

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:43.829
shows that
they're interacting with.

00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:47.619
We love the idea of
them being up on the stage as well as kind

00:36:47.619 --> 00:36:48.770
of doing a spy
story.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:52.790
&gt;&gt; Josh: I think, you know, for so often when
you go and you do

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.951
like Chuck goes to Paris or Chuck goes to
Rome and he

00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:57.799
goes to the parking garage.

00:36:57.799 --> 00:37:01.410
Or he goes to the basement
holding court.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:02.410
&gt;&gt; Chris: Berlin alley.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:04.359
&gt;&gt; Josh: The alley in Berlin.

00:37:04.359 --> 00:37:05.480
The basement in ZÃ¼rich.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.420
So I
think to actually be able to go to one of

00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.420
those exotic
locales and shoot there as opposed to shooting

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:15.450
in a
basement of a torture chamber allegedly set

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.509
there would
have been nice.

00:37:16.509 --> 00:37:17.640
That little atmosphere.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:20.250
&gt;&gt; Chris: The travel on the show would be
super-cool.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:21.400
In the
future.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.400
&gt;&gt; Josh: Chuck the Movie.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.400
&gt;&gt; Chris: Chuck the Movie.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.400
Yes.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.019
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Versus the silver screen.

00:37:27.019 --> 00:37:28.359
I like it.

00:37:28.359 --> 00:37:30.710
&gt;&gt; Josh: Chuck versus the unlimited budget.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.529
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: And looking at the finale,

00:37:33.529 --> 00:37:34.529
too.

00:37:34.529 --> 00:37:38.230
To a certain extent
this is kind of like your third chance of

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.230
writing a
series finale.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:41.990
&gt;&gt;Josh: It might be more than that
&gt;&gt; Chris: Hopefully we'll get it right this

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.990
time.

00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.150
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Yeah, I was gonna say
&gt;&gt;Josh: There's been

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.670
several series finales and the show has been
lucky enough to stay alive.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:50.019
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: And we're proud of it.

00:37:50.019 --> 00:37:51.309
Have you approached this one differently?

00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:54.549
Were there
any things that you learned from the cliff

00:37:54.549 --> 00:37:57.900
hangers in
your final seasons like your season 4, for

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.900
example.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.200
&gt;&gt;Josh: Chris, you wrote it.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:01.250
It's not a cliff hanger you
should say that.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:02.250
&gt;&gt;Chris: It's not a cliff hanger.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:06.890
I think the biggest thing we
learned going to this season is we want to

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.010
do an ending.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.319
&gt;&gt; Josh: We knew we were told emphatically
this is it, guys.

00:38:11.319 --> 00:38:13.150
We know
we told you that every year, but this is really

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.150
it.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.150
We're done.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:16.150
&gt;&gt;Chris: We were picked up and canceled in
the same

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.050
moment which is good in the sense we knew
we were going

00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:21.140
to be writing the final chapter.

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.130
So when we sat down to
think about the ending, we really wanted this

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.300
to be a
final moment for the show.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:32.309
In seasons, past Josh and I we
like endings that imply a great exciting next

00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:33.309
chapter.

00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:35.540
&gt;&gt; Josh: We ended the season 2 finale with
the words to be

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.820
continued and we had no idea if that was actually
true.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.670
&gt;&gt; Chris: That was really a good chance we
were not coming back.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:42.700
So that was kind of ballsy.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.609
This would be a different
type ending and I think we definitely wanted

00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:50.270
to structure
it in such a way that we haven't seen this

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:51.420
ending on a
Chuck show.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.829
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Cool.

00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:54.869
And then, what was the final day of filming
like?

00:38:54.869 --> 00:38:57.210
Were you surprised at things that made it
and

00:38:57.210 --> 00:39:00.750
didn't make it on the cutting room floor.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.710
&gt;&gt; Chris: It's amazing.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.430
Josh missed the final but he had a
amazing excuse.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.089
&gt;&gt;Josh: My wife's and my first child was born
on the last day of

00:39:10.089 --> 00:39:11.089
Chuck.

00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:14.359
She was literally born an hour before they
wrapped.

00:39:14.359 --> 00:39:15.710
&gt;&gt; Chris: The facts incredible.

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.470
Because we were on-set.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.019
It's
like the middle of the night and you know

00:39:20.019 --> 00:39:21.910
we do the last
shot and it's very nice.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.140
Kind of when you're on a film
set.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.859
It's kind of nautical, that's not the right
word, but it's very procedural in

00:39:26.859 --> 00:39:29.570
the sense that everybody has very specific
jobs so when

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.670
we wrap an episode when we wrap a character
the assistant

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:37.779
director announces that and he always does
that.

00:39:37.779 --> 00:39:40.640
So as
we were kind of moving in on the final moments

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.331
of the
show, you know, it's the AD and the director

00:39:43.331 --> 00:39:45.200
and myself and how
do we handle it.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.380
And the AD will say this.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:48.210
And the
director will say this and then I will say

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:49.430
something to
the cast.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:53.329
And this is the procedure and it's the way
it's been done for ages.

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:54.700
And it was amazing in that
moment.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.480
As I was going up to say thank you to the
cast.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.540
It was a quiet moment in our castle set.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.540
The crews were around.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.540
We all
kind of gingerly.

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:01.869
We're all just talking to each other.

00:40:01.869 --> 00:40:05.240
I'm thanking the cast and
I get an e-mail from Josh saying thank you

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.999
for the show.

00:40:06.999 --> 00:40:08.069
It's been an amazing run.

00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:11.559
And I'd also like to announce
the birth of Josh's daughter.

00:40:11.559 --> 00:40:14.230
It was just a
amazing wonderful moment of things.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:17.670
In some ways the Chuck show
has been a an incredibly tough process.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.390
We never know
when we're going to be canceled.

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:21.299
And we've been lucky to
survive.

00:40:21.299 --> 00:40:23.259
And I think that those wonderful warm little
moments

00:40:23.259 --> 00:40:25.960
it was an amazing 5 years and I couldn't imagine
a better

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.300
way to top it.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.310
&gt;&gt;Josh: Me either.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.660
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: And do you think there's

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:35.390
room for a Chuck extended
universe like comics or a Jeffster CD

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:39.380
&gt;&gt; Josh: Jeffster's Greatest Hits, for sure
you'll see on like 3 in the morning after

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.890
like some sort of ab roller or ads.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:48.019
I think we did a mini
run comic book at one point early in the show.

00:40:48.019 --> 00:40:49.960
&gt;&gt; Chris: It was Chuck the movie.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:56.130
Which actually we had pretty
much President Obama as the kidnapped person

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:57.130
even though.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.130
&gt;&gt; Josh: In the comic book.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:00.411
&gt;&gt; Chris: Even though he hadn't -- he wasn't
even nominated yet.

00:41:00.411 --> 00:41:03.930
That was a lot of fun.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:07.549
So yes -- I think we'd certainly
be open to the idea of an expanded universe

00:41:07.549 --> 00:41:09.830
and the idea
there's people who would like to write fan

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.989
fiction about
Chuck is great.

00:41:11.989 --> 00:41:14.349
&gt;&gt; Josh: And hopefully ten years somebody
will watch the show

00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:16.539
will come down and say I got a great idea
for a movie.

00:41:16.539 --> 00:41:20.279
That will be a nostalgia factor we'll wheel
ourselves up

00:41:20.279 --> 00:41:21.279
and put in our teeth.

00:41:21.279 --> 00:41:22.279
&gt;&gt; Chris: How old are we?

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:23.279
&gt;&gt;Josh: I don't know.

00:41:23.279 --> 00:41:24.609
We're going to age badly is what I'm
implying.

00:41:24.609 --> 00:41:28.099
[laughing]
&gt;&gt; Josh: Ten years we'll be 112.

00:41:28.099 --> 00:41:30.599
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Some time delay.

00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:34.170
And of course if Jeffster wants to lay
down some tracks in Google music and that

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:35.909
sort of cuts
the distribution angle.

00:41:35.909 --> 00:41:38.970
&gt;&gt; Josh: Wow, so everybody could have a piece
of those

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.119
nonprofits that we're not going to make.

00:41:41.119 --> 00:41:44.829
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: What do you think the legacy
of Chuck is going to be

00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:48.220
for future shows and for your own work?

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.000
&gt;&gt; Josh: I think, I mean, Chuck is a true
-- it gets harder and

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.970
harder and you guys know that just from seeing
what's on

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:54.970
TV.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.589
It's harder and harder to make something that
is truly original

00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:58.809
that's not already on TV, that's not based
on a comic book

00:41:58.809 --> 00:42:00.819
or based on something that existed before.

00:42:00.819 --> 00:42:03.800
And I think
what I'm really proud of about the show is

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.999
it was truly
something origin.

00:42:04.999 --> 00:42:08.300
It wasn't something that had been on
the air before.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:13.960
It was a brand new kind of collision of
genres and turned into something that took

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.749
a lot of
things that we certainly loved growing up

00:42:15.749 --> 00:42:19.099
and fused it
into something new.

00:42:19.099 --> 00:42:23.079
I think for people who ever felt
like an underdog, an outsider, there's a real

00:42:23.079 --> 00:42:24.079
legacy
there.

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:25.250
He was a real hero for people.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.520
To connect with
about the possibility for fulfilling your

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.520
potential.

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.200
I
think the relationship that the show had with

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.299
the fans is
also definitely part of its legacy and part

00:42:35.299 --> 00:42:36.700
of its DNA.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:40.009
And so, those are three things I can think
of I'm very

00:42:40.009 --> 00:42:41.359
very proud of with the show.

00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:43.579
&gt;&gt; Chris: And I think we're always amazed
when we're sitting in

00:42:43.579 --> 00:42:47.069
the edit bay working on the show and it's
so unique.

00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:52.710
The mash up
of -- you know, Josh brings amazing music

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:53.799
to the show.

00:42:53.799 --> 00:42:57.099
And I think that it's such an incredible mash
up of music and

00:42:57.099 --> 00:43:02.549
movies and TV and references that sometimes
we think it's

00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:04.780
like we'll be lucky if they ever let us do
this again on

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.309
this scale.

00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:11.589
So it's been a challenge, but it's been an
incredible opportunity to kind of smush all

00:43:11.589 --> 00:43:13.019
these things
together and see what you get.

00:43:13.019 --> 00:43:16.190
It started off like we
love shows from the 80s.

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:19.589
We love shows kind of classic television
shows like Quantum Leap and Magnum PI and

00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:20.940
things we grew
up on.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.599
This is a mash up of those things kind of
wholly

00:43:23.599 --> 00:43:26.189
unique in a way especially in what it's trying
to do.

00:43:26.189 --> 00:43:28.269
&gt;&gt; Josh: You know also Chris and I knew each
other from

00:43:28.269 --> 00:43:29.269
college.

00:43:29.269 --> 00:43:30.269
We never really worked together.

00:43:30.269 --> 00:43:32.239
And so, to
have the opportunity to work together is also

00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:36.150
something
that I really glad and grateful to have the

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:37.150
experience to
do.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:38.820
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: Cool, are you guys planning
to work together in the

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.820
future.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.820
&gt;&gt; Josh: We sure are.

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:41.950
&gt;&gt;Chris: We very much hope so.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:46.109
I think that's also something I didn't know
how to

00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:47.190
write a TV show.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:52.089
It's like when Josh and I first sat
down I worked on features and those types

00:43:52.089 --> 00:43:53.089
of stories.

00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:54.839
I
think the amazing opportunity to work for

00:43:54.839 --> 00:43:57.930
Josh allowed me
to kind of -- how do you write a big story?

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:02.489
How do you
write this crazy 91 chapters of some giant

00:44:02.489 --> 00:44:04.109
weird novel called the
Chuck show?

00:44:04.109 --> 00:44:05.780
Giant weird novel.

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.460
That was great.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.569
Cut
that.

00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:13.380
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: I think we have some time
for a few Googler questions

00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:14.670
if there's any here in the audience.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:17.220
We have a
microphone that we're passing around.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.359
That way you can
be on the.

00:44:20.359 --> 00:44:23.420
&gt;&gt;Male #3: First I just wanted to say thank
you for a really

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.119
entertaining five years.

00:44:25.119 --> 00:44:29.609
My wife and I kind of find it
the most fun hour that we have with television

00:44:29.609 --> 00:44:30.609
each week.

00:44:30.609 --> 00:44:33.499
&gt;&gt;Josh: I would also say that we hear that
a lot from people.

00:44:33.499 --> 00:44:34.499
It's fun.

00:44:34.499 --> 00:44:39.410
It's an hour they can put on TV and enjoy
themselves have a smile on their face.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:40.960
Families are able
to watch it together.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.700
Stuff's falling out of my pocket.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.450
And I think that's also something that we're
really proud

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.099
of for the show.

00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:47.910
&gt;&gt; Male #3: It's been really fun.

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:51.150
I participated in the whole
Subway thing.

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:55.749
[inaudible] So my question is with the, you
know, I'm

00:44:55.749 --> 00:44:58.599
really glad that you guys got a chance to
know this is

00:44:58.599 --> 00:44:59.650
the ending this season.

00:44:59.650 --> 00:45:01.540
Because I think you do finales
really well.

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:02.829
And I've very excited to see

00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:04.609
&gt;&gt;Josh: And every 13 episodes we do one.

00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:05.609
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Right.

00:45:05.609 --> 00:45:07.700
So, but with that, you know, you've talked
a

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.470
lot about the character development and I
think that's

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.349
been a huge strength of the show and why it's
so fun.

00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:16.800
But you know
having to wonder if you're going to be canceled

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.310
any
moment, with the character development that

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:23.570
you want to
do are there any real pacing challenges that

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:27.410
you've had
to deal with because you're not sure if you're

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:29.829
going to
be around next week and then all of a sudden

00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:31.730
you found
out you had a reprieve.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:32.730
&gt;&gt;Josh: 100 percent.

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:36.200
Chris is the guy who's living and
breathing in that writer's room and generating

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.200
stories.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.230
And I remember like being able to walk into
his office

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.490
after they broke in episode 13 "great news
Chris, we just

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:42.490
got 11 more."

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.680
And him being like we got what?

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:47.259
[laughter] So you're
excited because your show is being picked

00:45:47.259 --> 00:45:49.059
up and you're
going to get to make more episodes, but you

00:45:49.059 --> 00:45:52.180
just came up
with the most amazing finale ever.

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.529
And now you got to
figure out how to have that be like a really

00:45:54.529 --> 00:45:56.579
good episode
in the middle of the season and do like 11

00:45:56.579 --> 00:45:57.579
more.

00:45:57.579 --> 00:45:58.579
&gt;&gt; Chris: What happens next?

00:45:58.579 --> 00:45:59.579
Yeah.

00:45:59.579 --> 00:46:00.859
&gt;&gt; Josh: So it does.

00:46:00.859 --> 00:46:04.150
I mean, I think part of what's always
driven show is this idea we don't want to

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:05.519
leave anything
on the table.

00:46:05.519 --> 00:46:08.550
So there have been a lot of major plot
developments that have happened whether it's

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:10.539
people finding
out about Chuck's secret.

00:46:10.539 --> 00:46:12.660
Obviously Chuck and Sarah got together near
the

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.660
end of season 2.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.390
If we had known going into it that
season 3 was a lock, do you do that then?

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:18.390
I don't know.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.390
I'm glad we did it.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.130
It made for a really great episode.

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:26.519
But certainly it does inspire you to make
sure that,

00:46:26.519 --> 00:46:29.430
"okay, what are some really major things we
know -- this

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.849
is it if we're walking off the court after
this, what do

00:46:32.849 --> 00:46:34.349
we have that we've got to do right now?"

00:46:34.349 --> 00:46:37.329
&gt;&gt; Chris: Yeah, I mean going back to season
one, we knew from

00:46:37.329 --> 00:46:39.480
the get-go that we were going to bring Bryce
Larkin back.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:42.609
We knew we were going have that story kind
of pop back in, but to bring Chuck and Sarah

00:46:42.609 --> 00:46:44.400
back
especially with that relationship that part

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.710
we knew we
were going to do that.

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:48.009
But I don't think anybody thought
there was going to be an episode 7.

00:46:48.009 --> 00:46:50.180
We waited 7 episodes
and we brought him back.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.529
We thought that would have
been.

00:46:51.529 --> 00:46:53.739
We realized early on especially in this day
and

00:46:53.739 --> 00:46:55.990
age you got to keep telling the story.

00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:59.510
&gt;&gt; Josh: You can't keep repeating the pilot
over and over.

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:02.950
&gt;&gt; Chris: It works for some shows but for
us we knew we had

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.130
to -- people were looking for mythology.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:07.769
When we got to
episode 6 and we went to back to Stanford

00:47:07.769 --> 00:47:10.599
there was a
real hunger for learning more about these

00:47:10.599 --> 00:47:11.599
characters.

00:47:11.599 --> 00:47:12.609
And I think at that point we were kind of
realizing it

00:47:12.609 --> 00:47:14.839
wasn't a show that was just going to be episodes.

00:47:14.839 --> 00:47:17.089
There
had to be a mythology.

00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:18.259
&gt;&gt; Josh: Yeah.

00:47:18.259 --> 00:47:22.710
I mean, the irony of season 1 was the one
season where we didn't get to do everything

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.400
we wanted to
because of the writer's strike.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:29.049
So that was for us a
good lesson of, like, leave nothing behind.

00:47:29.049 --> 00:47:31.039
Leave nothing
behind.

00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:34.359
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Any other questions?.

00:47:34.359 --> 00:47:38.220
&gt;&gt; Male #4: So you were talking about how
the relationships are

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.289
really important.

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:44.150
And I know one of the reasons I really
enjoy the show is the family stuff that keeps

00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:45.150
coming in.

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:48.390
And that's another way I keep liking these
-- as it keeps

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.749
going you kind of introduce new family.

00:47:50.749 --> 00:47:52.299
I thought that
was really good.

00:47:52.299 --> 00:47:54.559
&gt;&gt;Josh: Season 6 would have been Chuck's uncle.

00:47:54.559 --> 00:47:55.559
Incredible.

00:47:55.559 --> 00:47:56.559
&gt;&gt; Chris: We actually had an uncle for awhile.

00:47:56.559 --> 00:47:58.950
&gt;&gt; Male #4: I actually was having trouble
coming up with a

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:00.529
question here.

00:48:00.529 --> 00:48:02.430
&gt;&gt; Chris: Compliments are fine too.

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:03.430
We'll take those.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:05.169
&gt;&gt; Josh: But we actually need those.

00:48:05.169 --> 00:48:06.430
&gt;&gt; Chris: I guess.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:07.430
Yeah..

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:10.650
&gt;&gt;Josh: No, it's always been big for us knowing
that Chuck's

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:13.170
mom was going to come into the show.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:15.190
We pitched that to
NBC.

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:16.190
You can't cancel us.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.170
Chuck's mom is coming and
we're going to get Madonna.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.080
[laughter] And they're
like Madonna?

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.080
Great.

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.080
You're picked up.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.080
And we're
like, "oh, shit.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.080
How do we do that?"

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.869
And then,
obviously getting Linda Hamilton and somebody

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:30.269
who, again,
movies that we grew up on part of the mythology.

00:48:30.269 --> 00:48:32.339
We knew
our fans grew occupy on that.

00:48:32.339 --> 00:48:36.790
Who better represents the
like, the mother of all, you know, summer

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:39.890
movie
franchises block busters than Sarah Connor.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:43.640
When we first
leaked that in comic on Chuck's mom is coming,

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:47.039
we were
like this is the little clip of her from Terminator

00:48:47.039 --> 00:48:48.039
2
turning around.

00:48:48.039 --> 00:48:49.039
It was just like for a second.

00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:51.070
The
place went bananas.

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.960
And that was really fun.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.660
And NBC
was like great -- where's Madonna?

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.459
Season 6 ma Donna.

00:48:56.459 --> 00:48:59.970
&gt;&gt; Chis: I think just going off that.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:03.630
The TV show especially
like Chuck even if it's not moms and dads,

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:05.900
there really
is a family, especially after.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.239
&gt;&gt; Josh: Every show is about family.

00:49:07.239 --> 00:49:09.979
&gt;&gt; Chris: Every show is about family and people
become a family

00:49:09.979 --> 00:49:10.979
unit.

00:49:10.979 --> 00:49:11.979
And I think that's what we loved about Chuck.

00:49:11.979 --> 00:49:16.690
A lot of our favorite shows especially
sitcoms be it the Office or Cheers, much more

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.800
successful shows
than what we've done.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.500
They're really about families.

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.760
They're really about people coming kind of
creating their

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:26.010
families these small units.

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:27.310
That's a great thing to
write.

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:30.130
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: We have time for one final
question.

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:32.149
&gt;&gt; Chris: All right.

00:49:32.149 --> 00:49:34.849
&gt;&gt; Male #5: All right.

00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:38.950
Mine's kind of trivial, but it's my
favorite thing I think from the show.

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:43.980
Who is responsible
for all of the Spies like Us references like

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:49.359
did GLG-20
Listening Device and the Emmett Milbarge those

00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:50.579
types of things.

00:49:50.579 --> 00:49:53.279
&gt;&gt; Josh: Well, look that was -- again, when
you talk about

00:49:53.279 --> 00:49:56.890
movies when we talk about Spies Like Us was
a big one

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.539
because obviously was a spy story it but was
a comedy.

00:49:59.539 --> 00:50:02.880
Chevy chase came on the show as a major villain.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.039
Fletch
also big influence on the show.

00:50:05.039 --> 00:50:08.380
We had a bunch of
writers who shared the same references.

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:13.729
&gt;&gt; Chris: And when we start working on something,
we usually --

00:50:13.729 --> 00:50:15.730
we start talking about like stories and ideas,
but we

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:17.529
also talk about tone.

00:50:17.529 --> 00:50:22.349
And the way we do that is we start
passing back lists of different movies.

00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:27.789
This is part of
what Josh -- it was a really clever idea that

00:50:27.789 --> 00:50:28.789
Josh had.

00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:29.789
We can start passing these movies back and
forth and

00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:32.440
there would be movies we'd take off the list
because they weren't one way or the other,

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.569
they were too dark.

00:50:33.569 --> 00:50:37.170
But Spies Like Us always on the Chuck
list from the get-go.

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:38.460
It was always Spies Like Us.

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.460
There
was always.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.880
&gt;&gt; Josh: North by Northwest.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:42.630
&gt;&gt; Chris: North by Northwest.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:43.630
And.

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:45.000
&gt;&gt; Josh: Which have never been mentioned in
the same sentence

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.490
before until now.

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.829
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Chris: But pretty much the entire John

00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:49.910
Landis cannon.

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:54.640
But
yes, Spies Like Us, incredibly important to

00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.640
the show..

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.640
&gt;&gt; Josh: Good catch.

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:58.900
&gt;&gt;Chris: Emmett Milbarge
&gt;&gt; Josh: Milbarge met a very unfortunate end.

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:01.430
He was shot with Wilson Phillips playing in
the background.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:03.760
We always
talked about bringing Tony Hale's brother

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.760
back.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.380
His twin
brother who was like convinced that Emmett

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.119
Milbarge had
been killed and he would wear an eye patch.

00:51:10.119 --> 00:51:11.819
&gt;&gt; Chris: We wanted to do that.

00:51:11.819 --> 00:51:14.069
&gt;&gt; Josh: Just have Tony Hale in an eye patch.

00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:16.019
&gt;&gt; Chris: Tony Hale is so cool, so great.

00:51:16.019 --> 00:51:20.099
If we really, really like
somebody, we killed them.

00:51:20.099 --> 00:51:22.779
Scott Bakula, Tony Hale.

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:24.599
Just
two amazing actors who were delightful to

00:51:24.599 --> 00:51:25.599
work with.

00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:26.599
Cold blooded.

00:51:26.599 --> 00:51:27.599
We would kill them.

00:51:27.599 --> 00:51:28.599
Shoot them.

00:51:28.599 --> 00:51:29.599
&gt;&gt;Josh: Murdered.

00:51:29.599 --> 00:51:30.599
Murdered.

00:51:30.599 --> 00:51:31.599
That's our legacy.

00:51:31.599 --> 00:51:32.599
&gt;&gt;Chris: That's our legacy.

00:51:32.599 --> 00:51:33.599
&gt;&gt;Josh: If we like you, we kill you.

00:51:33.599 --> 00:51:34.599
&gt;&gt; Chris: If we like you, we kill you.

00:51:34.599 --> 00:51:35.599
&gt;&gt;Chris: If we don't like you, please stick
around.

00:51:35.599 --> 00:51:38.319
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: With that I want to draw
everyone's attention to the

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:41.180
final three episodes of Chuck going on the
next two

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.180
weeks.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:43.180
Then we'll have the --

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.180
&gt;&gt;Josh: Two hour finale.

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.180
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Two hour finale.

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.630
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: Blue ray coming pretty
soon hopefully and then maybe

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:50.099
some sort of box set with complete director
comedy who

00:51:50.099 --> 00:51:51.099
knows.

00:51:51.099 --> 00:51:53.570
&gt;&gt;Josh: We should get on that
&gt;&gt; Chris: I like that.

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:55.890
&gt;&gt; Josh: We'll even use this interview make
it an extra.

00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:56.990
&gt;&gt; Josh: You could be on it.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:52:00.720
&gt;&gt; Male presenter: It would be an interview
within the interview.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.670
So
with that on behalf of Google and on behalf

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:05.400
of the Chuck
fans everywhere thank you for really keeping

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.869
us
entertained for the past five years and thank

00:52:07.869 --> 00:52:09.900
you for
stopping by the nerd herd at Google.

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.289
Thank-you very much.

00:52:11.289 --> 00:52:13.150
&gt;&gt;Josh: Thank-you
&gt;&gt;Chris: Thank-you

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:14.539
&gt;&gt;Josh: Thank-you guys

00:52:14.539 --> 00:52:17.789
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: All right, that's it

00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:19.090
&gt;&gt;Josh: Good stuff
