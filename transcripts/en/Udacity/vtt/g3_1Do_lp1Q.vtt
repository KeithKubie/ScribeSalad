00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.059
Property three is where things get interesting. Okay? It states that each

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:09.160
lower level of refinement, must faithfully represent the level above it.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.660
Okay? But this is going to be a little bit tricky to express, and involves some

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.140
subtleties, we're going to have to get at. It's the most involved of the three

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.880
properties. And, the question one asks is, how exactly can we determine whether

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.220
a level implements the piece that is abstracting it? Before answering that,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.549
let's go back to our example bank account and add a level of, refinement to it.
