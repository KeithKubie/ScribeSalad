00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.040
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.130
Perfect timing.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.090
Let's turn to the
announcements.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.820
You know the big announcement
is Monday,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.110
Celebration Part three.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.610
I think Hilary sent all
of you the coverage.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.110
Just to be clear, start with
defects, amorphous solids,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.820
kinetics, diffusions, solutions,
acids, and bases.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150
No orgo, no polymers.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.180
We'll catch the orgo and the
polymers on the celebration of

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.430
celebrations, the final exam.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.250
OK, so let's get moving.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.440
Last day we started talking
about polymers.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.990
These are macromolecules.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.950
Here we've got an example of a
simple compound with a double

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.610
bond, vinyl chloride.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.650
And by the action of addition
polymerization, we can turn

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.670
this into a macromolecule where
you see a repeat unit.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.960
The double bond has been broken
to allow but carbon to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.970
bond to another vinyl
chloride, and so on.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.530
These are very, very large
molecules, can be on the order

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.690
of microns in length, mass
measured in kilodaltons, or

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.290
thousands of grams per mole.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.270
So today I want to go back
and look a little

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.890
bit at polymer synthesis.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.440
Then we're going to talk about
properties of polymers, and

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.400
end with some cultural
implications that I alluded to

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.510
the very beginning.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.780
So we've already seen how this
reaction begins, but let's see

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.110
how it proceeds.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.230
So here's an example of starting
with an initiation

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.460
reaction that generates this
hydroxyl radical that starts

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.780
from a peroxide.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.560
And then you can see, in this
first instance, the unpaired

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.870
electron attacks the double
bond, breaks the double bond

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.770
links, and then moves that
unpaired electron to the end,

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.300
and so on, and so on.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.450
So here I'm indicating that
we're going to keep attaching,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.430
in this case, ethylenes
to make polyethylene.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.210
And then at some point, we
decide that we've got the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.190
molecule long enough,
and then we have

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.300
to quench the reaction.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.640
So then we add something that
will cap this unpaired

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.140
electron, and this step
is called termination.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.370
So this is how we make the
long-chain molecules by this

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.910
particular reaction.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.880
And the thing to know,
trivially, is that the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.040
composition of the polymer
equals the

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.150
composition of the mer.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.460
You can see it right
here, that I

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.090
start with vinyl chloride.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.510
Yeah, we've changed the double
bond to a single bond, but

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.320
it's still C2H3Cl, C2H3Cl
taken many times.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.280
That's it.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.310
OK.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.200
There's another way
to make polymers.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.120
And this is really important,
not only in commerce, but it's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.890
most important in biology.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.370
We do not have the biological
apparatus to create radicals.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.460
So during the course of this
lecture, we have cell death

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.940
proceeding in all of us,
and cell generation and

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.080
polymerization reactions
occurring, amino acids being

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.160
linked to form proteins
and whatnot.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.530
And that process goes by the
second mechanism, condensation

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.780
polymerization.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.940
And I'll give you a simple
example of that where we start

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.020
with more than one mer, OK?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.670
Involves more than
one mer type.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.830
Typically two, all right?

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.340
So let's look at a reaction.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.590
So this is going to be a first
kind of a mer, and R is just a

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.300
general placeholder the people
use in organic chemistry.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.300
It comes from the word residual,
but it's some giant

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.700
piece of molecular mass, and
there's a hydrogen here.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.420
And this one then reacts with a
second mer, which I'm going

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.010
to designate R2.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.360
And the second mer
has a hydroxyl.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.440
And what happens in condensation
polymerization,

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.000
is that we link R1 to R2.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.190
R1 is now linked to R2
in a covalent manner.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:39.080
And then, we take the hydrogen
and the hydroxyl, and we send

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.580
them over here.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.910
So the hydrogen goes here,
the hydroxyl goes

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.540
here, to form water.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.460
And this is typically conducted,
in industry, not in

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.170
our bodies, but in industry,
it's typically conducted at

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.240
elevated temperatures where this
eventually goes into some

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.490
kind of a condenser.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.590
And then the water condenses
and makes liquid.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.000
And for this step, the
condensation step of the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.810
byproduct of the reaction that
we name the process.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.390
The process isn't named
for what happens here.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.960
It's named for what
happens over here.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.690
So this is condensation
polymerization, and you can

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.900
see, we have covalent linkages
at both ends, and we can add

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.940
another R1H here, and then
another R2OH here, and so on,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.520
and so on, and so on.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.220
So clearly, we're losing
some of the mass of

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.520
the reactants here.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.200
So the mass of the final polymer
is less than the sum

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.080
of the masses of all
of the reagents.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.320
So let's make a note of that.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.770
That the mass of the polymer
formed by condensation

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:01.730
polymerization is less than the
sum of the masses of the

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.180
constituents.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.670
Or let's say reactants,
if we like.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.890
Reactants.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.140
Because we lose the
condensate.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:19.310
And so here's an example
from commerce.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.540
Oh, before I get to that, I
wanted to show you some of the

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.600
common addition polymers,
which ones that you're

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.440
familiar with that are made
by this first process.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.900
So at the top, we have
polyethylene.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.400
That's we started with.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.580
And you know that's used in food
wrap, it's used in milk

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.810
jugs, and so on.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.340
There's the
polytetrafluoroethylene.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.030
You remove the hydrogens, you
put fluorines, and then you

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.190
make Teflon.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.740
So that's also made
by addition.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.635
Polypropylene, also
used as separator.

00:06:48.635 --> 00:06:50.910
In fact, polypropylene
is found in

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.130
every lithium ion battery.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:55.060
It's the separator between the
two electrodes, and it's

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.760
engineered so that its glass
transition temperature is

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.160
about 60, 70 degrees Celsius.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.010
So that if there's some event,
and you start getting thermal

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.050
runaway in your battery, and
the temperature rises to

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.670
whatever, let's say the number
is 70 degrees C, the pores in

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.150
the polypropylene collapse.

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.380
And when they collapse, they
form a barrier, and it kills

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.450
the battery, and prevents the
battery from exploding.

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.550
And that's polypropylene.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.720
There's butyl rubber.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.320
What else do we have?

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.610
Polystyrene, you know, which is
used in these cups and food

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.080
containers.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.920
Orlon, here.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.280
Polyvinyl chloride, which is
used in everything from old

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.180
vinyl phonograph records
to plumbing supplies.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.610
That white PVC tubing that's
used for piping.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.610
Polymethyl methacrylate, this
is plexiglass, which many of

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.170
you are wearing in
your eyeglasses.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.530
That's this material here.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.860
Butadiene, OK.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.140
You see there's the
after-polymerization.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.450
There's still one unused double
bond, so then we can

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.070
mix this later on for
cross-linking.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.630
And the various rubbers,
and so on.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.210
You can see, they all have
residual double bonds, which

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.770
allows them to then participate

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.460
in disulfide linkages.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:15.770
OK.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.240
So now here's the example I
wanted to show you that you

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.040
will be familiar with
in commerce.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.910
This is the PET, the
polyethylene terephthalate,

00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.260
the plastic bottles.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.640
The two-liter soda bottles
are made of this stuff.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.570
So you start with this thing,
which is known industrially as

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.730
terephthalic acid, which
is really 1-4-benzene.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.600
You see the benzene ring here,
so one, two, three, four.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.850
So off the one position and the
four position, you have a

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.420
carboxylic acid, and this
is critical in proteins.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.710
You're going to see the COOH
structure over and over again.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.110
And that H is detachable.

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.660
So this, then, it becomes
a proton donor.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.820
If it's a proton donor,
it's an acid.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:09:00.210
So this is the
1-4-benzenedicarboxylic acid.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.240
And this is ethylene glycol,
which you know as the base

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.150
constituent of antifreeze
for automobiles.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.480
It's really ethane with
two alcohols.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.670
So it's a diol.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.630
Ethanediol, 1-2.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.440
And you mix the ethanediol with
the terephthalic acid,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.700
spit off the proton and the
hydroxyl, leaving behind this,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.480
which then forms the bridge
here, and there's the basis

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.720
for the plastic soda bottle.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.140
This is the same material from
which you can make Dacron,

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.290
which is a fiber used sometimes
in textiles, and

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:39.205
Mylar, which is used in sheet
films for polymer films. So

00:09:39.205 --> 00:09:40.580
this is the PET.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.770
And note here, you see this
oxygen is acting as a bridge.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.400
It's acting as a bridge between
the terephthalic acid

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.430
residual and the ethylene
glycol residual.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.430
So again, we see nature relying
on the fact that

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:59.230
oxygen forms those two bonds and
acts as a bridge for us.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.780
OK.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.570
A couple of other
things to note.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:08.390
Here are the typical polymers
that are made by condensation

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.040
polymerization.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.610
All of the nylons.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.750
The nylons are made by
condensation polymerization.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:20.360
And the bond here that exists
between the nitrogen and the

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.390
carbon is called
the amide bond.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.410
Even though it's spelled A M I
D E, it's pronounced amid.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:27.680
So these are all nylons.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.810
The generic term
is polyamides.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.180
And you see the different
types of nylon here.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:38.690
Kevlar, used as a substitute
for steel belting in tires,

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.910
derives its strength from this,
the benzene ring here.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.150
And polyesters, OK?

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.610
The Dacron, the Mylar, I
just showed you that.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.480
Lexan.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.320
This is used in everything from
sports equipment, if you

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.080
wear eyeglasses in
sports, they're

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.910
probably made of Lexan.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.820
Again, look at these twin
benzene rings, and then you've

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.250
got the linkage on
the end here.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.270
And also used when you're
sitting seven miles above the

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.100
surface of the earth.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.460
The only thing that prevents you
from being asphyxiated or

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.760
frozen to death in that
airplane is a

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.010
window made of Lexan.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.990
And lastly, here are the
silicones, which are also made

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.805
by condensation polymerization.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:23.590
And just a little note
here for you.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.910
The person who invented
the silicones

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.070
didn't know his chemistry.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.410
And he thought that the
silicone, in fact, had a

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.200
double bond here.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.960
See, this is acetone, and
it from comes from

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.620
the family of ketones.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.840
So you have methyl above, methyl
below, carbon, and a

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.220
double bond off to the side.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.970
Well, it turns out
that silicone

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.420
doesn't form double bonds.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.460
Everybody in 3.091 knows this.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.750
It's too big.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:48.220
So it only has a single bond.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.730
If it's a single bond,
it's not an -one.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:54.830
It's just like a pentane,
methane, so on.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.060
So this should be a siloxane.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:00.630
So what people refer to as
silicones today properly are

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.270
called siloxanes.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.680
OK.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.260
Another thing to note.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.010
Let's go back to the--

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.820
you see here?

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.170
We go down the backbone
of the nylon, there's

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:14.450
the carboxylic acid.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.080
And there's a C with a double
bond to the O, and it spit off

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.100
its H, right?

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.610
That was the proton donor.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.590
Look at over here.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.100
There's an amino group here,
a nitrogen with a hydrogen.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.720
Well, if I line those
two up just right,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.100
look at what can happen.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.270
Here's a carbon-oxygen, and
here's a nitrogen-hydrogen.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.060
What do you know if you've
got hydrogen

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.950
sitting next to an oxygen?

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.920
It can form hydrogen bonds.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.590
And so nylons derive their
higher strength from the

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.950
hydrogen bonds that form
between the chains.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.670
Doesn't this remind you
of cross-linking?

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.550
It's sort of same church,
different pew.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:54.470
It's not as strong as a
disulfite covalent linkage,

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.950
but it does form linkages.

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.320
That's good.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.400
It's good because it
gives you strength.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.780
But it doesn't come with the
penalty that cross-linking

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:04.820
comes with.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.980
And what's the penalty?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.370
You can't recycle cross- linked
polymers very easily,

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.650
because you've got these
strong covalent

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:13.750
bonds in the chains.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.750
If you heat the polymer up,
those bonds don't break.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.300
If you heat this up, the
hydrogen bonds will let go.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:23.930
And you can remelt nylons, you
can recycle those polymers

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.260
much more easily.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.850
So I want to make another
taxonomy here that

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.810
distinguishes polymers
on the basis of their

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.920
ability to be recycled.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.070
Very important these days.

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.620
One of the first questions
people ask if you're using a

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.890
polymer in a process,
is it recyclable?

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.110
And what do you do?

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:45.750
You start thinking about the
molecular architecture in

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.880
order to answer that question.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.210
OK.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.760
So let's talk about the ones
that can be recycled.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.125
So recyclable ones are called
thermoplastics.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:08.960
Weak van der Waals and
hydrogen bonds only.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.130
And this is between
the chains.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:12.750
You don't break the bonds up
and down the backbone.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.620
If you break the blinds up and
down the backbone, you'll

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.910
pyrolyze the material.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.440
If you go to a high enough
temperature to break covalent

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.790
bonds in the backbone of a
polymer, you're on fire.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.300
So don't go there, all right?

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.710
So hydrogen bonds only, so this
can reheat and reprocess.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.810
So now we're talking about
something that's almost like

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:36.980
recycling metal.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.300
You remelt it and reuse it.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.930
The ones that have the strong
covalent linkages are called

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.180
thermal sets.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.690
And the thermal set is
difficult to recycle.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:50.940
This is cross-linked--

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.740
difficult.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.840
Notice I'm not writing
impossible.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.570
It's difficult to recycle,
which is a polite way of

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.380
saying, you can do it,
and it's really

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.840
expensive to do so.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.070
You might be better off to just

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.990
start with virgin material.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.410
By the way, where do we
get the material?

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.500
How do we make polymers?

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.890
Where do we get this
carbon from?

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.420
From petroleum.

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.220
You say, well, why don't
we use coal?

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:22.170
Well, you need carbon and
hydrogen in these systems. And

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:23.460
coal is carbon.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.240
Petroleum is hydrocarbon.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.050
So these are petroleum-derived.

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.630
So all these questions about
resource utilization and so on

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.210
come right up in center stage.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:33.470
OK.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.950
Now I want to take a few minutes
to talk about use of

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.720
crystallization to strengthen
polymers, OK?

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:48.440
So crystallization for
mechanical performance.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.350
We want to improve the
mechanical performance.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.500
And I alluded to
this last day.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.740
We;ll do this really quickly.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:01.050
So we've seen that if we want
to, we know that if we--

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.430
let me give you the
little icon here.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:06.630
So you're going along like
this, and some nice, long

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.490
chain, and all of a sudden,
you get a zone of

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:09.660
crystallinity.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:14.390
So I'm talking about adding
crystallinity in order to

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.360
strengthen the material.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.820
And so we know that this has
more bond density than the

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.610
straight chain here, so this
is going to be stronger.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.270
So if I want to strengthen the
polymer, introduce more

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:30.230
crystallization, so what
favors the onset of

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.110
crystallization?

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.850
Or we'll say, partial
crystallization.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.870
The whole thing doesn't
turn into a crystal.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:39.500
To favor crystallization, what
do we do with the various set

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.370
points that we have
in the material?

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.770
Well, first of all, we know with
composition, composition

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.380
is one of our levers.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.630
And we want to make
it uniform.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:58.930
So that means homopolymer is
favored over the copolymer.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.260
Or maybe there are other
instances where you don't want

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:05.990
crystallinity.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.420
In the soles of your running
shoe, you don't want that

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.620
turning into something
that's semibrittle.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.640
You want it to be soft.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.000
So that's why we use copolymers
in the soles of

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.930
running shoes, in order
to disfavor.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.000
And if we want to do something
like those jewel cases that I

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.280
keep railing against, the jewel
cases are a homopolymer

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:29.630
that have a fair bit
of crystallinity.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:33.240
The second one we talked about
last day, tacticity, this is a

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.620
second lever that you have.
So we know that

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:45.285
isotactic over atactic.

00:17:45.285 --> 00:17:48.660
The more uniform, the more
likely the material will be to

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.260
crystallize.

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.790
So the isotactic polystyrene
makes those jewel boxes,

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:56.490
whereas the atactic polystyrene
makes the food

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.580
containers that you get
when you buy food from

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.550
the trucks out here.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.440
And number three, we talked
about conformation.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.140
And we know that
conformation--

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.500
linear over branched, right?

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.890
Linear over branched.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.860
If we have a branched polymer,
it's not going to pack very

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.410
well, so it's less likely
to crystallize.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.170
The linear one, as I've
demonstrated in this cartoon,

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.850
has a much, much higher
propensity for

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:25.160
crystallization.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:25.390
All right.

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:26.490
How about properties?

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.440
Let's talk about properties.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.450
Properties of polymers.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.790
And I'm talking here about the
bulk commodity polymers.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:40.630
Sure, you can find specialty
polymers that have remarkable

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:42.910
properties that aren't
characteristic of polymers,

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.040
but I'm not talking
about those.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.640
So first of all.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.740
Electrical properties.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.660
They're insulators, electrical
insulators.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.160
Why are they electrical
insulators?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.970
We're talking about mainly
covalent bonds here.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:59.630
Covalent bonds, which means
tightly bound electrons,

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:03.080
tightly bound and localized,
because you saw that in

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.220
graphite, they're tightly
bound, but they're

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.080
delocalized.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.090
So tightly bound electrons.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.230
And no ions, because we've now
recognized that we can conduct

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.070
electricity not only by
electrons, but by ions.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.355
Tightly bound electrons,
no ions.

00:19:17.355 --> 00:19:21.520
That means no carriers, that
means no connectivity.

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:22.290
Number two.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.320
What's the second property?

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.790
Transparent to visible light.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:33.780
Again, same thing.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.880
Tightly bound electrons, not
possible to excite, et cetera.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.250
So these are clear,
and furthermore,

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.800
are generally colorless.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:52.760
And this is especially in the
case of amorphous materials.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.700
Amorphous materials are
clear, colorless.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.290
What happens if we get
semicrystallization?

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.250
Those crystalline zones, as I
showed you last day, those

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.950
crystalline zones are clear and
colorless as well, but the

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:08.880
index of refraction of the
crystalline zone is not equal

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:12.300
to the index of refraction of
the amorphous zone, and so

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.110
this boundary, if you will,
scatters light.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.550
So we have two clear and
colorless zones of different

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.820
index, and so if we put them
together, we end up with

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:29.880
something that is opaque, and
that's in the case of the

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.760
crystallinity.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.040
When you have some
crystallinity,

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.690
you'll give up on that.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.540
And actually, I wanted to show
you a few things from the

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.430
popular culture.

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.450
So I think what I've
got here--

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.965
oh, these are the-- yeah, OK.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.486
This is a little scene from
the musical Chicago.

00:20:47.486 --> 00:20:48.920
It's Mr. Cellophane.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.820
Cellophane is polymer,
viscose.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:51.960
All right?

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.970
Listen to the properties.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:54.269
They get it right.

Because you can look right
through me, walk right by me,

00:21:14.518 --> 00:21:16.110
and never know I'm there.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.926
-Oh, I didn't see you.

00:21:22.926 --> 00:21:23.390
[END MUSIC PLAYBACK]

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.710
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.890
So sometimes the popular
culture gets it right.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:27.210
All right.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.200
So now, what's the third
property of polymers?

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.450
Chemically inert.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:37.820
And this is why we use them in
food packaging, and also in

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.110
other forms of packaging.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:45.590
Again, strong bonds, strong
covalent bonds, means that

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:50.900
it's not very reactive with
the contents of many

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.670
containers, including
foods and beverages.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.560
A fourth property that's
exploited in polymers is very

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.510
low density.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.520
Why?

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.290
Well, what are the constituents
of the polymers?

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.970
Contains things like
carbon, nitrogen--

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.170
well, let's put carbon and
hydrogen first. Those are the

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.700
two biggies.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.390
So we've got carbon
and hydrogen.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:18.020
You saw some nitrogen, oxygen,
and then trace levels of other

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:18.670
substances.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.530
So these are all
low Z elements.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.740
So for example, in a
beverage container.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.270
I can make a beverage
container.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:30.810
You see a beverage container.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.340
I see a bundle of properties.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.930
What is the bundle
of properties?

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.510
It has to be some physical
rigidity, but not much,

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.490
because I can squeeze this.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.170
It's OK.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.720
And it has to be chemically
inert with

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.470
respect to its contents.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:48.560
So I could build this out
of a borosilicate

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.670
glass, a glass bottle.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.210
And the density of borosilicate

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:56.350
glass is about 3.54.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:58.470
Or I can make it out of
aluminum, and the density of

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.270
the aluminum is about 2.7.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.340
Or I can make it out of polymer,
and the density is

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.270
down close to 1.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.250
So now if I load up the beverage
truck, instead of

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:14.530
transporting the contents plus
the mass of the container, the

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.880
higher fraction now is just
the contents, and the

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.630
container weighs less.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.760
When I was your age,
we had still soda

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.770
cans made out of steel.

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:26.640
Steel soda cans.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:26.810
Yeah.

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:27.980
They didn't have pull tops.

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.850
You had to have an opener
to open them.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.230
And the density of
steel is 7.87.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.765
Iron is 7.87.

00:23:36.765 --> 00:23:39.050
So from steel, down to this,
down to this, and so on.

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:44.880
So you see the low density
has an advantage.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.730
But, you know, we're going to
have to go back over here and

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.900
start thinking about
recyclability.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.930
So you see the balancing act
here in choosing materials.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.150
You can't just seize upon one
attribute and say, oh, this is

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.550
less dense than that,
let's go with it.

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.190
But it's made from petroleum,
and maybe it's not so

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:06.780
recyclable.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:07.740
So now what do you do?

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.490
Maybe you do make it out of
steel, because you know, what

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.950
you can recycle steel.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:16.510
You can take the door off a 1928
Model-T Ford, melt that

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:21.590
door down, and you can put
it on a 2010 Taurus.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:25.440
That's how recyclable iron is.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.090
I'm just telling you what
the properties are.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.200
You're going to have to make
the tough decisions.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.373
And five, solid at
room temperature.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.950
And why are they solid
at room temperature?

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:43.110
Because the interchain bonds,
even though they're weak, they

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:46.480
have a long, long, long, long
surface contact area.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:54.800
So entanglement of van
der Waals bonds.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.280
So you have the best
of both worlds.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.380
It's solid at room temperature,
but in the case

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:03.630
of a thermal plastic with
modest heating, you can

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:07.510
restore back to the
original case.

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.970

to, in many of the

can't tell this.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.480

century, with one exception.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.740
A pharmacist in Germany by the
name of Eduard Simon was

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:57.380
playing with the vinyl benzene
and managed to make this goo

00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.500
that became what we know
as polystyrene.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.530
And nobody could explain.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.270
Remember, in 18--

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:09.390
he was doing this in 1839,
before Kekule had even

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.120
speculated that you can get
carbon-carbon linkages!

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.050
No benzene rings!

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.840
So that he was linking benzene,
that they didn't even

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.630
understand existed as a ring,
and he was making polymers

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.610

that you could even make

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:34.010

gave the explanation that what

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.570
we're seeing here is the
polymerization into

Nobel Prize in 1953.

accept it and say,

characterization.

How were they going
to verify in 1922?

So you keep waiting,
waiting, waiting.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.740
Look at what happened
to de Broglie.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.470

equals h over p,

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.720
and they went, uh-huh.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.820

did the experiment

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.040
down at Bell Labs and they
got electron defraction--

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.460
boom!

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.600
He gets the Nobel Prize.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.110
They said, you know what?

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.020
You're right!

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.270
That's how it works.

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:21.930
OK.

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:23.070
This was one of the giants.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.460
This was Wallace Carothers.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.930
Carothers, who for
a short time was

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.350
a lecturer at Harvard.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:33.320
He left Harvard and joined
DuPont, and he gave birth to

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:38.980
an incredible array of synthetic
materials, as they

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.730
say here, similar to cellulose
and silicon.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.890
Invented neoprene, the first
synthetic rubber.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.340
This was very important for
the United States and the

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.710
Allied Powers during World War
II, because we did not have

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.740
access to natural rubber.

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.380
And the fact that they were
making synthetic rubber here

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.120
from materials that we had here
allowed us to continue

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.030
building for the war effort.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:06.760
Invented nylon, in 1937.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.660
An amazing man.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:12.420
Unfortunately deeply troubled,
very depressive.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.110
And two days after his 41st
birthday, he checked in a

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.690
hotel in Philadelphia, and
took his own life.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:21.940
This is Wallace Carothers.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.990
So I'm going to show you
now some synthesis.

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.610
About ten years ago, I had a
live demonstration here.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.880
There was a gal who was doing
her PhD over here in Building

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.070
13, and she'd come in
and do these demos.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:36.760
But, you know, it's been
ten years now.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.610
We let her graduate, so she's
not around anymore.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:40.970
So we took some videos of it.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.270
So the first thing I want
to show you is the

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.070
synthesis of nylon.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.920
So you're going to see
this reaction.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.130
So in this case, it's
hexamethylene diamine and

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.160
adipic acid.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.540
And that's going to give you
nylon-6,6 plus water, just as

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.200
this reaction indicates here,
and these are immiscible.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.030
See, the adipic acid is in
aqueous phase, and the

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.920
hexamethylene diamine is a
non-aqueous phase, so they

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.400
form two phases right here, two
liquid layers, and this

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.230
reaction occurs at
the interface

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.630
between the two layers.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.530
So you're going to see a close
up of the beaker, and she's

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.200
going to now dip an
instrument in, and

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.710
start pulling the solid.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.085
She's making the solid from two
liquids, and she's going

00:30:19.085 --> 00:30:19.710
to pull it.

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:23.270
And as she pulls it, she
clears the interface.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.020
Because once the interface
is covered, new

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.380
reactant can't get there.

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.980
So ironically, the product
separates the two halves of

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.850
the reaction from each other.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.350
So you have to get
the product out.

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:37.100
This is really cool.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.550
So there's the chemistry.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:39.140
So let's look.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.170
This is Heidi Burch.

00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.190
David, could we dim
the lights, maybe?

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.653
[FILM PLAYBACK]

00:30:42.653 --> 00:30:45.980
HEIDI BURCH: The derivative of
a carboxylic acid then is

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.976
mercuric chloride.

00:30:46.976 --> 00:30:49.964
I have it dissolved in hexane.

00:30:49.964 --> 00:30:53.079
My base is hexamethylene
diamine, and I've got it

00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:53.460
dissolved in water.

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:57.250
So to do this right, I have
to make them float.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:03.620
So we're going to pour,
if I can get it open.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.220
PROFESSOR: This is the
old 10-250, too.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.240
It's got a carpet here.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.475
HEIDI BURCH: --because it's
dissolved in water, which has

00:31:08.475 --> 00:31:11.485
a higher density than hexane.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.370
And then I have my acid
dissolved in the hexane.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.440
So what's going to happen
when I pour that in?

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.973
It's not going to mix, right?

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:25.490
PROFESSOR: It'll separate.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:27.160
HEIDI BURCH: It's going to
phase separate, exactly.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.680
And we're going to
have strata.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.245
Is that going to help or
hurt our reaction?

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.420
It's going to hurt our
reaction, right?

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.560
To have a good reaction, you
need intimate mixing.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.010
Well--

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.760
PROFESSOR: This is like
the Uzo water problem.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.080
HEIDI BURCH: So this is pretty,
actually pretty

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:48.980
unexciting.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.525
Nothing really interesting
has happened.

00:31:50.525 --> 00:31:51.420
It's just kind of
sitting there.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.580
Nothing's exploding out of the
beaker, nothing's coming out.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.660
It's kind of tame.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:01.150
But if you look carefully,
you can kind of see--

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:03.572
where did my pointer go?

00:32:03.572 --> 00:32:05.965
You can kind of see this
film right there.

00:32:05.965 --> 00:32:07.740
See that big bubble?

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.400
Well, there's a scum that's
floating at the interface

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.260
between the two layers.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.230
That's actually the nylon
that we formed.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:18.430
What happens is, I mentioned
that nylon has that excellent

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.150
chemical resistance.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:24.225
Well, when we formed it, it made
a barrier film between

00:32:24.225 --> 00:32:28.110
the two layers so that no more
reactants could get through to

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:31.590
each other to form
more nylons.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:35.980
So what I have to do is remove
that barrier film to allow the

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.675
reactants to come
into contact.

00:32:37.675 --> 00:32:42.690
And I'm doing that by drawing
off the nylon as it's formed.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:45.650
Because I'm drawing off the
film, are very haphazard.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:49.120
And what's happening is, the
polymer I'm forming has a very

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.990
broad molecular weight
distribution.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:55.366
It's not all 240 grams
per mole or whatever.

00:32:55.366 --> 00:32:58.256
And that greatly affects the
mechanical properties, and, in

00:32:58.256 --> 00:33:00.620
fact, it affects them
detrimentally.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.110
So the mechanical properties of
this nylon that I'm forming

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.030
aren't very good.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:05.450
[END FILM PLAYBACK]

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.660
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.960
So that's the first one.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.450
Now, the second one I'm going to
show you talks about glass

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:16.290
transition temperature, and
how you engineer a rubber.

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:20.360
So it might shock you to
know that a rubber

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.980
is, in fact, a liquid.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:25.150
It's a polymer that's above
its glass transition

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:25.720
temperature.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.260
It might be supercooled liquid,
but it's liquid.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.150
And those disulfide linkages
give you the flexibility so

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.860
that the chains can move
against one another.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.590
If you drop the temperature
below the glass transition

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:41.860
temperature, the whole thing
turns into an amorphous solid.

00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:43.790
So what are the mechanical
properties?

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.200
What I'm indicating here
is the ball, all right?

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:50.420
So the bouncing ball is up
here, above the glass

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.460
transition temperature
it's cross-linked and

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.740
behaves as an elastomer.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.590
If you get the temperature too
low, you'll end up solidifying

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.710
everything, and then it turns
into something with the

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.640
mechanical properties of a
billiard ball, all right?

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.790
So we call that tough.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.830
Tough means it has impact
resistance.

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:08.250
It will absorb a
lot of energy.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.960
So if I drop the ball, it won't
bounce, it takes the

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.200
energy of falling and absorbs
it and holds it.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.560
So if you want a ball
to bounce, you

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.610
want to be above here.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:18.090
So what we're going to do, is
we're going to take two

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.220
different polymers.

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:23.070
One that at room temperature is
here, and one that at room

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:24.550
temperature is here.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.400
The one that's down here, we're
going to put in the

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.540
boiling water and get
it over here.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:31.690
The one that is naturally a
bouncer here, we're going to

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.210
put into liquid nitrogen
and send it over here.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.770
So we're going to make a
bouncing ball not bounce, and

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.710
we're going to make a flat
unbouncy ball bounce.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.044
We're going to teach
these balls.

00:34:42.044 --> 00:34:43.010
And what are we going to do?

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:45.050
We're going to teach these balls
how to bounce and not

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:49.140
bounce on temperature cue, by
moving on opposite sides of

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.590
the glass transition
temperature.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:55.440
So this is a glass, and this
over here is a rubber, OK?

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:55.770
All right.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:56.340
So here they are.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.060
Those are the two rubbers.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.270
One is norbornene, and the
other is isoprene.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.990
And both of these, if you go
back to the earlier slides,

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.410
have a double bond in the
polymer, And that double bond

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:09.450
has now been broken for
disulfide linkages.

00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:10.620
This is Heidi again.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.070
[FILM PLAYBACK]

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:11.202
HEIDI BURCH: OK.

00:35:11.202 --> 00:35:13.630
The thing I want to talk about
now, is the effect of

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:17.150
temperature on polymer
molecules.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.880
Basically, when do I get rubbery
behavior and when do I

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.340
get glassy behavior?

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.960
Because I can get the same
polymer to exhibit rubbery

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.895
behavior or glassy behavior,
depending on the temperature

00:35:26.895 --> 00:35:28.780
at which I use that material.

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.480
As Dr. Sadoway told you,
polymers have what's called a

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.220
glass transition temperature,
and the type of behavior that

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.570
I get is determined by my use
temperature relative to my

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.780
glass transition temperature.

00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:48.410
So I have here six
little balls with

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.040
faces painted on them.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.430
The ones with the happy faces
are polyisoprene.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.560
The ones with the sad faces
are polynorbornene.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.010
Now, polynorbornene is a
synthetic rubber that was

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:03.630
developed during World War II
when we didn't have access to

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.545
all the rubber tree groves
in Southeast Asia.

00:36:07.545 --> 00:36:10.195
So the happy balls are happy
because their glass transition

00:36:10.195 --> 00:36:12.450
temperature is minus 67.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.770
So our use temperature at room
temperature is much greater

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:18.230
that their glass transition
temperatures, so they behave

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.390
as rubber would.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:25.730
The polynorbornene has a glass
transition temperature of 40.

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:28.220
So we're actually below its
glass transition temperature

00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.462
at room temperature,
and it just

00:36:30.462 --> 00:36:31.770
dissipates all the energy.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.380
We get a much more glassy-like
behavior from this material,

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.740
and it doesn't bounce.

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.520
So what we can do here to
demonstrate the effect is

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:45.125
we're going raise the use
temperature of both materials,

00:36:45.125 --> 00:36:46.410
and we're going to
lower the use

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.200
temperature of both materials.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.290
So I'm going to drop them in
boiling water, and hope that

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.215
the little faces stay on,
because I just painted them on

00:36:52.215 --> 00:36:53.890
with white-out.

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:55.170
I don't know how that's
going to work.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.450
And then I'm going to drop two
of them in liquid nitrogen.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.020
Now, these will be
our controls.

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:03.950
Remember, polynorbornene,
polyisoprene.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:06.755
Now something to think about,
which I know Dr. Sadoway

00:37:06.755 --> 00:37:10.230
always likes to ask, is why
does one have a high glass

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:12.460
transition temperature, and why
does one have a low glass

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.720
transition temperature?

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.220
And I'll leave you to ponder
that little conundrum, while I

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.530
try to fish these
bad boys out.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:23.320
OK.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:23.810
Oh!

00:37:23.810 --> 00:37:24.856
White-out worked.

00:37:24.856 --> 00:37:27.810
So this is the polyisoprene.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:29.060
Can you hear the sound
that it makes?

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.610
When I drop the one that's at
room temperature, I get a nice

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.860
rubbery sound.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.850
When I drop that one, I get a
plastic, hard glassy sound.

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:47.640
I've cooled it below its glass
transition temperature, and

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.670
now I get a totally glassy
impact, like if I were

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:52.920
knocking pool balls together.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:57.440
Now let's go in for the
polynorbornene.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:57.630
Oh!

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.730
His eye came off.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:01.640
Same thing.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.090
I pulled the polynorbornene
below its glass transition

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.030
temperature as well, so it,
too, exhibits a glassy

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:10.230
collision, like a pool ball.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:14.338
Now, let's go in here.

00:38:14.338 --> 00:38:17.495
This is the polynorbornene, so
it should still continue to

00:38:17.495 --> 00:38:21.920
bounce, because we've raised
its use temperature further

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.160
above its glass transition
temperature.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.690
That's not the exciting one.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.276
The exciting one is--

00:38:28.276 --> 00:38:31.050
if I can get it out.

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:35.000
What happens to the
polynorbornene?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.310
This is the sad ball, the one
that wouldn't bounce at room

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:38.440
temperature.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.625
By raising its use temperature
above its glass transition

00:38:41.625 --> 00:38:43.900
temperature by dunking it
in boiling water, I

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.430
get a rubbery response.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.630
[END FILM PLAYBACK]

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.750
PROFESSOR: Super.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:49.000
OK.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.270
House lights, please.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:53.760
I don't read well in the dark.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:54.430
OK.

00:38:54.430 --> 00:39:02.750
So I hope you've seen some
examples of how these work.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:04.830
So now I want to talk a
little bit about the

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:05.900
broader societal issues.

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.820
So this, I think, is sort
of a pattern of

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.770
adoption of new materials.

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:12.620
You start off with this wonder,
you know, this cool

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.840
property that you get
at the lab bench.

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:19.020
You know, when nylon was
invented, it led to

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:19.912
democratization.

00:39:19.912 --> 00:39:24.430
Do you realize stockings,
womens' stockings, were only

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:25.730
owned by the wealthy?

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.850
Because they were
made of silk.

00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.550
When they were made
out of nylon, they

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.590
became cheap and abundant.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:33.750
So that changed the way
people dressed.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:38.990
It changed the way people made
clothing in a way that was

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:41.180
unimaginable before.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:45.790
So you could, for example, make
a billiard ball, or piano

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.910
keys, without killing
an elephant.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.980
You didn't have to use ivory.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.170
You could use polymers.

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:55.970
Huge, huge implications.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:59.150
So this is one of the first
commercial polymers.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:03.050
It's phenolic resin, and it's
made by a condensation

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.070
polymerization between
carbolic acid and

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:05.510
formaldehyde.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:06.960
It was called bakelite.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.120
and its corporate symbol was
B with the infinity sign.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.700
Material of a thousand uses.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.000
And this, normally, is--

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.290
look at the elaborate
art deco coffeepot.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:18.620
And this is all-- it's thermal
insulated, and so on.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:22.000
These are all plumbing parts
made out of bakelite, that

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.400
previously would be made out of
many pieces of metal that

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.320
had to be machined and
fashioned together.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.780
You could take bakelite powder,
put it into a die,

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.240
heat it, and out comes the part,
finished, in one step.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.420
So this has a huge implication
on productivity.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:42.010
But then, so now we start
talking about substitution,

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:45.300
making the cheap things, the
piano keys, the fork here, and

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.310
on and on and on.

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.850
But then things that couldn't
exist before.

00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:52.440
You know, the movie film.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.580
Look at the steering
wheel here.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.350
There's the, that's indicating
the lady's

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.390
stocking, and so on.

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.120
This is from Look
magazine, 1940.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.270
People thought these things
were just godsends.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.130
This is Synthetica.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.470
This is a country, and it's got
the province of Cellulose,

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:13.600
Petrolia, Castphenolic
and so on.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.430
This is the 1960s.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.740
This is plastics, the
future has arrived.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.820
It's at a museum in New York.

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:23.350
You're looking at the interior
of a home with furniture built

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:28.160
in, and it's all plastic walls,
and formed, and so on.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.110
I think maybe these guys were
in a drug haze or something.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.190
Those are the windows.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:33.230
Maybe they thought those
windows were square,

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.140
rectilinear, I don't know.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.480
So this is going
way overboard.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.320
And then let me show you
a piece of iconic

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.490
film from The Graduate.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.220
You'll see a young
Dustin Hoffman.

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.890
He's just come back from getting
a bachelor's degree.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:50.030
So this could be you someday in
the not too distant future.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.350
And he's at a party that
his parents are

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.404
throwing in his honor.

[END FILM PLAYBACK]

00:42:59.350 --> 00:42:59.530
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:03.780
So this was 1967, '68.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.710
So what's happened since
then in plastics?

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:08.730
Well, all of these other
considerations about

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:13.790
recyclability, environmental
health and safety issues.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.800
In order to facilitate molding,
when you want to mold

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:20.050
the plastic, to get those bonds
to loosen up a little

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.280
bit, we use a chemical known
as a plasticizer.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.030
It's a low molecular weight
polymer that helps the--

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.220
it's sort of the equivalent of
putting a little bit of olive

00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:33.080
oil in with the pasta, to give
it that freedom to move.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.910
And so this, then, when you sit
in a new car, the new car

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.670
smell is the smell of the
plasticizer, which is still

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:39.700
evaporating.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.950
And some of those plasticizers
have molecular architectures

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.590
that are similar to hormones
in our bodies.

00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:49.890
And so it's not healthy for us
to be breathing this stuff.

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:53.390
So maybe the bright future that
was talked about is not

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:58.120
quite as bright as some people
might have thought it to be.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.480
The other thing is--

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.670
you know how I showed you
the plumbing parts?

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.930
Well, we started making
all kinds of

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:07.150
things out of polymers.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:09.050
As a child, I remember
my father bringing

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:11.820
me, one day, a shoe.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.890
The shoe was 100% man-made.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:17.290
It was all polymer.

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:20.930
And we thought this was
the coolest thing,

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:24.090
because of all man-made.

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.200
Of course, there was a
complete reversal.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.603
People said, you know, your foot
can't breathe, and this

00:44:29.603 --> 00:44:32.280
is a silly thing to have. But
at the time, we started

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.590
making-- and they were ugly.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.730
And you know, for me, if it's
ugly, I don't want to wear

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:38.630
something that's ugly.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:42.680
So what happened was, we started
making all kinds of

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.790
things out of polymers,
or as the public

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:46.900
knows them, as plastics.

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:52.110
And by the mid-'70s, to call
something plastic was to make

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:53.990
a derogatory comment.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:57.620
It's plastic, it's cheap,
it's shoddy.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:01.350
So you know, making silk
stockings cheaper as nylon

00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.530
stockings was good.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.200
But if you get them too
cheap, they're cheap.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:05.750
See?

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:07.030
So there's an optimum there.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.470
And all of that went
into play.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.010
By the way, how do we get
the word plastic?

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.030
It comes from the
Greek plastikos.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.060
And same word as potter.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:15.800
So when you're working with
clay, you're working with a

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.930
plastic medium.

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.680
It's deformable,
it's malleable.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:24.240
There's Samuel Johnson "let
Thy plastick hand." So all

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:28.180
plastics are polymers, but not
all polymers are plastics,

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.980
because some polymers
can't be deformed.

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.900
If they're below their glass
transition temperature,

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.150
they're brittle solids.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:37.150
All right.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.440
So I've told you enough
about concern.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:42.170
Let's look at recycling.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.420
In the United States right
now, 100 billion pounds

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.500
annually of polymer, 50 million
tons of which 3 to 4

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.110
million are recycled.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.660
It's a very low recycle rate.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.110
So this ends up in the waste.

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.950
Contrast that to steel.

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:59.250
Steel, we still make 80 million
tons a year of virgin

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:01.110
metal in the United States.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.300
It's still a world-class
steel industry.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.600
You can bet it's world-class.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.050
With our wages and our high
standards, if you're still in

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:10.130
business making steel in
the United States, you

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:12.660
better be damn good.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.900
Very good.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.920
So 80 million tons virgin
metal, 60 million tons

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.310
recycled scrap.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:25.310
We recycle more steel per year
from automobiles than we

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:27.830
consume building new
automobiles.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.080
It's a complete ecology.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.900
And compare that to aluminum.

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.580
Aluminum, 4 million tons a year,
1 million tons recycled.

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.080
Very high rate on used
beverage containers.

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.210
But that's the exception.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:44.450
Because this was DFE, Designed
For Environment.

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:48.570
The alloy choices were made in
order to facilitate recycling.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.280
So there were certain metals
that were forbidden to go into

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.990
the alloy because
they would pose

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.080
problems later in recycling.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.960
So there are many ways to get
the same deep-drawing

00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.760
characteristics.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.172
You know, you make a beverage
can out of a

00:47:01.172 --> 00:47:03.370
sheet, and you snap.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:06.050
Punch down, punch up, there's
no seam on the bottom.

00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:08.630
This is made from a single
sheet of metal.

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:11.330
And then a second piece
comes down on the top.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.100
And so this has only aluminum,
silicon, and magnesium.

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.140
You could choose other metals,
but with aluminum, silicon,

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:20.280
magnesium, it is recyclable.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:22.720
But aluminum ladders-- if you're
building an airplane,

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.495
let's say you're the chief
purchasing agent for Boeing.

00:47:25.495 --> 00:47:29.120
And you've got a choice of
aluminum scrap, which, you

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.000
know, people might have thrown
some old fishing weights with

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.390
lead in there, and that's now
contaminant in the aluminum.

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.800
Or you're going to buy
high-purity virgin metal, and

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.330
you're going to bet the
company's future.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:41.630
What are you going to buy?

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:45.050
You're going to put recycled
metal into an airplane.

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:47.070
Have the thing fall
out of the sky.

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.070
No way.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:50.890
So you have to be careful.

00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:54.890
Those alloys, if you take the,
I told you, the door off the

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:59.280
1928 Model-T, and you put it
on a 2010 Taurus, you can't

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.470
take the wing off a DC-3
and melt it down

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:04.670
and put it on a 777.

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:08.350
Because the top has an aluminum
alloy with zinc, and

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:11.230
in the bottom one has an
aluminum alloy with copper.

00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:13.220
And if you co-melt those,
you'll end up with

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:17.060
intermetallics, and the
alloy is unusable.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.960
So you have to separate them.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.050
Now it's not so simple.

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:22.520
So before you go make
pronouncements saying, yeah,

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:25.860
recycling is great,
think about it.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.530
Follow through.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:29.070
OK.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.990
If you find this interesting,
and the impact that polymer

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:36.280
had on American culture, this
is a lovely book by Jeffrey

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.510
Meikle on polymers
and their use.
