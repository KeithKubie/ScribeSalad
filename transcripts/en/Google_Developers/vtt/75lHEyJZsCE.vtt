00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:06.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.170
I'm Timothy Jordan, and you're
watching "The Developer Show,"

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.371
here, on-site at
Google I/O 2016.

00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:15.870
In this video, we're going to
be taking a look at the Search

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.369
APIs.

00:00:20.946 --> 00:00:23.070
So Mihai, I'd like to talk
to you about two things.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.940
The first of which
is Rich Cards,

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.700
and the second is app indexing.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.390
Now, first I want to take a look
at the documentation for Rich

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.969
Cards.

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:31.510
Can you get us
started by telling me,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.997
well, what is a Rich Card?

00:00:32.997 --> 00:00:33.830
MIHAI IONESCU: Sure.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.070
So, a Rich Card is
a new visual format

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.210
to present search results in an
interactive and engaging way.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.934
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really awesome.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:45.350
Pretty much what it means is
that, I search for something,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.360
and instead of just
getting a blue link,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.480
I see information
there in a rich way.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.520
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes, yes.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.690
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And you can do
this with markup in your web

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.960
page .

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.200
So when you're
building your template,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.640
you also just build the
template for markup as well.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.360
So Google knows what it is.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.190
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.605
So let's actually take a
look at the documentation,

00:01:01.605 --> 00:01:04.019
which we recently updated.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:04.930
And it's really cool.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.410
You can see the
example in a gallery,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.310
take a look at the
code, validate it,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.320
and see an example of
what it would look like.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.820
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.660
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Can
you show us that?

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.493
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:17.330
So in this case, we
have a recipe example.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.830
On the right side, it
shows how the recipes

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560
would appear in a carousel.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.050
We can have a quick
look at the markup.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.265
And the markup in
this case is JSON-LD.

00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:31.850
Schema.org offers different
ways to show metadata.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.820
JSON-LD is something
we usually recommend.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.160
You can put your information
in the Schema.org fields

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.270
in this format.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.980
When you want to
test it, you can

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.576
click on the Validate button.

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:48.470
It will show you, in this
case, hey, we have no errors,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.440
no warnings.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's convenient.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.853
MIHAI IONESCU: That's
very convenient.

00:01:51.853 --> 00:01:54.470
We have a lot of
information covered here.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.000
Usually, just a few
fields are required.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.810
But the more you add, the
richer the Card will look like,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.390
and the higher the
chances the user

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.484
will interact with the
Card and will go on

00:02:04.484 --> 00:02:05.400
to visit your website.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Cool.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.771
MIHAI IONESCU: So more
conversions for you.

00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:12.870
So once we have this, we can
go ahead and preview the Card.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.020
And this is how your Card will
look on the search results.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.020
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So easy.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.811
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes.

00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:22.290
And you can see it has more
than just a small snippet

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.260
in the link.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.170
You have a picture.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.600
You have a rating.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.881
You have stuff that's very
specific to the Schema.org type

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:32.630
you're using here.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.940
In this case, the recipe.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.290
It shows that it's
only 230 calories.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.520
So that's a pretty
good piece of pie.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.820
It only takes three
hours to make.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.360
And it has very good reviews.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.810
So as a website
owner, I'm really

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.500
happy that this shows preeminent
in the search results.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.390
I'm sure people
will click on this.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.450
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm getting
hungry just looking at it.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.283
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:02:55.283 --> 00:02:56.935
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.530
So I have a search here
for a fried chicken recipe.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.970
At the top of the
search results,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.030
we have what we call a
summary carousel that

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.970
shows fried chicken recipes
from all around the web.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.210
And as we talked
before, each card

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.240
gives you some
interesting information,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.030
like how long it takes to
cook the recipe, some ratings,

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.530
and reviews.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.000
Another way to show
in search results

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.600
is through what we
call a host carousel.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.670
Your site-- your cooking
site, or your recipe site--

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.720
has a lot of related recipes,
in this case, fried chicken.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.210
Then we group all
of them together.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.950
And we show them for
your site in particular.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.332
In this case, the Food
Network, of course,

00:03:50.332 --> 00:03:52.040
they have a lot of
fried chicken recipes.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.480
You can show them in
the host carousel.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.260
So there's a lot of information
that users can browse, and then

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.060
decide to go and
visit your website.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.280
So app indexing is a way to
add your app in the search

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.480
results, same way you have you
website in the search results.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.715
So we offer an API that
you can use and have

00:04:13.715 --> 00:04:15.189
your app indexed by Google.

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:15.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.689
Let's see a demo.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.813
Show me what it looks like.

00:04:17.813 --> 00:04:19.079
MIHAI IONESCU: So let's see.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.850
You're traveling,
and you're in Japan.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.030
You want to find
a hotel in Tokyo.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.970
You find the familiar
search results.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.460
If you scroll down
a little bit, you'll

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.020
actually see that you have
the Booking.com app installed.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.550
And it provides a link to
the 30 best hotels in Tokyo.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.790
If you click on it, this link--

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It goes
right into the app.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.670
MIHAI IONESCU: So we are now
inside the Booking.com app.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.120
There is a nice
listing of hotels

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.620
with a lot of information.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.210
You browse through it.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.520
After a while, you come back.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.330
And you, of course,
don't remember the link.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.180
But you can just type Tokyo
or start typing Tokyo.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.500
And you see, because you
already visited the app,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.680
another nice feature of--

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
It's right there.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.750
MIHAI IONESCU: --app
indexing is autocompletion.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.380
We have a link to
properties in Tokyo.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.247
You click on it, you go
back exactly where you were.

00:05:12.247 --> 00:05:13.330
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.010
MIHAI IONESCU: That's another
great benefit of app indexing.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.070
And I want to show
you one more thing.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.610
Let's say, oh, there's
so much stuff out there.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.470
I want to see
another booking app.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.450
What other booking
apps are out there?

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.300
So you just type here,
hotel booking apps.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.220
And let's see how many
apps are app indexed.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.420
Well, quite a lot of them.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.194
It will provide a nice
matrix of hotel booking apps.

00:05:41.194 --> 00:05:43.110
Booking.com is one of
them, but of course, you

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.550
can try another one.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.216
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
very cool, Mihai.

00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:48.760
Thank you so much for the demo
of both Rich Cards and app

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:49.370
indexing.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.310
And for everybody
there at home, please

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.310
check the description
below for the links

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.925
to demos and documentation
of everything

00:05:55.925 --> 00:05:56.800
we just talked about.
