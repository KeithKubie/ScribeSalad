00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:02.101
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that we're starting with a

00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:05.840
population of 1,000
rabbits, and we know that

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.461
this population is
growing at 10% per month.

00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:14.443
What I wanna do is explore
how that population will grow,

00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:17.343
if it's growing 10% per month.

00:00:17.343 --> 00:00:19.299
So let's set up a little bit of a,

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:23.429
let's set up a little
table here, a little table.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.819
And on this left column,
let's just say this is

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.009
the number of months that have gone by,

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.000
and on the right column, let's
say this is the population.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.136
So we know from the
information given to us,

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:41.996
that at zero months, we're
starting off with 1,000 rabbits.

00:00:41.996 --> 00:00:45.096
Now let's think about what's
gonna happen after one month.

00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:47.767
Well, our population's gonna grow by 10%,

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:50.376
so we can take our population
at the beginning of the month,

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:52.376
and growing by 10%,
that's the same thing as

00:00:52.376 --> 00:00:55.505
multiplying by one point one.

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:56.996
You have your original population,

00:00:56.996 --> 00:01:01.136
and then you grow it by 10%,
one plus 10% is one point one.

00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:03.336
So we can multiply it by one point one,

00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:04.509
and that math we can do in our head,

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.435
it is 11 hundred, or 1,100,

00:01:07.435 --> 00:01:11.602
but let's just write this
as 1,000 times one point,

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:17.729
not one point five, times one point one.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.597
Now let's think about what
happens as we go to month two.

00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:22.257
What's gonna have is
gonna be the population

00:01:22.257 --> 00:01:25.166
that we started at the
beginning of the month

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.409
times one point one again,

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.979
so it's gonna be the population

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.116
at the beginning of the
month, which was that,

00:01:32.116 --> 00:01:33.339
which we have right over there,

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:36.287
but then we're gonna multiply
by one point one again,

00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:40.729
or we can just say this
is one point one squared.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.677
I think you see a pattern emerging.

00:01:42.677 --> 00:01:44.659
After another month, the
population's gonna be

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.409
1,000 times one point
one to the third power,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.562
we're just gonna multiply
by one point one again.

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:56.092
And so if you were to go
n months into the future,

00:01:56.092 --> 00:01:57.920
well you can see what's going to be.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.753
It's gonna be 1,000
times, or being multiplied

00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:05.354
by one point one n times,

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:09.187
or 1,000 times one point
one to the nth power.

00:02:10.383 --> 00:02:12.482
And so we can set up an expression here,

00:02:12.482 --> 00:02:13.965
we can say look the population,

00:02:13.965 --> 00:02:17.126
let's say that the population is P.

00:02:17.126 --> 00:02:21.293
The population as a function
of n, as a function of n,

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:27.654
is gonna be equal to
our initial population,

00:02:27.654 --> 00:02:31.237
our initial population,
times one point one

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:33.750
to the nth power.

00:02:34.855 --> 00:02:36.785
And you might say, "Okay this makes sense,

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:38.767
"it doesn't look like we're
getting crazy numbers",

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:40.697
but just for kicks, let's just think about

00:02:40.697 --> 00:02:42.418
what's gonna happen in 10 years.

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:45.185
So 10 years would be 120 months.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:49.516
So the population at the end
of 120 months is gonna be

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:53.266
1,000 times one point
one to the 120th power,

00:02:56.728 --> 00:03:00.809
and so let's, let me get a
calculator out to do that.

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:02.758
I can not calculate one point one

00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:04.829
to the 120th power in my head.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.996
One point one to the 120th
power is equal to that,

00:03:12.208 --> 00:03:16.499
times our original
population, so times 1,000,

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.332
one two three, is going
to be equal to roughly

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.493
93 million rabbits,
let me write that down.

00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:29.119
So we started with 1,000,
and we're gonna have

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:32.869
approximately 93 million
rabbits, 93 million,

00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:38.103
million rabbits.

00:03:38.103 --> 00:03:41.882
And so we grew by a factor
of 93,000 over 10 years,

00:03:41.882 --> 00:03:43.333
so over another 10 years,

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:46.424
we're gonna grow by 93,000 times this.

00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:50.583
And so you quickly realize
10% per month is quite fast,

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:52.702
and this might seem extremely fast,

00:03:52.702 --> 00:03:57.083
but it's actually not outlandish
for a population of rabbits

00:03:57.083 --> 00:04:01.250
that are not limited by
space or predators or food,

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:04.535
and if you were to plot
something like this out,

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:06.725
if you were to plot the rabbit population

00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:08.474
with respect to time,

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:11.698
you would see a graph that
looks, let me draw it.

00:04:11.698 --> 00:04:15.448
So this axis it is time,
let's say in months,

00:04:16.998 --> 00:04:20.867
and this axis you have your population,

00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:22.950
you have your population.

00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:27.819
This type of function,
or this type of equation,

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:31.088
let me see population I, population,

00:04:31.088 --> 00:04:32.898
this is an exponential function,

00:04:32.898 --> 00:04:35.127
and so your population
as a function of time

00:04:35.127 --> 00:04:37.377
is gonna look like this,
it's gonna have this kinda

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:40.565
hockey stick j shape right over here.

00:04:40.565 --> 00:04:42.836
And if you let these rabbits
reproduce long enough,

00:04:42.836 --> 00:04:44.823
they would frankly take over the planet,

00:04:44.823 --> 00:04:47.894
if they had enough food and
they had enough space to do it.

00:04:47.894 --> 00:04:50.693
But if you notice I keep
saying if they have enough food

00:04:50.693 --> 00:04:52.696
and if they have enough space.

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:55.124
The reality in the world
is that there is not

00:04:55.124 --> 00:04:56.905
infinite food and infinite space,

00:04:56.905 --> 00:05:00.123
and it isn't the case that
there are no predators,

00:05:00.123 --> 00:05:03.000
or competition for resources.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.753
And so there is actually a
maximum carrying capacity

00:05:05.753 --> 00:05:08.670
for certain part of the environment

00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:12.134
for a certain type of species.

00:05:12.134 --> 00:05:13.896
And so what's more likely to happen,

00:05:13.896 --> 00:05:17.775
what we described right over
here, is exponential growth,

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:21.942
exponential growth, and why is
it called exponential growth?

00:05:23.134 --> 00:05:26.884
Well you notice, we are
growing by the input,

00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:32.367
which is time, is being
thrown into our exponent.

00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:35.946
And so that is exponential
growth, but obviously

00:05:35.946 --> 00:05:38.186
you can't have an
infinite number of rabbits

00:05:38.186 --> 00:05:40.157
or you can't just grow forever.

00:05:40.157 --> 00:05:45.008
There is going to be some
natural maximum carrying capacity

00:05:45.008 --> 00:05:47.507
that the environment can actually sustain.

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:49.705
And so the actual growth
that you would see,

00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:53.246
when the population is well
below that carrying capacity,

00:05:53.246 --> 00:05:56.829
is reasonable to model it
with exponential growth,

00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:59.860
but as it get closer and closer
to that carrying capacity,

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.739
it is going to axiom up towards it,

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:05.998
so it's gonna get up towards
it, but not cross it,

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:07.090
and that's just a model.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.217
There are other situations
where maybe it goes up to it,

00:06:10.217 --> 00:06:12.889
and it crosses it, and
then it cycles around it,

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.218
so these are all different
ways of thinking about it,

00:06:15.218 --> 00:06:17.583
but the general idea is you
wouldn't expect something

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:20.972
to just grow unfettered forever.

00:06:20.972 --> 00:06:24.094
Now this blue curve,
which people often use

00:06:24.094 --> 00:06:26.253
to model population,
especially when they're

00:06:26.253 --> 00:06:29.263
thinking about the
population once they approach

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:31.693
the environment's carrying capacity.

00:06:31.693 --> 00:06:36.532
This is, this kinda s shaped
curve, that is considered,

00:06:36.532 --> 00:06:38.664
that's called logistic growth,

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.904
and there is a logistic
function that describes this,

00:06:40.904 --> 00:06:43.091
but you don't have to know it in the scope

00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:45.851
of a kinda introductory biology.

00:06:45.851 --> 00:06:48.738
There's a logistic, logistic growth,

00:06:48.738 --> 00:06:50.988
and it's described by
the logistic function.

00:06:50.988 --> 00:06:53.936
If you're curious about
it, we do have videos

00:06:53.936 --> 00:06:56.386
on Khan Academy about logistic growth

00:06:56.386 --> 00:06:58.126
and also about exponential growth,

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:00.668
and we go into a lot more detail on that.

00:07:00.668 --> 00:07:03.638
But the general idea
here is when populations

00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:07.106
are not limited by their
environment, by food,

00:07:07.106 --> 00:07:11.273
by resources, by space, they
tend to grow exponentially,

00:07:12.217 --> 00:07:14.165
but then once they get close,

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:16.583
that exponential growth
no longer models it well,

00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:19.874
once they start to really
saturate their environment,

00:07:19.874 --> 00:07:21.935
or they start to get
close to that ceiling,

00:07:21.935 --> 00:07:24.785
and overall the logistic,
or logistic function,

00:07:24.785 --> 00:07:28.045
or logistic growth, is a better model

00:07:28.045 --> 00:07:31.128
for what is actually going to happen.
