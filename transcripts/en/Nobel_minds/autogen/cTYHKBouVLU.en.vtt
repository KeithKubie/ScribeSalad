00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570
in manufacturing and other situations
 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.780
in manufacturing and other situations
where you can design the environment

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790
where you can design the environment
 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.759
where you can design the environment
around the robot so the robot doesn't

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769
around the robot so the robot doesn't
 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.199
around the robot so the robot doesn't
have to be intelligent to do its

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209
have to be intelligent to do its
 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.500
have to be intelligent to do its
function so that's one big set of

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510
function so that's one big set of
 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.479
function so that's one big set of
problems that I think will really see

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489
problems that I think will really see
 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.670
problems that I think will really see
progress on and the other I hope is

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680
progress on and the other I hope is
 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.979
progress on and the other I hope is
going to be the real understanding of

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989
going to be the real understanding of
 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.150
going to be the real understanding of
language so speech is is a wonderful

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
language so speech is is a wonderful
 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.350
language so speech is is a wonderful
thing to be able to

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360
thing to be able to
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.029
thing to be able to
to turn into text but if you don't

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039
to turn into text but if you don't
 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.040
to turn into text but if you don't
understand the text then the world's

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050
understand the text then the world's
 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.510
understand the text then the world's
best speech recognition system is

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520
best speech recognition system is
 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.330
best speech recognition system is
completely useless so the real

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340
completely useless so the real
 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.219
completely useless so the real
understanding of language means means

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229
understanding of language means means
 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.379
understanding of language means means
not that you can process you know 100

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389
not that you can process you know 100
 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.170
not that you can process you know 100
billion pages and you know and count how

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180
billion pages and you know and count how
 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.790
billion pages and you know and count how
many times the word Shakespeare appeal

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800
many times the word Shakespeare appeal
 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.920
many times the word Shakespeare appeal
or something like that it's it's that

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930
or something like that it's it's that
 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.629
or something like that it's it's that
you actually you know even if it's just

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639
you actually you know even if it's just
 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.899
you actually you know even if it's just
a page that you can really extract the

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909
a page that you can really extract the
 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.119
a page that you can really extract the
meaning and answer detail questions

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129
meaning and answer detail questions
 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.790
meaning and answer detail questions
about what was said why was it said how

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800
about what was said why was it said how
 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.740
about what was said why was it said how
does it relate to information or taken

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750
does it relate to information or taken
 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.260
does it relate to information or taken
from another document if that takes

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270
from another document if that takes
 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.679
from another document if that takes
place on you know with one page then

00:05:03.679 --> 00:05:03.689
place on you know with one page then
 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:05.659
place on you know with one page then
very quickly you'll see that scale up to

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669
very quickly you'll see that scale up to
 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.420
very quickly you'll see that scale up to
100 billion pages and then you've got

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430
100 billion pages and then you've got
 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.249
100 billion pages and then you've got
machines that are read and understood to

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259
machines that are read and understood to
 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.019
machines that are read and understood to
some degree everything the human race

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:12.029
some degree everything the human race
 

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.769
some degree everything the human race
has ever written and that will be a

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:15.779

capability that we can only begin to

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849
capability that we can only begin to
 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.480
capability that we can only begin to
guess how important that would be you

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490
guess how important that would be you
 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.429
guess how important that would be you
know it would put search engines Google

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:22.439
know it would put search engines Google
 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.269
know it would put search engines Google
and so on into the shade as a technical

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:26.279
and so on into the shade as a technical
 

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:28.309
and so on into the shade as a technical
advance so we've heard lots of optimism

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319
advance so we've heard lots of optimism

crystal ball here hey somebody asked me

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139
crystal ball here hey somebody asked me
 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.170
crystal ball here hey somebody asked me
to predict this and and it's not telling

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180
to predict this and and it's not telling
 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.719
to predict this and and it's not telling
me anything since since I but thank you

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729
me anything since since I but thank you
 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.040
me anything since since I but thank you
for making it worthwhile to have direct

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050
for making it worthwhile to have direct
 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:59.149
for making it worthwhile to have direct
it um since in in 1975 I predicted that

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159
it um since in in 1975 I predicted that
 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.189
it um since in in 1975 I predicted that
by 1980 we would have solved the dialog

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199
by 1980 we would have solved the dialog
 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.709
by 1980 we would have solved the dialog
problem I've given up this is a

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719
problem I've given up this is a
 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.619
problem I've given up this is a
tradition I didn't I actually had a full

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:06.629
tradition I didn't I actually had a full
 

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.779
tradition I didn't I actually had a full
plan for it you know I did means in

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:08.789
plan for it you know I did means in
 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.329

reasoning well we needed in 1980 so we

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:11.339
reasoning well we needed in 1980 so we
 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.760
reasoning well we needed in 1980 so we
must have this by 76 77 said me get

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770
must have this by 76 77 said me get
 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.749
must have this by 76 77 said me get
there so um I think so first of all I

00:06:17.749 --> 00:06:17.759
there so um I think so first of all I
 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.990
there so um I think so first of all I
agree with what what in some sense both

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000
agree with what what in some sense both
 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.800
agree with what what in some sense both
Harry and Stuart said but i would i

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810
Harry and Stuart said but i would i
 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.499
Harry and Stuart said but i would i
would add one thing to it which is if we

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:27.509
would add one thing to it which is if we
 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:29.809
would add one thing to it which is if we
take seriously what we talked about in

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819
take seriously what we talked about in
 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:31.490
take seriously what we talked about in
the previous panel with human computer

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500
the previous panel with human computer
 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.159
the previous panel with human computer
interaction and also take seriously that

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169
interaction and also take seriously that
 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.350
interaction and also take seriously that
we're not trying to replicate humans but

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360
we're not trying to replicate humans but
 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.779
we're not trying to replicate humans but
instead to augment them i think we can

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789
instead to augment them i think we can
 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.690
instead to augment them i think we can
take many of the partial solution

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700
take many of the partial solution
 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.970
take many of the partial solution
that Harry talked about and combine them

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980
that Harry talked about and combine them
 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.660
that Harry talked about and combine them
with with well-designed interfaces to

with with well-designed interfaces to
 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.870
with with well-designed interfaces to
really increase what people are able to

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880
really increase what people are able to
 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.500
really increase what people are able to
do and here I mean both what people in

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510
do and here I mean both what people in
 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.870
do and here I mean both what people in
their everyday lives can be doing

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880
their everyday lives can be doing
 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.640
their everyday lives can be doing
because the machines are enhancing them

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:57.650
because the machines are enhancing them
 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.710
because the machines are enhancing them
but also what scientists can do in their

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720
but also what scientists can do in their
 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.380
but also what scientists can do in their
own work which I think actually it is a

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390
own work which I think actually it is a
 

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.660
own work which I think actually it is a
good segue over to Michael yeah thank

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670
good segue over to Michael yeah thank
 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.660
good segue over to Michael yeah thank
you your perspective back to the

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670
you your perspective back to the
 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.400
you your perspective back to the
original question about the ups and

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410
original question about the ups and
 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.460
original question about the ups and
downs of artificial intelligence and I

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:12.470
downs of artificial intelligence and I
 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.820
downs of artificial intelligence and I
think you're getting up and down when

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830
think you're getting up and down when
 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.420
think you're getting up and down when
achievements don't match the

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430
achievements don't match the
 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.220
achievements don't match the
expectations and i would say instead of

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.230
expectations and i would say instead of
 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.380
expectations and i would say instead of
blaming the achievements blame the

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:20.390
blaming the achievements blame the
 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.090
blaming the achievements blame the
expectations for some reason the word

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:22.100
expectations for some reason the word
 

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.490
expectations for some reason the word
artificial intelligence leads the hyper

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500
artificial intelligence leads the hyper
 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.910
artificial intelligence leads the hyper
and this hype is not always achieved

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:27.920
and this hype is not always achieved
 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.160
and this hype is not always achieved
very often also things are achieved that

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:30.170
very often also things are achieved that
 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.720
very often also things are achieved that
weren't explains it I find it quite

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:31.730
weren't explains it I find it quite
 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.390
weren't explains it I find it quite
difficult to distinguish between

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400
difficult to distinguish between
 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.490
difficult to distinguish between
computing artificial intelligence you

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.500
computing artificial intelligence you
 

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.010
computing artificial intelligence you
know big data it's all just using

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.020
know big data it's all just using
 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.650
know big data it's all just using
computers to do things so for example

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660
computers to do things so for example
 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.610
computers to do things so for example
there are computers could multiply

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:42.620
there are computers could multiply
 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.690
there are computers could multiply
phosphoryl i could probably in 1935 like

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:46.700
phosphoryl i could probably in 1935 like
 

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.430
phosphoryl i could probably in 1935 like
what's around then but I didn't see I

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440
what's around then but I didn't see I
 

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.140
what's around then but I didn't see I
mean no one feels bad that computers of

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.150
mean no one feels bad that computers of
 

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.870
mean no one feels bad that computers of
better words multiplying and you know

and predicting where the poachers are

00:11:34.949 --> 00:11:34.959
and predicting where the poachers are
 

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.989
and predicting where the poachers are
going to be so that's an example of

00:11:36.989 --> 00:11:36.999
going to be so that's an example of
 

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:38.819
going to be so that's an example of
something that's here now that wouldn't

very well there were you said that we
 

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:07.110
very well there were you said that we
should really blame for the these

and and so on so i would draw a
 

00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:47.160
and and so on so i would draw a
different curve which is that the

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:47.170
different curve which is that the
 

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.110
different curve which is that the
progress has been like this and that

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120
progress has been like this and that
 

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.970
progress has been like this and that
there are breakthroughs and what we

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:50.980
there are breakthroughs and what we

where for example in speech recognition

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:32.300
where for example in speech recognition
 

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.420
where for example in speech recognition
where it becomes more valuable to a

you know one thing I was just thinking

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:18.210
you know one thing I was just thinking

you know one thing I was just thinking
about is so there's a lots of different

ways and if you don't know about it you

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:25.860
ways and if you don't know about it you
 

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.010
ways and if you don't know about it you
should know about it so but so basically

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020
should know about it so but so basically
 

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.530
should know about it so but so basically
it it basically breaks all privacy

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:30.540

larger amounts of information than we
 

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.740
larger amounts of information than we
can handle and I can think of two

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:31.750
can handle and I can think of two
 

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.260
can handle and I can think of two
examples one which is quite close to

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:36.940
Michael's interest which would be the
 

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.570
Michael's interest which would be the
massive amount of information we have in

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:39.580
massive amount of information we have in
 

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.510
massive amount of information we have in
molecular biology about the functioning

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520
molecular biology about the functioning
 

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.830
molecular biology about the functioning
of cells and organs which is far too

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:46.840
of cells and organs which is far too
 

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.320

much for any individual person to

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:49.330

much for any individual person to
understand there are about a million

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:50.920
understand there are about a million
 

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.460
understand there are about a million
papers published every year on these

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:53.470
papers published every year on these
 

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.230
papers published every year on these
topics then if you read any one of them

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240
topics then if you read any one of them
 

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.540
topics then if you read any one of them
right there they named 500 molecules in

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:57.550
right there they named 500 molecules in
 

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.770
right there they named 500 molecules in
the first pages and so I think this is

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:01.780
the first pages and so I think this is
 

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.310
the first pages and so I think this is
regular just a cognitive capacity to

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320
regular just a cognitive capacity to
 

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.010
regular just a cognitive capacity to
handle this is a real bottleneck so if

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:08.020
handle this is a real bottleneck so if
 

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.210
handle this is a real bottleneck so if
we could use that information and use it

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:12.220
we could use that information and use it
 

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.340
we could use that information and use it
to build a consistent picture which

wouldn't be a definitive picture because
we don't have definitive answers but it

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720
we don't have definitive answers but it
 

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.020
we don't have definitive answers but it
would represent the uncertainty that we

would represent the uncertainty that we
 

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.400
would represent the uncertainty that we
have about information because one of

wonderful way of learning about
 

00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:08.230
wonderful way of learning about

disagreements we ask you're just a very
 

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.090
disagreements we ask you're just a very
very simple question which you're only

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:55.100
very simple question which you're only

allowed to answer with one word which
has to be a number okay so the question

00:28:00.519 --> 00:28:00.529
has to be a number okay so the question
 

00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:04.779
has to be a number okay so the question
is how many years from now will human

00:28:04.779 --> 00:28:04.789
is how many years from now will human
 

00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:09.090
is how many years from now will human
will will machines be able to actually

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:09.100
will will machines be able to actually
 

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.009
will will machines be able to actually
match human ability on all cognitive

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:12.019
match human ability on all cognitive
 

00:28:12.019 --> 00:28:14.680

it's never gonna happen by all cognitive

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:16.370
it's never gonna happen by all cognitive
 

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.460
it's never gonna happen by all cognitive
tasks I mean not only playing chess and

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:18.470

translating French into Mandarin but I
also mean making a really good omelet

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:24.590
also mean making a really good omelet
 

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.769

Alma let that you approve of if you plug

00:28:26.769 --> 00:28:26.779
Alma let that you approve of if you plug
 

00:28:26.779 --> 00:28:28.450
Alma let that you approve of if you plug
the machine into a sufficiently good

the machine into a sufficiently good
 

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.940
the machine into a sufficiently good
mechanical system so you can say a

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:30.950
mechanical system so you can say a
 

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:34.840
mechanical system so you can say a
number between zero and infinity when

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:34.850
number between zero and infinity when
 

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.220
number between zero and infinity when
you think there's at least fifty percent

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:36.230
you think there's at least fifty percent
 

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.470
you think there's at least fifty percent

00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:40.879
human level AI you want to go first let
 

00:28:40.879 --> 00:28:42.009

me have a chance to qualify it

00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:42.019
me have a chance to qualify it
 

00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:43.800
me have a chance to qualify it
afterwards I have a request

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:43.810
afterwards I have a request
 

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.710
afterwards I have a request
yeah you won't be too surprised by this

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720
yeah you won't be too surprised by this
 

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.340
yeah you won't be too surprised by this
question but everything you mentioned

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:49.350
question but everything you mentioned
 

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:53.640
question but everything you mentioned
was the kind of subject matter issue are

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:53.650
was the kind of subject matter issue are
 

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.540
was the kind of subject matter issue are
you also asking about machines that are

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:57.550
you also asking about machines that are
 

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.700
you also asking about machines that are
going to be good psychotherapist and

00:28:59.700 --> 00:28:59.710
going to be good psychotherapist and
 

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:02.610
going to be good psychotherapist and
friends are we leaving that human k % of

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:02.620
friends are we leaving that human k % of
 

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:05.070
friends are we leaving that human k % of
human capabilities as I hope out of the

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080
human capabilities as I hope out of the
 

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.140
human capabilities as I hope out of the
equation I would leave it up to you to

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:07.150
equation I would leave it up to you to
 

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:08.580
equation I would leave it up to you to
make your own definitions but I would be

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:08.590
make your own definitions but I would be
 

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.560
make your own definitions but I would be
very broad and say that's absolutely a

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:10.570
very broad and say that's absolutely a
 

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.150
very broad and say that's absolutely a
cognitive task because we do it with our

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:12.160
cognitive task because we do it with our
 

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.100
cognitive task because we do it with our
brains when we're psychologists so if

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.110
brains when we're psychologists so if
 

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:17.040
brains when we're psychologists so if
you think machines are you we're your

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:17.050
you think machines are you we're your
 

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.590
you think machines are you we're your
including the hypothalamus yeah

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600
including the hypothalamus yeah
 

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.220
including the hypothalamus yeah
everything works so just say one number

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:23.230
everything works so just say one number
 

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:24.720
everything works so just say one number
really quickly and then it'll be very

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:24.730
really quickly and then it'll be very
 

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:26.520
really quickly and then it'll be very
interesting to see if there's a big

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:26.530
interesting to see if there's a big
 

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:29.820
interesting to see if there's a big
spread 300 years 300 years what about

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:29.830
spread 300 years 300 years what about
 

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.280
spread 300 years 300 years what about
you infinity cuz I wouldn't include the

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.290
you infinity cuz I wouldn't include the
 

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.360
you infinity cuz I wouldn't include the
hypothalamus okay and what about you I'm

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:36.370
hypothalamus okay and what about you I'm
 

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:39.870
hypothalamus okay and what about you I'm
not gonna give a number till the last

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880
not gonna give a number till the last
 

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.430
not gonna give a number till the last
time I was asked to give a number was in

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440
time I was asked to give a number was in
 

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.130
time I was asked to give a number was in
an officially off the record session

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:44.140
an officially off the record session
 

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.390
an officially off the record session
where journalists were not allowed to

take notes let alone report anything and
 

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.840
take notes let alone report anything and
so I said off the record possibly within

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:51.850
so I said off the record possibly within
 

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.400
so I said off the record possibly within
a lifetime of my children one of whom

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:53.410
a lifetime of my children one of whom
 

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.250

at 300 years so why don't we each go

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.210
at 300 years so why don't we each go
 

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.060
at 300 years so why don't we each go
around and I think you should go this

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:16.070
around and I think you should go this

scientific point of view you look at the
 

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.070
scientific point of view you look at the
data you have then you mix sudden

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.850
don't use chemical weapons we hardly use
nuclear weapons and so you know I think

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:27.860
nuclear weapons and so you know I think
 

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.970
nuclear weapons and so you know I think
that they need to be limits set

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:30.980
that they need to be limits set
 

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:32.920
that they need to be limits set
I was a find it quite difficult to

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:32.930
I was a find it quite difficult to
 

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.530
I was a find it quite difficult to
distinguish between artificial

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:35.540
distinguish between artificial
 

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.320
distinguish between artificial
intelligence and computing so for

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:38.330
intelligence and computing so for
 

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.270
intelligence and computing so for
example is my iphone an artificial

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280
example is my iphone an artificial
 

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.460
example is my iphone an artificial
intelligence device is it an interface

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:42.470
intelligence device is it an interface
 

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:45.280
intelligence device is it an interface
device is it a calculating machine my

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:45.290
device is it a calculating machine my
 

00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:47.020
device is it a calculating machine my
feeling is that it certainly egg ments

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:47.030
feeling is that it certainly egg ments
 

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.840
feeling is that it certainly egg ments
my intelligence and as such I am very

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:49.850
my intelligence and as such I am very
 

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:51.760
my intelligence and as such I am very
happy to see it as artificial

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:51.770
happy to see it as artificial
 

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.240
happy to see it as artificial
intelligence so I you know I think that

00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:54.250
intelligence so I you know I think that
 

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.500
intelligence so I you know I think that
there's no doubt that computing is going

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:56.510
there's no doubt that computing is going
 

00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.359
there's no doubt that computing is going
to become more and more important

00:37:58.359 --> 00:37:58.369
to become more and more important
 

00:37:58.369 --> 00:38:00.460
to become more and more important
everything we do and I hope we can

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:00.470
everything we do and I hope we can
 

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:01.690
everything we do and I hope we can
really get things better I think the

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:01.700
really get things better I think the
 

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.000
really get things better I think the
fact that world poverty has fallen by a

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.010
fact that world poverty has fallen by a
 

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:05.740
fact that world poverty has fallen by a
factor of two in 25 years which is

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:05.750
factor of two in 25 years which is
 

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.300
factor of two in 25 years which is
unbelievable yeah I don't even believe

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:07.310
unbelievable yeah I don't even believe
 

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:08.770
unbelievable yeah I don't even believe
the numbers I bet there has a lot of

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:08.780
the numbers I bet there has a lot of
 

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.740
the numbers I bet there has a lot of
technical technological input to that

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:11.750
technical technological input to that
 

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.109
technical technological input to that
those are really nice perspectives and

00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:14.119
those are really nice perspectives and
 

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:16.270
those are really nice perspectives and
we have a lot certainly to be optimistic

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:16.280
we have a lot certainly to be optimistic
 

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.700
we have a lot certainly to be optimistic
about their where is shortly going to go

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:18.710
about their where is shortly going to go
 

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:20.260
about their where is shortly going to go
to some audience questions during our

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:20.270
to some audience questions during our
 

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.870
to some audience questions during our
last five minutes just to spur you in

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880
last five minutes just to spur you in
 

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:25.900
last five minutes just to spur you in
the audience to ask questions let me ask

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:25.910
the audience to ask questions let me ask
 

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:28.780
the audience to ask questions let me ask
one last quickie round that all of you

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:28.790
one last quickie round that all of you
 

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:30.910
one last quickie round that all of you
here again so we saw a poll this morning

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:30.920
here again so we saw a poll this morning
 

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.300
here again so we saw a poll this morning
we're about two-thirds of you here in

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:34.310
we're about two-thirds of you here in
 

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.520
we're about two-thirds of you here in
the room guessed that we would get human

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:36.530
the room guessed that we would get human
 

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.320
the room guessed that we would get human
level artificial intelligence in this

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:38.330
level artificial intelligence in this
 

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.359
level artificial intelligence in this
century so let's for a moment give our

00:38:40.359 --> 00:38:40.369
century so let's for a moment give our
 

00:38:40.369 --> 00:38:41.470
century so let's for a moment give our
audience the benefit of the doubt

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480
audience the benefit of the doubt
 

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.320
audience the benefit of the doubt
regardless of what what what we said

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:44.330
regardless of what what what we said
 

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:47.710
regardless of what what what we said
here on stage suppose some time in the

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:47.720
here on stage suppose some time in the
 

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.200
here on stage suppose some time in the
century or even later we do get the

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:50.210
century or even later we do get the
 

00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.430
century or even later we do get the
human level intelligence then my

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:51.440
human level intelligence then my
 

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.780
human level intelligence then my
question is and here again you should

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:52.790
question is and here again you should
 

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:54.490
question is and here again you should
just say a number for your answer on a

00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:54.500
just say a number for your answer on a
 

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.349
just say a number for your answer on a
scale from 0 to 10 how do you feel about

00:38:59.349 --> 00:38:59.359
scale from 0 to 10 how do you feel about
 

00:38:59.359 --> 00:39:03.430
scale from 0 to 10 how do you feel about
this where where where how concerned do

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440
this where where where how concerned do
 

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.200
this where where where how concerned do
you feel where 10 means you're really

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:05.210
you feel where 10 means you're really
 

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:09.190
you feel where 10 means you're really
quite concerned that it might go bad 0

00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200
quite concerned that it might go bad 0
 

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.690
quite concerned that it might go bad 0
means you're absolutely do not worry at

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:10.700
means you're absolutely do not worry at
 

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.520
means you're absolutely do not worry at
all and you feel so guaranteed

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:12.530
all and you feel so guaranteed
 

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.620
all and you feel so guaranteed
everything is going to be fine so

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:14.630
everything is going to be fine so
 

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.900
everything is going to be fine so
supportive right we'll get human level

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:16.910
supportive right we'll get human level
 

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:20.070
supportive right we'll get human level
at some point how worried are you zero

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:20.080
at some point how worried are you zero
 

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:25.300
at some point how worried are you zero
all right an optimist ah if by human

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:25.310
all right an optimist ah if by human
 

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:27.880
all right an optimist ah if by human
level intelligence you mean at least the

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:27.890
level intelligence you mean at least the
 

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.670
level intelligence you mean at least the
ethical standards that most human beings

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680
ethical standards that most human beings
 

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.430
ethical standards that most human beings
have and I'm not worried if you mean

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440
have and I'm not worried if you mean
 

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.760
have and I'm not worried if you mean
that we're just creating intelligent in

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:36.770
that we're just creating intelligent in
 

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:40.359
that we're just creating intelligent in
some other abstract sense with a with no

00:39:40.359 --> 00:39:40.369
some other abstract sense with a with no
 

00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:42.190
some other abstract sense with a with no
as Stuart would actually refer to a

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200
as Stuart would actually refer to a
 

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.150
as Stuart would actually refer to a
value system but I'll say

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160
value system but I'll say
 

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.430
value system but I'll say
no ethics built into the way it operates

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440
no ethics built into the way it operates
 

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.299
no ethics built into the way it operates
and I would be very concerned okay

00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:49.309
and I would be very concerned okay
 

00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:53.630
and I would be very concerned okay
Stewart uh seven so I think I get to

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640
Stewart uh seven so I think I get to
 

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.359
Stewart uh seven so I think I get to
know what Barbara said but she were

00:39:56.359 --> 00:39:56.369
know what Barbara said but she were
 

00:39:56.369 --> 00:39:59.359
know what Barbara said but she were
being good in case I'm a number yes yeah

00:39:59.359 --> 00:39:59.369
being good in case I'm a number yes yeah
 

00:39:59.369 --> 00:40:03.069
being good in case I'm a number yes yeah
so I coming back to the question of

00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079
so I coming back to the question of
 

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:08.750
so I coming back to the question of
robots invincible robot soldiers this is

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760
robots invincible robot soldiers this is
 

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.609
robots invincible robot soldiers this is
i would say balanced on a knife-edge we

00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619
i would say balanced on a knife-edge we
 

00:40:10.619 --> 00:40:13.359
i would say balanced on a knife-edge we
could see within five or ten years that

00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:13.369
could see within five or ten years that
 

00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:16.279
could see within five or ten years that
most of the major powers are actually

00:40:16.279 --> 00:40:16.289
most of the major powers are actually
 

00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:18.140
most of the major powers are actually
operating their defense systems largely

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:18.150
operating their defense systems largely
 

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.799
operating their defense systems largely
using autonomous weapons which I think

00:40:21.799 --> 00:40:21.809
using autonomous weapons which I think
 

00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:25.220
using autonomous weapons which I think
could be extremely unstable and quite

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:25.230
could be extremely unstable and quite
 

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.720
could be extremely unstable and quite
dangerous situation with those weapons

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:26.730
dangerous situation with those weapons
 

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:29.660
dangerous situation with those weapons
be able to take take your rock I mean

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:29.670
be able to take take your rock I mean
 

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.880
be able to take take your rock I mean
we're not not just fighter bombers I go

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:31.890
we're not not just fighter bombers I go
 

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:34.609
we're not not just fighter bombers I go
in there and occupied territory uh yes

00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619
in there and occupied territory uh yes
 

00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:36.380
in there and occupied territory uh yes
yes I mean you could you could imagine

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:36.390
yes I mean you could you could imagine
 

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.990
yes I mean you could you could imagine
yeah thousand such robots who would go

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:39.000
yeah thousand such robots who would go
 

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.910
yeah thousand such robots who would go
in and yeah that's it required okay why

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920
in and yeah that's it required okay why
 

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.130
in and yeah that's it required okay why
don't just make sure the harry gets a

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140
don't just make sure the harry gets a
 

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.809
don't just make sure the harry gets a
before we go to court in so just to

00:40:47.809 --> 00:40:47.819
before we go to court in so just to
 

00:40:47.819 --> 00:40:49.460
before we go to court in so just to
clarify heavens we're gonna meetings

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:49.470
clarify heavens we're gonna meetings
 

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.740
clarify heavens we're gonna meetings
actually he's really worried about but

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:51.750
actually he's really worried about but
 

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.390
actually he's really worried about but
it clearly has the hope that we can get

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400
it clearly has the hope that we can get
 

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.269
it clearly has the hope that we can get
things right yeah he didn't say 10 yes

00:40:55.269 --> 00:40:55.279
things right yeah he didn't say 10 yes
 

00:40:55.279 --> 00:40:58.940
things right yeah he didn't say 10 yes
no then I'm exactly you know 10-7 so I

00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:58.950
no then I'm exactly you know 10-7 so I
 

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:00.740
no then I'm exactly you know 10-7 so I
actually goes three I would say of

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:00.750
actually goes three I would say of
 

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.480
actually goes three I would say of
course we should be worried about and I

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:02.490
course we should be worried about and I
 

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.069
course we should be worried about and I
actually was talking to you Barbara in

00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079
actually was talking to you Barbara in
 

00:41:04.079 --> 00:41:06.950
actually was talking to you Barbara in
at lunch time that the ethics ethics

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960
at lunch time that the ethics ethics
 

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.049
at lunch time that the ethics ethics
concerns we should have as we develop

00:41:09.049 --> 00:41:09.059
concerns we should have as we develop
 

00:41:09.059 --> 00:41:11.210
concerns we should have as we develop
this kind of technology especially in on

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220
this kind of technology especially in on
 

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.010
this kind of technology especially in on
the emotional side with human being and

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020
the emotional side with human being and
 

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.690
the emotional side with human being and
of course you know is this kind of

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700
of course you know is this kind of
 

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.460
of course you know is this kind of
powerful technology you know potential

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:16.470
powerful technology you know potential
 

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.049
powerful technology you know potential
you know powerful weapons and other

00:41:18.049 --> 00:41:18.059
you know powerful weapons and other
 

00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:20.180
you know powerful weapons and other
things we mentioned about with robots

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:20.190
things we mentioned about with robots
 

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:22.519
things we mentioned about with robots
and the way they are we have to be very

00:41:22.519 --> 00:41:22.529
and the way they are we have to be very
 

00:41:22.529 --> 00:41:24.019
and the way they are we have to be very
careful you know how we actually use

00:41:24.019 --> 00:41:24.029
careful you know how we actually use
 

00:41:24.029 --> 00:41:26.150
careful you know how we actually use
this kind of technology just like how we

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160
this kind of technology just like how we
 

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.250
this kind of technology just like how we
actually use nuclear weapons know those

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260
actually use nuclear weapons know those
 

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.799
actually use nuclear weapons know those
things right just that you cannot go all

00:41:30.799 --> 00:41:30.809
things right just that you cannot go all
 

00:41:30.809 --> 00:41:32.720
things right just that you cannot go all
the way down to zero at all so you have

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:32.730
the way down to zero at all so you have
 

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.279
the way down to zero at all so you have
to be concerned good I want to just get

00:41:34.279 --> 00:41:34.289
to be concerned good I want to just get

00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579
the order to give the audience a chance
 

00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:36.980
the order to give the audience a chance
to ask a couple of quick questions

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:36.990
to ask a couple of quick questions
 

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:38.660
to ask a couple of quick questions
before we don't want to be the one

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:38.670
before we don't want to be the one
 

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:40.549

not statements and we'll try to answer
 

00:41:48.119 --> 00:41:50.539
not statements and we'll try to answer
briefly to max can I say something yeah

00:41:50.539 --> 00:41:50.549
briefly to max can I say something yeah
 

00:41:50.549 --> 00:41:51.890
briefly to max can I say something yeah
while we get the question right go for

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:51.900
while we get the question right go for
 

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.990

um that Michael said which is he thinks

00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339
um that Michael said which is he thinks
 

00:41:56.339 --> 00:41:57.070
um that Michael said which is he thinks
of AI

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:57.080
of AI
 

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:59.140
of AI
computing is the same thing and as we

00:41:59.140 --> 00:41:59.150
computing is the same thing and as we
 

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:03.640
computing is the same thing and as we
think about the risk the risk of cyber

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:03.650
think about the risk the risk of cyber
 

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.270
think about the risk the risk of cyber
warfare of cybersecurity permeates all

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280
warfare of cybersecurity permeates all
 

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.420
warfare of cybersecurity permeates all
of this there's also the risk of the

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:10.430
of this there's also the risk of the
 

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:12.790
of this there's also the risk of the
handoffs that I that I talked about and

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800
handoffs that I that I talked about and
 

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.800
handoffs that I that I talked about and
there's the risks of buddy but buggy

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:14.810
there's the risks of buddy but buggy
 

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:17.980
there's the risks of buddy but buggy
code which also permeates all of this so

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:17.990
code which also permeates all of this so
 

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.440
code which also permeates all of this so
I think that the fact that AI and

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:20.450
I think that the fact that AI and
 

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.510
I think that the fact that AI and
computing are so closely intertwined

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:22.520
computing are so closely intertwined
 

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.820
computing are so closely intertwined
means that the risks are closely

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:24.830
means that the risks are closely
 

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.280
means that the risks are closely
intertwined as well a very good point so

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:27.290
intertwined as well a very good point so
 

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.720
intertwined as well a very good point so
quick questions and we'll try to do

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:28.730
quick questions and we'll try to do
 

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.100
quick questions and we'll try to do
quick answers it's squeezing a couple

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:30.110
quick answers it's squeezing a couple
 

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.140
quick answers it's squeezing a couple

feels most eager to feel this one is the
 

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.030
feels most eager to feel this one is the
one person for each question since we're

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:04.040
one person for each question since we're
 

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.600

the answer is no that that computers can

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000
the answer is no that that computers can
 

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.270
the answer is no that that computers can
interact quite well with people without
