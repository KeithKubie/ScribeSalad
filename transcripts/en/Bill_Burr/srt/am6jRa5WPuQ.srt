1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,950
Okay.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,950
Hey, what's going on and spill? Burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,300
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. Yeah.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,530
[inaudible]

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:12,610
just checking in on you.

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,820
I'm just checking in on just
seeing how your week's going.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,740
You know a lot of people when
they podcasts for one week,

8
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:23,880
they don't fucking think about their
listeners for the rest of the week,

9
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:27,210
but you know what, not this
guy, I think about you.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,150
I think I think about you.

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:34,140
What was it that was
fucking guns and roses,

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,910
right? All that fucking falsetto
singing back then. Oh Lee,

13
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,190
you woo hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hoo, Hoo,

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,230
hoo.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,280
Everyone will go nuts and they would
have their fucking lighters up in the air

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,370
already. Right out of the
gate. You can say, Gee, Bill,

17
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:58,040
you have a lot more energy
than you've had lately.

18
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,230
What's going on with you while ty,
what's going on?

19
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:06,231
Today's the last day we're wrapping on
the movie front run of storing a Hugh

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,670
Jackman directed by Jason Reitman.
Um,

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,120
this is the last day.

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,300
I'm very excited because I think
it's going to be a great movie.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,950
And I also get to go home and see my yeah.
Family is that my daughter over there?

24
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,570
MMM.
Very cool.

25
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:27,480
I got a quick little run in New York and
then I'm done and I'm just done for the

26
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:31,460
rest of the year. Other than the Times
I go to New Mexico and Arizona. Okay.

27
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:36,830
I mean, I still am a traveling
comedian. I still am a plate spinner,

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,790
but uh, I'm pretty much home til like
the end of January, which is awesome.

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,610
So I will be spending that time
with my family and uh, going in,

30
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,400
punching up and editing some
of the first cuts of a season,

31
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:53,500
three of f is for family. That's what I'm
doing, you know, getting into the, uh,

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,160
thanksgiving spirit.
Thanksgiving often overlooked.

33
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,330
Okay. You know, the second Halloween
comes along, everybody goes, oh shit,

34
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,950
it's the fucking Christmas season.

35
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,910
But people forget that there's a holiday.
You know,

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,400
the holiday, you don't have to have
any gifts. All you gotta do is show up.

37
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,980
You show up the Wednesday
before thanksgiving,

38
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:20,030
you go down to the local bar and a lot
of the checks that you were too afraid to

39
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:21,860
talk to are going to be down there.

40
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,280
A lot of the chicks that were afraid to
be talked to or going to be down there,

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,160
everybody's looking for
some sentimental sex. Right.

42
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,430
What are some,
what if encounters,

43
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:35,580
okay,

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,270
sorry. I don't mean to go.
All Harvey Weinstein here.
All of that was consensual.

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,630
All right.
Jesus Christ.

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,330
There's just one accusation
after another finally beat.

47
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,370
All these famous people are
starting to go like, yeah,

48
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:50,610
I have no idea who that is or, yeah, I
dunno. I Dunno. I don't remember that.

49
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,390
You know, which I was surprised right
out of the gate. They didn't do,

50
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,080
I'm not condoning their behavior.
I'm just saying legal advice.

51
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:00,821
Yes.

52
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:05,710
Later after the jazz has disappeared off
for you throughout the plant that you

53
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:06,910
fucking came on,

54
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,130
you'd think that these people would go
into denial like that fucking Supreme

55
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,160
Court judge. God, I, I don't know what
you're talking about. I didn't do that.

56
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:19,390
I just went back to my study and I was
reading on how to become a better person

57
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,750
this slowly starting to do
that. Um, but anyways, why,

58
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:27,710
why bill?
Why on such a,

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,620
a glorious holiday month would
you bring up such a scandal?

60
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,520
Um, there should be like, you know what,
you should start doing like a, like,

61
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,710
you know, you have like a
dead pool. They should do.

62
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,020
You should do like a pool
now where you just fucking,

63
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,230
you try to bend on who's the next person.

64
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,080
Yeah.

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,900
I can't even say anything because it's
not funny to Fuckin accuse somebody that

66
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:52,240
shit.
Um,

67
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,773
okay.

68
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,870
I'm trying to think of anybody who I've,
and I ain't going to fucking do that,

69
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,670
but let's get it.
Let's go with something positive.

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,820
I went to the best music store.
I've been to an [inaudible] since,

71
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,480
I dunno when with the best
commercial on Youtube,

72
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:11,420
which I am going to post off of the Monday
morning podcast, Twitter account, uh,

73
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,040
Portman's music store in Savannah,

74
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:19,600
Georgia is hands down the best
music store I've been to. Um,

75
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,050
what do you want? Uh, you want
a French horn? They got it.

76
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,440
You want a bassoon? They got it.
You want to Didgeridoo? They got it.

77
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Are you an old man and you got to read
some charts and your fucking eyes had

78
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:36,290
gone. They actually sell readers up
at the, up at the counter a little,

79
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,470
you know those glasses when you don't
want to just waste your money getting a

80
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:42,600
prescription, do you just go out and you
get the readers? You just try some her, I,

81
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,850
these are all good things that
go right. They sold those, uh,

82
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:49,370
I went over there just to get some
drum sticks and next thing you know,

83
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,440
I'm actually thinking of buying a trumpet.

84
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:52,880
Okay.

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,850
I always loved the trumpet. I always love
the power of that fucking instrument,

86
00:04:55,851 --> 00:04:58,010
you know?
And uh,

87
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,420
I actually looked at one for the first
time I had this guy explained to me the

88
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:05,360
whole way that it worked
and I was thinking about it.

89
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,020
And then fortunately I
called my laugh and she goes,

90
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,610
you're not buying a fucking trumpet.

91
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:20,450
Why do wives always do
that? They always, you know,

92
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:23,350
I'm not saying that she was wrong,
but they always do. You like,

93
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:28,330
you're not doing that. You're
not buying a boat. You can do,

94
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,590
you're not putting a speed bag
up on the side of the house. One.

95
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,620
Yeah, it doesn't rain that much
to the tree over it, honey.

96
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,660
We're not doing that right.

97
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,510
They always do that to us,
but one can,

98
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,530
can we always ever sit there
looking at me like, like hunting.

99
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,450
You're not buying another pair of shoes.

100
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,790
You're not buying any more throw pillows.

101
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,880
You already can't sit on the
fucking couch. There's too many.

102
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:58,150
I'm not yelling now.
I am.

103
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,200
Yes, but I, I wasn't. Oh,
you know what? Fuck you.

104
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,120
Yeah. Fuck you fine. I don't give a fuck.
I never didn't want to go there anyways.

105
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,900
Why do you hope to ruin the weekend,

106
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,620
right?
That's the way it goes.

107
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,990
Why can't we do that? What,
you know, we should just,

108
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,250
we've got to figure out what they do.
Obviously we can't start crying, you know?

109
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,120
No fucking send us to some God damn home.

110
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,780
I'm going to do that next time. Uh, buying
a trumpet. You're not buying a trumpet.

111
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:32,360
Dopey

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,020
me.
Tell me.

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,150
She was right in another
life, you know, come on man.

114
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,670
The trumpet with the plunger on the end,
getting that Jimi Hendrix. Why was sound,

115
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,340
maybe that's why, that's probably
where he got it from. Right?

116
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,220
He probably wanted to have that sound
in the guitar because he was probably

117
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:57,510
listening to somebody playing a fucking
horn. I don't know what, but uh,

118
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,200
I always loved the trumpet and the
trombone and the sac sex phone's kind of

119
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:04,170
hacky to like,
that's like Lichen Guitar.

120
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,770
Everybody likes fucking guitar. Everybody
likes somebody who comes to horns.

121
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:12,360
Everybody likes to saxophone. Write the
fucking, Trump owns the shit, right?

122
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,010
The trumpet,
the ability to do a big band.

123
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,620
And those four trumpet players
show up. They fucking, you know,

124
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,840
they stand up and they start
playing their little section.

125
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,160
They almost knock you out of your seat.

126
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,633
MMM.

127
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,570
I Dunno man. They will fucking cool.
And they were expensive as shit.

128
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,820
Like the cheapest one was like that they
had, there was like six, seven, 800 bucks.

129
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,171
You want to,

130
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:40,410
parents are always fucking freaking out
when their kid stops playing the trumpet.

131
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:42,330
It's like, dude, you know,

132
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,630
I could have bought a new ride Moa.

133
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,340
Do you know what stopped me from playing
the trumpet? Other than, uh, just poor,

134
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,110
you know, musical gifts was, I didn't
want to get that fucked up live.

135
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,320
And then the guy behind the
counter told me, he said,

136
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:03,220
all that's just poor technique.
That's just from Preston. I probably,

137
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,050
your amateur or whatever the fuck they
call it is wrong. So to make up for it,

138
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,290
you got to press it against your lips and
then you get like that, that you know,

139
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,230
yeah, you look like somebody beat you
with a trumpet rather than you play one.

140
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:19,850
Right? And he's like, no,
you just want to be relaxed.

141
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,660
You want to be relaxed since everything
is that in life, you know what I mean?

142
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:28,380
Do you want to be relaxed? You want to
hit a home run? Don't try and kill it.

143
00:08:28,381 --> 00:08:30,660
Just swing through the fucking zone.
But the bat,

144
00:08:30,661 --> 00:08:35,070
meet the ball there it goes right
in a little league field for me.

145
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,880
Professional guys, they could hit
it out of Fenway plaque, right?

146
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,870
Stop trying to kill it. Golf. You want to
drive it a bunch of yards there, right?

147
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:47,490
You want to show off?
You're on the first tee heavy.

148
00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:50,250
All the fucking white
dude standing behind you.

149
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,470
One woman in somebody of color so nobody
can say you're fucking membership is

150
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:57,210
racist, right? You fly them in,

151
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,810
everybody's standing there watching
you. You're waiting to tee off, right?

152
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,280
You feel in the sweat going down the
Becky a ball bag. And what do you do?

153
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,660
You grip it a little tighter.

154
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,780
You fucking go back like John Daly is
swing outside your zone and you fucking go

155
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:18,090
through your little hat with the
pompom falls off, you fall on your ass,

156
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,110
you white slacks, get a grass date on
them. And where does the ball go? Huh?

157
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,800
Fucking record shades off the
ladies tees and everybody snickers,

158
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,890
everybody snickers and
you're in a bad mood.

159
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,360
You have a bad round and then you fucking
come home. You throw your clubs down,

160
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,253
right?

161
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,740
And then you wife comes out and once
you to emote and next thing you know you

162
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:41,790
get your hands around her throat,
right? Her eyes are rolling back.

163
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,390
She's making dents on the file,
what you need, you know how it is,

164
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,223
right?

165
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,620
You know how it ends.
It ends with a trip to home depot.

166
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:55,120
You buy in a pickax and some sort
of live and all you had to do,

167
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,700
all you had to do was just relax.

168
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,810
Go up this smile and wave at all
your so called friends that you know,

169
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:06,080
a rooting against you. You
know, stay within yourself,

170
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,540
be nice and relaxed.
Don't give a shit,

171
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,830
let the face meet the fucking ball there
it goes right down the goddamn fairway.

172
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,513
But no,

173
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,080
you tried to kill it and one and it ended
up happening. An innocent woman died.

174
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,230
Right? And how are you
going to get caught? Huh?

175
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,600
Cause of the back of her
head. The imprints going to
be on the hood of the car.

176
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,420
They come over there to dust it,
right?

177
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,560
And then they'll still be able to tell
it's the perfect shape of her skull with

178
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:40,140
the little blue little ponytail, you
know? And then you just sit there.

179
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:43,540
That's when you break down on the,
on the fucking stand, like all,

180
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,500
I'm one of those classic, uh, iron side,

181
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,900
the right writer with man.

182
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,400
Remember those old stupid court dramas,

183
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,820
the early days of movies
and television shit.

184
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,190
All the Ed to do is just ask the person,

185
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,590
the defendant a bunch of quick questions.

186
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,343
You know,

187
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,470
it just be like, you went golfing that
day, didn't you? Yeah. What about it?

188
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,110
Everyone was watching it one day.

189
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,870
They were watching and you squeezed the
glove clutter. I know I didn't Jabba.

190
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,150
And You keep saying, then you went home
and he tells you, I write it. I did it.

191
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,780
She never believed in my golf game.
She right.

192
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:32,670
They always did that. And then they
always shook women and slapped them.

193
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,350
Yeah.

194
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,680
You know, but that was the backbone. Oh,
Hollywood. And for some fucking reason,

195
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:42,340
67 years late, everybody's surprised
that people are running around,

196
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,960
grabbing people by their private,
Eh, finishing on a plant.

197
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,710
Um, anyways, I guess, was it the midterm
elections? I don't. What happened?

198
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:55,780
All I know is I was down on
the set and somebody said, hey,

199
00:11:55,781 --> 00:12:00,370
it's a good good day for Democrats.
And I was just like,

200
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,760
uh, what do you mean? He goes
yesterday, man, he said the Democrats,

201
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,740
Democrats fucking killed it yesterday.
And my first thought was, well,

202
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:12,970
did they elect good Democrats?
You know what I mean?

203
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,140
I don't like how people look at politics
the way they look at their sports team.

204
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,220
You know what I mean?
Where like if it's a bad call,

205
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:24,580
as long as it goes into the favor of your
team, you're like, ah, that was fine.

206
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,990
You know, like Hillary supporters
doing that stupid. Thank you Hillary,

207
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,930
which was probably started by her people.

208
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,400
MMM,
okay.

209
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,950
I don't understand what
people on the left are doing.

210
00:12:37,951 --> 00:12:40,200
Still trying to push her over the top.

211
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:44,460
At some point you just got to admit you
wasted a draft pick and you got to move

212
00:12:44,461 --> 00:12:45,600
on to somebody else.

213
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,640
I've never seen somebody just keep coming
back like fucking Freddy Krueger since

214
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:53,110
probably Richard Nixon.

215
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,430
That has to be her spirit
animal. My favorite, my fucking,

216
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,380
I didn't just say favorite.

217
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:05,220
That's the thing I hate the most when
people say so and so is my spirit animal.

218
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,540
We fucking 11. You got
a pen pal too? Um, yeah,

219
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:16,350
like if I was her, I would just, I would
look, I would look at Richard Nixon

220
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,610
and be like, okay, this guy lost you.

221
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,950
No one on the radio last on TV.
He was sitting there, you know,

222
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,190
sitting there like how you normally sit,
right? He's got sweat on his upper lip.

223
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,020
JFK comes in all tanned up.
He's got his legs crossed,

224
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:39,320
like he's doing panel on the
fucking tonight's show. You know,

225
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:41,780
all the women are watching going off.

226
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:44,750
I had to think a political dick
that would be the deck. Right?

227
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,260
So everybody fucking votes, you
know, thinks that he one on TV,

228
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,870
Nixon loses the election and then he lost
the governor's race in California and

229
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:55,550
literally was out of politics

230
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,710
in that eight years later.
Oh,

231
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:04,200
tricky Dick came back and
won the fucking White House.

232
00:14:04,201 --> 00:14:05,730
I think that's what
Hillary is trying to do.

233
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,023
MMM.

234
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,520
But just watching everybody on the left,
just ignoring,

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
completely turning a fucking blind eye
to the fact that Bernie Sanders got more

236
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:20,880
votes and the debt,
they admitted it in court.

237
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:25,881
The Democratic National Party colluded
with her campaign to make her the fucking

238
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:28,950
representative. I mean, can
you give me a fucking break?

239
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,720
She's fucking sitting here bitching about
the electoral college. I don't get it.

240
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,070
I get, if you're, you're a woman and
you want a woman to be president,

241
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:42,240
but you know, can you pick a
good one? Can we start with that?

242
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,913
MMM.

243
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,970
I mean, how much more corrupt can,
I don't know. I just don't get it.

244
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,580
People and being a namerd
with either the bushes and the Clintons,

245
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:59,960
I, I've had enough with them. I
want a new last name lying to me.

246
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,290
Is that asking too
much? Um, but so anyway,

247
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:07,430
so I checked out some of those elections
and I'm way in over my head here,

248
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:10,790
but I just saw these weird headlines like,
congratulations,

249
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,770
such and such state,

250
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:18,070
you elected the first transgendered
person way to go Vermont or way to go do

251
00:15:18,441 --> 00:15:23,180
jersey. You elected the
first Muslim, whatever,

252
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:25,580
that this seat guy or whatever,
I don't know how to say to whatever,

253
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,320
there was nothing in there that you
elected somebody who was qualified that's

254
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,000
going to do a great fucking job.

255
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:36,140
Who happens to be Polynesian or whatever.

256
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,330
I don't understand it. Read the
exact same. Well that's like,

257
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,620
that's like how white supremacists vote.
You know,

258
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,410
they vote strictly by you know,
race or whatever.

259
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:55,760
Like that doesn't make any sense. Like
can we just vote for people who are good,

260
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,810
who actually have demonstrated that they
can not be swayed by money and they're

261
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,670
actually going to do what's going to be
good for the environment that's going to

262
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,890
be good for,
for poor people,

263
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:12,380
middle class people that's going
to be good for this country.

264
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:17,590
Don't just fucking vote for somebody
because of their genitalia or,

265
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:20,750
or you know, I mean, I
don't get, I don't get it.

266
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:25,751
This whole fucking idea that
that sociopath's selfish people.

267
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:31,811
Liars are only white male heterosexuals
and that only they are susceptible to.

268
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:38,390
Um, being weak when they get
positions of power is, is,

269
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,350
is not a good road to go down is the
only thing I'm going to say. You got to,

270
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,820
I don't know how you, uh, figure out
what the fuck somebody going to do,

271
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,010
but like to just be excited that somebody
got in there because of their sex or

272
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,850
their race is a,
is a very short sighted way to look at it.

273
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,610
You've got to look at what the
fuck they did is all I'm saying.

274
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,540
And I did not see that in the
headline. I just thought, oh good,

275
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:04,850
this person's in there,
you know?

276
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,780
But I feel like that's how we
try to fix shit. Like, oh my God,

277
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,530
there was eight years of Democrats.
Fuck this. Let's do, let's,

278
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,830
let's vote all Republican. Oh,
wait a minute. That doesn't work.

279
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,640
Let's go all Democrat.
That's what we just keep fucking doing.

280
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:23,480
And now we're going to do
that. I think on a, a, uh, a,

281
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,650
uh,
what do you call it?

282
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,510
Gender and a race thing is what they're
going to do and it's going to be

283
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:32,480
fucking, I'm telling you, you're
going to see the exact same scandals.

284
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,840
I did not have sex with that woman.

285
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,630
You wait, I want to see how this plays
out when they get in there, right?

286
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,493
When the non,

287
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,640
he's get in there and they got
their own private fucking subway,

288
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,410
you know everybody's eating
fucking lobster, you know,

289
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:59,940
and it's all just sitting there dangling.
You know, you want to be present.

290
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:01,620
Hey Buddy, you want to
be president, right?

291
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,970
And they got to get in bed with all
of these evil fucking corporations.

292
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:09,740
And then when they get in there, they
got to do what those corporations want,

293
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,150
right? They got to do what the fuck
they want. And then if they do,

294
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,200
then you end up like, like
Obama, like Bush, like Clinton,

295
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:20,690
like all of these fucking
people after their president.

296
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,310
Then you go on the fucking
bribe money tour going out,

297
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,930
air quote giving speeches, right?
Why are you still giving speeches?

298
00:18:29,931 --> 00:18:32,660
You're not president anymore.
You know what I mean?

299
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,560
Is Dan Marino walking around with
the football still throwing passes.

300
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,430
He's retired. What the fuck
are you all your collect? Yeah.

301
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,350
Obama right now is on tour.

302
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,950
$69 million tour giving speeches.

303
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,893
Let's say the guy,

304
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:56,010
does it give a good speech
but 69 million in one year.

305
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,580
The Fuck Outta here. The fuck out of
here? Who's he going to go talk to? Huh?

306
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,320
What was he talking to, Joe
six pack? I don't think so.

307
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,350
Um, I know that was a very
bleak way of looking at it,

308
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:12,920
but there's something positive in there.
I think we need as,

309
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,960
as everybody represented,
obviously in government,

310
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,750
but you got to make sure
that you're not just voting,

311
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,643
you know,

312
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,710
just to get a woman in there or
somebody's got to make sure they're good.

313
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:30,780
And that is, that is my
problem with the Clintons.

314
00:19:30,781 --> 00:19:32,580
I just think that they're just fucking,

315
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,670
they like, I don't even know what they
are. They just sold his fucking people.

316
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,570
There's gotta be somebody better than
her. All right. But you know, Democrats,

317
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:43,680
if you want to hang your hat around,

318
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:47,790
somebody with Mike Dukakis is fucking
charisma. Who's is comfortable in his own,

319
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,120
her own skin is Al Gore to fucking loses.

320
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,010
They can't say no to people
lost the election. Um,

321
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,280
have you ever heard me talk
politics as much in your life?

322
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,950
Would you think someone who doesn't watch
Fox News or CNN or MSNBC or anything

323
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:06,870
else who kind of just gets his news from
overhearing one comment from somebody

324
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:10,050
on a set? Well, doing
eight lines in a movie.

325
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,140
Um, anyways, so let's get back into my
wheelhouse. All right. What happened?

326
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,030
This is the podcast.
I fucking talk about what I want.

327
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:24,390
I talked about buying a trumpet
and I'm talking about a, you know,

328
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,080
be funny if a woman gets in into office
like, like, what is she gonna like,

329
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:31,650
how is she going to give it to,
you know,

330
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:33,830
yeah.

331
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,280
She gotta get like a bunch of
fucking [inaudible] like j crew,

332
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,900
like boy toys running around
the White House. Uh, who knows.

333
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:46,600
I don't know what they're going to do.
She'd probably go like that.

334
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:51,310
That Ferdinand Marcos chick there who
had like fucking 50,000 fucking shoes.

335
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,290
That's what it is. Guys are into
like, fuck it. We're animals, right?

336
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,710
Ladies are into stuff.
Maybe that's what it is.

337
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,950
They'll blow the entire defense budget
on like broaches or some shit. All right.

338
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,040
This is some of the dumbest
Shit I've ever said. Um,

339
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,670
I hope it makes you feel better
about yourself. All right. Oh,

340
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,810
the last day of the shoot, 84
days sober. I did it. All right.

341
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,000
I booked this thing. I was a fat
booze bag. I stopped fucking drinking.

342
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,080
I did it.

343
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,080
So can you and I'm so I'm a little
nervous here because now the shoot ends

344
00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:29,380
tonight and uh,
so now what do I do?

345
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,560
It's this weird thing where I don't
want to, I don't want to end my streak.

346
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,150
I forget.
I get at least a hundred days,

347
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:38,260
then I've gone through Thanksgiving
without drinking. But is that a bad thing?

348
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,090
You know what I mean?
Rather than, you know,

349
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,660
drinking and kind of forgetting half the
meal and then waking up at four in the

350
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:51,450
morning with the TV still on,
you know,

351
00:21:51,451 --> 00:21:54,870
sweat my ass off in some Thanksgiving
sweater being like, what the fuck?

352
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:59,430
Where is everybody? Did I
say goodnight? You know,

353
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:04,230
next day you go downstairs, you talked
to your wife, feel like a good morning.

354
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,120
She just looks at you and keeps brushing
your teeth. You're like, oh fuck.

355
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:12,930
MMM.

356
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,850
Did you have fun yesterday?

357
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,400
She stops brushing your teeth,
slams a hand down on the counter,

358
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,770
spits out the fucking turns the sink
on it, turns it off, and then turn.

359
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,190
So you're like, oh fuck. What
did I do? What did I say?

360
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,500
I don't want to do that.
I'll do that the day after,

361
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,060
right when I watch all
those rivalry games,

362
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:43,490
hoe did the Alabama Crimson tide
against the Auburn Tigers? Um,

363
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,050
I'm missing everything. I don't know
what's going on in the world. Uh,

364
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:50,950
I had a lot of people send me a

365
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:52,340
okay,

366
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,460
you know, tweets and t, uh,
texts and all that shit.

367
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,940
Unfortunately about the fatal crash.

368
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,463
Oh,
Bob,

369
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,610
sorry, I just clicked this
fucking thing off of, uh,

370
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,450
Roy Halladay and uh, yeah,
that's fucking brutal.

371
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,070
That's brutal.

372
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,760
Did see that guy in Boston sports
radio just fucking went off on him.

373
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,323
MMM.

374
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,041
You know,

375
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:22,850
what's hilarious about that whole clip
is he makes his point in the first like

376
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,810
eight seconds. He says what he feels
about it and then continues to say it.

377
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,200
I almost thought it was like on a loop.
He just kept going, oh, look at me.

378
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:34,510
I got to play the idea.
I'm waving at the fucking window.

379
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:37,360
He said that like nine times.
Um,

380
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:42,160
I was kind of done with the guy when
he called Halladay, uh, Jack Wagon

381
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,170
who says,
I understand you can't curse on the radio.

382
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:55,040
Um, I dunno, but the weird thing is
that there's, they're blaming the,

383
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,210
they're starting to
blame the plane and uh,

384
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,030
I don't think that's right. I mean,
if it's pilot error both times,

385
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:05,270
I don't think that that, you know,
what's scary is the other one. Right.

386
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:09,200
And have you thought about this the
first time that type of plane crashed?

387
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:10,370
I guess the test pilot,

388
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,870
he was flying into this
canyon flying low and he,

389
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,350
they're guessing that he thought he was
in this different part of the canyon

390
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:20,450
that was going to,
it opened up to a lake.

391
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,670
But this one didn't like it started
to get narrow and then he went into

392
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:29,140
basically a mountain called DSEC and if,

393
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,620
and basically the angle that he would've
had to fly out if he pulled back on the

394
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:35,570
stick,
he was going to fucking stall.

395
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,190
So he had to try to do
bang a UAE basically,

396
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,010
I would think. Um, yeah,

397
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,020
that's why I like a
helicopter cause you just go,

398
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,130
just stop those fucking things.

399
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,170
You have to keep like a shark.

400
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,920
They've got to keep moving forward
other than that's fucking it. Um,

401
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,470
but I gotta tell you, man, that plane
looks cool as hell. It really does.

402
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,640
It really looks cool. And um, I dunno,

403
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,810
but all of this shit where
people speculate and all
that, just shut the fuck up.

404
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,320
All right. The FAA will
investigate and like whatever.

405
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:17,660
And in a certain amount of time,
six months, a year, whatever,

406
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:19,250
they'll come out with
their official report.

407
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,300
All these fucking people who don't fly,
listen to them talk about,

408
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:27,710
it was kind of a, I dunno, it was
kind of funny like this and Oh,

409
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:30,530
this is the third time,
mom, blah blah. You know,

410
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,910
there's a lot of times if something's
easy, people will do dumb shit with it.

411
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,370
Like the helicopter that I
want to buy, you know, it's,

412
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,260
it's basically like the Robinson,

413
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:45,650
but they corrected all the safety
issues on it. First of all,

414
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:50,150
having a fully articulated main rotor
system where you could actually push the

415
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:54,650
stick forward and not enter into some
sort of low GI or mass bumping situation.

416
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,490
So there was a guy that got it and he
was trying to demonstrate how you could

417
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:03,350
fly like an asshole,
which is what you should never do.

418
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:08,240
And he slammed the stick forward and
he went into a nose down attitude.

419
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,390
But it was, it's a carborated
engine and the way the fuel is,

420
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,560
is fed in.
When he tipped it forward,

421
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,520
he basically starved the carburetor
of fuel and he stalled it,

422
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,140
demonstrating that he wouldn't
get into one situation.

423
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:27,290
He created another situation
and that he then crashed it.

424
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,850
So, you know, people
will always, I, you know,

425
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:36,470
the very little that I know about
aviation, whenever a new design comes out,

426
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,740
you know, people are always
like, well, let's see.

427
00:26:39,741 --> 00:26:44,741
Let's let people fly in it and let them
die and then they can fix it and let you

428
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:48,810
warn you about all of this stuff.
But a lot of times it's just people,

429
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:54,390
it's just weird thing where they make
it safer and make it easier and then

430
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,730
someone will then do something.

431
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,263
I don't know,

432
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,480
I'll do something like that,
just slam a stick forward or something.

433
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:04,740
So I have no idea what that guy
was doing, but it's brutal, man.

434
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,450
So obviously condolences out to
him and his wife and kids. Man,

435
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:12,230
it's fucking brutal. Um, all right,
when with that sad frigging story,

436
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,740
um, that guy in Boston radio
though, it was also like,

437
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,260
I feel like it's much as
he felt what he was saying,

438
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,790
he was also trying to be edgy.

439
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,583
MMM.

440
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,610
You know,
and it's one of these things,

441
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:26,800
if anything that he was
saying was actually true,

442
00:27:26,801 --> 00:27:28,570
it's like to kid don't need to say that.

443
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,290
Why are you adding to the pain of his
family if you really give a fuck about his

444
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:35,500
wife and kids? All right. If
somebody did something dumb,

445
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:39,080
everybody knows that they did something
dumb and then they died. Then Shit,

446
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,140
just shut up about it.
Let you should really upsets me.

447
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,520
It upsets you.
Upset you don't even know the fucking guy.

448
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,760
It was such like a car dash she into,

449
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,900
I just felt like for me that
was really upsetting. Um,

450
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,720
anyways. Mian ds everybody, uh,

451
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,200
beyond days, beyond days, don't
slam the fucking stick forward.

452
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,920
[inaudible] if you're in a Cabrini
fucking whatever I want to buy. Um,

453
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,740
why would I go into that? Why? Why the
fuck would I die? What can I say? Ah.

454
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,470
[inaudible] swing the club.
Nice. No single golf club.

455
00:28:19,471 --> 00:28:22,540
Relaxed Doo Doo Doo Doo.
Brds

456
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,390
the,
yeah,

457
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,050
you got nothing that runs through the
legs cause I'm thinking that. Fuck it.

458
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,780
All right. I'm sorry. You know what?

459
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,260
I feel like Casey case am
I just went from a tragic,

460
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,290
tragic fucking story to singing
about underwear right now.

461
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:40,690
You can't make that transition. Me,
Andy's everybody. Me undies makes you,

462
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,130
but [inaudible] will be proud
to wear and check this out.

463
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,230
I'm not the only one who loves me undies.

464
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,450
Listen to what longtime listener
and me undies enthusiasts,

465
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,080
George has to say.

466
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:57,130
[inaudible] I note from George and,
uh,

467
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,830
Bill burr listener and be on ds Fan.

468
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,890
I decided to try at Mandy's BC because
I love bell bar bear. I sat it.

469
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:08,560
Okay. Is that what you
want? All right. I did it.

470
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,890
I tried it on this off bloody
underwear. My Dick liked it. Okay. Um,

471
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,480
I smile every time he sings the song.

472
00:29:17,481 --> 00:29:20,150
Although it's so easy to skip
the eds and the podcasts,

473
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:23,360
I always listened to bill [inaudible]
Baba Baba Baba, you guys know this.

474
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,590
He loves these fucking things.

475
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:29,090
They're nice and comfortable and he loves
me on these cradling the family jewels

478
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:39,740
Go to [inaudible] dot com
slash [inaudible] that's
[inaudible] dot com slash bar

479
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,380
. Well, that was too short.
I should probably read what
the guy said. All right.

480
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,100
I always listened to bill's read and
I'm so glad Mandy's has stuck with them.

481
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,030
It's been probably two years since I
bought my first pair of meundies and now I

482
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:56,290
have a monthly subscription because they
are that comfortable before me undies.

483
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,590
I used to buy the three pack of underwear
in retail stores until I realized that

484
00:29:59,591 --> 00:30:01,900
I wanted to treat my junk to
something more comfortable.

485
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:03,730
And that starts with a
great pair of undies,

486
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:08,170
cradling the family jewels that is
just so slick. The way that is read,

487
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:11,200
it reeks of that.
It was rewritten by the advertisers.

488
00:30:11,201 --> 00:30:13,570
I'm sure there's a George n out there,

489
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,450
but I don't think he wrote
it as eloquently as that.

490
00:30:16,451 --> 00:30:19,810
If he did go to Madison Avenue Kid, you've
got a career, you've got a few chat.

491
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,850

All right, let's continue on here. Um,

509
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,570
I've been so frigging busy traveling
around doing shows and finishing up this

510
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,190
acting gig that I have not watched.

511
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:37,360
One second of my beloved Boston
Bruins and Boston Celtics.

512
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,950
I haven't watched anything.
And a friend of mine on F is for family.

513
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:46,951
A Cleveland Cavaliers Fan was raving
about how well Kyrie Irving was doing with

514
00:31:47,411 --> 00:31:47,951
the Celtics.

515
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:51,970
So I watched a little bit of highlights
last night of the Celtics defeating the

516
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:56,050
Lakers. I saw that Lonzo Ball, is that
his name or is that his dad's name?

517
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:59,530
I saw that he actually played well and
believe in, not even as a Celtics fan.

518
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,740
I'm happy for that Dude
because his fucking dad is
like such a crazy person that

519
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:09,040
it makes people hate this kid.
The kids never said Shit,

520
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:13,570
you can't pick your parents and that
the dude's dad did a lot of good things.

521
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,040
He is playing in the NBA,

522
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,260
but um,

523
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,220
I don't know what he's doing.

524
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,650
Okay.

525
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:25,980
He's fucking wrestling.
I don't know what is the one?

526
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,183
MMM.

527
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,140
I don't know what the fuck he's doing,

528
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:32,260
but that's going to be
one of those things.

529
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,450
To some point that kid is going to have
to make a very uncomfortable break with

530
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,620
his overbearing father,

531
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,470
but the Celtics won and I'm watching the
highlights and I don't know anybody on

532
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:46,530
the team anymore.
We still got Marcus mot.

533
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,810
It seems like we got rid of everybody
else. Crowder, Avery, Bradley,

534
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,970
Isaiah Thomas. I knew they were all
gone. But you know, Kelly, a Lennox gone.

535
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,010
Everybody's fucking God. There's like
two people left from last year's team.

536
00:33:01,011 --> 00:33:05,450
That kid green was looking great.
What the hell did he go? I was all, I,

537
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,290
I missed all of these
fucking trades. So, um,

538
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,780
I dunno, I'm right back to only being
able to name a couple of Celtic. So, uh,

539
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,420
I'm excited that, uh, this, I'm
going to get back into them.

540
00:33:19,421 --> 00:33:23,300
I'm going to get through my,
uh, my little New York run here.

541
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:27,440
Thank you by the way, to everybody that's
coming out to my show Sunday night.

542
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,570
Yeah. And, uh,

543
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,010
in New York City.
Thank you for getting bit in the tickets.

544
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,050
You can watch me trouts and material.
Fuck around,

545
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,420
do some shit that works and do
some shit that doesn't quite work.

546
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,120
And, um, but when I come back,
when I come back, I am a,

547
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,740
that's it. I'm watching the NBA
and NHL package and I can't,

548
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,370
I'm so fucking psyched of going
out on by my nieces and nephews,

549
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:54,660
a bunch of gifts. Uh, I'm going
to come back east for Christmas.

550
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,270
Everybody in my family who hasn't met my
beautiful, gorgeous, lovely daughter. Uh,

551
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,910
my wife sent me video yesterday of the
first time she was on a swing, which are,

552
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,540
you know, thank God for
video. I would have missed it.

553
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,943
MMM.

554
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:11,780
Oh it was just awesome. She was so happy.
And then the way she was sitting there,

555
00:34:11,781 --> 00:34:15,050
she had like an elbow, like she was
hanging out the driver's side window.

556
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,320
She was so totally chill.
She has like a, like a,

557
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,300
like a relaxed confidence about her
and she's a sweetheart, you know?

558
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:28,070
So all I gotta do is not be
an angry maniac. You know,

559
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:32,090
who can do, I'm going to be an angry
maniac, but I'm going to be less of one.

560
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,600
And when she calls me out on it,
when she inevitably learns how to talk,

561
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:37,610
I'm just going to admit to, it'd be
like, you know what, you're right.

562
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:40,520
Daddy needs to work on that
because I don't want to,

563
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:43,850
I don't want to ruin what she looks like.
She's gonna be mad cause she,

564
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,200
I just kids going to be special. You
know, like all dads, I am a little biased,

565
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:52,370
but I'm telling you, um, anyways,

566
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,780
which is another reason to not be
boozing around the frigging house. Right.

567
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,053
Uh,

568
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,100
I think that's what I'm going to do.
I think in, in, in the next year,

569
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,070
I'll keep my drinking on the road.
That's what I'll do.

570
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,290
I live this double life,
stone sober at home,

571
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,100
pushing her on a swing, wearing
sweaters, smiling and waving.

572
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,220
And then on the road I'll just
be in the gutter after my shows.

573
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,570
That's too sad. I would
never do that. Um, anyways.

574
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,900
And I heard that kid for the Bruins,

575
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,400
that kid on bu who stepped up last year
was looking, looking very promising.

576
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:34,040
I heard he's playing really well.
I heard the Bruins of fast.

577
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,950
I know we don't have the greatest
record at this point, but you know,

578
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,160
a long season,

579
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,020
I cannot fucking wait to get
back to my family and just a,

580
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:49,620
you know, I don't know. I'm not
gonna do shit for like two weeks,

581
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,400
right through thanksgiving, right till
the end of this month. And then I'll,

582
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,940
you know, whatever, you'll start getting
busy again. But who gives a fuck?

583
00:35:56,941 --> 00:35:59,430
I'm gonna Really gonna try to enjoy the
holidays this year. I'm getting into it.

584
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,430
All right, I'm going to buy a fucking
tree. I'm going to do the whole thing.

585
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:05,250
Although where I usually buy my tree,
you know,

586
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,640
got all of you and got all fucked
up down there now. So they prepare,

587
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,400
they can't sell the trees there.
Who knows what,

588
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,610
they'll probably knock it down the
building to put up another building.

589
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,770
That's the big move out
here, right? Build these, uh,

590
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,210
I don't know what you call him.

591
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,160
These high rises, luxury
rentals. Do yourself a favor.

592
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,690
Don't rent a luxury apartment when
you can just instead go out and buy

593
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:39,230
a starter house. Throw all that
money down the fucking toilet. Okay.

594
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,200
Please don't do that unless you want
it. If you want to do it, by all means,

595
00:36:42,201 --> 00:36:46,790
go ahead and do it. So, um, I was
reading, I always read drum magazine,

596
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:49,280
I Read Modern Drummer magazine and um,

597
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,040
okay,

598
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,050
I saw this whole article on um,

599
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,150
these drummers favorite like
prog rock bands from the 70s.

600
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,020
And uh, you know, early genesis. You know,

601
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,390
when Peter Gabriel is still in it and
Phil Collins was on drums, King Crimson,

602
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,890
all of these bands. So I actually started
listening to King Crimson, that band,

603
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:16,270
that album red and it's
pretty fucking out there.

604
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,360
This shit is pretty fucking out there.
Some of it doesn't hold up,

605
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:21,260
some of it does.

606
00:37:21,261 --> 00:37:25,850
But when they get into the real trippy
keyboard shit using all the effects and

607
00:37:25,851 --> 00:37:30,590
everything, um, that definitely
gets a little bit nuts. But, uh,

608
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,900
I dunno, I was always curious
of like Bill Bruford strumming.

609
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,020
Like he was always on, you know,
the cover of those magazines.

610
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:41,510
I know he played in yes. And all
that time he's this amazing drummer.

611
00:37:41,511 --> 00:37:46,300
So I was kind of psyched to finally be
able to hear him play. But, uh, I dunno.

612
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,930
I think I'm going to listen
to some of that shit.

613
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,150
If anybody has any good suggestions.

614
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,173
MMM.

615
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:54,381
I don't know.

616
00:37:54,381 --> 00:37:59,381
I can't help but feel like it's very
hipstery a lot of that I don't get into

617
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,250
progressive. I don't mind
fusion. Fusion is cool,

618
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,270
but progressive gets a
little, uh, you know,

619
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:11,210
reminds me of Kevin Murphy wants
what Kevin Murphy listens to.

620
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,630
One F is for family, so I'll just
treat it as like research or whatever.

621
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,150
All right, I'm babbling here. Once again,

622
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:20,810
thanks to everyone's going to come out
to my show Sunday night and thanks to

623
00:38:20,811 --> 00:38:25,310
everybody on front runner,
they gave me a part here in this movie.

624
00:38:25,311 --> 00:38:27,860
I had such a great time on the
shoe and a bunch of people,

625
00:38:27,861 --> 00:38:30,020
just awesome people and

626
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,100
okay,

627
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,550
I'm really excited to get back to my
family and just enjoy the holidays and

628
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,650
everything. This is a great
time of fucking year. You know,

629
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,110
it would've been nice if I could
have said that without cursing,

630
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,410
but I'm not the brightest guy. All
right, go fuck yourselves. Go Celtics,

631
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,510
go patriots. Go Bruins. I
Dunno if we have a soccer team.

632
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:52,000
I don't know what it is, but I'm
just, that's it, man. I'm going home.

633
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:56,110
I'm putting on my fucking pajamas and
I ain't doing shit for the rest of the

634
00:38:56,111 --> 00:38:59,860
fucking year. Except Christmas
shopping, cooking, thanksgiving dinner,

635
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,460
flying back east,
meeting a bunch of relatives,

636
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:06,430
giving out gifts to the out of fucking
crisis. It's always busy, isn't it?

637
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,820
Who gives a shit? All right. Go fuck
yourselves. Have a great weekend.

638
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:15,310
Enjoy the music here. And uh, also,
um, we got another 30 minutes.

639
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,360
If you knew my podcast,

640
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:20,550
we always played like a greatest hits
from a Thursday afternoon podcast. Uh,

641
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,300
you know, from a few years ago. Maybe this
year. I don't fucking know. All right.

642
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,293
See,

643
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,240
you can be the best

644
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,880
[inaudible] [inaudible]
it's

645
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,530
going on. It is a bill burr and it is
the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

646
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:33,070
November 9th, 2009. And yes,

647
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,960
I am a little late with this one.

648
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:40,240
It is a well into Monday evening
here in Los Angeles. And uh,

649
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:45,730
I had, I just had a whirlwind
of a week. I really did.

650
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,620
I really did.
It should been my,

651
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:52,621
my basically my Wednesday,

652
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,570
Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, my last whatever that is,

653
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:57,550
five days should have been filmed.

654
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:03,390
Okay with like that MTV style where
just as you start to focus on what the

655
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:08,791
images they fucking quickly cut to what
you were just looking at from the side

656
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:11,320
in a black and white,
black and white, you know,

657
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:16,000
you know your mother used
to film up punked and Ashton
Kutcher would be standing

658
00:41:16,001 --> 00:41:20,740
there like, okay, check
it out. I'm fucking zippy.

659
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:24,370
Sea Crest is going to get a glazed
doughnut, right? And then Bam.

660
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,430
Then they go from the side and he'd
be fucking sitting there with his hat

661
00:41:27,431 --> 00:41:30,990
sideways. Remember that I had like
a fucking, I had, I had an eight,

662
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,280
like I heard like a
totally TRL experience.

663
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,530
I had an unbelievable fucking week,
you know? Why do I feel like what?

664
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:42,380
I actually feel guilty about
it like telling you guys
that I had an unbelievable

665
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:46,340
week. Like I have to fucking apologize
to you guys during a free podcast.

666
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:50,960
Fuck you. You know I gotta tone it
down. Why? Because your week sucked.

667
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,140
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why did I turn the fucking fan on?

668
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:00,830
It's God damn hottest fucking
hell. In order to this about
my apartment? No. Bill,

669
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,940
what is it? Hang on a second. Let me turn
this fucking thing on. Come on, turn on.

670
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,670
Um, the problem is is I live in a
desert and uh, this time of year,

671
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:12,260
the sun is like three,

672
00:42:12,261 --> 00:42:16,820
four hours where it just beats down
right on the corner of my apartment.

673
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,190
And uh,
it's just sitting there naked.

674
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,980
There's no avocado tree or a whatever,

675
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,960
cactus or any shit to block out the sun.
So it just heats up like an oven.

676
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,770
And then I always try to close
the windows. You know, I've,

677
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,640
I've explained this before because
I say Cantala in the podcast and uh,

678
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,630
I want my neighbors to think
I'm a swell guy. No, I don't.

679
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:40,250
I don't give a shit what they
think. I just don't, you know,

680
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,650
if somebody steals something,
I don't want them to think it was me.

681
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,530
That's basically an all right.
So this was my week.

682
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,910
Listen to this all you fuckers in your
cubicles, Huh? Is it Tuesday morning?

683
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,760
Did you already throw your hands
up and give up on me? Like,

684
00:42:52,761 --> 00:42:56,900
I wasn't going to fucking do it this
week, or at least today. Shame on you.

685
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:00,530
You could have been listening to this
yesterday. At the end of your job,

686
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,750
you know when you're supposed
to be getting all your
spreadsheets in order, Huh?

687
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,700
Right around the time that egg salad
sandwiches starting to bug you and you're

688
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:11,660
thinking,
can I,

689
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,650
can I shoot it right into the fucking
staples office chair that I'm sitting on

690
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,240
that sorta has some sort
of foam underneath it? Um,

691
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,260
isn't that the worst?

692
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,230
When you have a sit down job and you
have a chair you can't fart into,

693
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,040
that's really bad. You know, you've got,

694
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,800
you've gotta wear like two pairs of
boxers every time you have Mexican. Right.

695
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,640
Jesus, Bill, shit jokes, three minutes.
Right. Right into the podcast. Huh?

696
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,030
This is how it's going to be. Sorry,
I was just adjusting myself here.

697
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,770
Not that kind of way.
Just to Justin everything cause I,

698
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,860
it's a long fucking story.

699
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,740
What I have to go through to turn the
fan on and keep the podcast going.

700
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:51,440
I have to stretch the technology
out. All the why is, um, all right,

701
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:53,270
this was my week. Alright, Wednesday,

702
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:59,410
Wednesday I fly to a JFK
in New York City and um,

703
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,920
cause I'm getting ready
for my big town hall show,

704
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,240
my First Theater Gig in New York City,
right?

705
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:13,870
So I'm on my way there and I land right
around five 30 just in time for the

706
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:16,430
fucking traffic.
And low and behold,

707
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:20,750
the Yankees are playing game six of
the fucking world series. All right.

708
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:23,270
And if they win that night,
they're gonna wrap the shit up.

709
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,350
I'm staying in a hotel in Times
Square. I bring my girl along, right?

710
00:44:28,351 --> 00:44:32,490
It's a big fucking weak for me, you know,
and I'm sitting there riding and going,

711
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:36,930
please let the Phillies win. Please
let the fucking Phillies win, you know,

712
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:38,940
and then when games seven so I can walk,

713
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,000
watch all those fucking sad sack Yankee
fans with those satin Yankee jackets

714
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,170
that they wear.
You know,

715
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,220
like they're in some biker gang
on fucking happy days. I don't,

716
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,600
they're like one of the only teams left.
It's still has those satin jackets.

717
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,960
Um, anyways, but it was
not to be right. Then. Um,

718
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,200
I started to watch games,

719
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:05,220
sex and Pedro's on the mound and he
starts off with like an 84 mile an hour

720
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,090
fastball and I just really had a bad
feeling that I was going to watch the end

721
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:12,270
of his career that night and he was
going to let up like 17 runs and I,

722
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:15,420
I couldn't watch it, so
I shut it off. So, uh,

723
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,620
I have to do opie and Anthony in
the morning. So I take my vitamins,

724
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:23,640
I go to sleep or whatever, uh,
try not to get sick on the road.

725
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,290
And right around right around writers,
I'm starting to nod off.

726
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,460
I hear the first screaming that I
would hear for the next three hours.

727
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,840
I just hear like way off,
you know,

728
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,260
basically where I'm sitting in Times
Square is about a half a block away.

729
00:45:42,261 --> 00:45:46,400
So all I hear right is about rate and
not off and get a nice eight hours sleep

730
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:50,180
right before I go to do the morning radio.
All of a sudden I just hear like

731
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:55,260
[inaudible] well, good stories. Yeah.

732
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:57,350
Woo.

733
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:00,800
Right. Couldn't really make
it out. It wasn't that clear.

734
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,520
And then I started hearing from
her, I'm sorry, these horns blowing.

735
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:09,050
And it was like the whole fucking stadium.
I guess they want it.

736
00:46:09,051 --> 00:46:12,590
I figured it out at that point. That's
like the whole fucking stadium decided,

737
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,180
what do we do now?

738
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:18,290
Let's go to time square and keep bill
up for the next fucking three hours.

739
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:22,640
And that's what they did. And it
was so loud. It's so ridiculous.

740
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:24,170
I was actually sitting there

741
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:29,410
with my head in between two pillows,
like I was having a fucking like,

742
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,160
like a head sandwich. Right? It was
so fucking loud and so ridiculous.

743
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:38,750
I was actually laying there laughing.
Um, and one of the fucking odds, right?

744
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,210
One of the, one of the, one
of the biggest red sox fans,

745
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:46,160
one of the guys who hates the Yankees
the most, okay, I live 3000 miles away.

746
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,690
What are the fucking odds?

747
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,920
This one random day I'm going to fly
in and they're going to win the world

748
00:46:51,921 --> 00:46:55,940
series and that is going to decide to
celebrate half a fucking block away.

749
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,470
So, uh, that was my first night. Um,

750
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:02,750
and the next night I did a Gig for a,

751
00:47:02,751 --> 00:47:05,660
actually I didn't height this gig because
I was trying to sell tickets for my

752
00:47:05,661 --> 00:47:08,720
town hall Gig. And, um,

753
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,040
I actually on Thursday I opened for this
up and coming comedian then I'm sure

754
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:17,870
all you guys [inaudible] you're going
to know about soon a guy by the name of

755
00:47:17,871 --> 00:47:22,340
Dane Cook. I don't know if you've
ever heard of him. Just uh, you know,

756
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:25,070
up and coming guy, you know,
just, just trying to plug away,

757
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:31,390
I opened up for them at Madison Square
Garden, I a 10 minutes and it was,

758
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:34,750
wasn't like the, the, the
theater at Madison Square Garden.

759
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:38,370
It was where the next play.
And uh,

760
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,710
I'm trying to think the last time
I worked with him on the road,

761
00:47:41,711 --> 00:47:46,711
I think maybe we did a college
gig together about 15 years ago,

762
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:52,000
way back when we were starting out in
Boston. So it was, uh, I gotta tell Ya,

763
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,090
that's, it's been a long time
since I did a gig that wasn't like,

764
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:56,950
if I do Letterman,
I get butterflies.

765
00:47:56,951 --> 00:48:00,520
But it's been a long time since I've done
a standup gig where I got that wasn't

766
00:48:00,521 --> 00:48:04,330
going to be on TV and I
actually got butterflies. I, uh,

767
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:09,810
I was standing back there waiting to
go on and I was like legitimately,

768
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:14,680
uh, not like nervous to the point that
there was going to fuck with my set,

769
00:48:14,681 --> 00:48:16,600
but I was like,
I don't know what it was.

770
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:21,870
I stumped because I kind of got to this
like Madison, it's canyon, right? And uh,

771
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,280
fortunately I had the presence of
mind to be like, you know what?

772
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:28,210
When are you ever gonna get to do this
again, bill? I'm going to go with never,

773
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:33,370
I'm going to bet I'm going to pet the
long shot on this one and guests that

774
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:37,660
you're never going to get to do this
again. So, uh, or most likely, you know,

775
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:41,260
never say never. So why don't you
go up there and fucking enjoy it.

776
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:43,780
And right before Dan does
is shows in the round.

777
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,020
So it's like 20,000 fucking people.

778
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:52,930
And I'm sitting there looking at the stage
and I'm trying to figure out who am I

779
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:56,830
going to look at. So fortunately
before I went out there, I go, Dan,

780
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,890
exactly how does this theater in the
round work it? He goes, it's no big deal.

781
00:48:59,891 --> 00:49:03,070
He goes, it's just like, it's like four
theaters. There's one in front of you,

782
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,880
one of the right one or the left and one
behind. You just break it up like that.

783
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:11,680
Then all of a sudden it didn't, it, it
just made sense. And I went out there,

784
00:49:11,681 --> 00:49:13,720
he actually had a great car.
I mean, I was freaking out.

785
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,320
I knew I was gonna be doing the Gig for
about six days and I was just going on,

786
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:19,180
my God, is this going to be
a bunch of Facebook hotties?

787
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:22,780
And I'm going to go up there saying con
to every other word and that it just can

788
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,780
be looking at me like Wednesday
and coming on. This guy is angry,

789
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,550
but they weren't. They were fucking
awesome. And they totally listened. And,

790
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,010
uh, I was probably, uh,

791
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,210
one of the best 10 minutes sets I
think I've ever had as far as, uh,

792
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,930
many times you get to do a 10 minutes
set and you get to look up at a Stanley

793
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:45,640
Cup champion banner. You know, by the way,

794
00:49:45,641 --> 00:49:49,420
why is Madison Square Garden? Um,
I'm not trying to be a dick here.

795
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:51,850
Why is it considered a basketball Mecca?

796
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,870
They always say that like when Michael
Jordan would go there, it's, you know,

797
00:49:55,871 --> 00:50:00,010
it's a basketball Mecca. Lebron James.
It's, it's a basketball and they,

798
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,820
we say that to basketball Mecca.
All right.

799
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,320
Now fans of the New York Knicks.
All right.

800
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,660
And you're a true fan right now if
you're still watching those bumps. Okay.

801
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,640
Going through a real rough patch.
Um, I wanna I want you to justify,

802
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,140
send me an email and tell me,

803
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,760
explain to me how Madison Square Garden
is considered a basketball Mecca.

804
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,200
How,
okay.

805
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:29,660
The Knicks haven't a
championship since 1972.

806
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,840
I think they won the other
one in like 69 or 70.

807
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,480
They've won two championships.
The fucking spurs have won like what?

808
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:39,620
Four,
five.

809
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:44,330
How is Madison Square Garden a
basketball Mecca if that's a mecca.

810
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,010
What was the old Boston Garden?

811
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:50,390
We want 16 there or say like the La Forum,

812
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:55,190
the La Forum, they won a five, six,

813
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:58,820
seven. I don't know what they want their,
they want a good, they weren't like nine.

814
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:02,870
I think they won nine out
there. Okay. If, if if

815
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,260
Madison Square Garden, I'm not
gonna, I'm not being a dick here.

816
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:10,340
New York City is a
basketball Mecca that uh,

817
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:14,150
Rutger park or whatever the
fuck it is with a goat. Right.

818
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:16,550
He used to fucking,
uh,

819
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:20,430
lift up a refrigerator and put it on
top of the back board is not how the,

820
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,520
the urban myth goes or whatever the
fuck it was. Lew Alcindor. Right.

821
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:30,200
All those guys came from
there. I understand that. I
understand all those players,

822
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,260
but there's only been fun.

823
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:36,950
There's two championship banners
hanging in Madison Square Garden. Okay.

824
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:41,660
So I'm going to kind of be a jerk here
and say that it's not a basketball Mecca.

825
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:46,010
I don't think you've earned the
right, what? College basketball maybe,

826
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:49,340
you know, I dunno. I think he'll let you,

827
00:51:49,341 --> 00:51:52,490
I think you guys really need to win a
lot more. The fucking Chicago Bulls.

828
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:53,870
When six in the 90s

829
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:58,280
it's the first three at old Chicago
Stadium and then the other three.

830
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,740
What at the United Center? Is that how
it went? I don't, I don't fucking know.

831
00:52:00,741 --> 00:52:05,390
All I'm saying is, uh, you guys need to
bring that down a little bit. You know,

832
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,350
that's like you ever see like when
you see a restaurant they, they will,

833
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:13,130
they'll say a welcome to
two world famous blah blah,

834
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:17,960
blahs and you sitting there
really, really, they, they
know about this in Portugal.

835
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:21,800
They don't, you just say in
that, and I think that fucking,

836
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:26,801
you know what Madison Square Garden is
just like Ray's famous pizza in New York

837
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,910
City. Every fucking one claims
to be, there's a couple of,

838
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:35,300
there's a couple of comedy clubs.
The Ward,

839
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:39,530
the world famous fucking Yuk, Yuk, slap
a knee, whatever the fuck they call them.

840
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:43,370
It's like, it's not world
famous. It's not alright.

841
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,640
It isn't okay. Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah. I beat that to death.

842
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,460
I really got off the rails here.
Let me get back to my fucking story here.

843
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:51,080
All right.
Um,

844
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:56,000
so the first night I go Yankees won the
world series and their fans keep me up,

845
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,350
um, for like three hours.
All right. And uh, oh,

846
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:04,310
I actually congratulated the Yankees
on, uh, on the radio the next day,

847
00:53:04,311 --> 00:53:07,760
which is probably very surprising to a
lot of people if you'd like to hear it.

848
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:12,710
Go to the wire, just Google bill burr
opie and Anthony show a Yankee rant.

849
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:14,330
For some reason they called it a rant,

850
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:18,410
but I was actually congratulating them
and I meant everything that I said and it

851
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,410
might've sounded like I was being
a little sarcastic, but I wasn't.

852
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:24,290
Anyways,
let me plow ahead.

853
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:27,870
So the next night I opened for Dane
at Madison Square Garden, right.

854
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,920
I'm fucking is pictures of
like Frank Sinatra and Elvis,

855
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:35,010
I'm talking to the security guard
has been there for 40 years.

856
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:38,280
He's pointing out where Mike Milbury went
into the stands and beat that guy with

857
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:43,030
his own fucking shoe. Right. The guys
ever seen that. And of course not.

858
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,730
You're not hockey fans actually look,

859
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:49,170
look up Boston Bruins fight fans.
Just looked that up.

860
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:52,020
It was a Bruins rangers game and
I think it was Terry O'Reilly.

861
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:55,050
Somebody grabbed the stick and they
hit him with it thinking, you know,

862
00:53:55,051 --> 00:53:58,500
typical fan like that.
Like that's not a real guy.

863
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,990
He's on skates. I have fucking chuck
Taylor's on. He can't catch me.

864
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:04,890
I don't know how he did it,

865
00:54:04,891 --> 00:54:09,420
but Terry Riley climbed up the fucking
glass and grab this guy and then the rest

866
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:12,660
of the Bruins followed him in the stands.
And um,

867
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,560
this is how far we've come as a society.
Back then.

868
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:21,480
That was probably a story for about five
days. There were lawsuits or whatever,

869
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:22,230
but you never heard about,

870
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:26,400
there was no fucking ESPN who's at came
and it went there wasn't suspended for

871
00:54:26,401 --> 00:54:30,600
life, you know? No. Latrell
Sprewell kind of shit. Nothing.

872
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:31,950
They went up there,

873
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:35,460
they beat fans with their own clothing
and then they went back on the ice and

874
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:38,850
they finish the fucking game
as far as I know. Um, anyway,

875
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:41,450
so then Friday night I,
uh,

876
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:45,870
I did my first theater Gig and I want to
thank everybody who came out there was

877
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:50,490
a huge milestone in my career to be
able to perform in a theater in New York

878
00:54:50,491 --> 00:54:54,870
City and, uh, sell the thing
out. Um, everything went awesome.

879
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:59,220
I got a standing ovation and, um, had, uh,

880
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:02,670
three killer comics on in front
of me, Joe De Rosa, Paul Versey,

881
00:55:02,671 --> 00:55:04,650
and then there was this
curl if this contest winner.

882
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:09,570
And of course her name escapes me at this
point because I talk on my cell phone

883
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:13,170
too much and I can't remember
any fucking thing anymore. Oh,

884
00:55:13,171 --> 00:55:16,860
and speaking of that Shit,
uh, no, no, stay on track.

885
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,190
They'll stay on track because I was
making a couple of corrections from last

886
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:21,023
week. But, uh,

887
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,000
so Saturday night comes Saturday night
I was up in Boston, I did the, uh,

888
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:30,630
comics come home with a Camelia,
Denis leary and all that type of shit.

889
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:32,340
And that was in front of 6,000 people.

890
00:55:32,341 --> 00:55:37,341
So basically over three days I went
on in front of a almost 25,000 people.

891
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,910
And,
uh,

892
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:45,960
now I'm sitting in my bedroom talking
to myself and do an orange fucking

893
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:50,430
microphone. So you know, I'm coming down
a little bit, getting back to reality,

894
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:55,410
you know, how's that for a fucking
weekend? I can't believe it.

895
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:59,160
Unbelievable. I can't believe it.
And then he says unbelievable.

896
00:55:59,161 --> 00:56:01,680
Just in case she didn't realize
that it was unbelievable right. Now,

897
00:56:01,681 --> 00:56:05,640
you know what's funny about me? I'm
actually self conscious right now that a,

898
00:56:05,641 --> 00:56:08,520
I talked about so much good shit
that happened to me. That's,

899
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:13,110
that's what it's like to be a fucking
German Irish Catholic from Boston.

900
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:16,410
That's what it is. Oh my God. A bunch of
good stuff happened. I should feel guilty,

901
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,890
you know? And I almost said fuck you
to you guys. Like you're actually,

902
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:24,070
you give a shit. Either way. I really
got issues. All right, let's uh,

903
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,360
let's make a couple of corrections. All
right. Last week, that racist movie,

904
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:32,830
I was trying to remember the name of it's
birth of a nation and I want to thank

905
00:56:32,831 --> 00:56:35,830
the 87 people who brought
that to my attention.

906
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:39,490
And I also mentioned I was going to
read a book about how to speak better on

907
00:56:39,491 --> 00:56:42,460
stage using, uh, using my voice correctly.

908
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,340
And people want to know the name
of the book that I was reading.

909
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:48,790
I actually lied to you. I'm not
reading it. I keep starting the book,

910
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:52,660
but it's really involved.
It's a selector. Dory or fram.

911
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:55,090
There's emotional when you're deliberate
body. And I'm just like, oh my God,

912
00:56:55,091 --> 00:56:55,750
I hate school.

913
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:59,860
And then I close it and then I'll read
like slashes autobiography or like,

914
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:03,550
what's the guy from the red hot
chili peppers? Anthony Kietus.

915
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:07,000
I'm sort of skipping around his biography.
Um,

916
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,250
but the name of the book is called
freeing the natural voice by Kristin link

917
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:15,000
ladder.
All right.

918
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:19,860
L I. N. K. L. A. T. E. R. M. I just
been doing a lot of shows and uh,

919
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,880
I have a tendency to yell from my throat
rather than down here by the fucking

920
00:57:25,801 --> 00:57:30,360
diaphragm. You like that here? That,
that's fucking Ray's famous pizza.

921
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:36,600
That's an awful burger from a diner.
And that's uh,

922
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:41,520
some bar pizza that I got up in
Boston trying so hard to get in shape.

923
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,260
I just don't think it's going to happen.
Fuck that pat.

924
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:48,510
The whole fucking goddamn summer
to get in shape and I didn't do it.

925
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,780
I've been a fucking idiot. Like
usual. I'm waiting till the last week,

926
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:55,110
like one of these chicks on the
shows right now. I just don't eat.

927
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,370
Then I show up in a strapless
dress with my fucking I fucking,

928
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:03,030
I was gonna say clavicle showing is that
said though. Was that a word? Collarbone.

929
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,870
There you go. What does the clavicle,
is that that thing on your back?

930
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:07,980
That looks like a sale.

931
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,340
What does that your shoulder
blade is that call the clavicle?

932
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:17,990
I don't fucking remember when it radius
Ulna. Tarsal metatarsal Phalanges.

933
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:24,020
Um, [inaudible] anyways, let's, uh,
let's plow ahead here with the podcast.

934
00:58:24,021 --> 00:58:26,660
So I'm actually now I'm like hardcore.
There's no turning back.

935
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,270
I have to drop like 10
pounds before my special.

936
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,750
All my big fucking TV kitchen,
kitchen,

937
00:58:32,751 --> 00:58:36,580
TV sized head is going to look fucking
ridiculous on TV. So I really got it.

938
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:40,640
I got to get the booze weight off and
I actually just went for a bike ride.

939
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:44,630
Um, I was hiking up one of these parks
out here out here at Griffith Park.

940
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:48,950
You know the observatory. You guys
ever see a, that James Dean movie.

941
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,670
Then he filmed something up
there or Charlie's angels.

942
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:56,510
And when those four skinny whores are up
there with their botox in their fucking

943
00:58:56,511 --> 00:59:00,350
twats hanging out, remember that last
scene that, that, that's the observatory.

944
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:06,370
So the other day I was hiking up to it
on foot and I see this fucking like 55

945
00:59:07,641 --> 00:59:10,730
year old guy,
white hair pedaling up the hill.

946
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:14,120
Like he's in a fucking Viagra commercial
and I'm going to look at that son of a

947
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:16,710
bitch. You know, when he had
all the, all that he had all,

948
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,790
he had the whole getup on, you know,
the whole Lance Armstrong outfit.

949
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:21,530
Like he's gonna,
you know,

950
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,570
ride through Paris and throw his hands
up right under the OCTA triumph. Right.

951
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,600
Rather than, he's just riding up
a hill in the middle of a desert,

952
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:33,650
sucking in bus fucking fumes. But I was
impressed and I was like, you know what,

953
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,170
if that old best it can do it,
you know,

954
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,830
and I got to admit 55 and La is like 32.

955
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,750
The way these people work out
out here. All right. And, uh,

956
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:47,530
I'm sorry to the people in the middle
of the middle of this country and, uh,

957
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,900
down south. All right. Unless you
love, and people do that when they,

958
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:53,480
when they insult you and then they say
they're sorry, but you know, they're not,

959
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,680
you know, I get that a lot at the end of
my shows. I didn't think you have funny,

960
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:02,600
you know, I mean, I'm sorry I
didn't and I'm always like, okay,

961
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:07,670
yeah, yeah. Cause you know, it's
like, I know other people did,

962
01:00:07,671 --> 01:00:11,630
but you know, it's like, you know,
I'm sorry, I just, I just didn't,

963
01:00:11,631 --> 01:00:16,610
why do you keep a Paul? You're
not sorry. You're not sorry. Okay,

964
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:17,031
I got it.

965
01:00:17,031 --> 01:00:20,480
You don't like me and I don't give a shit
because you already paid for a ticket.

966
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,330
You paid to watch me annoy you.

967
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:27,800
And I find that I find that humorous.
Um, anyways, let's plow ahead.

968
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:32,801
So I figure I gave myself 10 days to be
able to fucking make it all the way up

969
01:00:33,081 --> 01:00:36,380
to this Goddamn Hill.
And I just did it today in the middle,

970
01:00:36,381 --> 01:00:38,880
all the way up to the top.
I'm not gonna lie to Ya.

971
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:42,140
I feel like I'm going to fucking die.
But I, uh, I actually made it up there.

972
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:45,860
So now I don't know what to do. I thought
that that was going to be my project.

973
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,130
I would just do that every day.
And every day I get a little bit farther.

974
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,010
And while I would focus on
the carrot in front of me,

975
01:00:52,011 --> 01:00:54,920
I would just drop this booze weight.
Right?

976
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:59,450
But what happens the first fucking day?
I go all the way up the goddamn thing.

977
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,130
It's now what do I do?
You know what I gotta do?

978
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:07,320
I gotta join a gym and I
got a Tro to weights around.

979
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,940
That's what I gotta do you know what?
In the mail today,

980
01:01:10,941 --> 01:01:15,590
I got a free 30 days at Gold's gym.
Anybody work at a gym?

981
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,200
How is this free?
30 days going to work out for me.

982
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:23,450
Sign up for three 34 FRI third
I can't even fucking talk.

983
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,790
The Hell is wrong with me.
I know what's wrong with me.

984
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,650
I've fucking flown like 200 hours on
a plane the last goddamn two months.

985
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,680
You should have seen this fucking douche
bag putting his coat in the overhead

986
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:39,290
compartment on my flight out here.

987
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:45,550
I couldn't tell if this guy had the
biggest Yamaka on I'd ever seen in my life

988
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:49,280
or he had just shrunk his jazz hat.
You know,

989
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:52,820
you know those little jazz hats
that those black guys were.

990
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:56,750
And then white guys where when when they
get into jazz to try to act like they

991
01:01:56,751 --> 01:02:00,920
get it to, you know those ones
though, the African colors,

992
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,533
you know,

993
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:08,090
and you just sit there and
talking about a Charlie Parker,

994
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:13,160
you know, in your version of salt
peanuts or whatever the fuck it is.

995
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:18,380
And
I don't know what it was.

996
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,010
Any Jewish people listen to

997
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:22,770
this shit? Huh? Let me ask you a question.

998
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,950
Is it technically still a Yamaka when
it almost goes to the front of the guy's

999
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,280
guys hairline and all the way to
the two ways. Let me this thing,

1000
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:30,450
it looked like a,
like a,

1001
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:36,840
what is that thing the Mexicans
do they use the, uh, the Tortilla,

1002
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,440
right? How fucking ignorant am I
have every goddamn culture out there.

1003
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:44,520
I thought a Yamaka was beanie.
Is that incorrect?

1004
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,720
I call him a beanie for a long time and
I always used to get looks. I was like,

1005
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:52,830
yeah, the guy had the fucking, I
had the fucking beanie thing, the a,

1006
01:02:52,831 --> 01:02:55,710
and then I get looks and it's like,
oh, this kid's, I cursed. That's I say,

1007
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:59,490
fuck when I'm trying to gather my
thoughts. Sometimes the fucking, uh,

1008
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:04,770
beanie rather than saying the, um, Oh
gee, what is that thing called the beanie?

1009
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,160
I put the fucking in front of it
and then it adds an extra edge to it

1010
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:11,310
inadvertently. Then
people like, oh my God,

1011
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:14,150
he doesn't like Jewish people with hats.
Um,

1012
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,280
is it a beanie or is a beanie that thing
with the little propeller on top of it?

1013
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,850
And another question.
Did anybody ever have those?

1014
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,630
Does anybody old enough to actually
answer that fucking question?

1015
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,190
Is that one of those Hollywood things,

1016
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,450
cartoon things that they just acted like
people used to have those back in the

1017
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,790
day, I know kids used to wear
those little raccoon hats.

1018
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:36,720
You know back when it was
game all over the place.

1019
01:03:38,070 --> 01:03:41,040
You know mothers made pies and
stuck them on window sills.

1020
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:45,090
Stanley, have you going to
shoot it? You better cook at,

1021
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:46,260
we're going to have to eat it.
Right?

1022
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:50,760
Did white people ever say that or did
we just waste if we always just wasted

1023
01:03:50,761 --> 01:03:52,970
shit?
We've always had the MTV

1024
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,350
cribs approach to fucking nature
having way white people didn't.

1025
01:03:57,351 --> 01:04:00,260
Buffalo bill used to just ride
around shooting buffalo in the head,

1026
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:05,720
laughing his ass off to that Fu Manchu
that connected to his sideburns. You know

1027
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:08,100
what?

1028
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:12,660
How much more did you increase your odds
of having your legs sewed off like soda

1029
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:17,940
sought off what you drank? Brandy, if you
had that little fucking, that Fu Manchu,

1030
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,840
what does that one called as far as the
facial hair mask and a lot of questions.

1031
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,520
Maybe I should have done some research.

1032
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:28,990
The only person I've seen with that is
that Guy Lemmy from Motorhead and then

1033
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:33,810
afterwards, the dude from Metallica
had it. He had it for a minute there.

1034
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,990
James Hetfield.
Why don't we get to the questions here?

1035
01:04:36,991 --> 01:04:38,670
I seem to be asking a
lot of questions here.

1036
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:42,930
Why do I get to some of your questions
and I'll try to answer them a question.

1037
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,540
A bill.
I have two questions.

1038
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,610
I can't help but notice these fucking
annoying commercials and ads about selling

1039
01:04:50,611 --> 01:04:52,920
your gold.
Um,

1040
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:56,520
I wondered whether or not you thought
this was a conspiracy to round up all the

1041
01:04:56,521 --> 01:05:01,230
gold still owned by individuals so
that when the dollar completely tanks,

1042
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,030
the people won't have anything
of worth for themselves. Uh, no,

1043
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:07,230
I don't think it's a conspiracy.

1044
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:11,220
I just think that those guys late night
are doing a much smaller version of the

1045
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:16,221
scam that bankers did originally is what
they're doing is they're taking gold

1046
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:21,550
and they're just giving people
a piece of paper for it.

1047
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:24,820
But it's not as bad as when the banks
did, did the banks did it. They said,

1048
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:25,654
give us your goal,

1049
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,560
then we'll give you these little pieces
of paper that are redeemable anytime you

1050
01:05:29,561 --> 01:05:34,000
want, you can come back and get
your goals. And needless to say,

1051
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:37,400
eventually, uh, you couldn't
claim your gold anymore. And uh,

1052
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,620
they just sort of cap it.

1053
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:44,950
No one knows where it is cause
you can audit them. Um, so yeah,

1054
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:46,210
that's what those guys are doing.

1055
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,300
They're anticipating I probably
the tanking of the dollar they get,

1056
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,191
I don't know if you guys,

1057
01:05:51,191 --> 01:05:52,900
have you seen those commercials
where they're just like,

1058
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:56,920
I used to a bit about it. You
know, if you got an old class ring,

1059
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:58,900
if you got a broken bracelet,

1060
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:01,960
if you got some busted
jewelry sandy and your goal,

1061
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:06,430
then we will give you cash for
it. That's what they're doing. Um,

1062
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:09,370
and for those of you who
think I'm a fucking moron, um,

1063
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:12,910
if you had a sandwich shop and somebody
walked in and tried to buy a sandwich

1064
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,870
sandwich with some rubles,
you tell them to go fuck themselves.

1065
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:21,340
But if somebody who came from a country
that used to use rubles but at a handful

1066
01:06:21,341 --> 01:06:25,510
of gold, you know, you still would
be like, dude, what the fuck?

1067
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:29,290
I don't know what gold is trading at,
but you'd know that the gold had value.

1068
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,540
Okay, that's the great thing about
gold all around the fucking world.

1069
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,750
You can get yourself a god damn
sandwich with a piece of gold.

1070
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:41,950
I challenge you to buy anything
with the fucking ruble.

1071
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:46,780
Go ahead and do it. Um,
or some defunct, the yen.

1072
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:49,720
Do they have that anymore in Japan?
Bill, you're getting in over your head.

1073
01:06:49,721 --> 01:06:52,810
Shut the fuck up. Just keep moving. So no,
I don't think that that's a conspiracy.

1074
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:57,811
I just think that that's one of the oldest
scams in the book and a JP Morgan and

1075
01:06:58,391 --> 01:07:01,450
the guys that was a Jekyll's
island or whatever Federal Reserve,

1076
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:05,920
those guys perfected it.
God bless him. Shame on us.

1077
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:10,510
Fool me once. Shame on you. Fool us
for a fucking hundred years and a yeah,

1078
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:13,240
we're fucking morons. Okay, next one. Um,

1079
01:07:13,241 --> 01:07:16,420
also I'll be coming to Cleveland to see
you and wondered if the same guy that

1080
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:19,840
opened for you in Pittsburgh, we'll be
opening for you in Cleveland as well.

1081
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:26,190
Um, oh, that was Doug [inaudible].
Doug Seen Yay. Getting
some props, ducks and yeah,

1082
01:07:26,191 --> 01:07:30,640
he's hilarious. I kind of rotate my
openers. Um, when I go to Cleveland,

1083
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:33,460
who's it going to be?
Ryan Dalton in a Jason Lawhead.

1084
01:07:34,060 --> 01:07:37,060
Actually two guys that I've known
for about five years right now.

1085
01:07:37,061 --> 01:07:41,710
They're based out of Cleveland. Travel
all around. Absolutely fucking hilarious.

1086
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:46,090
And A, I lose half my liver every time
I go out there and work with them.

1087
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:49,870
So I love those guys and they're going to
be opening their fucking hilarious. So,

1088
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:54,280
uh, if you're wondering if I'm going
to have a funny opener. Yes, I am. Um,

1089
01:07:54,281 --> 01:07:57,100
next question. Bill. As a say
of bills and a Sabres fan.

1090
01:07:57,101 --> 01:08:02,101
I think I have it the worst with two lost
Stanley cups and for lost Super Bowls

1091
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:07,420
and 11 years of 11 years without a playoff
appearance. Do you think I'm right?

1092
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:12,970
No, I don't. I do not. I think you
definitely have it bad. But um,

1093
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:17,420
for the longest time everybody talked
about Boston and then we want a bunch of

1094
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,860
shits. So that was over and they have been
talking about the cubs, blah blah blah,

1095
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:22,460
blah,
blah.

1096
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:26,870
But I think the worst city to be
a fan in right now is Cleveland.

1097
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:28,850
Very quietly.

1098
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:34,130
Those guys have gone my entire
life and nobody has won anything.

1099
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,670
The Cleveland browns have
never won a Superbowl.

1100
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,080
The Cleveland Cavaliers have
never won an NBA championship.

1101
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:47,081
And the Cleveland Indians haven't won a
world series since 1948 so and less your

1102
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:52,810
in your seventies.
Um,

1103
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:56,800
for all extensive purposes,
the Indians have never won a world series.

1104
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,950
Do you understand that? Cause you gotta
be like at least like eight years old,

1105
01:08:59,951 --> 01:09:02,650
nine years old to remember
a fucking world series. Now,

1106
01:09:02,651 --> 01:09:06,070
some douche bags going to email me
actually always shakes your job when the

1107
01:09:06,071 --> 01:09:10,750
Tigers won it in [inaudible] 68. Who
gives a fuck? You know what I'm saying?

1108
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:14,380
Don't be a cunt. All right. Um,

1109
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:19,570
so I would say that they have it worse.
Um, but yeah, you guys are, you know,

1110
01:09:19,571 --> 01:09:22,360
you're right there. You're right there
with them. That's one of those things.

1111
01:09:22,361 --> 01:09:24,310
It's like,
do you really want to win that argument?

1112
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:28,120
Remember longtime ESPN long
time ago, ESPN did, who has the,

1113
01:09:28,121 --> 01:09:29,200
who had the worst curse,

1114
01:09:29,201 --> 01:09:34,201
the Boston red sox or the Chicago cubs
and they did this stupid trial and they

1115
01:09:34,391 --> 01:09:38,800
had like George Wendt from cheers, who's
a Chicago guy. He's arguing to be like,

1116
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:42,280
no, we're more miserable. And
it's just like, all right,

1117
01:09:42,281 --> 01:09:44,230
you want to win that contest?
That's all you.

1118
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:47,590
Who the fuck would want to win the
misery contest? It's really beyond me.

1119
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:52,480
So congratulations. You didn't win it.
I think people in, uh, Cleveland, um,

1120
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:54,310
our world, I think, how do
you think those guys feel?

1121
01:09:54,311 --> 01:09:57,730
Have to fucking guys with world series
rings this year? It used to be, uh,

1122
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:02,290
used to be on the fucking Indians or
half the guys in the world series, right?

1123
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:06,850
Cc Sabathia. Ah, fuck.

1124
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,490
Who was the other guy? God dammit,
I had them right at the tip.

1125
01:10:09,491 --> 01:10:14,410
I got to stop talking on my cell phone.
Manny Ramirez.

1126
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:17,770
Okay. We'll see how the last couple of
years. Manny Ramirez, red sox bought him,

1127
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:23,100
right CC Sabathia the fucking a Yankees
bought that dude via the brewers.

1128
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,390
Who else did Jim tell me play
on the Phillies last year.

1129
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,660
I mean, the Indian should have
won it. They should've won it.

1130
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:36,320
But the way baseball is is a, you
know, it's not competitive anymore.

1131
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,890
That's why I'm kind of a,
I think I'm tapping out on baseball.

1132
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:44,300
I don't give a shit anymore. Uh, I dunno.

1133
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,510
In my world competition, I
was right. Actually wrote an
email to a guy about this.

1134
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:51,920
I met my world. Competition is our
best guys. First. Your best guys,

1135
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:55,380
best team wins. That's
to me is competition. Uh,

1136
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:59,810
I don't think competition is our
best guys. Plus your best guys,

1137
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:03,920
verse whatever the Fuck you
have left. Stupid. You know.

1138
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,860
Do you mind when you were kids
and you'd be choosing up sides?

1139
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,320
You know when right off the bat,

1140
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:12,950
if two of the best guys were on the
same side or in the end it seemed uneven

1141
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:14,070
people you'll

1142
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,180
and when I was from, and it was
called snuck teams Smu, see k,

1143
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,790
I've never heard that anywhere else.
I was like,

1144
01:11:20,791 --> 01:11:23,800
suck with an eminent snuck people.
Ignore smoke teams.

1145
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:27,900
The teams are smug ain't
what the fuck that that's,

1146
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:30,900
that should have been said like
during the little rascals era,

1147
01:11:30,901 --> 01:11:34,050
but some reason it was said during
my childhood, he's a smug teams.

1148
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:37,260
So then you had to break them up.
You had to break up the evil empire,

1149
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:41,670
the fucking, the fucking Yankees
or the red sox Dodgers or whatever.

1150
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:44,340
Any one of these teams. I mean the
Yankees are in a league of their own,

1151
01:11:44,341 --> 01:11:45,174
but you know what I'm saying?

1152
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:47,760
Red Sox and all them are just as
much part of the fucking problem.

1153
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:51,570
They would break up any of those kids
know enough to break up those fucking

1154
01:11:51,571 --> 01:11:55,560
teams. All right. Anyways, plowing ahead.

1155
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,890
Um, let's read, uh, what the
fuck was I going to read here?

1156
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:06,420
Um,
questions already did that,

1157
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:09,150
this is called broads over
there broads over there.

1158
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:11,700
I don't know what the hell it
says. Let's read this one. Bill.

1159
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:13,950
I had been a fan of yours sometime.
Just want to tell you that.

1160
01:12:13,951 --> 01:12:17,650
I think you're a great thank you.
Why don't I fucking delete those? Um,

1161
01:12:17,660 --> 01:12:22,380
I think your comedy of up at
the [inaudible]. All right.

1162
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:26,700
Anyways, uh, the reason I am writing
you is to tell you a funny story. Uh,

1163
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:30,630
my girl dating five plus years
now and I live in Tucson, Arizona,

1164
01:12:30,631 --> 01:12:34,740
and she's always bitching at me saying,
we never do anything anymore.

1165
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,420
Well, my job is very consuming of my
time. And I realized that she was correct.

1166
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:40,740
So what do I do?

1167
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,950
So what I do is I try to come up with
something we could do together that would

1168
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:45,300
be entertaining and unique,

1169
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,840
something different that is not
an average night out in Tucson se.

1170
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,900
The guy's using his brain,
trying to surprise her. Anyways,

1171
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:56,220
I've been telling her about your comedy
and showing her clips of you, uh,

1172
01:12:56,221 --> 01:12:58,800
that I found on your myspace
page for the past few months.

1173
01:12:58,801 --> 01:13:01,080
She really seemed to enjoy
it and laughed hysterically.

1174
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:05,720
So I planned this great evening
for the 20th of November, um,

1175
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,800
which goes something like this,
head up to temp Eav,

1176
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:11,250
have a nice dinner and head over
to the Improv and watch your show.

1177
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:15,000
You're eight o'clock show a while I
bought the tickets and thought I would

1178
01:13:15,001 --> 01:13:16,260
surprise her with the whole thing.

1179
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:20,250
She loved the idea and she
was very excited and I was
supposed to pleased to see

1180
01:13:20,251 --> 01:13:23,790
her excited about the event.
Well,

1181
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,910
we were telling our friends about
it and she sort of says this,

1182
01:13:26,911 --> 01:13:30,240
well it's his evening and I'm
just throw at a tagging along.

1183
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,510
Uh, I got to admit that, um,

1184
01:13:33,511 --> 01:13:37,110
I was a little upset at this point because
I intended this whole thing to be a

1185
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:38,490
gift from me to her.

1186
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,210
Which is funny because this is very
similar to the story that you told on

1187
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:47,211
October 19 on the October 19th podcasts
when you took your girl in the corvette

1188
01:13:47,401 --> 01:13:50,440
up the PCH. She just showed a shot. Ah,

1189
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,450
she just showed it sort of shut me down.
Um,

1190
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,240
so my question to you is
why is it never enough?

1191
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,520
Ah,
what a great question.

1192
01:13:59,521 --> 01:14:03,210
Do you realize you just ask the question
of properly every guy on this fucking

1193
01:14:03,211 --> 01:14:05,550
podcast, um, hold on.

1194
01:14:05,551 --> 01:14:08,910
I'm just going to pause here while the
women roll their eyes and I got it both.

1195
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:11,380
Shit, that's not true.
It's just, you know,

1196
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:17,020
you got to use your imagination.
What did like surprises?

1197
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:21,040
They just fucking
shut up.

1198
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:22,750
Just shut up.

1199
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:28,240
Would you just shut up and take off
all those fucking layers so that the 18

1200
01:14:28,241 --> 01:14:28,900
hundreds,

1201
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:33,670
you know with your panties and your
panty hose and your slip and your fucking

1202
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:38,020
skirt. All right. What am I
talking about? I Dunno. Um,

1203
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:43,900
anyways, uh, where'd I lost my
place? I'm, so my question to you is,

1204
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:46,780
why is it never enough?
I can do everything she wants,

1205
01:14:46,781 --> 01:14:51,370
but she was still find a way to make
me look like an asshole. Making me a,

1206
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:55,570
making it seem like I'm dragging her
around and making her do all that stuff

1207
01:14:55,571 --> 01:14:56,440
that I want to do.

1208
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:01,360
I guess that is why I relate to your
comedy because it seems that she is only

1209
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:05,290
happy when we do all the things
that she wants to do. Uh,

1210
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,680
you know what I'm talking you don't want
to talk about with Brunch Street Fairs

1211
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,380
in the candle store. Uh, nevertheless,

1212
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:15,120
we are going and really looking
forward to seeing you in person. Uh,

1213
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,430
I hope to see you have to show signs
of cds and DVDs. All right. Um,

1214
01:15:18,940 --> 01:15:23,050
why is it never enough? I
don't know. I don't know why.

1215
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,470
I don't know if it's an
insecurity that they are,

1216
01:15:26,471 --> 01:15:29,860
they're always questioning whether
you truly love them or not.

1217
01:15:31,690 --> 01:15:36,430
Um, I have no idea. I
don't know why. I mean,

1218
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:41,090
I would think that. All right, look, look,

1219
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:43,690
look at me. Okay. I went, I
rented a corvette for the day,

1220
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:46,600
core veteran vertebral and I
drove my girl all around La.

1221
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:50,980
We went up the fucking Pacific
coast highway, looked at
the ocean, we had lunch.

1222
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:54,850
I took her out to this
beautiful bar late at night.

1223
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:58,030
I drove through the Hollywood hills
with the top down looking at the stars,

1224
01:15:58,031 --> 01:15:59,740
looking at the lights out over the city.

1225
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:03,670
I thought it was a very romantic thing
and then I got on the podcast and she was

1226
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:06,670
just like, yeah, that was really
just, that was really your thing.

1227
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,130
I just did that for you.
You know,

1228
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:13,870
I just thought of fat there
and a $30,000 automobile,

1229
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:14,793
you know,

1230
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,770
seeing views that people fly six
hours to thi and just, you know,

1231
01:16:20,771 --> 01:16:25,570
just got a free lunch out of it and free
fucking drinks and you ever watched the

1232
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,010
prices right there?

1233
01:16:27,011 --> 01:16:30,310
You spit on my own microphone and
you never have the prices right.

1234
01:16:30,311 --> 01:16:34,360
You have watched the prices,
right? Sure. We all have. Okay.

1235
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,830
Getting a corvette,
I mean like,

1236
01:16:35,831 --> 01:16:40,270
and then go into that
restaurant and driving up to
PCH and looking at the lights

1237
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:45,220
and going out to the fucking bar in
the hotel where John Belushi. Oh deed.

1238
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:48,700
Isn't that, that sounds like one in
one of those showcases that you bid on.

1239
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:53,320
Are you going to bid? Are you going to
pass? You know? Oh Dude. You know what?

1240
01:16:53,321 --> 01:16:54,610
Speaking of that,
I was watching,

1241
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:59,990
I was watching the prices
right the other day and uh,

1242
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,370
I had like a white guilt
moment. Okay, this,

1243
01:17:03,371 --> 01:17:07,460
this black dude goes up to go
spin the big fucking wheel, right?

1244
01:17:08,350 --> 01:17:09,420
And you know,
you know the deal.

1245
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,930
If for those of you who don't live
in this country, you basically,

1246
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:14,650
you spin the wheel,
whoever comes close to dark,

1247
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:19,340
closest to a dollar without going over
gets to then go on and bid on the big

1248
01:17:19,341 --> 01:17:22,190
surprises. All right? That's for
people in England and Australia.

1249
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:24,520
And I'll let you to email me
if you don't know the show. So

1250
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:29,700
basically they have every
denomination from 5 cents, 10 cents,

1251
01:17:29,701 --> 01:17:34,701
1530 40455050560 all the way up to $1.

1252
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:39,960
So this like 55 year old
black dudes spins the wheel

1253
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,240
and it stops on 30 cents.
Okay.

1254
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:48,960
Now you can decide to stay or spin again.

1255
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:54,840
Now I'm not a fucking math
petition, but I think, uh,

1256
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,700
you want to hit on 30
cents, right? You want,

1257
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,470
he's looking out at the crowd and I'm
like, is this guy fucking kidding me?

1258
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:04,470
And I'm kind of laughing going out.
He's a little bit old.

1259
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,090
He's a little bit older,
right?

1260
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:09,870
His family's gonna straighten it up
for him and he looks out in the crowd.

1261
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:14,670
I don't know if they told them, I don't
know what the fuck they told buddy goes,

1262
01:18:14,671 --> 01:18:15,750
I'm gonna stay.

1263
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:21,450
He stayed on 30 cents and I'm looking
at drew Carey going like, all right,

1264
01:18:21,451 --> 01:18:24,720
I know what Bob Barker would do. Bob
Barker would be like, okay, wait a minute.

1265
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,130
You sure you want to stay on this?
30 cents is really low.

1266
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,340
He would have helped him through it.
But drew Carey just went like,

1267
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:35,750
he's gonna stay on 30 cents. All
right, let's bring up the next person.

1268
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:39,210
So the dude is standing there
with the 30 cents up above them.

1269
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,840
And I wanted to laugh my ass off
and be like, what a stupid fuck.

1270
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:46,530
But then I felt guilty because it was a
black dude and I'd be white laughing at

1271
01:18:46,531 --> 01:18:49,590
this black guy. Like he's a
moron. And that's one of the,

1272
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:54,591
that's the worst thing about racist is a
ruined your ability to be able to laugh

1273
01:18:56,461 --> 01:18:59,180
at a moron because he's

1274
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,520
another color. Then all because all of
a sudden it becomes this ugly thing,

1275
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,690
you know, I'll give a fuck what color
you are. If you're playing a game,

1276
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:09,390
we're trying to come close to a
dollar and you stop at 30 cents,

1277
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:11,550
you're a fucking moron.
And I should be able to laugh.

1278
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,930
And I was laughing and then I felt bad.
And then I actually thought, oh shit,

1279
01:19:15,931 --> 01:19:19,080
someone's gonna take that clip and
they're going to put it up on youtube and

1280
01:19:19,081 --> 01:19:22,200
then someone's going to write a bunch
of racist shit underneath it rather than

1281
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:26,610
sticking with the subject
that this individual who
happens to be a black dude is

1282
01:19:26,611 --> 01:19:28,290
a fucking moron,
you know?

1283
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:32,400
Or at the very least didn't understand
how the game worked. Look at that.

1284
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:34,440
I had to get, still had to give
him the benefit of the doubt.

1285
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:39,240
A fucking game show that's
been on 40 fucking years. Um,

1286
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:43,200
Jesus Christ. How did I get on that
subject? All right, let's get back here.

1287
01:19:43,201 --> 01:19:46,530
So my question is why is it never enough?
You know what?

1288
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,000
My girls got the flu right now.

1289
01:19:48,001 --> 01:19:51,870
How funny would it be if I actually called
her in here right now with the flu to

1290
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:55,530
ask her this question?
I'm really jeopardizing my relationship.

1291
01:19:55,531 --> 01:19:59,010
Should I do what everybody? I think
I'm going to do it. Hang on one second.

1292
01:19:59,011 --> 01:20:02,040
Let me see if I can get
her in here. Hold on. Hey

1293
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:07,480
Mia. Hey Dad and your dad.

1294
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:17,660
Alright, she's coming in. Don't
say anything. Right. Watch miss.

1295
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:21,940
Finesse my way through this. Yeah,
it's, come on in for a second. Alright.

1296
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:25,260
Making her way in.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1297
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:28,260
making her triumphant
return to the podcast.

1298
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:34,830
Look at you officially sick,
officially sick pajamas,

1299
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:39,250
socks. Is that orange juice
or you got any booze in there?

1300
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:45,000
On the rocks? Okay. Yes, it is
everything. Don't worry Cleo.

1301
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,060
We'll get it. Um, all right.
Here's a question for you.

1302
01:20:48,061 --> 01:20:51,390
Here's a question one of my
listeners had. All right. Yeah.

1303
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:55,920
I'm not trying to be hostile here.
This is the female question.

1304
01:20:55,921 --> 01:21:00,921
I know we had a big battle about that
dude who punched that chick in the face,

1305
01:21:01,201 --> 01:21:04,950
right? Rihanna, Rihanna,
Chris Brown and Chris Brown.

1306
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:09,150
We had a big argument on the plane
about that. It really bad. Um,

1307
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:13,710
all right. Should we talk about that
argument or should we get into this?

1308
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:16,980
Why don't we get into this and then,
and then we'll do the argument,

1309
01:21:16,981 --> 01:21:20,340
then we'll wrap it up, then we'll
segue. There you go. All right.

1310
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:22,310
I'll read this to you
and then you have to go.

1311
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:27,230
We have to come closer to the Mike here.
Um, don't look over my shoulder. She,

1312
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:31,710
she reads way faster than me. It makes
me self conscious. All right. Basically,

1313
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,620
there's this guy, he's got a
girl. I'm going to paraphrase,

1314
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:37,540
my listeners don't have to
listen to this shit again. Um,

1315
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:38,790
they'd been dating for five years.

1316
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:41,820
She always complains that they never do
anything because the job is very time

1317
01:21:41,821 --> 01:21:46,320
consuming. He admits this is job is his
team. His job is very time consuming.

1318
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:51,690
Okay. All right. We're on the same page.
Yeah, we're ready to go. Okay. Listen,

1319
01:21:51,691 --> 01:21:52,524
she starts coughing.

1320
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:54,483
Don't make me,

1321
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:57,300
I've been doing this story every
day, all day long. I make a left.

1322
01:21:57,301 --> 01:21:59,920
So she starts coughing.
You're terrible. She's like,

1323
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:05,290
I'll
listen to you selling.

1324
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:11,400
He's selling. You worked in a mine.
Listen to that. That's horrible.

1325
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:17,650
God, how did I ever find you attractive?
Oh my God. I'm joking. No, I'm joking.

1326
01:22:17,651 --> 01:22:21,650
I told you you're adorable.
All right. So any ways,

1327
01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:26,680
any anywhere, easy, easy. She says,

1328
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:32,470
Oh my God, this is horrible.
You sound horrible. Alright,

1329
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:35,530
I'm listening. All right. Stop doing that.
Be a performer here. Okay. All right.

1330
01:22:35,531 --> 01:22:37,620
Jerry Lewis would have
just, yeah, sat down.

1331
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:43,420
Um,
anyways lady.

1332
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:50,740
See what a great sense of humor she's
got even with the 105 degrees. So no,

1333
01:22:50,741 --> 01:22:52,720
it's not that he doesn't take her,
she said,

1334
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:56,760
she just said he doesn't take her anyway.
Do you understand that? I understand.

1335
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:59,260
Okay.
He has a time consuming job.

1336
01:22:59,410 --> 01:23:01,600
She complains that they
don't go a lot of places.

1337
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:05,120
She's claiming that they don't go anywhere
and he admits that he works a lot and

1338
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:07,000
he might not have enough time here.
Okay.

1339
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:11,410
Just don't side with the broad cause she
has a Twat here. All right. Really? Yeah,

1340
01:23:11,411 --> 01:23:14,710
I know I had to go there. Makes
the guys laugh. Alright. Uh,

1341
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:19,420
so anyways, so then he just, so he
decides he's going to take her somewhere.

1342
01:23:19,421 --> 01:23:21,280
So he sees that I'm going
to be common in town. Right.

1343
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:24,640
He starts showing clips of
me. Um, I, my space page.

1344
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:28,360
Of course she starts laughing cause I'm
fucking hilarious. Right? We know this.

1345
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:32,290
And handsome. Yeah. Thank you. All right.
So he goes, all right, this is perfect.

1346
01:23:32,291 --> 01:23:34,570
So he gets tickets to
my eight o'clock show.

1347
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,010
He's going to take her out to dinner.

1348
01:23:36,130 --> 01:23:38,950
He's going to take her out to the comedy
show. She says, that's not a good idea.

1349
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:43,180
He says, yeah, so we site, he
feels like he's fixed the problem.

1350
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:48,380
So the next night they're talking
about it to their friends and uh,

1351
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:51,160
he says where he's going to go
and what they're going to do.

1352
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,670
What should we have done? What
shouldn't we do? Remember that?

1353
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:59,710
No reservoir dogs. Oh yeah. So
you like telling jokes? Huh?

1354
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:05,710
Gig when like a budget girls
in a school yet. I'm sorry.

1355
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:10,900
I know I do. Bad Impressions. Um,
terrible, terrible. I know. So, uh,

1356
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:14,230
anyway, so then he finally ends up
saying it to, uh, he brings it up.

1357
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:16,900
She brings it up in front of
her friends and she said, well,

1358
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:21,040
it's his evening and I'm just
sort of tagging along. All right.

1359
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:22,750
And he goes,
I got omit that.

1360
01:24:22,751 --> 01:24:26,140
I was a little upset at that point because
I intended this whole evening thing

1361
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:30,850
to be a gift from me to her.
Okay. Right. So he goes,

1362
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:34,060
it reminded me of when you took your
girl out on the corvette and you said the

1363
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:36,100
same thing. Right? So he says,

1364
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:41,101
my question to you is
why is it never enough?

1365
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:44,973
Yeah.

1366
01:24:45,030 --> 01:24:49,500
I don't think that it's okay. I
love it. Your tongue tied. Look at,

1367
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:50,860
see what you're doing right now.
No.

1368
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,040
Say what's your exact say
exactly what you're thinking.

1369
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:57,570
Don't do this is you try to figure a way
to spin this shit. Don't spin it. Yeah.

1370
01:24:57,630 --> 01:25:00,630
I'm not spinning it because
it's not like it's not enough.

1371
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:03,990
But I think where she's coming from,
it's not like

1372
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,133
the whole

1373
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:10,840
he did. No, no, no,
no, no. I, like I said,

1374
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:14,920
it comes from this point of insecurity
that you guys never feel loved enough.

1375
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:17,740
Can you listen to me?
It's hard, but yeah. Okay.

1376
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:21,450
He is a fan of yours first she,

1377
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,920
she became a fan of yours but
he is like a long time fan.

1378
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:30,090
So even though she would enjoy
seeing your show, of course it's,

1379
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:34,830
he has more of a connection to you
and your, your comedy than she does.

1380
01:25:34,831 --> 01:25:36,510
He has more invested because he's,

1381
01:25:36,870 --> 01:25:40,260
he likes you and she had just heard of
you I guess when he introduced her to

1382
01:25:40,261 --> 01:25:43,800
your clips on youtube and stuff.
So in a way it's like,

1383
01:25:43,801 --> 01:25:46,740
oh well I like it and I'll show it
to her and how she thinks it's funny.

1384
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:48,960
So we'll make a night out of it.
But it's not as if,

1385
01:25:48,961 --> 01:25:50,310
I don't know what else she likes.
I mean,

1386
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:53,150
I'm sure she likes going
shopping and whatnot.

1387
01:25:53,210 --> 01:25:56,670
So basically the fact that he didn't
see, he didn't say, Hey, you know what,

1388
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,140
I have the afternoon free.

1389
01:25:58,230 --> 01:26:02,490
You want to like go to the farmer's
market or go like window shopping or

1390
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:06,980
whatever that have been an evening
or an afternoon all about her.

1391
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:11,630
That's like the difference. And
so can I interrupt right now? Yes.

1392
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,880
It's a relationship.
There's two people.

1393
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:17,750
It's not a birthday [inaudible] I
understand. If it's her birthday,

1394
01:26:17,751 --> 01:26:20,630
it's all about her. She goes,
you never take me anywhere.

1395
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:25,130
So basically the problem here is
the place that he's taking her to,

1396
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,380
he can actually have a good time at,

1397
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:30,890
he should actually take her to
something that he doesn't want to do.

1398
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,381
No,

1399
01:26:32,381 --> 01:26:37,381
I think the issue is that she would have
maybe preferred it if it was 100% all

1400
01:26:38,741 --> 01:26:40,180
about her.
Like if it was,

1401
01:26:40,181 --> 01:26:43,540
so you guys are selfish
specifically that she wanted to do?

1402
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,780
I don't know if she saw for sure not.
Well, it sounds like she's a little,

1403
01:26:46,781 --> 01:26:49,020
she's being a little
bratty about it now though.

1404
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:50,930
I'll take that. That was
very, I'll, you know what,

1405
01:26:50,931 --> 01:26:54,620
I appreciate that they know what the fact
that you actually admitted at least to

1406
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:58,290
the, now I can listen to your
opinion a lot more open mindedly

1407
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:00,250
yeah, sure. Okay. A little, I mean,

1408
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:03,940
she's being a little bratty to throw
that in there, especially to her friends.

1409
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:05,210
But yeah.

1410
01:27:05,210 --> 01:27:06,510
What do you think I would
do? What do, what do,

1411
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:08,810
what do you think I would do
if you did that? If, if you,

1412
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,410
if you made the comment in front of your
friends. Okay. And then I've already,

1413
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:15,470
I've, uh, I've already stopped
talking to us. We're coming home.

1414
01:27:15,471 --> 01:27:17,630
All we hear is this silent.
We're of our Prius.

1415
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:28,110
See how it starts off. Giulia somehow.

1416
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,190
Um, I don't think I was being bratty
though when I made the remark.

1417
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:33,620
No,
I understand it now.

1418
01:27:33,650 --> 01:27:36,980
What it was was I loved the
corvette long before I loved you.

1419
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,440
So it really was something
more about me then.

1420
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:43,623
Well,
I don't,

1421
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,300
was I smiling too much that day?
Is that what bugged you?

1422
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:48,360
No.
Listen,

1423
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:52,890
as awesome as it was to ride in
a corvette down the PCH Malibu,

1424
01:27:52,891 --> 01:27:55,830
that was fucking amazing.
It was not the,

1425
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,010
one of the things that I had on
my mind as something fun to do.

1426
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:02,910
When you mentioned it, I was like, yeah,
that, that sounds awesome. We did it.

1427
01:28:02,911 --> 01:28:04,040
It was even better.
But yeah,

1428
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:05,500
they know we'll, we'll,
we'll wait a minute.

1429
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:09,580
As far as your days that you've had out
here in La, where does that one rank?

1430
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:13,660
It's like number two to my birthday.
See?

1431
01:28:14,150 --> 01:28:15,890
Yeah,
a random day in October.

1432
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:19,490
So it was a fucking big time score
and you still had to be like, wow,

1433
01:28:19,491 --> 01:28:22,760
that was really kind of your
thing. Why? Why would you do that?

1434
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:26,490
You just said that I wasn't being
bratty when I said it. And now you're,

1435
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:27,230
now you're,

1436
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:30,590
no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I have memory problems. Wait, what?

1437
01:28:30,591 --> 01:28:33,630
When did I say what? I wasn't, I sent
you weren't being bratty with what? Okay.

1438
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:34,150
Oh,
I said,

1439
01:28:34,150 --> 01:28:36,710
I don't think that I was being bratty
when I said the thing about that.

1440
01:28:36,711 --> 01:28:39,440
And you were like, no, no, no. I see
where I see where you're coming from.

1441
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:44,720
You just said it. And that's not what
I meant. Oh Great. How convenient.

1442
01:28:45,370 --> 01:28:46,750
Look me,
I can't remember anything from,

1443
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:50,350
I don't have any short term memory
anymore, so I don't know who that guy was.

1444
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,470
Who was who. I don't even know if I
was agreeing with you. You know what?

1445
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:56,980
I'm never taking the stand if I ever
kill anybody because I'm not going to be

1446
01:28:56,981 --> 01:28:58,240
able to test them on it.
Honesty.

1447
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,150
It was a nice thing
that you did and it was,

1448
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:04,290
it was unnecessary for me to say that

1449
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:09,160
it wasn't a, you guys have to hang on a
second while I kiss my sick girlfriend.

1450
01:29:09,950 --> 01:29:12,730
Well there you go.
See that wasn't necessarily that guys,

1451
01:29:12,731 --> 01:29:14,530
I didn't have to slap her around.

1452
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,970
I didn't have to call any of them
names over there like Chris Brown.

1453
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,080
Oh I don't.

1454
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:23,580
And it was unnecessary for her to say
that because he was trying to do a nice

1455
01:29:23,581 --> 01:29:23,791
thing.

1456
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:28,791
Yes he is more of a fan of you than she
is making it more of an better and more

1457
01:29:29,761 --> 01:29:33,030
interesting fun night for him than for
her even though she would have enjoyed it,

1458
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:34,110
but it was unnecessary.

1459
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:36,440
Oh well let me ask you this.
Don't know,

1460
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:39,620
most women just automatically
see that with the idea.

1461
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:42,860
So then would she get self conscious
and feel like she had to call,

1462
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:45,860
call it out before they set it?

1463
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:50,210
Would she may be say that
because she's kind of embarrassed

1464
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:55,830
that, that, that, that like, yeah. Like,
cause if he said it, you know, you know,

1465
01:29:55,831 --> 01:29:59,010
what are you doing? Oh, he's taken me.
See this guy, Bill Barry says cunt,

1466
01:29:59,011 --> 01:30:03,480
every other word. That's what he's doing
on this romantic night. God Damn it.

1467
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,470
I think she might be right.

1468
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:07,980
Yeah. You know what? Yeah, I bet.
What happened was, oh, what did,

1469
01:30:07,981 --> 01:30:10,320
what is your boyfriend and doing?
Oh, what are you guys doing? Oh,

1470
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:13,530
we're going to dinner and then we're
going to a comedy show and I don't think

1471
01:30:13,531 --> 01:30:17,580
that's necessarily the first thing on a
woman's mind when it comes to a romantic

1472
01:30:17,581 --> 01:30:18,360
evening.

1473
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,890
Okay. Last question. Tell me,

1474
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:23,220
you didn't feel like you were dating
Paul Newman when we were driving up to

1475
01:30:23,221 --> 01:30:25,920
fucking PCH with the top down.
It was pretty impressive.

1476
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:30,900
You didn't feel like Nia
Woodward? I did. It did. Exactly.

1477
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:32,250
It's a fucking great idea.

1478
01:30:32,470 --> 01:30:36,190
Ballet like ran up to us and we
pulled into the, uh, parking. Yeah.

1479
01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:38,670
Oh, I'm putting in a
special spot. And God,

1480
01:30:38,930 --> 01:30:42,000
Pat was back then underneath that
overhang. So the shade would be,

1481
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:45,210
w was be all nice and cool.
Yeah. Was pretty hot. You know,

1482
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,460
they don't do that when you pull
up in the Prius, do they? No,

1483
01:30:47,461 --> 01:30:49,950
they do not stick that
bitch right out in the sun.

1484
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:58,890
Um, all right. So let's, let's get, let's
get onto, let's get onto our argument. So,

1485
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:03,420
right. We're, we're flying back from New
York City. How amazing was I a town hall?

1486
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:07,080
You were amazing. Standing Ovation.
Yes. Right. You're fucking right.

1487
01:31:07,290 --> 01:31:10,440
Am how insecure am I that I had to
make you say that for the sixth time.

1488
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:15,840
You're insecure, but I'm the
yeah, exactly. All right. So
let's plow ahead here. Um,

1489
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:20,790
so we're flying back from, uh, where
are we at Boston at that point.

1490
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:23,730
Yeah. And, uh, I don't,

1491
01:31:23,790 --> 01:31:26,160
I don't know if we'd already watched
the youtube clip or whatever.

1492
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:31,320
Rihanna had gone on TV talking to
Diane Sawyer, breaking it down.

1493
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:35,100
Yep. Talking about, um, you know,

1494
01:31:35,101 --> 01:31:39,150
getting the shit kicked out of her by
that dude with the beaver teeth. Right.

1495
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:44,280
He really looks like a bug to beaver.
He does.

1496
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:47,760
He has no business being a pop star.
Um,

1497
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:53,100
he better too, right? He did. Why wouldn't
you? You got to utilize your weapons.

1498
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:57,000
So we're sitting there and it's this real
is this really sad interview and she's

1499
01:31:57,001 --> 01:32:00,940
just like, I just felt silly and
stupid. You need to do for me.

1500
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,990
So this is what I did. So it started
off as a joke and I said, all right,

1501
01:32:04,991 --> 01:32:09,880
this is my impression
because wrong.

1502
01:32:10,070 --> 01:32:13,570
All right, to go on record as saying
that I feel that this is so wrong,

1503
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:17,380
but the things you do that are so
wrong. All right, well this is the deal.

1504
01:32:17,381 --> 01:32:20,140
I was talking about how they, she
was just saying that, you know,

1505
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:25,290
I found an inappropriate text message
and then things escalated and then next

1506
01:32:25,481 --> 01:32:29,610
thing you know, he caved in my cheek and
started biting me and Blah, blah, blah,

1507
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,000
blah, blah. And I was
just like, you know what?

1508
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:34,840
She left out a lot of the details and
cause what I've learned with arguing with

1509
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:39,070
women is when women argue when you're
there or not winning or they're not

1510
01:32:39,071 --> 01:32:40,840
getting you to admit that you're wrong,

1511
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:44,230
that some point they make this switch
in there where they're just like,

1512
01:32:44,231 --> 01:32:48,670
I'm just going to make this person is mad
as I possibly can by using every ounce

1513
01:32:48,671 --> 01:32:52,270
of information that I know about him.
So truth,

1514
01:32:54,890 --> 01:32:56,770
uh, you know what? That's
as good as a yes. Anyway,

1515
01:32:56,771 --> 01:33:00,730
so this is one of those in the moment
jokes. I can't remember what they said.

1516
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:03,220
I said,
this is my impression of,

1517
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:09,880
of the conversation before.
I can't remember what, how
I did it though. I was like,

1518
01:33:10,690 --> 01:33:12,010
wish you see from Barbados,

1519
01:33:12,011 --> 01:33:16,950
but for some reason I started doing
this really bad Jamaican accent and I go

1520
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:23,620
Yaman Yaman who be sending you the
text, man, you'll fuck you bitch.

1521
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:27,820
I ain't go say not in your mind.
Who gave you the text message?

1522
01:33:27,821 --> 01:33:29,080
You fucking buck tooth be,

1523
01:33:29,081 --> 01:33:32,950
I can't remember it somehow talked about
his teeth and you will laugh in your

1524
01:33:32,951 --> 01:33:36,040
fucking ass off.
I can never recreate that.

1525
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:39,100
That's why I had to tap out and you will
laugh in your fucking ass off and it

1526
01:33:39,101 --> 01:33:43,990
was totally wrong. And, but
then like halfway through it,

1527
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:48,991
I started making my point of how I'm so
sick of every time a woman gets the shit

1528
01:33:49,511 --> 01:33:52,330
kicked out of her, not every time,
but all these women they always get,

1529
01:33:52,331 --> 01:33:56,620
they always get to show guys in that
bad light of all these guys who beat the

1530
01:33:56,621 --> 01:33:57,490
shit out of the women,

1531
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:02,670
but they never show when women fuck
over guys ever in those situations ever.

1532
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:07,540
Like you know the situations that, that,
that, that I've seen where, you know,

1533
01:34:07,541 --> 01:34:08,590
a friend of mine,
you know,

1534
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:11,830
she slammed the door into them and then
just called the cops and said that he

1535
01:34:11,831 --> 01:34:13,930
hit her and they without question,

1536
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:17,920
arrest him and then that fucked up his
job and now everybody looks at him like

1537
01:34:17,921 --> 01:34:19,840
he's a wife beater.
He never even did it.

1538
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:23,770
How come Oprah never does shows about
that? That was our big argument.

1539
01:34:23,771 --> 01:34:27,130
And then she somehow, you
know me, the way I say Shit,

1540
01:34:27,131 --> 01:34:30,430
somehow it seemed like I was advocating
that the guy did nothing wrong.

1541
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:36,300
And like, just, you know, all women
are these horrible, manipulative yes.

1542
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:40,280
And you're not, you're not horrible
manipulate preachers, but you guys do,

1543
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,920
you definitely manipulate.
Can I burn a joke here that,

1544
01:34:42,921 --> 01:34:46,310
that fucking milkshake joke, I'll burn
it. I don't have that many, uh, listeners,

1545
01:34:46,330 --> 01:34:48,490
I'll still probably do it on my special.
I don't give a fuck.

1546
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:51,520
So here's a little t's kind of
like when you see a movie trailer,

1547
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:54,700
this is kind of a bit I'm
doing on my, uh, my special,

1548
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:58,190
this is what my girlfriend did
one night when I was driving home.

1549
01:34:58,191 --> 01:35:02,600
This is how much they manipulate, or as
I call it, lie to get what they want.

1550
01:35:02,660 --> 01:35:04,790
I was driving home and I
was looking at this fucking,

1551
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:09,770
there was this diner and I was driving
home and it was late at night. I was like,

1552
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:10,940
you know, hey, you know,
I'm gonna stop there.

1553
01:35:10,941 --> 01:35:15,140
I'm going to get one of those milkshakes.
And you'd just like, oh my God.

1554
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:24,110
Fuck you. It's hilarious. Let's
not forget at the end of the day,

1555
01:35:24,111 --> 01:35:27,920
my job is to like make those people
left. Okay? Nia, you don't understand.

1556
01:35:27,921 --> 01:35:30,680
These people work hard all week.
These were Americans.

1557
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:34,610
They need to come out and forget
about their problems now, whatever.

1558
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:38,240
I don't have one of my Mel Blanc.
I got one fucking voice. I do.

1559
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:41,450
Nice reference. I watch cartoons. Really?

1560
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,640
Is that all it takes to
impress you on a first date?

1561
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:48,350
That's how you ended up with me.
He knows who does the voice of bugs bunny.

1562
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:52,400
This guy is a keeper.
I think this guy will be able to provide

1563
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:58,820
what we ever hung out when I hooked up.
We'll save that for another one.

1564
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:03,290
But you gotta you gotta Tell Him, Huh?
You had to be impressed with my skills.

1565
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:06,920
Yeah. Yeah. Well, yes. You'd see
that. They just won't give it up.

1566
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:10,580
This guy was fucking cock
blocking me on an Olympic level.

1567
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:15,150
He saw I was going to hook up. He actually
tried to split a cab with you. Yeah, no,

1568
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:19,850
on the way home and I got around that.
Yeah. Got around that. What happened?

1569
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:23,840
I fucking put the cards. I went all
in just like world series of poker.

1570
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:27,180
I went all fucking in.
She,

1571
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:31,670
she was trying to be all coy with Little
Sammy Davis Jr had on trying to play

1572
01:36:31,671 --> 01:36:35,540
all hard to get high thinking you were
dealing with the sophomore in fucking

1573
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:38,690
college. Like I didn't have
any fucking lines. Yeah.

1574
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:44,600
And that douchebag kept coming over,
cock blocking me. He invited we,

1575
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:46,970
we will all set. I was hanging
out. I'm going to tell right now.

1576
01:36:46,971 --> 01:36:48,260
We were hanging out.
Right.

1577
01:36:48,380 --> 01:36:51,710
Me and this other dude and all of a
sudden he shows up. Right. And I can see,

1578
01:36:51,711 --> 01:36:56,620
I can see the vibe. I see the look on
her face. I know she wants it now. I get,

1579
01:36:56,700 --> 01:37:00,740
I don't know. He just, you know,
shut up. You look great. You came up,

1580
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:03,290
you had a nice big smile and
you're being flirtatious.

1581
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:06,740
And I immediately liked you.
Right. So you went to the bathroom,

1582
01:37:07,110 --> 01:37:09,080
you're with a friend.
I'm with a friend.

1583
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:11,030
Every guy knows what
you're supposed to do.

1584
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:14,540
Take that fucking battleaxe
out of the picture.

1585
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:19,580
Okay. Take one for the team. I can't
remember who the fuck you with.

1586
01:37:19,581 --> 01:37:23,480
So if it's one of your friends, I
apologize. Um, whatever. Alright,

1587
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:29,180
a war memorial. Um, so
what is this fucking,

1588
01:37:29,181 --> 01:37:32,690
he goes the opposite route. I said, look,
you went to the bathroom. I said, listen,

1589
01:37:32,691 --> 01:37:35,740
I'm really doing well with this
girl. All right, so a duty,

1590
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:39,410
I hate to like keep it like a
chick. No, I had to be like,

1591
01:37:39,411 --> 01:37:42,710
so if I'm not paying attention, he's, you
don't get upset. This is how like female,

1592
01:37:42,711 --> 01:37:46,910
this dude was, right. So I fucked in.
He is where he ends up doing. Okay.

1593
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:51,410
The fucking guy ends up as we're going
to leave, you know, I'm thinking, okay,

1594
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:52,990
he's going to try to peel off with a,

1595
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:54,860
your girl who's not a
battle ax and he just,

1596
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:57,960
he invites another dude over and he goes,
hey,

1597
01:37:57,961 --> 01:38:02,910
you guys all want to get something to eat
member and member and invited us over.

1598
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:04,950
Now we're sitting there. It's me. You,

1599
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:09,030
you're not so battleaxe friends and three
other fucking cocks are sitting there

1600
01:38:09,031 --> 01:38:13,680
and I'm trying to hit on you. Yeah. And he
keeps jumping in. Then he goes, Hey Nia,

1601
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:17,980
where do you live? Oh, I live up that way.
You want to split a cab? Remember that?

1602
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:23,040
And I had to be like, no, no, no, you
didn't. It was over at that point.

1603
01:38:23,070 --> 01:38:24,630
I made the move. Remember that? I said,

1604
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,940
are you at least I bought before
he fucking said that shit.

1605
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:28,080
He was doing everything.

1606
01:38:28,081 --> 01:38:31,470
I remember I didn't have any cash and
I pulled out my credit card. I said,

1607
01:38:31,471 --> 01:38:33,870
you guys just give me the cash or just
put it on my credit card. And he goes, oh,

1608
01:38:33,871 --> 01:38:35,610
he's just trying to get the miles.

1609
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:38,970
Remember that anything could do
to make me look like a shithead.

1610
01:38:40,230 --> 01:38:44,820
I thought you were like, Bam, I'm paying
for the whole meal. No, no, no, no.

1611
01:38:44,821 --> 01:38:48,180
They gave me money cause I didn't
have any cash. This is how I got you,

1612
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:50,610
what you was sitting there.
And I said, look, uh,

1613
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:53,370
we at least going to be able to split a
cab because I wanted to go over and have

1614
01:38:53,371 --> 01:38:56,100
a drink with you. And I was like,
oh, we should be able to split a cab.

1615
01:38:56,101 --> 01:38:58,140
And then you like, why? Why
do you want to split a cab?

1616
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:01,860
Just putting up the roadblock. And
that's when I went all in. I said,

1617
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:06,600
cause I want to kiss you. Bam.
Right. And then that was it.

1618
01:39:06,601 --> 01:39:09,620
I didn't fucking talk to you after that.
Yeah.

1619
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:12,750
You sat there with that little stunned
look on your face. Then what happened?

1620
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:16,320
Then we walked outside them, Dan, Dan,
Dan, we walked out. That was the shit.

1621
01:39:16,321 --> 01:39:18,100
That was one of the greatest I used to do.

1622
01:39:18,101 --> 01:39:20,070
The fucking guys like that
used to always get me,

1623
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:24,630
I fucking nailed that stuck the
landing like a male Mary Lou Retton

1624
01:39:26,820 --> 01:39:30,360
and you know what the best part was.
Then I stood up, we were all, and I,

1625
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,720
at that point I was like, fuck
it. I said what I wanted to do,

1626
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:36,870
all this shit is in,
I don't need to talk to her anymore.

1627
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:39,030
And I sort of peeled off.
Right.

1628
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,730
And then everybody got up to leave
and then you kind of touched me on the

1629
01:39:41,731 --> 01:39:43,740
shoulder, said, don't worry, she
doesn't usually like, don't worry,

1630
01:39:43,741 --> 01:39:45,750
we're going to split a cab up
time. And then I'm like, oh,

1631
01:39:45,751 --> 01:39:48,810
this is going to be great because now
I'm in and I'm going to get you get to

1632
01:39:48,811 --> 01:39:52,290
watch that little fucking cock block,
get his balls knocked on the, on the,

1633
01:39:52,291 --> 01:39:54,750
on the fucking sidewalk. And that's
what happened. He came out right,

1634
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:59,040
clapped his hands. Remember that
came out just like you, just like,

1635
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:03,510
so you guys ready to go and you're like,
ah, yeah, actually we're taking a cab.

1636
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:06,720
And he was, and he was so in cock block
mode. He still didn't know. He's like,

1637
01:40:06,721 --> 01:40:09,990
oh well they live right near
you. And you were like, listen,

1638
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:14,490
we're taking a cab and we're going uptown.
And you leaned over and you set it.

1639
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:18,030
And then that's when he realized that
everyone realized he was a cock block and

1640
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:21,500
dish. And then what did he do? He goes,
oh yeah. I mean, yeah, oh, hold on.

1641
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,920
He just fucking peeled off,
Huh? Then what happened?

1642
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:33,720
My, at my other fucking
classic line, we're fucking
real. June was a masterpiece,

1643
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:37,680
fucking masterpiece. Then we got
in the cab and you said, I thought,

1644
01:40:37,681 --> 01:40:40,890
I thought you were going to kiss me.
And we fucking driving like a maniac.

1645
01:40:40,891 --> 01:40:43,530
And I go, I can't the calves
jumping around too much.

1646
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:47,610
I go a kiss you at the
first red light right now.

1647
01:40:47,790 --> 01:40:51,930
You're trying to make this whole like I
was fucking seducing you and it worked

1648
01:40:52,620 --> 01:40:57,130
right? Then we hit the fucking
red light. Yeah, I put one on you,

1649
01:40:57,550 --> 01:41:00,520
Bam. Right? Couldn't
feel your fucking feet.

1650
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:07,390
I'm gonna make this story last nine hours
long. And then you know what happened?

1651
01:41:08,170 --> 01:41:10,690
Then I sat back and I was playing
mister fucking cool again.

1652
01:41:10,691 --> 01:41:15,691
Like I'm fucking Walt Frazier in 1972 oh
the callback to the nicks from an hour

1653
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:17,830
ago, right? Then what happened?

1654
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,640
We stopped again and I'm sitting there
looking out the window and you go,

1655
01:41:21,641 --> 01:41:24,430
it's another red light right now.
And then,

1656
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:29,470
and then we heard that cheesy saxophone
from every fucking sexy movie in the 80s

1657
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:34,180
right? And then you are going,
I'm not going home with you.

1658
01:41:34,330 --> 01:41:37,150
I'm not going home with you. Now,
whenever they say that guys, you know,

1659
01:41:37,151 --> 01:41:38,920
they're not going home with you.
You know that shit.

1660
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:43,660
So what you have to do is you have to
constantly make them feel like it's safe

1661
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:45,130
and they're in control.
So before,

1662
01:41:45,131 --> 01:41:48,610
actually before you said you weren't
going home with me, I felt your vibe.

1663
01:41:49,480 --> 01:41:52,840
I knew the deal. So I just said, listen,
I know we're not going home together,

1664
01:41:52,841 --> 01:41:55,510
but I'm really am a good time with you.
I'd like to have another drink with you.

1665
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:59,230
All right. I know a nice
bar. Ba Ba ba ba Bam.

1666
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:03,610
Right?
You didn't go home with me.

1667
01:42:03,970 --> 01:42:07,720
We had like fucking eight more drinks and
made out for like the next five hours.

1668
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:12,160
And that fucking hell's kitchen bar
had a great time. Yeah, there you go.

1669
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:14,100
So there's a little story people,
there's your

1670
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,570
little backstory hour in one
fucking minutes. There you
go. Oh, you know I've got,

1671
01:42:19,571 --> 01:42:21,480
damn it. I didn't get
to this. You want to,

1672
01:42:21,481 --> 01:42:23,230
you want to hear something
that's gonna make your, uh,

1673
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:28,600
your fucking privates crawl.
Sorry, what's was disgusting?

1674
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:32,870
I'm out of funny shit. I'm over time
right now. Listen to this guy. You know,

1675
01:42:32,871 --> 01:42:35,740
I was talking about that, that cut down
there at the, at the diner that one day.

1676
01:42:35,741 --> 01:42:39,640
Remember that guy good. Greg
Did Jersey, you fucking faggot.

1677
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:40,510
Whatever the hell he said.

1678
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:46,600
So people, people were talking
about, people would talking
about like all the, uh,

1679
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:47,310
you know,

1680
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:50,710
all the assholes in the confrontations
and some people had the confrontations.

1681
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,890
Yeah, some people won the fights,
some people lost the fight.

1682
01:42:53,891 --> 01:42:55,360
Some people want and got sued.

1683
01:42:55,830 --> 01:42:58,360
All the people walked away and
had the fucking anger like I did.

1684
01:42:58,630 --> 01:43:03,370
So he goes a podcast, the bullies
point of view. This is from the bully.

1685
01:43:04,090 --> 01:43:06,170
Listen to this. This is
really interesting, Bill.

1686
01:43:06,171 --> 01:43:08,860
I just listened to your last two podcasts
and listen to the stories of these

1687
01:43:08,861 --> 01:43:12,520
guys that went, that want to beat
people, uh, when they're bullied. Well,

1688
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:17,770
I think I'm the bully. I've got 100
stories, but I'll give you two short ones,

1689
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:21,220
right?
Fat People Bother me.

1690
01:43:24,410 --> 01:43:26,410
This guy's awesome.
Fat People Bother me.

1691
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:31,650
Smelly people do to combine the two and
give me lots of alcohol and I go off.

1692
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:33,840
So I'm down the,
uh,

1693
01:43:33,870 --> 01:43:38,350
down the hatch and Manhattan and fat
smelly and Fet smelly guys come in,

1694
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:43,470
I can't help but tell them that they are
an embarrassment to the white American

1695
01:43:43,991 --> 01:43:46,630
race. This is where he becomes
like this area and psychopath,

1696
01:43:46,631 --> 01:43:48,460
I guess this isn't funny anymore.
And he goes,

1697
01:43:48,461 --> 01:43:52,430
and I'm tired of picking up their slack
now if he's just saying that to be funny,

1698
01:43:52,431 --> 01:43:55,550
that's fucking hilarious for one white
person to say that to another white

1699
01:43:55,551 --> 01:43:56,384
person.

1700
01:43:57,350 --> 01:44:00,500
You're an embarrassment to the white race
and I'm tired of picking up the slap,

1701
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:04,010
take a fucking walk. At least
he goes, they don't say a word.

1702
01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:08,540
So I slapped one right across
the face. He goes, why?

1703
01:44:08,810 --> 01:44:12,950
I'm not sure. What's that movie you
love there with, with Christian Bale?

1704
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:17,630
American psych. Yeah. I think this is the
guy I'd love to see his business card.

1705
01:44:17,631 --> 01:44:20,960
He goes out, there's six of them.
I have four or five guys with me.

1706
01:44:21,110 --> 01:44:24,650
But they wouldn't have known that if they
wouldn't have known that and they just

1707
01:44:24,651 --> 01:44:29,600
walked up, they just walked away out the
door probably to grab some fried food.

1708
01:44:30,150 --> 01:44:34,040
Uh, but the point is they
didn't do anything. Did I
feel bad about it? Not really.

1709
01:44:34,580 --> 01:44:37,070
A, it's a pretty funny story
to tell when I'm drunk.

1710
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:43,760
Most of this story. Oh,
these stories are hilarious.

1711
01:44:43,761 --> 01:44:45,830
I don't even know if they're true,
but these are fucking make me laugh.

1712
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:46,761
Arena elements story too.

1713
01:44:46,761 --> 01:44:50,180
So I'm at a bar with a couple of
guys and there's a midget in it. Uh,

1714
01:44:50,181 --> 01:44:52,430
for some reason I don't
notice the little man,

1715
01:44:52,431 --> 01:44:54,770
but my friends do in the
midget jokes commence.

1716
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:57,350
And one of the little men's friends
says something to my friend.

1717
01:44:57,560 --> 01:45:00,940
I told him to shut the fuck up
and poured my corona on him. Uh,

1718
01:45:01,010 --> 01:45:04,270
he didn't know what to do. About 10
minutes later I ordered a shot and saw

1719
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:09,830
some near the bar and toss that
and him too. He did nothing. Why?

1720
01:45:09,950 --> 01:45:13,010
Because 98% of the time, people, uh,

1721
01:45:13,220 --> 01:45:17,510
people don't know how to react and clam
up. It's not just your listeners are you,

1722
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:18,700
it's mostly everyone.

1723
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:23,360
So don't feel bad about freezing up
and missing your opportunity. Um,

1724
01:45:23,361 --> 01:45:25,760
and you're right that we don't
always get what we deserve.

1725
01:45:25,761 --> 01:45:28,040
I've been kicked out of more
bars than I can remember.

1726
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:32,450
I've had sex with more women than I can
remember and showed all of my friends

1727
01:45:32,451 --> 01:45:34,670
pictures of them.
Where did it get me

1728
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:37,790
to a six figure salary?

1729
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:46,340
Wait a minute. You just want it to
be fake. You want it to be fake.

1730
01:45:47,890 --> 01:45:51,320
Nia, have you ever seen an
asshole who takes what he wants?

1731
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:54,620
Not Bang the hottest fucking
women out there ever.

1732
01:45:56,150 --> 01:45:59,680
Thank you. All right, let's
continue. One more thing. Yeah.

1733
01:45:59,700 --> 01:46:02,940
So this will make you feel great. All
these, uh, all these guys in your podcast,

1734
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:05,990
he keep talking about picking up girls
or being scared to talk to them or being

1735
01:46:05,991 --> 01:46:10,700
rejected, rejected, rejected.
Listen, kids, I love this.
He's talking down to them.

1736
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:14,240
Most of you are in college or
your senior years of high school.

1737
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:17,420
Fucking go out there and crush some pussy.

1738
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:22,100
Have trouble talking to girls. Here's
what you do. Go to your classes.

1739
01:46:22,220 --> 01:46:26,630
Come back to your dorm room and take a
nap or play Madden or do whatever till

1740
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:31,631
around 1:00 AM go get a fake id or chalk
your ID and move out to the bar about

1741
01:46:33,081 --> 01:46:37,940
one hour before they closed. Scope out the
action in search for blood. Be a shark.

1742
01:46:37,970 --> 01:46:42,680
Look for the over inebriated,
the overweight, the low
self esteem. Make it happen.

1743
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:46,850
He's screaming now, make it happen. He's
given a little halftime speech here. Uh,

1744
01:46:46,851 --> 01:46:50,040
be blunt. Ask a girl if you
can grab a little titty. Stick

1745
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,910
a hand down a chick's pants. When
you're on a dance floor, be aggressive.

1746
01:46:55,290 --> 01:46:56,330
All that shit works in the year.

1747
01:46:56,360 --> 01:47:00,180
I'm not gonna lie to you putting your
hand out some girl's hands on the dance

1748
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,640
floor. You just don't fucking
do what you just saw it.

1749
01:47:02,641 --> 01:47:05,970
You start doing other areas
that are gateways to that area.

1750
01:47:08,850 --> 01:47:13,590
Lies, lies, lies, yeah. Pain. What if
he turns you on? What if you worked out?

1751
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:16,500
What if he was a dick and he was shredded
and he just knew it was going to be

1752
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:20,310
some great fucking stress relieving cock?
Nia,

1753
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:23,910
uh, uh, you know what?
You're doing right now.

1754
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:27,030
Right now you're being talk show
audience. Nia, let me tell you something.

1755
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:30,030
Anybody puts a hand on my ass.
They getting their ass kicked.

1756
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:36,720
You're full of shit in here. If you,
ah, all right, whatever you're sick.

1757
01:47:36,721 --> 01:47:40,650
I'll let you go. Um, and Oh and
never play up the nice guy thing. Uh,

1758
01:47:40,651 --> 01:47:44,700
you go in there, look like
you've done this a hundred
times. Scared of performing.

1759
01:47:44,701 --> 01:47:49,080
Don't worry, they won't
remember it anyways. And
chances are they've had worse.

1760
01:47:50,290 --> 01:47:52,530
All right? So this guy's cocky.
You know, I love about him.

1761
01:47:52,531 --> 01:47:55,890
He's cocky for good reasons and
also cocky for no reasons. I mean,

1762
01:47:57,710 --> 01:48:02,190
what are his accomplishments? What is,
I know? Well, he's, he slaps fat people.

1763
01:48:02,191 --> 01:48:04,720
He makes fun of Friends of midgets.
Any fucks.

1764
01:48:04,721 --> 01:48:09,030
A girls who are too drunk to say no,
and now we make six figures.

1765
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:14,850
Come on. You know, we was, she was
trying to be funny, but you know,

1766
01:48:15,030 --> 01:48:17,070
he did his thing. You know,
now you've got the attitude.

1767
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:20,010
You don't care if she comes, stays
laser praise. You ever see that?

1768
01:48:20,011 --> 01:48:24,240
Remember that guy? Damone
you know, it's funny.

1769
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:26,610
You know what's funny about you?

1770
01:48:26,611 --> 01:48:30,210
You already have that look on your face
when you meet a guy who doesn't give a

1771
01:48:30,211 --> 01:48:33,870
fuck the same way I didn't.
You got that look on your face.

1772
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:36,300
That fucking look that.

1773
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:40,020
Let me know that someday you are going
to be in my bedroom, which you are.

1774
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:42,630
I just didn't count on me falling for you.
That's where I fucked up.

1775
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:47,580
That's why you turned the tables on me,
Huh? Cutie Pie. All right. That's it.

1776
01:48:47,581 --> 01:48:50,610
That's it for the podcast.
You fucking twats you guys.

1777
01:48:53,780 --> 01:48:56,850
I got to end on a left and sometimes
we don't have a joke. Go dirty.

1778
01:48:57,030 --> 01:49:00,210
I'm teaching these people
how to be a comedian. If I
was on, if they could see me,

1779
01:49:00,211 --> 01:49:03,180
I just would have made a funny face.
That's all my act is.

You're coming out of it
yet too silly to be sick,

1802
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:22,993
Huh?
Wow.

1803
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:29,120
Pasta. That's what I ate when I was
single and I was fucking struggling.

1804
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:30,350
Really?

1805
01:50:30,350 --> 01:50:33,800
Can I eat it on like of the fucking back
of a chair of the way I used to ice.

1806
01:50:33,801 --> 01:50:37,130
Put the plate right where
you sit. I already told this

Thank you everybody. Have a
wonderful week. I'll talk to you.
