00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:16.949
attempt to explain this and then when i
get done i'm going to ask people to

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:16.959

you all hard it is when you have a

you all hard it is when you have a
 

00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:08.820
you all hard it is when you have a
government incentive and say we're going

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:08.830
government incentive and say we're going
 

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.190
government incentive and say we're going
to phase it out because it's very hard

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200
to phase it out because it's very hard
 

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.440
to phase it out because it's very hard
to phase it out so I think that's going

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:13.450
to phase it out so I think that's going
 

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:16.770
to phase it out so I think that's going
to be very very hard to phase out so

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:16.780
to be very very hard to phase out so
 

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.260
to be very very hard to phase out so
I've argued and said despite the fact I

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:19.270
I've argued and said despite the fact I
 

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.240
I've argued and said despite the fact I
would you know I might phase them out

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.250
would you know I might phase them out
 

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.419
would you know I might phase them out
altogether that's it I think that's

00:25:24.419 --> 00:25:24.429
altogether that's it I think that's
 

00:25:24.429 --> 00:25:26.279
altogether that's it I think that's
going to be politically very difficult

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:26.289
going to be politically very difficult
 

00:25:26.289 --> 00:25:30.000
going to be politically very difficult
to do and so if you'll end up with an

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.010
to do and so if you'll end up with an
 

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.070
to do and so if you'll end up with an
explicit guarantee and they're paying

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080
explicit guarantee and they're paying
 

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.580
explicit guarantee and they're paying
for it and they're still playing a

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:34.590
for it and they're still playing a
 

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:37.710
for it and they're still playing a
meaningful role then I would make them

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720
meaningful role then I would make them
 

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.960
meaningful role then I would make them
utilities because I certainly wouldn't

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:39.970
utilities because I certainly wouldn't
 

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.750
utilities because I certainly wouldn't
have their be government guarantee for

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:42.760
have their be government guarantee for
 

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.710
have their be government guarantee for
private profit and I would have a big

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720
private profit and I would have a big
 

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.120
private profit and I would have a big
utility I certainly wouldn't have

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:48.130
utility I certainly wouldn't have
 

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:49.890
utility I certainly wouldn't have
portfolios and I have big capital rules

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:49.900
portfolios and I have big capital rules
 

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.850
portfolios and I have big capital rules
but I think you're very wise to point

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:53.860
but I think you're very wise to point
 

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.390
but I think you're very wise to point
that out at the situation because we

00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:57.400
that out at the situation because we
 

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.250
that out at the situation because we
needed these we needed to nationalize

00:25:59.250 --> 00:25:59.260
needed these we needed to nationalize
 

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.080
needed these we needed to nationalize
them i think we actually the most

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:01.090
them i think we actually the most
 

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.630
them i think we actually the most
significant thing I did we did when i

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.640
significant thing I did we did when i
 

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.930
significant thing I did we did when i
was there was to nationalize those

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:06.940
was there was to nationalize those
 

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.060
was there was to nationalize those
because if can you imagine what would

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:09.070
because if can you imagine what would
 

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.220
because if can you imagine what would
happen the housing prices if we had met

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:11.230
happen the housing prices if we had met
 

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.919
happen the housing prices if we had met

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:24.120
about that a number of times so you need
that but but right now how we how we get

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:24.130
that but but right now how we how we get
 

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.690
that but but right now how we how we get
the government out of that business and

the government out of that business and
 

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.399
the government out of that business and
come up with with some system is

00:26:30.429 --> 00:26:32.789
sustainable is going to be very
difficult to do and I tell you there

00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799
difficult to do and I tell you there
 

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.649
difficult to do and I tell you there

00:27:15.699 --> 00:27:18.029
and the economic relationship with China
was so important as far as I was

00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:18.039
was so important as far as I was
 

00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:20.609
was so important as far as I was
concerned I thought this was as

00:27:20.609 --> 00:27:20.619
concerned I thought this was as
 

00:27:20.619 --> 00:27:25.589
concerned I thought this was as
important as any bilateral relationship

00:27:25.589 --> 00:27:25.599
important as any bilateral relationship
 

00:27:25.599 --> 00:27:27.389
important as any bilateral relationship
we had any relationship we had in the

difficult to get things done
 

00:27:33.159 --> 00:27:36.989
difficult to get things done

unilaterally and if you look at the
 

00:27:36.999 --> 00:27:39.349
unilaterally and if you look at the
world today and what I went down there

00:27:39.349 --> 00:27:39.359
world today and what I went down there
 

00:27:39.359 --> 00:27:43.259

security economic issue was going to be

security economic issue was going to be
 

00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:47.819
security economic issue was going to be
much easier if you had the biggest

if you didn't number one and I also knew

00:27:55.619 --> 00:27:55.629
if you didn't number one and I also knew
 

00:27:55.629 --> 00:27:58.439
if you didn't number one and I also knew
that the good news was we had an

00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:06.899
relationship of trading relationship is
going to be tension and we were going to

00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:06.909
going to be tension and we were going to
 

00:28:06.909 --> 00:28:09.119
going to be tension and we were going to
have real tension if we didn't figure

00:28:09.119 --> 00:28:09.129
have real tension if we didn't figure
 

00:28:09.129 --> 00:28:11.999
have real tension if we didn't figure
out how to get in there and manage that

00:28:11.999 --> 00:28:12.009
out how to get in there and manage that
 

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:16.139
out how to get in there and manage that
and we sure did with the Japanese and

00:28:16.139 --> 00:28:16.149
and we sure did with the Japanese and
 

00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:19.189

00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:28.020
so I am a big believer in engagement
and I think because we engaged and took

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:28.030
and I think because we engaged and took
 

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:32.640
and I think because we engaged and took
a lot of time and built trust that the

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:32.650
a lot of time and built trust that the
 

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.250

interpersonal level that we were able to
 

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.779
interpersonal level that we were able to
do things we were able to get the

00:28:36.779 --> 00:28:36.789
do things we were able to get the
 

00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:38.610
do things we were able to get the
biggest appreciation we'd have in the

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:38.620
biggest appreciation we'd have in the
 

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.289
biggest appreciation we'd have in the
remedy which I thought was important

00:28:40.289 --> 00:28:40.299
remedy which I thought was important
 

00:28:40.299 --> 00:28:42.350
remedy which I thought was important
doing a relatively short period of time

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360

and it would require sacrifices by

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240
and it would require sacrifices by
 

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.510
and it would require sacrifices by
throughout our society but none of the

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520
throughout our society but none of the
 

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.390
throughout our society but none of the
sacrifices would be too severe if they

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400
sacrifices would be too severe if they
 

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.680

I fortunately when I ran Goldman Sachs I

00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:14.830
I fortunately when I ran Goldman Sachs I
 

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:16.950
I fortunately when I ran Goldman Sachs I
had advised a lot of clients and they

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960
had advised a lot of clients and they
 

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.890
had advised a lot of clients and they
were the principal so I knew I had to

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:19.900
were the principal so I knew I had to
 

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.620
were the principal so I knew I had to
build that relationship of trust I knew

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:22.630
build that relationship of trust I knew
 

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:25.020

that members of Congress I had to work
 

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.060
that members of Congress I had to work
with them and then and then of course in

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:27.070
with them and then and then of course in
 

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:31.410
with them and then and then of course in
a crisis as was mentioned earlier it's

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:31.420
a crisis as was mentioned earlier it's
 

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.470
a crisis as was mentioned earlier it's
very it's just a very difficult you

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480
very it's just a very difficult you
 

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.330

never have all the information you need
 

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.790
never have all the information you need
or you like and so you have to get as

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800
or you like and so you have to get as
 

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.130
or you like and so you have to get as
much as quickly as you can and you have

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:41.140
much as quickly as you can and you have
 

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.910
much as quickly as you can and you have
to weigh the costs of taking imperfect

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920
to weigh the costs of taking imperfect
 

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.330
to weigh the costs of taking imperfect
actions against the costs of not acting

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:48.340
actions against the costs of not acting
 

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:51.180
actions against the costs of not acting
and then you always have to be prepared

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:51.190
and then you always have to be prepared
 

00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:56.150
and then you always have to be prepared
to change if you either learn more or

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160
to change if you either learn more or
 

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:59.910
to change if you either learn more or
the situation changes and so it's just

00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920
the situation changes and so it's just
 

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.740
the situation changes and so it's just
that it's a different and I think that's

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:01.750
that it's a different and I think that's
 

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:06.570
that it's a different and I think that's
the same in in in the private sector and

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:06.580
the same in in in the private sector and
 

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:10.920
the same in in in the private sector and
in government and fortunately I'd been

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:51.020
you can't underestimate how the
 

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.540
you can't underestimate how the
Europeans that have lived through both

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:52.550
Europeans that have lived through both
 

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:55.600
Europeans that have lived through both
systems how committed i think they are

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:55.610
systems how committed i think they are
 

00:55:55.610 --> 00:56:00.840
systems how committed i think they are
to the euro number one number two the

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:00.850
to the euro number one number two the
 

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:04.630
to the euro number one number two the
the financial system in Europe is not

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640
the financial system in Europe is not
 

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:07.960
the financial system in Europe is not
come back as quickly as in the US I

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:07.970
come back as quickly as in the US I
 

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:10.060
come back as quickly as in the US I
don't think their programs are quite as

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:10.070
don't think their programs are quite as
 

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:11.770
don't think their programs are quite as
effective I don't think their accounting

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:11.780
effective I don't think their accounting
 

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:13.960
effective I don't think their accounting
is as transparent I don't think their

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:13.970
is as transparent I don't think their
 

00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:16.060
is as transparent I don't think their
institutions it wrecked or as quick as

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:16.070
institutions it wrecked or as quick as
 

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:18.520
institutions it wrecked or as quick as
recognizing their losses and they have

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:18.530
recognizing their losses and they have
 

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:20.590
recognizing their losses and they have
lower amounts of capital but but the

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:20.600
lower amounts of capital but but the
 

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.960
lower amounts of capital but but the
financial system is basically stable in

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:22.970
financial system is basically stable in
 

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.580
financial system is basically stable in
Europe and so what you're dealing with

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:24.590
Europe and so what you're dealing with
 

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:27.160
Europe and so what you're dealing with
are the structural issues

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:27.170
are the structural issues
 

00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:31.450
are the structural issues
the fiscal issue and so the way I think

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:31.460
the fiscal issue and so the way I think
 

00:56:31.460 --> 00:56:34.079
the fiscal issue and so the way I think
about it is I think in the short term

00:56:34.079 --> 00:56:34.089
about it is I think in the short term
 

00:56:34.089 --> 00:56:38.260
about it is I think in the short term
right now I would guess that they have

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:38.270
right now I would guess that they have
 

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:41.020
right now I would guess that they have
the commitment to do what's necessary to

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:41.030
the commitment to do what's necessary to
 

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:43.900
the commitment to do what's necessary to
stabilize and prevent that short-term

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:43.910
stabilize and prevent that short-term
 

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:47.380
stabilize and prevent that short-term
crises and they've got the financial

00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:47.390
crises and they've got the financial
 

00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:50.289
crises and they've got the financial
capacity to do that so I think that's I

00:56:50.289 --> 00:56:50.299
capacity to do that so I think that's I
 

00:56:50.299 --> 00:56:52.210
capacity to do that so I think that's I
think the more interesting and difficult

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:52.220
think the more interesting and difficult
 

00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:54.099
think the more interesting and difficult
question is going to be how the

00:56:54.099 --> 00:56:54.109
question is going to be how the
 

00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:56.589
question is going to be how the
structural issues are worked through

00:56:56.589 --> 00:56:56.599
structural issues are worked through
 

00:56:56.599 --> 00:56:58.780
structural issues are worked through
later and just as we've got problems

00:56:58.780 --> 00:56:58.790
later and just as we've got problems
 

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:00.760
later and just as we've got problems
with our deficit they're going to be

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:00.770
with our deficit they're going to be
 

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:04.390
with our deficit they're going to be
other countries you know Greece being

00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400
other countries you know Greece being
 

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.579
other countries you know Greece being
one there are a number of meaningful

00:57:06.579 --> 00:57:06.589
one there are a number of meaningful
 

00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:08.770
one there are a number of meaningful
challenges in the intermediate to tilt

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:08.780
challenges in the intermediate to tilt
 

00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:11.980
challenges in the intermediate to tilt
the long term and but I think they've

00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:11.990
the long term and but I think they've
 

00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:14.640
the long term and but I think they've
got what it takes in the short term and

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:14.650
got what it takes in the short term and
 

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:19.150
got what it takes in the short term and
in clearly i understand that it's more

00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160
in clearly i understand that it's more
 

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:23.079
in clearly i understand that it's more
difficult if you don't have a your own

difficult if you don't have a your own
 

00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:25.750
difficult if you don't have a your own
monetary policy in your own currency to
