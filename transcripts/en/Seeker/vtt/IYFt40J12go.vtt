00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.280
[Sun] Flares to full!

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.280
[Earth] SHIELDS UP!...

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.280
HA!

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.280
[Sun] FIRE EVERYTHING!

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.640
[Earth] There's a crack in the shields!!

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.059
WHAT DO WE DO?!

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.530
Hey sunny dispositions, Trace with Julian
for DNews.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.590
The Sun and the Earth are in a constant battle,
thanks to the Sun's tendency to be an unfathomably

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.769
large mass of incandescent gas...

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.520
Yes, absolutely, it's a gigantic nuclear furnace
where hydrogen is built into helium...

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.660
At temperatures of millions of degrees!

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.010
But as a result… the sun is constantly releasing
highly energized particles blasted away from

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.579
these nuclear reactions.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.050
Mostly these particles are protons and electrons
with some alpha particles (the nuclei of helium),

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.489
and heavier charged particles thrown in like
the nuclei of magnesium, sulfur, iron, neon,

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.329
carbon, and titanium among others.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.829
Sometimes, the sun gets excited and releases
a mass of superheated, charged plasma -- called

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.280
a coronal mass ejection or CME.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.420
We've talked about them before.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.420
They're crazy.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.989
And that's when the Earth's magnetosphere
is really challenged.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.039
These CMEs can be strong enough to damage
satellites, force airplanes to change course

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.721
to avoid them, disrupt electronics on the
ground, and force astronauts to stay in the

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.530
shelter of the International Space Station.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.470
The main thing stopping those pungently radioactive,
highly charged particles from hitting you

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.740
and me on top of the head, is the Earth's
trusty magnetic field… generated by the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.260
movement of iron through our mantle.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.040
The magnetosphere works like a shield, protecting
us from harmful CMEs and other charged particles,

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.310
but our shield system has a crack in it!

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.049
That's right, new research from the GRAPES-3
muon telescope reads like a battle report

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.130
from Star Trek.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.770
Trace's Log, Stardate: June 22, 2015.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:43.540
A plasma ejection from the sun struck the
planet at 2.5 million kilometers per hour.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.360
The energetic collision caused a compression
of the magnetosphere between 2 and 5.5 times

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.420
the width of Earth itself… causing magnetic
storms and radio blackouts all over the planet.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.430
We suspect the Romulans are involved.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.610
No we don't.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.610
Trace out.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.610
Okay, lemme 'splain.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.619
A muon telescope is a cosmic ray detector.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.000
It's designed to keep an eye on cosmic rays
breaching the magnetosphere -- it's looking

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
for cracks.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And it found one.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.479
The magnetosphere is powerful, but not perfect.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.170
According to the data, published in Physical
Review Letters, the GRAPES-3 spotted a 20

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.030
giga electron volt collision with the magnetosphere
and then some leakage!

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.750
A CRACK IN THE FIELD!!!

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.660
REVERSE THE POLARIZATION!

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.660
Sorry.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.530
For perspective, the Large Hadron Collider,
the world's most powerful particle accelerator

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.910
can hit a top energy of about 26 GeV when
accelerating only few protons at a time.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.960
This solar assault lasted for 2 hours at 20
GeV and coronal mass ejections are filled

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.069
with plasma stretching half the distance from
Earth to the sun.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.849
Luckily for us down here under the shield,
it deflected the burst of solar plasma…

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.620
But CMEs aren't the only thing attacking Earth
at any given moment -- there are also cosmic

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.620
rays.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.159
To keep up the Star Trek references, the Sun
is like… the Romulan Fleet, but cosmic rays

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.140
are more like a few shuttlecraft or escape
pods.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.310
They're from other galaxies, black holes and
the like, and while they're few, they are

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.610
also constantly trying to leak down to us…

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.500
This is where the "crack" comes in.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.409
When the CME assaulted the magnetosphere at
such high energy, our field deflected it.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:18.220
But while it did that, some low-energy cosmic
radiation leaked through!

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.470
At that point, the energy was likely absorbed
by molecules in our atmosphere before it hit

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.470
you or me.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.330
In fact, the muon detector doesn't directly
detect cosmic rays or coronal mass ejections

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.330
at all.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.510
Instead, it detects muons -- subatomic particles
-- that are created when cosmic rays hit the

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.640
molecules of air in our atmosphere!

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.799
So GRAPES-3 detected this burst of activity
(the crack) that normalized after the CME

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.629
ended; shield integrity is nominal.

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.900
Even though we're okay down here, astronauts
on orbit are less so.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.410
People in space are bombarded with cosmic
rays!

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.640
Unlike some larger energetic particles of
a CME, cosmic rays can penetrate the walls

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.360
of the ISS (and the astronauts inside).

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.790
There's even a name for when one flies through
an astronaut's eyeball...

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.129
It's called Cosmic Ray Visual Phenomena -- and
the ray basically causes the rods and cones

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.820
to activate, creating a sparkle or spot.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.590
Astronaut Don Pettit describes it like "dancing
faeries."

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.609
Of course, long term exposure to cosmic rays,
like on a trip to Mars, could cause permanent

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.060
damage to brain cells.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.060
Not good.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.660
Luckily for us, the mantle keeps turning under
our feet, generating our magnetosphere shield,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.800
and keeping us safe from both CMEs and cosmic
rays… and from brain damage.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
Mostly.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.800
Mostly.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.490
Worried about radiation messing with your
brain?

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.810

affects your DNA here.
