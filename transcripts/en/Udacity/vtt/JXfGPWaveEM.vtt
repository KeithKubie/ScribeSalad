00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.040
Oh my god Mark,
I have the best idea for an app!

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.570
It's going to totally change the world.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:06.860
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah?

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it will totally revolutionize
how left handed people meet each other.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.530
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.020
&gt;&gt; It's so simple Mark.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.170
You'll be shown pictures
of other lefties near you,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.160
and you'll swipe them to the right if
you don't think they're interesting, and

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.560
you'll swipe them to the left If
they're a lefty you would like to meet.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.576
&gt;&gt; Brilliant, I'm sure.

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:25.970
&gt;&gt; Ugh, you wouldn't understand.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.185
Look at you,
standing there in your righty privilege.

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:32.509
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.606
&gt;&gt; Well I just wanted to thank you for

00:00:33.606 --> 00:00:35.420
teaching me everything there
is to know about Gradle.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.530
I'm going to be using the Gradle Java
plugin to build my Android app.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.810
I just thought you'd be proud.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.990
&gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.780
We barely scratched
the surface of Gradle.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.490
There's a lot more to building
an Android app than just compiling some

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.620
Java code.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.180
&gt;&gt; No,
I'm pretty sure I know everything.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.730
I'm changing the world, remember?

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.890
&gt;&gt; I know, I know.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.290
But, let's take a look at how
the Android build process works, first.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.970
&gt;&gt; I promise we'll change
the world tomorrow.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:57.470
&gt;&gt; Fine.
