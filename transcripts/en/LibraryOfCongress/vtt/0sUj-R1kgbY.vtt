WE'LL BE STARTING THE SUMMER
FILM SENTENCE COINCIDENTALLY,

LIFE LESSONS FROM MY GRAND
PHAT," NELSON MANDELA.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.670
THE STORY OF NELSON
MANDELA IS HIS STORY

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.330
AND HOPING IT WILL
BE YOUR STORY.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.720
HE'S CONTINUING HIS
GRANDFATHER'S LEGACY

AS CO-CHAIRMAN OF A

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.890
TO CREATE A POSITIVE IMAGE
FOR AFRICA AROUND THE GLOBE

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.890

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.620
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.920
OH, WOW. THIS IS SUCH A TREAT.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.220
AND IT'S EVEN MORE OF A TREAT

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.520
BECAUSE YOUR BOOK JUST
CAME OUT YESTERDAY.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.820
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.950
&gt;&gt; AND I GOT A CHANCE
TO READ IT LAST NIGHT.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.660
SO, WE'RE GOING TO DO -- BE ABLE
TO TALK ABOUT THE BOOK AND SOME

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.960
OF THE THINGS IN THERE.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.260
SO WE JUST THANK
YOU FOR BEING HERE.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.740
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: AN ABSOLUTE
PLEASURE TO BE HERE.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.290
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: HAVE YOU BEEN
TO WASHINGTON, D.C. BEFORE?

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.970
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I HAVE, I ATTENDED
THE BLACK CAUCUS TWICE.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:26.440
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOU CAN CLAP.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.140
SO, WELL, IN THE BOOK,
LET'S JUST GET TO IT --

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.260
HAVING THE LAST NAME MANDELA
AND WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU,

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.770
IS THERE A LOT OF
PRESSURE OR RESPONSIBILITY?

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.040
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: OF COURSE,
OF COURSE.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.700
I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A
LOT OF EXPECTATIONS,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.270
YOU KNOW, OF BEING A MANDELA.

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.500
OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, THEY
CONSTANTLY WANT TO PUT YOU

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.050
IN THE FOOTSTEPS
OF NELSON MANDELA.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.900
AND WANT TO KNOW
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.940
FOR YOUR COMMUNITY, YOU KNOW?

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.500
LUCKILY, I AM DOING
SOMETHING FOR MY COMMUNITY,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.610
THROUGH MY FOUNDATION WHERE ALL
OF OUR EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.970
AND TECHNOLOGY AND
CELEBRATING AFRICAN CULTURE.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.960
AND DEVELOPED ENTREPRENEURS
IN THE VILLAGES.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.670
YEAH.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.690
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOU MENTIONED
TECHNOLOGY.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.200
HOW DO YOU BRING THAT IN?

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.000
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: SO BASICALLY WE'RE
RUNNING A THREE-MONTH COMPUTER

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.910
CODING PROGRAM.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.480
WE HAVE -- WE'RE TRAINING
50 YOUTH, 40 IN HIGH SCHOOL

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.750
AND THE OTHER 20
UNEMPLOYUNEMPLOYED YOUTH.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.450
ONE OF THE BIGGEST
CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:48.100
IN AFRICA IS WE HAVE 60% TO
70% OF OUR YOUTH UNEMPLOYED.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.120
AND UP TO MORE THAN 60%
OF THEM ARE UNEMPLOYABLE.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.460
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS
TO ACTUALLY BE EMPLOYED.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.350
SO WE ARE TRYING TO DO

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.560
THAT THROUGH TEACHING
THEM HOW TO DO CODING.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.070
AND THEY WRITE AN EXAM WITH
ORACLE AFTER THREE MONTHS.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.140
THEY THEN QUALIFY
FOR THE QUALIICATION

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.220
AND THEN WE FIND THEM JOBS.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.520
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: AFTER THREE MONTHS.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.820
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.120
VERY BASIC.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.630
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WOW, THAT'S
QUITE SOMETHING.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.270
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: THEY HAVE A
SKILL, THEY HAVE A CERTIFICATE

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.000
THAT PROVES THEY'RE PROFICIENT

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.910
IN THAT PARTICULAR
MODEL, ENTRY LEVEL.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.020
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: NOW, SPEAKING OF
JUMPING RIGHT INTO THE BOOK,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.790
AS A YOUNG MAN, AND I CAN SEE

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.610
WHERE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN A
THREAD, YOU WERE VERY MUCH

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.950
INTO CERTAIN VIDEO GAMES?

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.660
YOU MAY SAY WHICH ONES?

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.890
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: NORMAL ONES.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.910
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: REALLY.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.720
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: SPORTS, MUSIC.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.020
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: MUSIC.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.550
IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR
YOU DESCRIBE HIP-HOP AND ALL

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.980
OF THE THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.820
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I WAS VERY LUCKY.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.440
MY OLDER BROTHER, HE
GREW UP IN LONDON.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:20.370
SO WHEN I WAS 17, HE WAS
PLAYING PUBLIC ENEMY.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.750
THE FAT BOYS.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.050
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: THE FAT BOYS?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.350
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES?

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.840
AND, OF COURSE, COOL J RAP.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.060
AND SO, YOU KNOW, HE'S AN OLDER
BROTHER AND I REALLY LOOKED

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.180
UP TO HIM, I REALLY FOLLOWED HIM

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.440
AND THE TEAM HE SUPPORTED,
THE LOCAL TEAM.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.690
AND IN TERMS OF THE
MUSIC IN THIS INSTANCE.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.910
THE LABEL THAT HE LIKED, HE WAS
REALLY A GREAT INFLUENCE FOR ME

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.130
AT THOSE FORMATIVE
YEARS, TO BE HONEST.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.640
AND, I OF COURSE IDENTIFIED
FROM HIP-HOP BECAUSE WE COME

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.960
FROM A HISTORY OF FIGHTING
THE POWERS THAT BE,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.190
FIGHTING AGAINST THE SYSTEM,
FIGHTING AGAINST APARTHEID.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.410
SO ENWHICH YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
BEING A REBEL, IT'S SOMETHING

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.740
THAT IN MY BLOOD IT COMES
FROM THE GENERATIONS.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:13.170
HE HIMSELF WAS A REBEL AND HIS
FATHER HIMSELF WAS A REBEL.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:20.700
BASICALLY MY GRANDFATHER
WAS BORN IN A RURAL VILLAGE.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.810
AND THEN HIS FATHER
GOT IN DISPUTE WITH ONE

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.030
OF THE -- GOT IN TO A DISPUTE.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.940
AND BASICALLY PUNISHED
THE GENTLEMEN AND TOOK IT.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.190
AND HE WENT TO THE
WHITE MAGISTRATE

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.360
TO REPORT THIS MATTER.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.050
AND SO THEY -- THEY BASICALLY
DENOUNCED OR REMOVED THEM

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.360
FROM OUR GREAT GRANDFATHER.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.560
SO HE LEFT AND MOVED BECAUSE HE
WOULDN'T GIVE BACK THE CAPITAL,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.200
BECAUSE HE SAID, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.280
YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW
I RULE MY AREA.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.580
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO COME

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.290
AND TELL ME HOW I
SHOULD GOVERN MY AREA.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.330
SO PLEASE GET AWAY.

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.800
HE TOLD HIM TO -- TO LEAVE
HIM ALONE, BASICALLY.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.130
SO THEY BASICALLY CAME
WITH POLICE, ETC. , ETC. ,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.090
AND THEY REMOVED HIM FORCIBLY.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.390
SO HE SETTLED IN KUNU.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:14.530
AND MY GRANDFATHER GREW
UP, YOU KNOW, SEEING HIM.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.040
BUT ANOTHER THING HE WAS I
GUESS ATTRIBUTED TO IS WE COME

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:24.290
FROM THE RURAL KINGDOM AND
WE COME FROM THE FOUR PARTS.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.880
SO WE ARE A POLYGAMIST NATION.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.570
SO THE FIRST WIFE
IS THE GREAT HOUSE,

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.660
THE SECOND WIFE IS
THE RIGHT-HAND HOUSE.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:36.230
THE THIRD WIFE IS
THE LEFT-HAND HOUSE,

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.060
AND WE COME FROM THE FOURTH
HOUSE, WHICH IS A JUNIOR HOUSE.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.710
AND EVERY WIFE AFTER THAT
COMES FROM A JUNIOR HOUSE.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.630
&gt;&gt; AND IN THE FOURTH HOUSE
SEEMED TO BE THE HOUSE

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.140
THAT MEDIATED BETWEEN
THE OTHER HOUSES?

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.440
&gt;&gt; THAT IS CORRECT.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.540
SO OUR JOB FROM THE FOURTH HOUSE
WAS TO BE MEDIATORS AMONGST ALL

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.850
OF THE HOUSES, ESPECIALLY
AMONGST THE FIRST TWO HOUSES

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.880
BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS
FIGHTING OVER THE CROWN.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.180
AND THEN TO BE COUNSELOR
TO THE KING.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.210
SO, YOU SEE, NELSON MANDELA
DID NOT FALL FROM THE HEAVENS

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.000
AND BECOME A GREAT PEACEMAKER,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.440
IT IS IN HIS BLOOD,
YOU UNDERSTAND.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.010
THAT IS WHAT HE WAS ESSENTIALLY
RAISED TO DO, TO BECOME.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.250
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: THAT'S
AN INTERESTING IDEA

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.900
OF HOW YOUR GRANDFATHER
DEVELOPED

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.190
AND WHAT HE BROUGHT WITH HIM.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:35.270
YOU MENTIONED, AND THE NAME OF
THE BOOK REFERS TO SOMETHING.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.570
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.870
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: GOING
TO THE MOUNTAIN.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.950
&gt;&gt; MANDELA "GOING TO THE
MOUNTAIN" REFERS TO TWO THINGS.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:47.590
FIRSTLY, IN OUR CULTURE,
WE HAVE A RIGHT OF PASSAGE

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.040
WHERE YOU MOVE FROM BEING
A BOY TO BEING A MAN

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.560
AND THAT IS CIRCUMCISION.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:56.700
WE ARE CIRCUMCISED BETWEEN
THE AGES OF 18 AND 21.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.100
BECAUSE WE DON'T
BELIEVE YOU CAN BE A MAN

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.660
AT THE AGE WHEN YOU'RE BORN.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.000
YOU KNOW, USUALLY
HERE IN THE WORLD,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.010
YOU GET CIRCUMCISED
WHEN YOU'RE BORN.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:05.310
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: SPOILER ALERT,

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:10.550
THERE'S AN ENTIRE CHAPTER
ON YOUR EXPERIENCE.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:14.340
(LAUGHTER)

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.900
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: FOR US,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.140
TO UNDERSTAND FIRSTLY
HOW TO BECOME A MAN,

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.860
YOU HAVE TO EARN THE
RIGHTS TO BECOME A MAN.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:28.010
YOU DON'T JUST BECOME -- TURN
21 AND NOW YOU'RE REGARDED

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.420
AS AN ADULT, NO, YOU
HAVE TO EARN THIS RIGHT.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.720
YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.430
AND THAT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT HAPPENS IS THE CHOP --

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.330
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: LET'S JUST
SAY, THAT WAS THE --

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:46.830
AT NIGHT, YOU'RE READING
THIS AND GOING OKAY.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.530
I COULDN'T STOP READING.

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:58.850
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: THAT'S THE
FIRST -- (LAUGHTER)

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.150
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: THAT'S REFERS

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.030
TO THE CIRCUMCISION
PROCESS WE GO THROUGH.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.330
IT'S RICH.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.640
BECAUSE YOU GET TO UNDERSTAND
WHO YOU ARE, YOUR HISTORY,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.650
YOUR HERITAGE, YOUR SPIRITUAL
BEING IN TERMS OF HOW YOU RELATE

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.840
TO OTHER TRIBES AND OTHER CLANS.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.630
AND SECOND, THE CHALLENGES,

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.670
THE JOURNEY THAT ALL
YOUNG BLACK PEOPLE

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.790
IN THIS WORLD, PEOPLE
OF MINORITY.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.510
WE FACE AN ENORMOUS TASK.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.110
YOU HAVE TO GO AND
APPLY TO COLLEGE.

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:36.930
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU
GET ENOUGH GOOD GRADES

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.710
TO APPLY TO COLLEGE.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.910
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE GET --
WHEN YOU GET INTO COLLEGE,

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.110
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PAY
FOR THE TUITION FEES?

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.760
AND WHEN YOU FINISH
COLLEGE, HOW ARE YOU GOING

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.150
TO PAY BACK THOSE TUITION FEES?

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.180
AND NOW YOU MUST
BEGIN YOUR CAREER.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.500
SO THESE ARE ALL LITERAL
MOUNTAINS THAT WE'RE FACING

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.220
AS YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
BECAUSE OUR JOB IS MUCH HARDER

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.980
THAN THE AVERAGE WHITE
WESTERNER WHO HAS GROWN

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.750
UP IN THIS PRIVILEGED
WORLD, YOU SEE.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.160
SO THIS IS WHAT GOING
TO THE MOUNTAIN MEANS.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.160
AND AS NELSON MANDELA SAID,
AFTER CLIMBING A GREAT HILL,

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.750
AND YOU REACH THE TOP OF THAT
HILL, YOU REALIZE THERE ARE

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.590
SO MANY MORE MOUNTAINS TO CLIMB.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:24.340
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: AND YOU HAVE THE
PERSON THAT WE ALL REVERE

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.480
AND WE KNOW HIS PUBLIC PERSONA.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.970
WHEN YOU WERE 11, YOU
WENT TO LIVE WITH HIM.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.270
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES.

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.840
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WHAT WAS --
JUST TELL US ABOUT THAT.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:41.750
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES, I WAS LIVING
IN A GHETTO IN JOHANNESBURG.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:48.320
AND SO ONE DAY, THIS GENTLEMAN
CAME, MY GRANDFATHER'S DRIVER,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.130
AND HE SAID, I'VE BEEN
SENT BY GRANDFATHER

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.430
TO COME AND FETCH YOU.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.730
COME, LET'S GO.

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.930
THAT WAS -- I HAD ONLY MET MY
GRANDFATHER ONCE BEFORE IN 1990.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.180
THIS IS THREE YEARS LATER.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.940
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WAS HE
IN PRISON THEN?

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.240
RIGHT?

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.740
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: WE MET HIM JUST
BEFORE HE CAME OUT OF PRISON.

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.300
AND THIS IS THREE YEARS LATER,

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:10.340
NEVER SAW HIM, NEVER
HEARD FROM HIM.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.690
ALL OF A SUDDEN, A DRIVER
TOOK HIM AND WAS SENT BY HIM.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.880
I'M HOME ALONE BECAUSE
I'M AT HOME

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.790
AT 3:00 P.M. MY PARENTS GET
HOME AT 7:00 P.M. FROM WORK.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.850
SO I'M NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT
THE APPROVAL OF MY PARENTS.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:27.020
NO CELL PHONES IN THOSE DAYS.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.760
DO YOU KNOW WHO YOUR
GRANDFATHER IS?

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.060
ARE YOU CRAZY?

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.360
DO I NEED TO LOSE MY JOB?

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.660
PLEASE, LET'S GO!

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.850
I SAID, NO, SIR, I
CANNOT.E GAVE UP.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.820
MY PARENTS CAME HOME
THAT EVENING

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.100
AND I TOLD MY FATHER WHAT
HAD TRANSPIRED AND HE SAID,

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.400
YOU KNOW, IF THAT MAN COMES
AGAIN, YOU SHOULD GO WITH HIM.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.260
LO AND BEHOLD, THAT MAN CAME
BACK THE VERY SAME WEEK.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.800
AND I WENT TO THEM AND HE TOOK
ME TO MY GRANDFATHER'S HOUSE,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:59.840
WHICH WAS THIS BIG HOUSE,
A MANSION IN A WHITE SUBURB

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.670
IN THE NORTHERN SUBURBS OF
JOHANNESBURG, AND, YOU KNOW,

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.560
BASICALLY MY GRANDFATHER TOLD ME

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.380
THAT HE WOULD BE SENDING
MY PARENTS TO COLLEGE

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.470
AND WHILE THEY WERE AT COLLEGE,
THEY NEEDED TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:19.140
AND HE WAS GOING TO LOOK
AFTER ME DURING THAT TIME.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.440
I SLEPT OVER THAT DAY.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.820
MY FATHER CAME THE NEXT DAY
AND HE SAID, YEAH, WELL,

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.580
THIS IS WHAT MY FATHER HAS
DECIDED -- YOUR GRANDFATHER --

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.390
AND THIS IS WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.720
AS A YOUNG PERSON IN
ANY AFRICAN FAMILY,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.810
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.710
YOU DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.360
AND SO THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.230
AND NOW FROM A GHETTO,
FROM SLEEPING, EATING RICE

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.320
AND TOMATO SAUCE, THAT WAS MY
STAPLE DIET, BECAUSE WE GREW

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.080
UP IN A POOR HOME, TO
MOVING INTO THIS MANSION

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:55.080
WHERE THERE ARE CHEFS, DRIVERS,
SECURITY, GARDINERS, STAFF,

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.010
STAFF, STAFF, STAFF, STAFF.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.630
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOU MENTIONED
YOU FELT LIKE

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.830
"THE FRESH PRINCE OF BELL AIR."

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.750
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: KIND OF WAS
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.050
TO BE HONEST?

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:11.060
YOU WENT AND THERE YOU WERE.

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.360
AND THERE HE WAS.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.270
BUT A PRIVATE PERSON THAT MOST
OF US COULD NEVER IMAGINE.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.290
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:25.220
&gt;&gt; HE WAS ACTUALLY -- THE
FIRST CUP ALL OF YEARS,

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.280
THERE WASN'T MUCH
CONVERSATION HAPPENING.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.270
HE WAS A DISCIPLINARIAN.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.810
HE TOLD ME EVERY TIME
MY ROOM WAS IN A MESS.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:39.840
THINGS THAT REVOLVED
AROUND SCHOOL, WHAT I NEEDED

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:44.300
FOR SCHOOL, BOOKS,
UNIFORMS, SPORTS,

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.640
ALL ABOUT HOW THE
REPORT CARD WAS LOOKING.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.780
NOT MUCH OUTSIDE OF
SCHOOL STUFF, BASICALLY.

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:55.290
AND I REMEMBER ONCE,
I LOST MY JERSEY --

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.710
MY SCHOOL JERSEY
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.590
AND, OF COURSE, I HAD TO
TELL HIM, I NEEDED A NEW ONE.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:08.550
I WENT AND I TOLD HIM
AND I WAS VERY NERVOUS.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.680
HE CHANGED HIS FACE
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:20.500
TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING
TO SLEEP OUTSIDE!

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.590
OH, OKAY. OUT I WENT, OUTSIDE.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.720
I WAS PLAYING SOCCER
IN THE GARAGE.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.400
IRS AT FIRST, IT
WAS KIND OF OKAY.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.570
STARTED TO GET COLD, DARK.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.810
I SAW THE COOK BRING
ME BLANKETS.

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.910
SHE GAVE ME THE BLANKET
AND I THOUGHT, OH, MY GOD,

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:45.750
I'M REALLY GOING
TO SLEEP OUTSIDE.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:50.950
MAYBE 20 MINUTES, I MAKE
MY LITTLE BED ON THE GRASS.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:57.340
AND THEN 20 MINUTES LATER I CAME
UP AND HE CALLED ME AND HE SAID

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.080
IF YOU EVER LOSE ANOTHER JERSEY,

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.810
YOU WILL DEFINITELY SLEEP
OUTSIDE, NOW GO INSIDE,

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.020
HAVE YOUR DINNER AND
GO STRAIGHT TO BED.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.760
IT WAS KIND OF HARSH
BUT IT WORKED.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.270
I NEVER LOST ANOTHER JERSEY.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.780
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.820
WHERE HE MENTIONED HE
WAS THE DISCIPLINARIAN.

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.700
IN HINDSIGHT, DO YOU
THINK THAT YOU NEEDED IT?

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.070
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.730
I WAS A LITTLE KNUCKLE
HEAD BACK THEN.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:29.720
I JUST WANTED TO HAVE
FUN AND FUN AND MORE FUN.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.490
WHETHER IT WAS -- WASN'T PLAY
STATION BACK THEN, IT WAS SAGA.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.110
YOU KNOW? OR SOCCER.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.240
YOU KNOW? THAT WAS --
OR WATCHING A MOVIE.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.510
I'D GO TO HIM ON
FRIDAY, SATURDAY, HEY,

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:48.200
CAN I HAVE 50 RAND TO GO
WATCH A MOVIE WITH MY FRIENDS.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.440
AND HE WOULD ALWAYS GIVE ME.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.070
NOT ONE TIME HE SAID NO.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.940
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: SO THERE WAS
A SOFTNESS UNDER THERE.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.240
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.750
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: I WROTE THIS
DOWN, TO BE THE FATHER

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.990
OF A NATION WAS A GREAT
HONOR BUT TO BE FATHER

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:10.220
OF A FAMILY WAS A GREAT JOY,
A JOY I HAD FAR TOO LITTLE OF.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.320
AND IN THE YEARS OF
IMPRISONMENT, HE MISSED THAT.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.960
SO WITH YOU HE HAD AN
OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.260
&gt;&gt; I GUESS SO.

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.560
I GUESS SO.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:30.750
I MEAN, I ALSO STAYED WITH
MY GRANDMOTHER A LITTLE BIT,

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:32.050
GRANDMA WINNIE.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.790
HE COULD HAVE SENT ME
TO GO STAY WITH HER.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:39.480
OR MY REAL GRANDMOTHER
FROM THE FIRST MARRIAGE,

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.890
HIS FIRST WIFE WAS STILL ALIVE.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.360
MY AUNT WAS STILL AROUND.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.270
BUT HE DECIDED TO TAKE
ME IN AND STAY WITH HIM.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:52.500
HE HAD OPTIONINGS BUT
HE DECIDED I'M GOING

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.800
TO DISCIPLINE THIS YOUNG MAN,

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.520
I'M GOING TO SHOW
HIM THE WAY OF LIFE.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:03.130
SO PERHAPS THAT WAS HIS WAY OF
MAKING SOME SORT OF, YOU KNOW,

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:06.670
COMPENSATION OR RESTITUTION
OR WHAT --

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:10.560
BE THE FATHER FIGURE THAT HE
NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.930
THAT BECAUSE HE HAD TO MAKE
THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.230
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.550
INSTEAD OF TAKING HIS
KID TO GO RIDE BIKES,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:22.620
HE HAD TO GO ORGANIZE
PEACEFUL PROTESTS AND MARCHES

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.750
AND STRATEGIZE HOW TO KEEP THE
ANC ALIVE WHILE IT WAS BAD.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.360
HE HAD SO MANY THINGS TO
DO TO FOCUS ON TB COUNTRY.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.490
SO HE HAD TO MAKE A
VERY HARD DECISION.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:42.290
SATISFY HIS FAMILY OR FIVE
PEOPLE OR THE GREATER GOOD

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:48.120
OR 4 MILLION OR 5 MILLION.

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.640
&gt;&gt; AND YOU MENTIONED THAT
IN PRIVATE HE WAS SOME

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.240
OF THE THINGS THAT WE COULD
SEE -- HUMBLE AND FORGIVING.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.190
AND HE HAD A SENSE
OF HUMOR, THOUGH.

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.500
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: GREAT
SENSE OF HUMOR.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:09.660
HE WAS MISCHIEVOUS WITH HIS
HUMOR, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:16.840
ONE TIME I HAD ASKED A FEMALE
FRIEND TO COME OVER FOR LUNCH.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.330
AND SO HE SAYS, OH,
NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.530
SO DID YOU PROPOSE
TO MY GRANDSON?

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.830
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: OKAY.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:28.630
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YOU CAN IMAGINE
THE YOUNG LADY BLUSHING.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.220
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.380
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: HE WAS ALWAYS
TRYING TO THROW ME --

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.470
LIKE, HEY, HAVE YOU
SEEN MINUTE GRANDSON.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.800
I WAS A BIT TOO YOUNG.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.030
BECAUSE YOU USED TO HAVE -- MISS
SOUTH AFRICA WOULD COME OVER,

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.180
MISS UNIVERSE WOULD COME OVER,
MISS WORLD WOULD COME OVER.

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:50.360
I WAS IN AWE BUT I WAS
WAY TOO I DON'T THINK.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.130
I COULDN'T REALLY HANG.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.430
HE DIDN'T CARE.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:01.690
HE WOULD BE JUST LIKE, HEY,
DID YOU SEE MY GRANDSON?

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.270
THAT WAS PRETTY NICE.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.680
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: SO DURING THIS TIME,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.770
HE BECAME PRESIDENT
OF THE NATION.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:12.520
WERE YOU AWARE OF THOSE
-- HE WAS WORKING WITH YOU

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.680
AND BEING PART OF YOUR
LIFE, BUT HE WAS HELPING

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.300
TO BUILD THE NATION AGAIN?

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:18.970
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES,
HE WAS VERY BUSY.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.760
HE TRAVELLED A LOT, OF COURSE.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.840
THERE WERE MANY WEEKS
I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:27.830
IT WAS FUN, I COULD
GET AWAY WITH MURDER.

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.990
I COULD PLAY GAMES UNTIL
2:00 IN THE MORNING.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.670
AND NO ONE WOULD SAY ANYTHING.

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.520
BUT WHEN HE WAS HOME,
HEY, THE CHIEF IS HOME.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.820
YOU HAD TO KEEP EVERYTHING
IN LINE.

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:44.050
BUT THE ONE THING I REALIZED
ABOUT HIM IS THAT THAT'S A MAN

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:51.500
WITH SO MUCH COMPASSION FOR
PEOPLE, FOR ORDINARY PEOPLE.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.750
YOU CAN IMAGINE --
MICHAEL JACKSON HAD BEEN

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.350
TO OUR HOME TWICE.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:01.600
EVEN FORMER PRESIDENT
BUSH, EVANDER HOLYFIELD,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.290
MIKE TYSON, YOU NAME IT.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.590
AND ALL THESE PEOPLE

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:12.960
THAT VISITED US HE TREATED THE
SAME WAY AS MAMA KOLI WHO COOKED

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.530
FOR US, ALSO AS THE
GARDENER AND THE DRIVER.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.760
ONE THING NELSON MANDELA
UNDERSTOOD SIMILAR

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.930
TO MARTIN LUTHER KING,
YOU DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:31.530
BY THEIR SKIN COLOR, THEIR
AGE, RACE, SEXUALITY.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.280
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT EACH
PERSON HAS THE POTENTIAL

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:37.240
TO ACHIEVE GREATNESS AND
WE SHOULD ALLOW THAT PERSON

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.570
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
ACHIEVE THE GREATNESS THEY WANT

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:52.220
TO ACHIEVE FOR THEMSELVES.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.520
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.780
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOU MENTIONED HE
TREATED EVERYONE THE SAME.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:04.150
I WAS REALLY TAKEN WITH HIS
PHONE CALL WITH QUEEN ELIZABETH.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.940
WE THINK OF HER

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.860
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I KNOW, I KNOW.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:15.630
IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHE
WAS ALSO VERY MISCHIEVOUS

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:16.990
WITH GRANDFATHER.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:22.300
I REMEMBER ONE AFTERNOON -- NOT
SURE I SHOULD TELL THIS STORY.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.600
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: OH, DO.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.900
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: IT'S A BIT LATE NOW.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.360
A BIT LATE GRAND DAD, PLEASE
FORGIVE ME FOR THIS ONE.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.960
WE WERE HAVING LUNCH, ME,
MY GRANDFATHER AND AUNTIE --

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:37.700
MAMA KOLI COMES AND THE
PHONE NUMBER COMES IN.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.460
WE USED TO CALL HIM
FATHER -- TATA --

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.280
IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH
ON THE LINE.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.440
PUT HER THROUGH,
PUT HER THROUGH.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:51.510
AND THEN THE PHONE COMES.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.940
HE PICKS IT UP.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.580
HELLO, ELIZABETH, HOW ARE YOU?

00:23:55.580 --> 00:24:04.640
(LAUGHTER) AND THEY
HAVE A CONVERSATION.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.140
THEY TALK, THEY TALK.

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.410
YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY, BYE, BYE.

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:12.840
AND HOW CAN YOU CALL
THE QUEEN BY HER NAME,

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:16.010
YOU HAVE TO SAY YOUR IMAGESTY!

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.530
AND HE TURNED TO HER AND SAY,
WHY, SHE CALLS ME NELSON?

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:19.830
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.130
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WOW.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:28.920
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: WE ALWAYS CALL
EACH OTHER BY OUR FIRST NAME.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.920
DO YOU FORGET I'M A PRINCE.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.110
DO YOU FORGET I'M
A PRINCE, DARLING?

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:41.500
HMM? WHERE IS THE LOYALTY HERE.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.170
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WOW.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.530
SO YOU HAVE THE PRIVATE SIDE
AND YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS LEGACY.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.100
THAT'S WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE
HERE AND WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.280
ABOUT HOW SOME OF THE LESSONS

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.220
THAT YOU THINK CAN
BE APPLIED TODAY.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.520
THERE WAS A LOT ABOUT
RECONCILIATION, AND BEING ABLE

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.540
TO LET GO OF, NOW, NEVER

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:10.440
TO FORGET THE HATE,
BUT TO LET THINGS GO.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.990
TO RECONCILE.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.060
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES, YOU KNOW,

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:19.320
I THINK NELSON MANDELA OBVIOUSLY
HE TRIED THE PEACEFUL WAY.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.360
RIGHT? A PEACEFUL MARCH.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.100
BUT HE SAYS IN AN INTERVIEW
THAT ALL THE PEACEFUL MARCHES,

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:29.760
IMPORTANT AS THEY WERE, THEY
WERE ONLY MET WITH VIOLENCE

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.600
AND SAVAGE ATTACKS
BY THE GOVERNMENT.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.700
SO THEY DECIDED TO NOW
TAKE UP MILITARY ACTION

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.360
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.180
AND SO HE BECAME THE
FIRST COMMANDER IN CHIEF

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.510
OF THE MILITARY ARM OF THE ANC.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:51.350
HE TRAINED IN ALGERIA
FOR SIX MONTHS.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:56.280
AND SIX MONTHS WITH AN EMPEROR.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.620
AND HE CAME BACK AND STARTED
OBVIOUSLY HITTING BACK

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.920
AT THE ENEMY.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.440
BUT THEY DIDN'T OBVIOUSLY
ATTACK PEOPLE.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.770
THEY ATTACKED THE INFRASTRUCTURE
OF THEIR GOVERNMENTS.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:10.020
SO THEY ATTACKED THE POWER
LINES, THE POWER STATIONS,

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.760
THEY ATTACKED THE TELEPHONE
INFRASTRUCTURE, BASICALLY.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:20.440
BUT, OF COURSE, THERE WERE
CASUALTIES AS IS IN ANY WAR.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:25.940
CAPTURED AND SPENT
TIME IN PRISON.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:33.080
HE GOT TO SEE THE
INDEPENDENCE THAT WAS HAPPENING

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:41.010
ACROSS AFRICA, FROM 1960 GHANA
TO 1980 IN ZIMBABWE AND MOST

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.910
OF THE COUNTRIES WERE
GAINING INDEPENDENCE

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.590
IN AFRICA WERE GOING
THROUGH CIVIL WAR.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:52.200
AND I THINK HE REALLY WANTED
TO STOP THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:57.960
THAT WAS REALLY EATING AWAY
AT OUR COUNTRY, OUR SOCIETY.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.530
AND AS HE CAME OUT, HE
DECIDED TO OBVIOUSLY,

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:05.800
YOU KNOW, FORGIVE HIS CAPTORS.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:13.360
FORGIVE THOSE PEOPLE WHO
TRESPASS AGAINST HIM, YOU KNOW?

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.190
AND THE ONE THING THAT I HAVE
TO ASK MYSELF IS, FIRST OF ALL,

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.820
THAT IS ONE SUPER
UNNATURAL THING TO DO,

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.640
BECAUSE IF I WAS THERE FOR FIVE
YEARS, EVEN, LET ALONE 27 YEARS,

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.760
FIVE YEARS, I WOULD COME OUT
WITH THE VENGEANCE AND THE ANGER

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.400
OF -- OF A GORILLA, RIGHT?

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.110
AND I WOULD WANT TO
BLAST ALL OF MY ENEMIES.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:36.410
BUT HE DIDN'T.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.940
WHICH IS SOMETHING
VERY UNNATURAL.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:42.780
SECONDLY, A LOT OF COUNTRIES --

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:49.440
LEADERS WHO WERE CAUGHT WERE
KILLED IN INCARCERATION.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.160
THEY DIDN'T LAST LONG.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.880
SO HOW COME NELSON
MANDELA WAS NOT KILLED?

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.270
WHY WAS NELSON MANDELA SPARED?

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.380
AND THE ONLY ANSWER THAT I CAN
COME TO IS THAT GOD SAVED HIM.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.880
THAT GOD WAS THE ONE WHO WAS
ON THE SIDE AND KEPT HIM ALIVE

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.870
FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE
THAT HE HAD TO PLAY

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.290
AFTER HE CAME OUT OF PRISON.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:17.580
AND SO HE UNDERSTOOD
THAT THEY NEEDED

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.250
TO CURE THIS VICIOUS
CYCLE OF VIOLENCE

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.020
THAT WAS TAKING OUR COUNTRY.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.000
AND HE AND BISHOP TUTU
CAME UP WITH THE TRUTH

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.160
AND RECONCILIATION TALKS
THAT CAME OUT OF THE 90s,

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.550
THOSE WHO HAD LOST
LOVED ONES, TORTURED,

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:40.470
WRONGFULLY INCARS
RATED FOR MANY YEARS --

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.520
INCARCERATED FOR MANY YEARS
TO SIT WITH THEIR VICTIMS

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.040
AND HAVE SOME SORT OF
RESTORITIVE JUSTICE

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:53.980
AND FOR THE PERPETRATORS BE
ABLE TO DEVOLVE EVERY BIT

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.370
OF INFORMATION IN
RETURN FOR AMNESTY.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:00.630
A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT
IT WASN'T REALLY SUCCESSFUL.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:05.350
BUT I THINK IT REALLY
LAY THE FOUNDATION TO TRY

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.610
AND GET THE BALL ROLLING
FOR A NEW DISPEN SAYINGS,

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.620
FOR A NEW COUNTRY, CALL
IT THE RAINBOW NATION.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.960
THAT WOULD BE -- AND THEN PEOPLE
UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF PEACE

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.900
AND HARMONY OVER THE
CONTINUED VIOLENCE

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.160
THAT THEY'D BEEN EXPERIENCING
FOR SO MANY DECADES.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:28.980
AND I THINK IT WAS JUST
HIS WAY OF TRYING TO --

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:34.780
TO AMEND AND TO -- AND
TO ELIMINATE HIS ENEMIES.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.410
YOU KNOW? BECAUSE ONE OF
THE THINGS YOU SAID WAS

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.490
THAT IN ORDER TO DEFEAT
YOUR ENEMY, YOU MUST WORK

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.860
WITH YOUR UH ENEMY, BECAUSE
THEN HE BECOMES YOUR PARTNER.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:48.700
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: AND HE HAD YOU
LEARN AFTERRY KAN -- AFRIKKAN.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.690
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I DIDN'T LEARN IT.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:30:02.470
I DID LEARN A LITTLE BIT PCHLT
THERE ARE MANY AFRIKKAN SPEAKING

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.770
PEOPLE HERE?

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:07.110
NO. I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,
HE WOULD BE IN THE LOUNGE,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:10.530
HE WOULD READ THE
NEWSPAPERS BACK-TO-BACK.

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.450
HE WAS VERY FLUENT IN AFRIKKANS.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:14.750
READING AND WRITING.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:21.900
SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN IN JAIL,
THE WARDEN THAT WAS LOOKING

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.040
AFTER THE CELL HAD TO BE
CHANGED EVERY THREE MONTHS

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:31.120
BECAUSE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT
NELSON MANDELA WOULD BE ABLE

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.320
TO REALLY CONNECT
WITH ANY HUMAN BEING,

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.690
INCLUDING THE GUARDS, RIGHT?

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:36.990
INCLUDING THE GUARDS.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:41.270
SO HOW HE DID IT IS THAT THE
GUARDS WOULD RECEIVE LETTERS

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:46.310
FROM THE LOVED ONES, BUT THEY
WERE NOT AS EDUCATED AS HE WAS

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:48.360
IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.600
SO HE WOULD TRANSLATE THE
LETTERS FOR THE WARDEN

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.790
THAT WERE LOOKING AFTER HIM.

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:56.640
AND THEN HE WAS VERY
HAPPY HE UNDERSTANDS

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.420
AND NOW HE WOULD CONVINCE THEM

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:04.080
TO SMUGGLE HIM AN EXTRA FEW
SLICES OF BREAD, AN EXTRA COUPLE

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.550
OF ORANGES AND FRUITS,
AN EXTRA BLANKET,

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.570
SOME EXTRA JACKETS,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.970
ONCE THE AUTHORITIES
FOUND THIS OUT,

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:15.510
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE COMPLETELY,
COMPLETELY, YOU KNOW, ANGRY.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:16.810
SO THEY CHANGED THE GUARD.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.870
AND EVEN THOUGH THEY'D
CHANGE THE GUARD,

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.420
THE SAME THING WOULD
HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.110
SO EVEN IN PRISON, THERE WAS
NO ONE GUARD THAT COULD LOOK

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.430
AFTER NELSON MANDELA
WITHOUT HIM ENDING

00:31:28.430 --> 00:31:32.220
UP BECOMING A FRIEND
OF NELSON MANDELA.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.530
THAT IS THE SPIRIT AND
THE POWER OF MANDIBA.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:39.070
I BELIEVE HE HAD A GIFT FROM
GOD THAT HE COULD CONNECT

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.040
WITH HIS COMPASSION TO ANYBODY,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.130
WHETHER THAT PERSON
SPOKE ENGLISH OR NOT.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.690
BUT HE WOULD BE ABLE
TO CONNECT WITH YOU.

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:50.570
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: DO YOU
THINK HE REALIZED?

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.480
HE KNEW HE HAD THIS GIFT?

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.160
OR HE HAD THIS RESPONSIBILITY?

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.500
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: I THINK HE KNEW
HE HAD THIS RESPONSIBILITY.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.310
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE GIFT.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:05.470
BUT I THINK HE DEFINITELY KNEW
THAT HE HAD THIS RESPONSIBILITY.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:09.420
AND I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE HE
TAUGHT ME -- HE TOLD ME, DABA,

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.630
YOU'RE A MANDELA,
THEREFORE PEOPLE WILL LOOK

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.290
AT YOU AS A LEADER.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:20.770
AND AS A LEADER, YOU MUST
GET THE BEST MARKS IN CLASS.

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.200
I WAS LIKE, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:24.910
YOU KNOW? I WANTED
TO BE A NORMAL KID.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:27.660
AND PLAY AND HAVE FUN
AND DO A NORMAL KID.

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.720
I DON'T HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF HAVING TO STUDY ALL --

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.740
EVERY DAY SO THAT I
CAN HAVE THE BEST MARKS

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.860
IN CLASS SO I CAN BE A LEADER?

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.600
YOU KNOW? FOR ME, I DON'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND IT AT THE TIME.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.090
ONLY MUCH LATER THAT I
COME TO GRIPS WITH IT.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:46.740
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: AND SO YOU'VE BEEN
ABLE TO, WITH YOUR FOUNDATION

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.240
AND TO REALLY SEE
HOW YOU CAN KEEP IT.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.540
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES, YES.

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.170
OBVIOUSLY, INSPIRED
ME INDIRECTLY

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:54.470
TO START THIS FOUNDATION.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.620
BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE
MAIN REASONS I STARTED THIS

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:00.380
FOUNDATION IS I WAS LUCKY TO
BE ABLE TO TRAVEL, YOU KNOW,

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.930
WITH MY GRANDFATHER
AND WITHOUT HIM.

00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:06.970
AND I REMEMBER MY
FIRST TRIP HERE IN --

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.500
IN AMERICA, WE WENT TO
DISNEY WORLD, OF COURSE.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.850
I WAS 18 YEARS OLD
WITH MY YOUNGER

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:15.610
AND OLDER BROTHERS AND COUSINS.

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.770
AND WE WERE TRYING TO GET
ON THE ROLLER COASTER.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:22.940
YOU GET IN THE LINE, YOU GET IN
FRONT OF THE QUEUE, EVENTUALLY.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.600
AND THE GENTLEMAN
HI, HOW ARE YOU?

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.900
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.230
I'M FROM SOUTH AFRICA.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.130
HE SAYS TO ME, WELL, HOW
BIG DO THE LIONS GET.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:34.420
I LOOKED AT MY COUSIN
AND SAID, SORRY, SIR,

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:37.980
I DON'T WORK AT THE ZOO.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:44.080
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW
BIG LIONS GET.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.600
THEN WE TRAVEL TO LONDON
AND SOMEBODY SAYS, HEY, WOW,

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.060
YOU KNOW, HI, HOW ARE YOU?

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.460
AFRICA, I HEARD IT'S DANGEROUS.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.270
I NEED SECURITY TO
COME TO SOUTH AFRICA.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:55.570
IT'S QUITE SAFE.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:58.270
MY GRANDFATHER WAS PRESIDENT,
I DON'T EVEN HAVE SECURITY.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:00.420
I THINK YOU'LL BE JUST FINE.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.850
YOU'LL BE JUST FINE.

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:03.990
THEN WE TRAVEL TO NEW YORK.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.560
AND ANOTHER PERSON CAME
IN THE SAME FASHION.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.300
AND THEN I REALIZED, OH, MAN,
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE.

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.550
PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTINENT
HAVE A VERY SKEWED PERCEPTION

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.000
OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
ON OUR CONTINENT.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.780
AND THIS IS MAINLY
PERPETUATED BY MAIN STREAM MEDIA

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.080
THAT AFRICA IS A PLACE OF WAR,
POVERTY, DISEASE, AND DICTATORS.

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.920
NOW, WE'RE NOT HERE TO DENY
THESE THINGS EXIST, HOWEVER,

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.700
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUALITY
THINGS THAT ARE GOOD IN AFRICA

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.180
THAN WHAT YOU SEE ON YOUR TV.

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.760
AND SO WE DECIDED
TO START SOMETHING.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.060
WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.370
WE DECIDED TO START SOMETHING.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:40.820
SO WHEN I GOT BACK HOME,

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.840
ME AND MY COUSIN CALLED
OUR COLLEAGUES, RIGHT?

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:46.030
AND I SAID, GUYS,
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:47.330
WITH THE IMAGE OF AFRICA.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.630
WE NEED TO CHANGE IT.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.940
AND WHAT I REALIZED THAT DAY IS
I WAS NOT SPECIAL BECAUSE MOST

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.810
OF THE PEOPLE I CALLED TO THE
MEETING FELT THE VERY SAME WAY.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:02.040
SO IT WASN'T I AM IN THE HEART
OF AFRICAN YOUTH IN GENERAL,

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.740
THEY FEEL THE SAME WAY I DO.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.190
THEY'VE SEEN IT AND
EXPERIENCED IT.

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:09.180
SO THAT DAY WE DECIDED
TO BE A FOUNDATION,

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.730
A NON-PROFITABLE
ORGANIZATION THAT FOCUSES

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.050
ON YOUTH EMPOWERMENT BECAUSE
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE TASK

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.700
AT HAND IS NOT GOING TO
BE ACHIEVED OVERNIGHT.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:21.130
IT'S GOING TO TAKE TWO OR THREE
GENERATIONS FOR US TO BE ABLE

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:24.880
TO ACHIEVE THE BREAKING DOWN OF
THE MISCONCEPTION OF A AFRICA

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.920
SO THEY CAN SEE IT AS A PLACE
WHERE THEY CAN GO ON HOLIDAY,

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.890
THEY CAN SEE IT AS A PLACE
WHERE THEY CAN DO BUSINESS.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:35.210
THIS IS A PLACE -- YOU LOOK AT
THE TOP TEN GROWING ECONOMIES

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:38.310
IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,
SEVEN OF THOSE ARE COMING

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.970
FROM THE CONTINENT OF AFRICA.

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:43.550
RIGHT? MANY PEOPLE
DON'T KNOW THAT.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:46.100
YOU WANT REAL GROWTH
AND INVESTMENT

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.070
AND RETURN ON YOUR CAPITAL.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:49.930
COME TO AFRICA.

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.680
YOU WANT TO HAVE FUN AND
EXPERIENCE THE MOST TROPICAL

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.000
AND AMAZING ISLANDS,
COME TO AFRICA.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.080
YOU WANT THE FRESHEST,
CLEANEST GARMENT DRAPING

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:07.960
DOWN YOUR BODY, COME TO AFRICA.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.260
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.560
I MEAN, WHEN YOU LOOK AT
ALL OF THE FASHION HOUSES,

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.310
WHETHER IT BE LOUIS VUITTON,
HUGO BOSS, HI END, LOW END,

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:18.620
THEY'RE ALL SEEKING
INSPIRATION FROM AFRICA.

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:23.960
NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT
THE MUSIC AND DANCING.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.570
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: I WAS GOING TO ASK.

00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:27.930
AND ART.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:32.850
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: SO WE BASICALLY
FOCUS ON YOUNG PEOPLE

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.700
AT THE HIGH SCHOOL
LEVEL, FOCUS ON EDUCATION,

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.720
FOR DEVELOPMENT, AND TECHNOLOGY.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:44.030
SO WE ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING
A THREE-MONTH CODING PROGRAM

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:47.860
FOR 40 KIDS IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND 20 UNEMPLOYED YOUTH.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:53.440
AND IN SOUTH AFRICA, ONE OF OUR
CHALLENGES IS WE HAVE 60% TO 70%

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.150
OF OUR YOUTH ARE
UNEMPLOYED AND OVER 60%

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:00.860
OF THEM ARE UNEMPLOYABLE
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE SKILLS.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.920
TO ACTUALLY GET A JOB.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.790
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WHAT ABOUT
THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS?

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.860
I KNOW THERE WAS -- THERE
WERE DIVISIONS AND THINGS.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:12.350
SO, NOW, HOW ARE YOUR
EDUCATION SYSTEMS?

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:16.540
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YOU KNOW, THE
STORY OF SOUTH AFRICA IS

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.400
THAT WE HAVE THE
PRIVATE AND THE PUBLIC.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.650
THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN SOUTH
AFRICA ARE SOME OF THE BEST

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:27.230
IN THE WORLD, HAVE THE BEST
FACILITIES IN THE WORLD.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:30.640
AND CAN REALLY COMPARE
TO ANY IN THE WORLD.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:35.870
BUT THE PUBLIC NOT AS GOOD -- WE
HAD A FEW GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:40.040
BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM
ARE LACKING IN MANY WAYS.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.740
YOU KNOW? WHETHER
IT'S THE ATTITUDE

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.470
OF THE TEACHERS, YOU KNOW?

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:45.770
THE FACILITIES.

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:51.320
BUT SHEER DOWN THE MANAGEMENT OF
RESOURCES OR LACK OF RESOURCES

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.020
WHEN IT COMES TO
THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:58.090
I MEAN, I KNOW A SCHOOL WHICH
IS NOT TOO FAR FROM OUR VILLAGE,

00:37:58.090 --> 00:37:59.980
THEY ARE STUDYING IN A --

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:05.280
YOU KNOW, THE SHIPMENT
CONTAINERS, THAT IS A SCHOOL.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.800
THE SHIPMENT CONTAINER
-- A WHOLE SCHOOL.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.080
LOOKING AFTER ABOUT
200 CHILDREN.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.280
AND IT'S A RAGGEDY,
RAGGEDY, TERRIBLE SHAPE.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:18.160
RECENTLY BEFORE I CAME HERE,
THE TEACHER WHO TOLD ME

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.160
THAT IT HAS HOLES ON THE FLOOR
AND THERE'S BEEN INCIDENTS

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.160
WHERE SNAKES CREEP UP THROUGH --

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:27.420
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE
A 5-YEAR-OLD, 6-YEAR-OLD?

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.770
THAT'S THE MOST TRAUMATIC THING.

00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:30.890
THAT'S THE MOST TRAUMATIC THING.

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:34.650
SO HOW CAN YOU -- THESE
KIDS ARE NOT LOOKING FORWARD

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.950
TO GOING TO SCHOOL.

00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:37.250
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:38.550
THEY'RE NOT LOOKING
FORWARD TO GOING TO SCHOOL.

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.040
THEY DON'T KNOW THE FACT THAT
THEY CAN'T EVEN AFFORD FOOD,

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.420
HOW CAN YOU LEARN
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.070
SO THE WEIRD THING
IS THAT SOUTH AFRICA,

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:53.950
OUR COUNTRY IN PARTICULAR, HAS
BOTH ASPECTS OF A DEVELOPING

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:56.590
AND A DEVELOPED COUNTRY,
WE HAVE THE BEST

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.170
AND THE WORST IN OUR COUNTRY.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:00.850
THE BEST AND THE WORST.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:05.110
YOU'LL SAY, OH, MY GOD,
I'M BACK IN THE STONE AGES.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.410
LOOKS LIKE HELL.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.120
AND THEN THERE ARE PARTS
WHERE YOU SAY, OH, MY GOD,

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:10.410
LOOK AT THIS, I MUST
BE IN MONACO!

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:11.710
THIS IS AMAZING.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.890
THAT IS SOUTH AFRICA TODAY.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:18.280
SO IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW DO
WE CLOSE THE GAP, YOU KNOW?

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.590
THAT IS OUR BIGGEST
CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.890
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: THIS JULY,

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:26.390
YOUR GRANDFATHER WOULD
HAVE TURNED 100 YEARS OLD.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.820
AND ARE THERE PLANS
FOR A CENTENNIAL?

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.120
BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO --

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.380
BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP FOR
QUESTIONS, I WANTED TO --

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.680
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: AWESOME PLANS.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.980
THE NELSON MANDELA FOUNDATION,

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.160
THEY HAVE THE ANNUAL
LECTURE THAT'S BEEN GIVEN

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.100
BY BARACK OBAMA AND
MICHELLE OBAMA OF THIS YEAR,

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:46.290
THAT WILL BE THE 17th OF JULY.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:51.360
UNFORTUNATELY, WE WERE
GOING TO HAVE A GALA DINNER.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.700
IT HAD TO BE POSTPONED SO
WE'VE POSTPONED IT TO THE 1st

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.180
OF DECEMBER, IT'S
WORLD AIDS DAY.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:02.740
HIV-AIDS IS SOMETHING THAT'S
PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.500
IN MY LIFE.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.070
I LOST BOTH OF MY
PARENTS TO HIV/AIDS.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:09.350
AND SINCE THEN, HAVE BECOME ONE

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.630
OF THE LONGEST SERVING
AMBASSADORS OF U.N.-AIDS.

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:19.940
HAVING TRAVELLED TO, YOU KNOW,
BRAZIL, GENEVA, SWITZERLAND,

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:22.030
TALKING ABOUT THIS EPIDEMIC.

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:24.300
RECENTLY, I WAS IN
RUSSIA SPEAK EGG

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.860
AT THE EAST EUROPEAN
AIDS CONFERENCE.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:39.190
SO, YEAH. I MEAN, WE ARE BY
MANY WAYS THE AVERAGE FAMILIES.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:47.180
WE'RE AFFECTED BY SOMETHING THAT
AFFECTS ALL OF SOUTH AFRICANS,

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:52.310
WE HAVE MANDELA, THIS
PATRIARCH, OUR LEADER,

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:58.280
WE'RE VERY MUCH THE SAME AS
THOSE AVERAGE FAMILIES TODAY.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:03.530
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: YOUR GRANDFATHER
LEFT A LEGACY FELT GLOBALLY.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.710
I KNOW YOU CARRIED ON.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:10.540
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LIFE
LESSONS YOU THINK HE TAUGHT YOU

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:13.480
AND THAT WE CAN ALL
LOOK FORWARD TO?

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.710
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: THE ONE LESSON
WE TAUGHT ME WAS, NDABA,

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:23.010
YOU MUST ALWAYS BE HUMBLE,
HUMILITY IS VERY IMPORTANT,

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:24.310
ESPECIALLY FOR A LEADER.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:27.500
YOU HAVE TO BE -- YOU
HAVE TO BE ACCESSIBLE.

00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:31.050
AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE
PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE SERVING.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:34.420
BECAUSE AS A LEADER,
YOU ARE A SERVANT.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.830
YOU'RE NOT THERE TO
BOAST, TO SHOW HOW MUCH,

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:41.330
WHAT A GREAT CAR YOU HAVE
OR HOW MANY THINGS YOU HAVE.

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.630
THAT'S NOT A LEADER.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:46.750
LEADERS ARE NOT THERE TO SHOW
I'M NUMBER ONE, LOOK AT ME.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:50.550
I'M THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A VOICE,

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:52.770
WHO CAN'T STAND UP
FOR THEMSELVES,

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.750
THAT'S THE PEOPLE
I'M THERE TO SERVE.

00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:57.250
SO YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
WHO YOUR CONSTITUENCY IS.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.240
YOU NEED TO HAVE A CONSTITUENCY.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.620
YOU MUST BE HUMBLE AND
HE SAID TO ME, NDABA,

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:06.220
YOU MUST NEVER DRIVE A JAGUAR,

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.340
BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE KNOW
HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.920
AND THEN I THOUGHT TO
MYSELF, BUT, GRAD DAD,

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.740
YOU USED TO DRIVE
A MERCEDES BENZ.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.180
OKAY, OKAY.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.870
BUT I'LL TAKE IT ON THE CHIN.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:19.420
I'LL TAKE IT ON THE CHIN.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:23.470
BUT, OF COURSE, I THINK HE WAS
VERY SERIOUS AT THE SAME TIME.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:25.790
YOU KNOW? DISCIPLINE
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:30.800
AND HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST
DISCIPLINED PERSONS I'VE

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.230
EVER MET.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:34.670
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY AS
HE WAS GETTING OLDER,

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.310
HE WOULD GET SICK
FROM TIME TO TIME.

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:40.000
AND THE DOCTOR WOULD SAY,
YOU MUST EAT MORE TOMATOES

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.230
AND YOU'D TELMA MA
KOLI, EVERY MORNING,

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.640
I WANT YOU TO SLICE
UP TWO TOMATOES.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.400
THIN A COUPLE OF MONTHS
LATER, HE WOULD SAY, NO,

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.700
YOU MUST EAT LESS TOMATOES.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.610
AND THEN HE WOULD SAY, MAKE
SURE THERE ARE NO MORE TOMATOES.

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:54.830
NOW I WANT APPLES.

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:56.290
HE WOULD DO IT RELIGIOUSLY
EVERY DAY.

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:59.480
YOU KNOW? DISCIPLINE.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.460
INTEGRITY, VERY IMPORTANT.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.370
IF YOU TELL YOUR FRIEND, HEY,
LET'S MEET AT THE LIBRARY

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:10.080
AT 2:00, BE THERE
AT 2:00.OFF KNOW?

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.470
HE'D SAY, LISTEN,
I'M GOING TO SEND YOU

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:15.650
THAT E-MAIL LATER TONIGHT,
SEND THAT E-MAIL LATER TONIGHT.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:19.170
THAT'S INTEGRITY ON B A
VERY BASIC LEVEL, YOU KNOW?

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.470
BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:21.770
IT GOES A LONG WAY.

00:43:21.770 --> 00:43:25.060
BUT MANDIBA?

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.450
WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT MANDIBA?

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:33.170
HE TAUGHT ME THAW LOVE
IS STRONGER THAN HATE.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:42.770
BECAUSE LOVE COMES
MUCH MORE NATURAL

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.250
TO THE HUMAN CONDITION
THAN HATE.

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.090
IF A PERSON CAN BE
TAUGHT TO HATE,

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.850
THEY CAN BE TAUGHT TO LOVE.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:50.070
THAT'S OUR THEME FOR
CELEBRATING MANDELA

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:53.270
FOR 100 YEARS, LOVE AND UNITY.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:55.980
BECAUSE THROUGH LOVE AND
UNITY, THERE'S NOTHING

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.280
THAT WE CANNOT ACHIEVE.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.580
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:15.530
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A
CHANCE TO MAKE HIM PROUD.

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:18.380
AND I THINK HE CONTINUES
TO BE PROUD.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.390
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:24.570
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: SO WE HAVE TIME FOR
A FEW QUESTIONS, I UNDERSTAND.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:29.650
AND THERE IS A MICROPHONE.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:33.270
I HOPE. AND HERE
ARE SOME PEOPLE.

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:37.660
AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO AND OF
COURSE THE BOOK IS AVAILABLE,

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.760
AND THERE'S A YOUNG
MAN RIGHT HERE --

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.060
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: RIGHT HERE.

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.800
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: RIGHT IN FRONT.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.380
LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT THE AGE

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.090
WHEN YOU WERE TRYING
TO SNEAK OUT.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.650
SURE, INTRODUCE YOURSELF.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:44:59.780

&gt;&gt; I'M A CINEMA, TELEVISION,
AND EMERGING MEDIA STUDIES MAJOR

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.320
AND A JOURNALISM MINOR.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.660
I'M FROM COLUMBIA, MARYLAND
SO I GUESS I'M COMMUTING.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.650
I'M A JUNIOR FELLOW AT
THE LIBRARY OF COMMERCE.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.280
I WORK IN THE PHOTOS
AND PRINTS COLLECTION.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:26.040
YEAH, I'M AN INTERN HERE.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:31.560
SORRY. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS
YOU SAY THAT YOU SEE THE BEST

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.580
AND THE WORST, SOCIOECONOMICALLY
AND ON THE EDUCATIONAL LEVEL

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:39.300
OF THE PUBLIC IN AFRICA,
HOW COULD THAT TRANSLATE

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.890
TO HELPING THE BLACK
COMMUNITY IN AMERICA?

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:47.170
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: WELL, WHAT THAT
SAYS IS LIKE WHAT I SAID NOW,

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:51.290
THROUGH LOVE AND
UNITY, YOU KNOW,

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:55.080
MANDIBA SAID YOU CAN JUDGE
THE SOCIETY THERE'S NO KEENER

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.650
REVELATION TO A SOCIETY'S SOUL

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:02.820
THAN IN THE WAY THEY TREAT
THEIR CHILDREN, RIGHT?

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:09.850
SO WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:15.740
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE
HAVE MENTORSHIP, GOOD MENTORS.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:20.580
THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE BEST
SCHOOLS, BUT WE CAN TEACH ONE

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:23.910
OF US SITTING IN THIS
ROOM MENTOR A YOUNG CHILD

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:28.180
FOR ONE HOUR OR TWO
HOURS A WEEK.

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.480
THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY.

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.440
IF YOU CAN SIT WITH
THEM FOR ONE HOUR A WEEK

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.970
ON A SATURDAY, RIGHT?

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:37.660
AND GO THROUGH HIS
HOMEWORK AND ASK QUESTIONS

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.900
ABOUT WHAT HE EXPERIENCED
IN THAT WEEK

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:43.280
AND WHAT HIS CHALLENGES
ARE, THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:48.160
THAT IT WILL HAVE IF YOU DO
THAT FOR FIVE YEARS, RIGHT?

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.460
WE CANNOT -- THESE DAYS,

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:53.170
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE
ARE NO LONGER YOUR LAWYERS

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.450
OR YOUR POLICEMEN, RIGHT?

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.500
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL
PEOPLE TODAY ARE POP STARS.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.470
RIGHT? YOUR MUSICIANS,
YOUR ACTORS,

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.980
WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY
COGNIZANT

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.380
OF THE EFFECT THEY HAVE ON
A YOUNG KID'S MIND, RIGHT?

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:10.790
BECAUSE THEY ENGAGE FROM TIME
TO TIME IN NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.000
AND SOME OF THEM WILL SAY, WELL,
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A MENTOR.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.050
I DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE A MENTOR.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.880
DOESN'T MATTER IF
YOU CHOSE IT OR NOT.

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.200
YOU ARE A PERSON IN
AN INFLUENTIAL PERSON,

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.960
SO ACKNOWLEDGE AND EMBRACE
THAT POSITION THAT YOU'RE IN.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:31.700
RIGHT? SO IF WE CAN TAKE TIME TO
SPEND TIME WITH THE YOUNG PERSON

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.470
AND TAKE SOME OF THE
LESSONS OF NELSON MANDELA,

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:39.370
DON'T YOU THINK THIS WORLD
WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE FIVE

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:48.670
TO TEN YEARS FROM NOW?

I'M EMILY.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:56.590
I'M CURIOUS OF THE HISTORY
THAT YOU LIVED THROUGH

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.660
AND YOUR GRANDFATHER
LIVED THROUGH,

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:02.150
HAS OFFERED ANY PERSPECTIVE
ON TO THE WAY

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.760
THAT OUR NATION IS HEADED AND
DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR FOLKS

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:08.430
WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE
FUTURE OF HUMANITY BASED ON SOME

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:10.490
OF THE POLITICS THAT WE ARE
LIVING THROUGH RIGHT NOW

00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:13.390
AND THE DIRECTION THAT WE'RE
HEADING IN AS A NATION?

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:14.690
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YES, YOU
KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.450
ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION ISSUE

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:18.750
WHICH I SEE IS VERY
BIG RIGHT NOW,

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:22.350
AND IT'S VERY SIMILAR
TO OUR COUNTRY.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:24.800
WE WENT THROUGH A SIMILAR
THING, BUT IN OUR COUNTRY,

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.630
WE ACTUALLY HAD ATTACKS,
THE PHOBIA OF FEAR OF PEOPLE

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:34.160
FROM OUTSIDE OF YOUR COUNTRY,
FOREIGNERS, PRETTY MUCH.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.460
FEAR OF FOREIGNERS.

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.810
AND IT WAS SO BAD THAT SOUTH
AFRICANS WERE PHYSICALLY

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:42.870
ATTACKING ETHIOPIANS,
ZIMBABWEANS, NIGERIANS,

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:48.150
ETC. THEY'RE STEALING OUR JOBS,
MESSING UP OUR ECONOMY, ETC.,

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:51.830
ETC. IT'S A DAMN SHAME,
IT'S A DAMN SHAME.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:55.750
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE VERY
SAME PEOPLE THAT ASSISTED YOU

00:48:55.750 --> 00:49:00.600
IN LIBERATING YOUR COUNTRY.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:11.690
THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE
WHO BUILT THE FUNDAMENTALS

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:15.240
AND THE BUILDING BLOCKS
OF AMERICAN SOCIETY.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.540

AND EXPERIENCING
NEW OPPORTUNITIES

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.500
AND THE TICK NOLING BOOM AND
ALL OF THESE AMAZING NEW THINGS,

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:27.620
HEY, YOU BUILT OUR COUNTRY,
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO LEAVE

BECAUSE WE WANT TO ENJOY IT
BY OURSELVES, YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:33.830
WE NEED TO REMIND EACH
OTHER WHERE WE COME FROM.

HOW GREAT IS THIS COUNTRY BUILT.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.900
IT'S NOT BUILT BY AMERICANS.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.150

AROUND THE WORLD.

FROM THE ELECTIONS UNLESS

SOME SUGGESTIONS OR SOME SUPPORT
AND IF YOU COULD ALSO TOUCH

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.580
ON PAN AFRICANISM ON THIS ONE?

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:22.880
THANK YOU.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.180
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.480
THANK YOU.

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:30.810
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T REALLY
JUDGE ON THAT ISSUE.

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:34.800
BECAUSE IT ALSO DEPENDS ON
THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY.

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:36.850
YOU KNOW? IT'S -- IF
THE COUNTRY IS POOR

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:40.670
AND THEY DON'T HAVE RESOURCES
TO ALLOW THE CITIZENS TO VOTE

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.420
BY REMOTE CONTROL,
HOW CAN I JUDGE?

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:49.070
YOU KNOW? LIKELY, SOUTH AFRICA
HAS NO RESOURCES FOR PEOPLE

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:52.200
TO VOTE AT THEIR
EMBASSIES AROUND THE WORLD,

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.090
BUT JUST BECAUSE SOUTH AFRICA
CAN DO IT DOESN'T MEAN EVERY

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:59.500
NATION SHOULD DO IT OR
EVERY NATION CAN DO IT.

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:02.150
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME
TO JUDGE IN THAT SITUATION.

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:05.350
YES, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S
UNFORTUNATE, YOU KNOW.

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:06.710
YOU WANT AS MUCH CITIZENS

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:10.350
TO OBVIOUSLY BE INCLUDED
IN THE VOTING.

00:54:10.350 --> 00:54:13.220
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT.

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.610
YOU KNOW? IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:17.780
YOU CAN ONLY B HAVE THE
RESOURCES TO CARRY THE EMBASSIES

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.590
AND GET THOSE VOTES
BACK TO THE COUNTRIES.

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.440
YOU KNOW? WHO CAN
JUDGE THEM FOR THAT?

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.670
WE CAN'T REALLY JUDGE THEM.

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:28.340
SO, IF THE ONLY WAY TO TELL
PEOPLE TO COME HOME AND VOTE,

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.260
HOW CAN WE -- WE CAN'T
JUDGE THEM FOR THAT.

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.560
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:35.800
BUT, AS FAR AS PAN
AFRICANISM IS CONCERNED,

00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.130
I BELIEVE THAT LIBERATION

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:40.450
OF SOUTH AFRICA COULD
NOT HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:42.410
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF
OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:45.160
ACROSS THE CONTINENTS
AS YOU KNOW.

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.920
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE ZIMBABWE
AND SWATSLAND ALL THE WAY

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:58.870
UP TO NIGERIA, ETHIOPIA, YOU
NAME IT, MALI, ETC. SO, FOR ME,

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:07.160
WE NEED SOMEHOW, SOME WAY,
THROUGH THE INDEPENDENT JOURNEY

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:09.430
AND THE POST COLONIAL AREA,

00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:12.970
WE LOST THAT PAN
AFRICANISM THAT WE ONCE HAD.

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:16.000
WE LOST THE UNITY AND
SOLIDARITY THAT WE ONCE HAD.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.170
IT NEEDS TO BE REUNITED.

00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:22.260
AND IN OUR CONTINENT, WE'RE
TRADING MORE WITH THE WEST

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.270
AND THE EAST THAN WE ARE
TRADING WITH EACH OTHER,

00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:27.020
WHICH HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:31.240
WE NEED TO REIGNITE THAT
BECAUSE IF WE DO NOT UNITE,

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:38.380
AND REIGNITE THE SPIRIT OF
SOLIDARITY AMONGST AFRICANS

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.000
ON THE CONTINENT
FIRST AND FOREMOST,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.980
WE SHALL NEVER REALIZE
OUR ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:47.180
WE SHALL NEVER REALIZE OUR
DREAM TO CREATE A PROSPEROUS

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:50.850
AND INDEPENDENT CONTINENT
OF AFRICA.

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:55.530
THAT IS REALLY THE KEY
TO US ACHIEVING OUR GOALS

00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:59.810
AND MAKING SURE OUR
DREAMS COME TO FRUITION.

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:04.630
SO, IN THE SPIRIT OF MEN
WHO WERE TRUE VISIONARIES,

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:05.930
AND IN ONE OF THEIR WORDS,

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:09.540
WE AS AFRICANS DO NOT LOOK
WEST NOR DO WE LOOK EAST,

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:10.850
WE LOOK FORWARD.

00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:12.150
HUH? THANK YOU, BROTHER.

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:13.450
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:15.630
&gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WE HAVE
TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION.

00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:20.850
SO BE WE HAVE A PERSON HERE.

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:31.720
&gt;&gt; GOOD AFTERNOON, MY
NAME IS WAYNE CONNOR.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:37.960
I'M AN EMPLOYEE HERE AT
THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.700
I WORK IN THE OFFICE
OF GENERAL COUNSEL.

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:43.860
MY QUESTION IS FOR --

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:47.870
FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS OBVIOUSLY
BEEN INSPIRED BY A GREAT LEADER

00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:51.420
AND WHO IS CURRENTLY A GREAT
ADVOCATE FOR MANY CAUSES,

00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.170
HOW COULD -- DO YOU HAVE
ANY ADVICE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE

00:56:55.170 --> 00:57:09.150
LIKE MYSELF OR OTHERS
WHO MIGHT BE IN THE ROOM

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:17.100
ON HOW WE CAN BETTER,
YOU KNOW, BECOME A VOICE

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:21.100
AND BECOME AN INFLUENCER
OF CHANGE

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:25.490
WITHIN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES
AND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TOOLS

00:57:25.490 --> 00:57:32.820
THAT WE CAN SEEK OUT IN ORDER TO
BE ABLE TO BE BETTER AT THAT IN?

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.710
&gt;&gt; MANDELA: YOU KNOW, YOU
HAVE TO CHOOSE A CAUSE

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:41.010
THAT YOU CARE ABOUT, THAT
YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT.

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:43.380
IT'S LIKE BUSINESS.

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:45.900
WHERE YOU BECOME
AN ENTREPRENEUR.

00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:48.710
YOU CANNOT BE A SUCCESSFUL
ENTREPRENEUR

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:52.150
IF YOU'RE NOT PASSIONATE
ABOUT THAT BUSINESS.

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.130
BECAUSE ALONG THE WAY, YOU
WILL COME ACROSS HURDLES,

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:58.080
PEOPLE WHO DON'T BELIEVE YOU,

00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.930
AND PEOPLE WHO THINK
YOU CAN'T DO IT.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:06.100
RIGHT? SO YOU NEED
TO HAVE A CAUSE

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.500
THAT YOU'RE VERY
PASSIONATE ABOUT.

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.740
THAT WILL MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DON'T GIVE UP.

00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:17.500
BECAUSE PEOPLE GIVE UP
SOMETIMES TOO QUICKLY.

00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.820
YOU KNOW? FOR VARIOUS
AMOUNTS OF REASONS.

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:27.420
NOW, YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU SURROUND YOURSELF BY PEOPLE

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:32.600
WHO CARE FOR YOU
AND BELIEVE IN YOU.

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.900
YOU NEED TO HAVE A MENTOR.

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:38.620
EVERYBODY NEEDS A MENTOR,
NO MATTER HOW OLD YOU ARE,

00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:43.940
NO MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL YOU
ARE, EVERYBODY NEEDS A MENTOR.

00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:49.660
AND, YOU NEED TO THEN
UNDERSTAND THE PEOPLE OF A CAUSE

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:57.810
THAT YOU'RE CHAMPIONING,
WHAT THEIR CHALLENGES ARE.

00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:04.760
YOU CANNOT CHAMPION A CAUSE
IF YOU HAVE NOT TALKED

00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.210
TO THE PEOPLE THAT
IT AFFECTS THE MOST.

00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:09.740
OTHERWISE, YOU ARE JUST
SHOOTING IN THE HEAD, RIGHT?

00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:11.180
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:13.420
THAT CONSTITUENCY
THAT YOU'RE SERVING.

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.200
AND MAKE SURE THE CONCERN
YOURSELF WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.160
AND OFTEN THAT SUPPORTS AT HOME.

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:21.140
THAT SUPPORT STARTS WITHIN
YOUR OWN IMMEDIATE NETWORK.

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:26.740
AND IF YOU CAN'T GET SUPPORT
FROM YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.890
AND YOUR FRIENDS AND YOUR
OWN IMMEDIATE NETWORK, THEN,

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:33.830
MY FRIEND, I THINK YOU
NEED TO CHANGE YOUR COURSE.

00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:37.880
BECAUSE CLEARLY, THEY
DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.820
AND IF THEY DON'T BELIEVE
YOU, THEN I DON'T KNOW

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:43.990
WHERE YOU'RE GOING
TO GET YOUR SUPPORT.

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:57.400
SO FIRST -- THE FIRST
THING IS, DO I REALLY CARE

00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.720
ABOUT THIS THING AM
I TRYING TO PUSH?

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:05.250
AM I IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE
THAT I'M TRYING TO HELP,

01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:14.410
TRYING TO GIVE A VOICE,
TRYING TO GET A LAW PASSED,

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:18.260
OR AN ACTION -- YOU KNOW, DONE,
OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE.

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:21.820
YOU KNOW? YOU NEED TO BE
IMPRESSED WITH THOSE PEOPLE.

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.020
AND HAVE A MENTOR
AND A SUPPORT BASE.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:25.320
BASICALLY.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.410
AND THAT IS REALLY THE
FIRST STEPS OF MAKING SURE

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:31.270
THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO SERVE
THE OBJECTIVE THAT YOU SET

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:36.140
OUT FOR YOURSELF DON'T DO
IT BECAUSE THE GIRL YOU

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.440
LIKE SAID YOU SHOULD DO IT.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:38.740
OR YOU DO IT BECAUSE YOUR
PARENTS FORCE YOU TO DO IT.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.040
DO IT BECAUSE YOU YOURSELF CARE

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.340
AND ARE PASSIONATE
ABOUT THAT CAUSE.

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.640
[ APPLAUSE ]

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.940
&gt;&gt; HAYDEN: WE ALL THANK YOU

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.240
FOR SHARING THE LIFE LESSONS YOU
LEARNED FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.540
AND SHARING THEM WITH ALL OF US.

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.840
AND I AM NEVER RECOMMEND A
BOOK BECAUSE OF WHAT I DO.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.140
BUT IF YOU HAPPEN
TO HAVE A CHANCE

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.440
TO READ WHAT YOU HAVE
LEARNED AND READ THIS BOOK,

01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.740
I THINK YOU WOULD BE IN TOUCH,

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.040
NOT ONLY WITH YOUR
GRANDFATHER, BUT WITH YOU.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.340
