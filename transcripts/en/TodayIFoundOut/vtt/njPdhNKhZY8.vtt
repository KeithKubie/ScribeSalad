00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:30.140
Walter Hunt 
is a 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.580
man who is simultaneously considered to have
possessed one of the finest inventive minds

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.600
in all of American history while also being
an individual almost no one has ever heard.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.620
This is despite the fact that it’s almost
guaranteed that one of his inventions is currently

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.120
lying somewhere in your home, the safety pin.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.180
This was something he sold the patent for
for a few hundred dollars, reportedly as he

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.020
needed the money to pay off a $15 debt.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.920
This was a theme throughout his life- inventing
various items that otherwise should have made

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.199
him extremely wealthy and famous, but which
never did because of his proclivity to sell

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.950
his patents immediately and move on to his
next great invention.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.250
Because we’d be here all day if we discussed
in any level of detail everything Hunt patented

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.530
during his lifetime, instead we’ll give
you a small smattering of examples so you

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.909
can get an idea of how prolific an inventor
he was.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.030
Along with the safety pin and the first commercially
viable lockstitch sewing machine, Hunt invented

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.130
and patented a more efficient oil lamp, an
attachment to boats that allowed them to break

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.990
through ice, various improvements on bullet
and casing designs, a rope making machine,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.850
a machine that made nails, an improved fountain
pen, a portable knife sharpener, an innovative

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.340
saw, a coal heated convection oven, an early
version of the repeating rifle, and, most

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.329
incredibly of all, a device that allowed the
user to walk on the ceiling, dubbed the “antipodean

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.600
apparatus”, which he sold to a circus.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.000
While some of these inventions are antiquated
and seldom used today, others were pretty

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.960
revolutionary, in particular the repeating
rifle, which Hunt dubbed the Volitional Repeating

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960
Rifle.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.860
He sold the patent for that to a businessman,
George Arrowsmith, who then sold it to the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.400
founders of Smith and Wesson, Benjamin Tyler
Henry, Horace Smith, and Daniel B. Wesson.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.500
The design of Hunt’s rifle was studied by
and improved upon by the trio, eventually

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.300
serving as the basis for the Henry Repeating
Rifle, famed for its widespread use in the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.770
American Civil War.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.370
This latter rifle, in turn, was the basis
for the more famous Winchester Repeater, arguably

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.400
one of the most famous guns of all time.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.190
Hunt saw little recognition for his contributions
to the weapon and never received any royalties

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.700
or payment beyond the relatively paltry sum
given for the original patent, which was basically

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.190
the story of Hunt’s life.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.260
Born in 1796 on a small farm in Lewis County,
New York, Hunt’s beginnings were humble

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.360
and his education was surprisingly lacking
for a man who’d later be renowned for his

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.760
keen mechanical mind.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.510
Supposedly educated in a one room schoolhouse,
Hunt, the eldest of thirteen children, left

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.730
formal education in his early teens and settled
into the life of a simple farmer.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.750
However, his curiosity for tinkering soon
found him helping out at a nearby textile

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.690
mill, where many of his family members worked
and where he helped the owner, Willis Hoskins,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.280
and another worker, Ziba Knox, make improvements
to a flax spinning machine used there.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.910
Despite helping the pair improve the machine,
the young Hunt was left off the patent.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.760
However, soon after this, Hunt went and invented
an even better flax spinning machine and patented

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.370
that in 1826.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.520
Hunt then endeavoured to manufacture and sell
this machine to secure a better life for himself

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.620
and his young family.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.570
(He married his childhood sweetheart in his
teens and eventually the pair had four children.)

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.150
Towards this end, Hunt travelled to New York
and attempted to find investors to back production,

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.790
but became increasingly frustrated when nobody
would give him the time of day.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.930
(It’s presumed Hunt’s small town upbringing
and lack of formal education made it difficult

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.220
for him to assure banks and investors he could
be trusted with their money.)

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.570
Running short on funds, Hunt sold the patent
for the machine, using the funds to relocate

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.080
his family to New York, hoping to find his
fortune there with his next invention.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.230
In 1827, Hunt filed for his second patent,
this time for a foot operated gong to be fitted

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.310
in carriages.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.770
Hunt was said to have been inspired to create
this device after witnessing a small girl

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.290
hit by a horse carriage.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.590
This sort of thing was not totally uncommon
at a time when carriages and people shared

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.590
the road.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.690
To help get around the problem, many carriages
had air horns installed.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.019
However, to sound the horn required the driver
to have one hand free to operate it, which

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.320
was occasionally a problem if both hands were
needed to drive the horses.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.450
A foot pedal operated gong neatly solved the
issue.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.470
Again, despite the appeal and necessity of
his invention being immediately obvious, Hunt

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.540
similarly had trouble securing an investor
to fund manufacturing of the device and so

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.150
he sold the patent and moved on to his next
invention.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.580
Why Hunt opted to nearly always choose to
sell his patents outright rather than hold

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.930
onto them or ask for royalties as a part of
the sale agreement isn’t fully clear, though

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.680
given that he was not independently or otherwise
wealthy, one assumes he simply always had

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.140
need of the money to support his family, so
was inclined to take the quick money, rather

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.140
than lesser amounts upfront but better long
term prospects in royalties.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.620
And given how prolific an inventor he was,
it may well be he just always assumed he’d

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.240
be able to come up with something new to keep
money coming in, which, to be fair, is exactly

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.160
what happened throughout his life.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.841
Perhaps the best example of Hunt selling a
world-changing patent occurred in 1849 when

00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:26.320
a draftsman called J.R Chapin began pressuring
Hunt to settle a $15 debt (about $422 today).

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.470
Low on funds, Hunt did what he always did
to settle debts- he sat down and invented

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.750
something- the modern safety pin, reportedly
after just three hours of playing around with

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:35.750
a spool of wire.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.610
While Hunt’s invention wasn’t a totally
new idea, with variations on clothing pins

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.560
going all the way back to the 14th century
BCE, it was a massive improvement on anything

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.200
that came before thanks to the clasp at the
end keeping anyone from getting poked and

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.460
the coiled wire design giving enough spring
to keep the pin locked in place even as the

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.470
person wearing it moved around.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.690
Just as important to the design being extremely
functional, the whole thing was also incredibly

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.650
easy and cheap to manufacture.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.890
As a testament to the design’s simplicity
and functionality, unlike many products that

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:11.120
have evolved over time, in the near two centuries
since Hunt invented the safety pin, the basic

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.400
design hasn’t really changed at all.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.980
As he had done so often before, Hunt sold
the patent for the safety pin for a reported

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.620
$400 (about $11,000 today), with the rights
to it ultimately ending up in the hands of

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.640
W.R. Grace and Company, who would go on to
make many millions of dollars off the product.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.139
Perhaps Hunt’s third most famous invention,
outside of the safety pin and the repeating

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.300
rifle, was one of the first commercially viable
sewing machines that used a then revolutionary

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.850
two threaded lockstich mechanism (see a graphic
of how it works here) still commonly used

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.850
today.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.830
Legend has it Hunt refused to patent his 1833
automated sewing machine invention because

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.010
he didn’t want to put seamstresses out of
work, so didn’t push the invention with

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.800
various companies as he didn’t want to see
it made.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.010
However, this commonly touted notion seems
questionable as, while he didn’t patent

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.860
the idea, he did sell the rights to make the
machine to the aforementioned George Arrowsmith.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.700
Arrowsmith then attempted to manufacture the
sewing machine, but had difficult raising

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:07.260
the needed capital from investors owing to
something of an overabundance of seamstresses

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.770
working on the cheap at the time.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.780
Thus, he gave up on the project, choosing,
like Hunt before him, to not even bother patenting

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.780
it.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.260
It would be over a decade after this before
someone else would come up with another commercially

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.940
viable sewing machine- most notable to the
story at hand, Elias Howe, Jr.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.251
Howe seemingly independently invented and
patented his own lockstitch sewing machine

00:07:26.251 --> 00:07:29.090
that pretty much worked exactly like Hunt’s.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.210
Soon after, various companies, most notably
Singer Sewing Machines, started copying and

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.890
selling Howe’s design, at which point Howe
began suing them.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:40.389
During the course of litigation, Hunt’s
previous invention was brought to light, with

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:44.919
the companies then arguing that Howe’s patent
was invalid because Hunt had long before invented

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:48.330
more or less the same machine using the innovative
lockstich.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.111
And as Hunt hadn’t patented his design,
they felt they were free to copy it.

00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:55.820
It was at this point that Hunt himself got
into the game and decided to see if he could

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.800
retroactively get a patent or otherwise force
said companies to pay him for use of his design.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.730
At the same time, he began work once again
on the sewing machine, coming up with an improved

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.820
design that solved the then common jamming
problem via automatically feeding the cloth

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.110
in at an even rate, and then patenting that
improvement.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.919
True to form, he swiftly sold the rights to
the patent after receiving it.

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:20.320
While the patent office refused to give Hunt
a retroactive patent for the original design,

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.980
they did acknowledge that he invented the
device, but that Howe’s patent was still

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.610
valid owing to Howe having applied for a patent
first.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.620
Nevertheless, in 1858, Singer Sewing Machines,
which is still around today, settled with

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:37.690
Hunt out of court, agreeing to pay him $50,000
(about $1.4 million today) for their copying

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.419
his original design and subsequently making
a fortune off it.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:46.280
And so it was that Hunt finally made a small
fortune off one of his inventions… right?

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.310
Well, no.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:51.850
He died of pneumonia shortly after the agreement
was made and before the $50,000 settlement

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.420
was due to be paid to him.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.540
His family, however, reportedly did benefit
from the settlement.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.530
Funny enough, Hunt’s final resting place
is in the same cemetery as Howe’s, Green-Wood

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.070
Cemetery in Brooklyn.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:05.790
Seemingly fitting given how his life went,
Hunt’s grave marker, while more than a simple

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.140
gravestone as is often reported, is dwarfed
by Howe’s mini-monument.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.740
In the end, while he never made a fortune
off his various inventions that did make other

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.620
people rich, nor was he well-known in life
or death like so many other prolific inventors,

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.160
the New York Tribune did at least publish
an article about Hunt after he passed away,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.160
noting,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.440
For more than 40 years, he has been known
as an experiment in the arts.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.870
Whether in mechanical movements, chemistry,
electricity or metallic compositions, he was

00:09:30.870 --> 00:11:41.290
always at home: and, probably in all, he has
tried more experiments than any other inventor.
