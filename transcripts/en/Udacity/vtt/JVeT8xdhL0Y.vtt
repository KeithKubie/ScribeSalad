00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.900
Okay, you have mastered the art of genetics.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.700
You started with that Udacity course, Tales from the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.070
Genome and you went on to more schooling, you

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.920
got a degree, you became a human genetics researcher.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.590
And now you find yourself in this situation and

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.770
you figure that it's most likely, the allele chromosome

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.140
14, causing the microtia, by affecting the transcription, the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.550
expression of another gene elsewhere. That this allele must

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.850
be in the non-coding region and you also realized

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.000
during you test to figure out, how you could

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.700
develop a drug to treat this, that you'd need

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.160
it to reduce the transcription of gene Y somehow. It

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.270
could directly bind the promoter, or enhancer or silencer

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.070
regions, and affect transcription or it could somehow interact

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.850
with the allele on chromosome 14. We're not sure

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.620
how, based on the information here, to ultimately affect the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.350
overall transcription of gene Y. Now, this is a

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.260
pretty big hypothetical question here because, we normally don't try

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.270
to develop drugs that we can give to pregnant

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.280
women, to affect their development. Usually, genes that are important

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.400
in development, are important for many things, not just

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.230
one thing. And so if we start going around altering

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.970
transcription with drugs and other modalities, we really run

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.160
the risk of causing more harm than help. Either way,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.910
these are important questions that human geneticists get to

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.260
wrestle with, and really make a difference in the clinic.
