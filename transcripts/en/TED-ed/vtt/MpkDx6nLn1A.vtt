00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:12.820
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.240
It's the 1940's.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.609
The world is at war,

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:17.679
and for the first time 
in American history,

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:22.500
women are joining the full-time
work force in droves.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.709
An organic chemist by the name
of Hazel Bishop

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:29.378
is in the midst of designing aircraft fuel
for different oil companies.

00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:32.230
But her true interests lie elsewhere.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.049
The influx of women in the workforce

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:37.259
hasn't changed the superficial
expectations of society,

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:39.719
and working women are expected
to look well-groomed

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.540
no matter their trade.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.369
Bishop is sick of having to take time
to powder her nose

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:48.650
and reapply her lipstick.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.952
Although the FDA has already begun
regulating cosmetics,

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:56.594
various ingredients in lipsticks
can be detrimental to lip health.

00:00:56.594 --> 00:01:00.089
The bromo acid stains used to maintain
color in most lipsticks

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.740
are terribly drying.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.010
Bishop spends her spare time
working with stains and dyes,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.150
mixing oils,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.030
and experimenting with molten wax.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.291
In a moment of vision
and after years of hard work,

00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:18.591
Bishop introduces one of the first
smudge-proof, long-lasting,

00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:20.920
working woman's lipsticks

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.531
that doesn't just tint the lips,

00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:26.191
but also keeps them healthy
and moisturized.

00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:31.091
Marketed as the only kissable lipstick,
Bishop's product takes off

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:35.072
and it isn't long before rival companies
are not just replicating the lipstick

00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:40.361
but creating other, 
more practical cosmetics.

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:44.336
Today, lip cosmetics 
are a billion dollar industry.
