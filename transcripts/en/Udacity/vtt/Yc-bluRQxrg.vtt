00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.670
So, let's take a closer
look at this command.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.130
Print f is a shock command for
printing formatted strings.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.590
If I run it on its own,
it just prints out what I've put here,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.380
which is an HTTP request.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.225
You can Printf anything like this,
it's kind of like echo, but

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.825
it's a little smarter.

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:22.145
You can do things like
turn into a line break.

00:00:22.145 --> 00:00:25.760
Whereas echo would just print
out the \n's by themselves.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.670
And nc stands for
net cat nd it's a handy tool for

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.980
mentally talking to internet services.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.380
Here I'm giving a command that will
connect to the Wikipedia web server but

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.680
nc doesn't know anything about HTTP
in particular instead of Wikipedia.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.640
I can use it to say hello to
the local host SSH server on port 22.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.690
I can't speak SSH personally but
I can see what it says.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.320
Or we could use it to say hello to
an email server such as Gmail's.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.380
We get a little greeting
here from google.com SMTP,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.720
which is the email protocol.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.600
So we'll be using and see your netcat as
a sort of network Swiss army knife to

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.340
connect to various servers.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.360
And later even to act
as a server itself.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.570
Now let's take another look
at this here in the middle.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.340
The vertical bar here is a pipe.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340
It's the standard UNIX way to say.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.910
Take the output of this program and feed
it in as the input of that program So

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:28.050
we're taking the output of printf, which
is a string that forms an HTTP request

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.020
and we're using that as the input to nc.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.890
Nc picks that input and sends it
over the network to the address and

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.220
port that we tell it to and
displays the output.
