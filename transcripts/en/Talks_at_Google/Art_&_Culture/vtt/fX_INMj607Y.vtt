[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.420
SPEAKER: An award-winning
textile and fashion designer,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.590
a painter, a trained
classical dancer,

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.710
a theater artist,
and once a dentist,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.530
our guest today wears
multiple hats, none of which

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.630
are visible today, of course.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.340
His life and experiences have
made him a strong advocate

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.040
for prevention of child
sexual abuse in India,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.830
and also an inspiration to
many in the LGBTQ community,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.670
including us.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.590
His studio was
recently nominated

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.470
for Top 5,000 MSMEs in India,
and the man behind the story

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.470
himself, Dr. Ganesh
Nallari, is sure to talk

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.257
about his journey of awareness,
self-love, and acceptance.

00:00:51.257 --> 00:00:52.590
Please join me in welcoming him.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.892 --> 00:00:59.338
GANESH NALLARI: Hello.

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:01.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.580
GANESH NALLARI: So the question
always is, where do I begin?

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.300
But then-- now when I say
or think of beginning,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.820
I think even the thought of
starting or beginning something

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.030
is already a job half done.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.820
So I always believe that
what is most important

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.380
is to have the thought and idea,
and how you begin will follow.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.455
So here I am to begin and
share many chapters of my life.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.390
I started my career
as a dentist,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.250
and I practiced for
a couple of years

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.370
before I switched onto what
I was more passionate about--

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.910
design.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.590
After completing--
even before I started--

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.240
even before I studied
dentistry, as a child,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.770
I've always been interested
in art, painting, and dance.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.840
I learned Kuchipudi
for almost 11 years,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.139
and then I switched
to Bharatanatyam.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.970
I learned it for
the longest I could.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.320
So I think what
happened in terms

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.340
of why the switch of career--

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.230
after finishing
dentistry-- my DDS--

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.090
I was trying to--

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.120
I was not trying, but I
was preparing for my MDS--

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.580
my master's.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.920
And in that process,
I was also working

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.550
as a dental lecturer in the same
college where I graduated from,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.410
and they offered me a job.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.040
And I actually took up the job
because I had a crush on one

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.960
of my professors.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.564
I thought, oh, I can
see him every day.

00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:52.230
That's a secret.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.800
I hope he's watching it now.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.310
But then there was so
much to learn from him.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.420
When I say crush, it's not
purely a physical intimacy,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.310
but everything
about that person,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.970
I just wanted to be like myself.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.560
So I think that's the reason
why I actually took up that job.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.160
Then after a couple of
months, when I was actually

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.260
with that professor
of mine, driving down

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.890
the NIFT campus in Bangalore, I
just asked him to stop the car

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.800
and went to the campus,
picked up the Prospectus,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.470
and then he looked at
me and said, now what?

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.450
I said, why not?

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.110
And then, the rest is history.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.560
NIFT has been a cakewalk,
because I never really

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.400
considered design as something
which I was studying,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.560
but it was something
which was so organic.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.450
It was there within you.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.270
But it's more about
how you polish a skill.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.900
So in fact, until
everybody questioned me

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.560
about such a drastic
shift of career

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.440
from dentistry to
design, it didn't even

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.600
strike me, because it
came so naturally to me.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.660
The only time I had to
actually tell my parents

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.730
was before I joined NIFT.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.540
When I told my dad that,
two years of my life,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.420
let me do what I want to.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.035
I'm not going to
blame my parents or--

00:04:22.035 --> 00:04:23.410
yeah, I'm not
going to blame them

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.100
that they were the ones who
asked me to study dentistry,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.530
but I think I come
from a generation--

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.110
I'm talking about
the early '90s,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.330
when everybody was studying
engineering or medicine.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.390
So it was more of
a social pressure.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.710
Though I wanted to do
fine arts, I really

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.980
wanted to be a painter.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.040
But I think everybody--
it was understood

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.440
that you have to do either
medicine or engineering.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.700
And then-- I wasn't
a bad student.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.270
I said, OK.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.800
Let me just for--

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.470
if I have to paint, and I
would still continue painting.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:00.940
And that's what I did.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.970
Even when I studied
dentistry, in the evenings

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.110
I used to paint.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.240
Of course, [? downs ?]
took a break.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.900
[? Downs ?] needs so much more
commitment and time, but even

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.060
as a dentist, you need to
have a very good hand skill.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.120
You carve teeth
and wax, you know?

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.550
So I scored very well
in all those subjects

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.220
where there was a lot of
practical work involved.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.760
So it was never about not being
in touch with your other side.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.080
So NIFT happened and I
think more than anything,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.970
it was about--

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.460
you know you never try
to prove to others.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.192
It's more about proving
to your own self.

00:05:39.192 --> 00:05:42.210
Of course, there are 100
people watching you--

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.630
about all those guys around NIFT
maybe just to hit around women.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.370
You know, how most--

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.970
if the most clean-shaved way
of thinking about why people

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.680
go to a fashion
institute, because it's

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.080
all glamor and the pretty girls.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.000
One, yes.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.480
That was not even
of my interest.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.680
I mean, girls.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.850
And yes, there is glamor
in the fashion industry,

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.050
but then there is so much
of hard work as well.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.560
So at NIFT, like I mentioned,
it wasn't about studying,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.900
but it was more
about having fun.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.744
Every time they
gave an assignment,

00:06:20.744 --> 00:06:21.660
I would be the first--

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.909
I would just like went into
[INAUDIBLE] who was always

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:26.947
trying to finish things much
before my other classmates,

00:06:26.947 --> 00:06:29.280
and everybody would look at--
give me those dirty looks,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.540
saying, that-- stop.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.010
Don't show it today.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.770
I'm like, OK, I'll
wait for you all.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.240
Then it was fun.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.090
I eventually got the gold medal.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.340
And that particular year,
I was very fortunate

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.760
that I received it from the
president then, Mr. Abdul

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.044
Kalam.

00:06:47.044 --> 00:06:50.670
So-- and I think at
that point, my dad

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.979
was very clear about what
his son wanted to do in life.

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.520
After that, there
was no questioning.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.140
He just said, OK.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.560
I remember the day I got
my Best Student award.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.980
I just walked through the crowd
and I said, this is for you.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.380
And I'm sure he--

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.940
there was a certain
amount of pride, which--

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.650
I'm assuming.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.950
Or I want to believe that
he was happy about it.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.610
After NIFT, I did
work in Hyderabad

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.420
for a couple of years in
retail, and also in Bangalore,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.850
when I was invited
by NIFT again.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.187
I think my old institute
where I studied,

00:07:29.187 --> 00:07:30.270
they were very fond of me.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.610
They always called
me back to teach.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.620
So I came back to NIFT to teach
as a guest faculty, teaching

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.050
my favorite subject,
print design.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.190
And that's when, when I was
actually with my students

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.119
is when--

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:45.660
you know that little
urge of, I think

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.450
I want to study a little more.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.910
And at that point, you
had time on your side.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.050
When I say time, age.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:08:00.010
So I eventually did
my second master's.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.670
I did my MA Fashion in Italy--

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.170
Milan.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.230
I was 29 then, when
I went to Milan,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:15.070
and I think Milan changed
me as a person totally.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.670
I have to talk about all this--

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:23.380
this journey from dentistry
to going to NIFT, Hyderabad,

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.710
and then of course, to Italy--

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.530
Milan-- Europe.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.890
Because I think it's
very, very important

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.080
for all of us to travel--

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.794
travel alone to
discover yourself.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.350
When you are in a
foreign land by yourself,

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:48.640
that is when you actually
realize what you are.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.910
I'm not saying that you can't
do that living in your country,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.040
but then I think what
does meditation to do you?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:55.540
Right?

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.330
Same thing happens
when you travel.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.920
And I was a very, very
short-tempered person

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.110
when I was here,
back then in college.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.400
I would like-- probably,
also, I was carrying too much

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.200
of a baggage from
a certain time.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.800
But for me, it was
also about running away

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.060
from a lot of
things from my past.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:29.330
So I think reaching Milan and
starting life fresh from then--

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.340
because it was a new
surrounding for me--

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.450
starting fresh.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.900
New people around.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.650
So it was about
a lot of chapters

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.725
which you left
behind in your life.

00:09:41.725 --> 00:09:45.860
You didn't-- you want to just
dig them and don't show them

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.320
to anybody.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.110
I remember this one time when
my friend in Milan asked me,

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.970
Ganesh, do you ever get angry?

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.850
I just love when she asked me
that, because I remember back

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.790
in NIFT, everybody was so
scared to come and even

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.420
talk to me, because I
was so short-tempered.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.390
But when I went to
Milan, that whole change.

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.890
I knew that, yes, I'm
liking this phase of mine

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.410
where you're
accepting everything

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.640
that way everything is, and you
know, you have the patience.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.002
You are accepting.

00:10:17.002 --> 00:10:18.460
I think it was
around the same time

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.810
when I actually
accepted myself also--

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.690
when today, I say that I am gay.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.070
After coming back from Milan--
why did I come back from Milan?

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.050
Though I knew that there was--

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.670
I would have probably lived--

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.440
when I say live,
I literally mean

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.100
I could breathe easily
without thinking or caring

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.980
about what one
would think of me,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.870
or what anybody would judge if
what I wear, or what I speak,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:52.000
or whom I'm looking at.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.020
So-- but then I think at
that point in my life,

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.811
my priorities were
very different.

00:10:58.811 --> 00:11:00.310
There's a lot of
ambition, you know.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.650
When you finish college,
there's that zeal

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:06.250
to do something nice
about your life.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.920
So when I came
back from Milan, it

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.660
was about starting
my own studio.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:20.590
There was so much of energy
in terms of what's next?

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.420
How do I go about it,
because also coming

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:25.390
from a non-business family--
my mom's an art teacher,

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:30.430
my dad's a marketing person,
and nobody was into business.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.450
So for me, it was a
totally new thing.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:37.360
So again, after
coming back, I went

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.120
and I spent a
month in Auroville,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.630
and just to try and figure it
out as to what do I do now?

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.800
How do I go about
planning my studio?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.270
I come back, and of course, on
the first of September, 2007,

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:57.280
that I started my studio with
just a couple of machines.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.430
Tried and contacted
my really old tailors,

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.150
and embroidery carriers.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.590
I said, I'm starting this.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.450
Will you come work for me?

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.750
And everybody was there.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.390
I think they kind of
followed where I was going,

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.590
and then that one
phone call, and I said,

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.890
[INAUDIBLE] will you
come work for me?

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.890
And everybody was there.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:21.880
I felt like I must have
done something good,

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.450
that today everybody wants
to come and be with you.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:30.460
And that's how the journey of
my label, Ganesh Nallari, began.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:39.430
It started with designing
clothes for family, friends.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.752
And I've never really
publicized my work, like what

00:12:42.752 --> 00:12:43.960
you see in magazines and all.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.920
It was purely word of
mouth, and even till date,

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:54.050
as I complete my 10 years in
a couple of days from now,

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:56.340
I have never publicized my work.

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.510
It has purely being
word of mouth,

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:04.110
and I truly believe that is
the best way to reach out.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.810
Today, after a lot of
social media platforms

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.190
or in other things
which are available,

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.610
I think it is an
easier way to connect

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:16.240
with your client, or
anybody for that matter.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.230
But nothing like a one-on-one,
when you hear like,

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.980
oh, this person is
wearing something nice,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:27.740
and you hear it is done
by some so-and-so person.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:31.020
Why I'm mentioning you about my
clothing here is because when

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:31.520
I--

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.590
I function very
different at my studio.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.890
It is not about a retail outlet
where you just go and pick

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.170
something which is on the shelf.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.120
For me, it is about people.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.630
For me, it is about dressing
you, but not forcing myself

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.620
on you.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.160
When I say that you will
find a lot of designer pieces

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.410
in the market,
but for me, yes, I

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.870
will give you a designer
piece, but for me you

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.660
are important more than me.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.720
Your personality has to
reflect in what you wear.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.990
I come secondary there, and
that's what I truly believe.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.200
Because every
individual is different,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.644
and that should shine first.

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:14.310
Otherwise, everybody
would start looking

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:18.480
like a copy of each other.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.770
I also say this at
this point that when

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.670
we talk about every individual
being different, yes.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.560
There's black, gray, and white.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:32.370
There is also gray, which
we always tend to forget.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:38.090
So there is a man,
there's a woman,

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:43.800
and there's somebody in between
who has a certain preference,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.250
right?

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.370
So I did not come
out to the world

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.330
then, when I started
in my studio.

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:57.320
Being very
professional at work--

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.210
you have so many people you
are meeting on a daily basis.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.430
Fashion, yes, there
are so many women

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.110
you interact with every day.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.800
And it was one of my
clients who had invited me

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.840
for her birthday.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.300
I was very adamant of--

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.490
because I usually prefer
keeping it separate.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.170
I don't like to--

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:21.870
I am a private person, to
a large extent, until I

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.700
let somebody in my life.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.217
And there was this
one time when--

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.050
she was a very regular
client, and she said,

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.950
you have to come for my
birthday, and I said, OK.

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.910
And things kind of
changed from there,

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:40.340
because there was this
party, and of course, we

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.820
were all having a great
time, and I love to dance.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:49.220
Which most Hyderabad
men don't, sadly.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.380
And I was having a
great time dancing,

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.510
and there were three
women in front of me

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.900
and three women behind me.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.820
We were doing this weird--

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.950
I don't know what.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.590
But we were having a great time.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.520
And there was so much
of comfort around.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.900
At that point, I think one of
the husbands did not like it,

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.290
and so another
guy from the party

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:13.850
came and he just
whispered in my ear,

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.940
saying, dude, what
are you doing?

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:17.940
I said, what am I doing?

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.127
I'm having a great time.

00:16:20.127 --> 00:16:21.710
And then he just
pulled me to the side

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.810
and he said, the
way you're dancing

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.595
with these other ladies.

00:16:25.595 --> 00:16:27.300
I said, yeah, they're
all my friends.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.740
So what's wrong?

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.950
He said, do you realize that
they're all married women?

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.020
I said, so?

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.910
Like, I'm having a good
time with my friends,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.050
and they invited me.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:41.290
I have a certain
comfort with them,

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.420
and I'm having a great time.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.981
At that point, I think I just
told that guy, you know what?

00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:46.480
Relax.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.180
I'm gay.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.080
And that was it.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.630
I didn't even have to try coming
out to anybody, or do anything.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.550
He did the job for me.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.070
I was like, thank you.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.690
I think it made my life
so much more easier.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.504
So he took care of
my PR in terms of--

00:17:06.504 --> 00:17:09.510
you do my job of you
coming out for me.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:16.130
[LAUGHING] So well,
that's about it.

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.040
When it came to society--

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.310
I mean, when I say society,
in terms of the people

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.890
around you, your
client, or everybody--

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.619
this is how I came
out to the world.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.410
But I think my biggest
concern was when

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:33.715
I was coming out to my parents.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.870
I still do not know if I
have come out to them or not.

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:45.700
But considering I am at an age
where I should've been married

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:49.450
and all my friends almost have
kids who are in high school

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:56.040
now, and it was only once
that my mom asked me if I--

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.230
that I should consider marriage.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.650
I didn't even have
to say a word.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.380
I just looked at her.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.370
I used all my dance expressions,
and I just looked at her,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.944
and I said, that's it.

00:18:06.944 --> 00:18:08.610
And that was the first
and the last time

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.860
she actually asked
me about marriage.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.780
So I live by myself
in Hyderabad.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.600
My parents also live in
Hyderabad, in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.030
I visit them every
Sunday for lunch.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.060
I am mentioning this again
because every Sunday when

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:29.260
I go home, there's always been
that urge of, you know what?

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.420
Today, I think I'm
going to tell them.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.980
Just finish it, you know?

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.180
I don't want to keep them under
any hope of that, you know?

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.465
That he will get married
at some point or whatever.

00:18:41.465 --> 00:18:42.340
I think it's always--

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.940
I always felt like it's good
to sit and talk and finish it.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.680
But then every Sunday, I would
go thinking that OK, today I'm

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.030
going to tell them.

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:51.040
But I don't know.

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.780
I would just-- then
I would postpone it

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:55.035
for the next week,
thinking that I mean, yeah,

00:18:55.035 --> 00:18:56.330
I had a good time.

00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.050
Why again disturb this
whole peace at home?

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.184
I came, I had my lunch,
I had a nice nap.

00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:03.350
They gave me tea, I had tea.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.930
I played with my dog.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:05.980
So let it just be.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.560
I'll postpone it
to the next Sunday.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.630
So it was around the
same time that I actually

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.860
started doing theater.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.690
And in Hyderabad,
there's a theater group

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:20.050
which organizes short
play competitions.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.290
And I had also worked with
the theater group previously,

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.850
and this friend of
mine, he said, Ganesh,

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.320
you should take part
in this competition.

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.530
And he was the
one who pushed me.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.410
So when I decided to
write a story, I said,

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.120
why not write about my own self?

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.080
So that's when I did my first--

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.560
that's when I wrote
my first play.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.020
I also directed in it.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.520
Of course, I had to act in it.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.650
So I thought, let me
write about me and my mom.

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:59.620
And I used stage as a platform
to tell my story to the world--

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.380
more to my parents.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:06.850
So I just changed a little about
the designer being a dancer.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.660
How he becomes the famous
dancer, and the story

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.570
is about two dancers,
the mother and the son,

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.480
and how the mother faces a
lot of challenges in her life.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.270
How she gives up her
passion for dance,

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:24.070
but she secretly teaches
the son dance, and--

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.780
but when it actually
comes to when

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.670
the mother questions the son
about marriage, he does not--

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.130
he doesn't have words,
because he's so frightened.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.480
He's terrified.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.150
He's just not able
to tell it to her.

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.700
So at that point, he
dances, and he tells his mom

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.980
about what-- who he is.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.410
So when I wrote the script,
and I was discussing it with

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:49.330
my co-actor, the lady who
played my mother's role,

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:54.070
and also with my friend who
was doing the lighting for me,

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.160
I remember he mentioning
that [INAUDIBLE] dance--

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.440
to me, it's a
[INAUDIBLE] who will

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.170
understand what you're doing?

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.900
I said, if nobody
understands what I did,

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.670
that means I failed as a
dancer, I failed as a writer,

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.110
as an actor.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.720
I failed in communicating,
but forget about anything

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.000
but telling what I had
to tell my parents.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.720
I said, no.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.690
I'm going to do the same
thing in the climax,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.510
and that is going
to be the ending.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:27.810
And so we qualified
in the prelims,

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.244
and we reached the finals.

00:21:30.244 --> 00:21:38.120
And the big day, and I remember
the last scene happening.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.000
There was pin-drop silence.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.160
It's a very emotional,
very heavy scene--

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.420
the last scene.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.110
And I could see me and
my co-actor of course,

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.390
me getting emotional is
understood because I'm telling

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:54.440
my story, but then I remember
the girl who played my mom--

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.250
I could hear her crying.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.390
It's so quiet, and I
could hear her cry.

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.730
That-- it echoed
in the auditorium.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.380
And the lights were
off, and we both

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.670
were still hugging and crying.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.170
Actually, truly, somebody had
to come and say, hon, time up.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:10.830
Please go.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.522
We were like, oh, OK.

00:22:13.522 --> 00:22:14.980
And of course, we
won [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.313
[INAUDIBLE] won the competition.

00:22:16.313 --> 00:22:21.220
We were second, because it was
a very unconventional story.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:26.500
I was glad that we won,
not just because it

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.800
was important about winning
the competition, but about

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:35.810
the audience accepting us.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.050
When I say us, I mean
the LGBT community.

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:40.550
At that point, I
realized it was not

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.580
about me just talking
about my life,

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.060
but then there must have been so
many people in the audience who

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.790
related to it.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:56.170
Who were there to accept me,
and people like me there.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.360
So when I finished the
play, after getting

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.630
that trophy and
just walked down,

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.505
and I was still unsure about
whether my parents understood

00:23:04.505 --> 00:23:05.950
or no.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.320
So I-- somebody--
this girl who came

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.840
and who was congratulating me.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.010
What a powerful scene,
Ganesh-- the last one.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.390
I said, thank you.

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.730
And somebody tapped
me from the back,

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.710
and she was telling
to this person--

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.260
this girl was standing in
front of me, saying that,

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.150
but that is all true.

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.120
And I just turned back.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.910
It was my mom.

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:25.700
I was like, OK.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.020
She got the message.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.810
So that's how I came
out to my parents.

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:32.060
It was very interesting,
but it has always

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:38.560
been that way, that be it
coming out as who I am,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.910
or in every
situation, I've always

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.170
used some way or
the other of art

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.640
being centric towards my life.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:24:00.100
It was around the same
time in 2009 that I--

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.050
it just happened that
one of my family members

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.450
also passed away,
and it also happens

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:14.810
that this person was the one
who abused me all my life.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.130
All my life in the sense--

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.437
my whole childhood.

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:25.530
So I wasn't talking to
him for very, very long.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:26.770
Yeah, it was a guy.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:31.450
I wasn't talking to
him for very long

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.870
and everybody knew in the family
that I really didn't get along

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:35.680
very well with him.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.230
So when he passed
away that day, I

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.910
think I was the one
who cried the most.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.030
Because I did not know if I have
to mourn the death of a family

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:50.730
member or celebrate a chapter,
which was over in my life.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.200
So I just happened to--

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.190
I came back home, and I was
chatting with a friend of mine

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.960
who happens to be a filmmaker.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.490
And I told him that
this is what happened,

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:05.060
and I just came back
from the funeral.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.740
And he said, Ganesh, will
you write the story for me?

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.740
I said no.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:11.600
I will share important
parts of my life

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.760
with you, but I don't
want to dig back and talk

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.020
about anything--

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:20.190
what had happened.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.420
And eventually,
the film was made.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.860
The film is called "I Am."

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:31.880
They're four short stories
directed by Onir, and "I Am,"

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.450
"Abhimanyu" is based on mine,
and another friend, Harish

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.430
Iyer, from Bombay.

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:40.580
So it's an inspiration,
but it's an autobiography.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.410
There are parts of
the scenes where

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:46.130
he has picked from my
life and Harish's life,

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.146
and the movie's made.

00:25:48.146 --> 00:25:52.990
"I Am" eventually won the
National Award in 2012,

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:57.400
and I am again
talking about my abuse

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.440
here because for a long
time, I think I was blaming

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.290
my abuse for my sexuality.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:37.900
Because-- because it's an age
when you have your crushes.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.640
You see your friends
around who go

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:49.120
on Valentine's Day with
a rose, and here you're

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.780
sitting in one corner
trying to figure out what's

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.050
happening around, you know?

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.960
Dealing with your own abuse--

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.860
with your sexuality.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.570
I just pretended that
even I was straight.

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:16.130
I would just randomly buy a
rose and go give a girl whom--

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:17.880
I didn't even go
on real [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.150
just to make a point
that, oh, he did this,

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.780
so even I should be doing it.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:23.600
Today when I look--

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.880
I think back of all the
silly things which I did,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.670
and trying to be
somebody else, just

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:35.670
because my other friends, other
guys in the class were doing.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.860
But then there was such
a pure relationship

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.110
with all the friends I had,
like be it a guy or a girl,

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.610
you know?

00:27:44.991 --> 00:27:47.630
There was no--
there is intimacy.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:49.256
You know, when you
talk about intimacy,

00:27:49.256 --> 00:27:51.046
you also have to realize
that there are two

00:27:51.046 --> 00:27:52.310
different kinds of intimacy.

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.770
There is a physical
intimacy, and then there's

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.990
also an emotional connect
you have with a individual.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:01.370
But all my emotional connects
have been only with women.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.700
Yes, because I also say only
with women, because today,

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.660
I worry that if I have--

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.520
or with whoever I have an
emotional connect with a guy--

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.820
the world looks
at that other boy,

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.370
also thinking that he's gay.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:20.270
That has become my
biggest challenge today--

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.075
to have good guy friends.

00:28:25.469 --> 00:28:27.510
You go to a party,
everybody's clicking pictures.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.360
You have three women
and you take a picture.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.526
Everybody is fine with that.

00:28:30.526 --> 00:28:32.580
One post with that
boy on Facebook

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.719
or anywhere on social media,
next question involved-- so,

00:28:35.719 --> 00:28:36.510
are you dating him?

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.590
I'm like, give me a break.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.150
He's a straight guy.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.760
You know, you make
that other person

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.770
conscious about not
taking a picture with you.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.440
So what I'm trying
to tell you here

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:57.570
is it hasn't been tough because
you're also dealing with abuse,

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.170
and you're also dealing with
discovering your own self.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:06.030
The last time I actually
was felt by somebody

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.510
was when my abuse--

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.810
when the last time
the abuse happened.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:14.800
But for the longest time, I
almost lived like an asexual,

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.710
because for me, it
was something bad.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:20.080
It was something which I
did not want in my life,

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.680
because you are looked at--

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.200
your body is looked
at as an object.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.305
So I really had trust issues.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.420
I found that comfort
around women,

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.250
but I would never
go close to a boy.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.520
Also I think you
come from a time

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.330
when people did not even know
what a gay or a lesbian is.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:47.340
I'm talking what the
previous generation.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:47.880
Not now.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.620
Like how openly
we talk about it.

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:54.030
So even I did not know what
was going on, honestly.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:56.670
We have so many apps, and
it's so much more easier

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.200
to connect with the
community today.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.570
But I'm talking about a
time, like a few years back--

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:01.070
not too--

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.170
I'm not very old.

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:07.610
Just a couple of years back,
that even to find somebody

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:11.700
to just talk about how
you feel was so difficult.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:17.910
And so I think over a
period of time, I had to--

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.400
I'd worked on
myself in many ways.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.700
Like I said, as I
mentioned about dentistry

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:33.060
to design, this whole
journey to where I am today--

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:38.120
and to reach a state of mind
where you accept yourself

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:43.910
for what it is without worrying
about who is judging you.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:50.740
So what is most important
is, I'm not going to ask--

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.240
I'm not going to
question any of you

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.560
all here whether you have
come out of the closet.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:58.400
Do we need a
heterosexual to come out

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.160
of the closet to prove that
he's heterosexual, and say

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.460
that he likes women?

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:09.430
So at that point, I feel
everybody's sexual preference

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.710
is their personal business.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:16.070
I will come out to people whom
I think are important to me.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:23.080
I do not even care about what
the third, fourth person is

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.370
going to think about me.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:32.120
So coming out is never about
coming out for the society.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:38.090
Coming out is always
for you, because if you

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:47.200
feel it is important that you
come out and you feel lighter,

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.980
you will realize that.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.740
How long can you live
in denial, you know?

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.280
There might be a lot of cases
where people are married

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.670
and living a dual life,
cheating on partners,

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.430
but they still know that
there is something--

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.410
that they are doing
something wrong,

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:06.850
because they haven't
totally come face-to-face

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.180
with reality with themselves.

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.230
Again, like I
said, I do not want

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.690
to judge who's done
that, because I think

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.940
whoever is living
a particular life

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:18.280
is living a particular life.

00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.890
Only they know what they are
going through in their life.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.180
But as far as I'm
concerned, I'm talking

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.850
in specific about
marriage because I

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.910
think some people still
expect-- my relatives expect

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.310
that I should get married.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:32.230
Even when I'm so
openly gay, some people

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.538
ask questions like--

00:32:34.538 --> 00:32:36.540
like I remember this
last time when--

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:38.280
I usually don't go
to family gatherings,

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.745
only to avoid this--

00:32:39.745 --> 00:32:41.370
and as soon as I
went, one of my aunt's

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.760
asked me, so, Ganesh, when
are you getting married?

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.160
She just said it so loud.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.650
I was so embarrassed.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:49.380
I just-- I want to just
tell it to her, saying, oh,

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.460
just find me a cute
boy and I'm ready.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.210
I with there was an
arranged marriage even

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.690
for the LGBT
community, you know?

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:01.114
It would just make life
so much more easier.

00:33:01.114 --> 00:33:02.780
And I just looked at
my mom, and I said,

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.238
this is the reason why I don't
want to come to such places.

00:33:05.238 --> 00:33:06.140
And she's like, OK.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.500
Calm down.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:11.370
So coming out is
always for yourself,

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:15.840
and life always gives
us many chances.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.250
It's only for us to look
forward for new beginnings.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:28.620
And I think what you do is
everything is in your hands.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.260
You create your opportunities.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:35.090
I truly believe that you have
to create your opportunities.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.880
You create your moments,
your situations.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.730
There's confusion.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:39.650
It's all right.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.770
I think confusion
gives you choices.

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.970
But you can design your life.

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:51.500
People can help you or support
you, but it's all up to you

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.370
what you want to do.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:56.930
So whether you want
to come out and face--

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:02.873
and live an honest
life, or suffer within,

00:34:02.873 --> 00:34:05.720
it's totally your call.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:13.990
But what is most important is
just being honest to yourself.

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:16.690
Yeah.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:17.590
Thank you.

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:19.740
[APPLAUSE]
