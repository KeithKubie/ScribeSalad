00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:09.072
I think because of just the complexity

00:00:09.072 --> 00:00:11.993
of environmental problems today,

00:00:11.993 --> 00:00:14.010
I think that there's going to be

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.376
a big role and a kind of profession

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:20.290
around process design,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.520
so not technical or technological process design

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.025
because those jobs exist now,

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.516
but more social process design.

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:30.506
And I think there will be jobs available

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:32.480
for people who really understand

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.838
both, like, the complexity of the environment

00:00:35.838 --> 00:00:38.188
and social and political issues

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:41.656
but also are able to design very effective processes

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:45.109
to get us from one stage to another.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.731
I think there's a lot of people

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.239
who know what they want the world to look like

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.507
and there are people who know what we should do,

00:00:53.507 --> 00:00:57.158
but the path between aspiration and action

00:00:57.158 --> 00:00:58.727
is still a little bit blurry,

00:00:58.727 --> 00:00:59.982
so I think there's going to be jobs

00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:02.828
for people who make that much clearer.
