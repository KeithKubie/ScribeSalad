00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now take a look at this force diagram, this force is going down the plane must be balance assuming

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
it's not accelerating by the force going up the plane.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Put another way, the push force and that's the force that the guy pushing on the block was exerting

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
must also be equal to 500N.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Just like in the previous examples of the pulleys, we don't just want to know the force we have to exert

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to move this object up to a height of 1 m.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We want to know the distance over which we must exert that force.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Can you use your knowledge of trigonometry and geometry to tell me over what distance

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
must we observe this 500 N force to move it from the bottom down here all the way to the top.
