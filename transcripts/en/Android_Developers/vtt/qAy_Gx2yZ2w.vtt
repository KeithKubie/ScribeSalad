00:00:02.105 --> 00:00:04.960
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: It's
my distinct pleasure

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.720
to introduce Arianna Huffington,
journalist extraordinaire,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.310
founder of Huff Post--

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.910
I sort of start and end my
day on Huff Post sometimes,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.230
I feel--

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.220
author of 15 bestselling books,
including, most recently,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.120
"The Sleep Revolution,"
"Time" magazine's 100

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.930
most influential, "Forbes"
most powerful women,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.955
board member to Uber, Onex,
Global Citizen, Just Capital.

00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:37.900
It feels super hard driving.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.450
And it feels like,
oh, my god, how do you

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.910
manage all of this in 24 hours?

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.280
And yet we find ourselves
here talking about her latest

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.690
venture, which she
founded in 2016,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.340
called Thrive Global, a
corporate and consumer

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.760
well-being and
productivity platform

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.360
to help us change the
way we work and live.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.670
Welcome, Arianna.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.980
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Thank you so much.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.500
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Where does
that hard-charging "Forbes"

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.430
most powerful, "Time's"
100 most influential

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.490
get to talking about sleep?

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.130
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Well,
this is a fantastic question

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.660
to start with.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.720
Because it's at the heart
of everything we're doing

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.180
at Thrive, which is ending the
delusion that we've been living

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.840
under, really, since the
first Industrial Revolution--

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.910
so for decades--

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.280
that, in order to
succeed, in order

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.910
to achieve amazing things
like everybody here is doing,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.640
we need to be always on.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.170
We need to never stop,
to unplug, and recharge.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.310
And what is interesting
about that is that we now

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.370
have overwhelming data--

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.020
scientific findings that prove
that the opposite is true--

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.620
that, in fact, when we
take time to recharge

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.820
we operate from a deeper, more
productive, more effective,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.900
more creative part of ourselves,
and we achieve much more

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.012
in a more sustainable way.

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.470
And what is
interesting-- you know,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.250
you and I come from
ancient civilizations--

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.820
India and ancient
Greece knew that.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.180
So if you go back to the
ancient wisdom of our cultures,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.760
they knew that.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.120
As you know, India is
my favorite country.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.200
I started at Santiniketan
University when I was 17.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.100
And the Bhagavad Gita
makes it very clear

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.820
that there is that higher
life where you actually

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.300
operate from resources that,
otherwise, you don't even

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.670
know you have.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.640
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: But somewhere,
despite being in Santiniketan

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.027
when you were 17, I
think I heard something

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:01.360
about hitting a head on a desk--

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.080
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Exactly.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.820
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: --that
caused this awakening.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.112
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Absolutely.

00:03:05.112 --> 00:03:07.930
I kind of basically bought
into the collective delusion,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.450
which is really hard
to avoid if you're

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.160
a type A personality like
everybody here is, I'm sure,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.540
and everybody on stage.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.130
Let's admit it.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.210
So I absolutely
bought into all that.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.270
And so two years into
building The Huffington Post,

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.510
being a divorced mother of
two teenage daughters, which

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.450
has its own problems attached,
I collapsed from burnout,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.060
sleep deprivation, exhaustion.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.480
I hit my head on my
desk, broke my cheekbone.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.530
And that was really the
beginning of my new awakening

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.845
that led to launching
Thrive and being here.

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:52.220
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
How long did it

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.250
take from that awakening to
really change habits and be

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.160
that person who
now has bestselling

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.110
books on this topic?

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.890
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: So I'm
a kind of research freak.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.870
So I started
studying everything,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.510
delving into the latest science.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.410
And the entire Thrive
Global platform

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.220
is based on the
scientific knowledge

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.830
that we grow and change
through micro-steps.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.810
It doesn't happen overnight.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.500
It's small, incremental,
daily changes.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.030
So that's what happened with
me in every aspect of life,

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.850
from the obvious--

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:42.800
sleep and meditation-- but also,
what's happening in our minds.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.300
Because very often, it's what
I call the obnoxious roommate

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.450
living in our head-- you
know, that negative voice.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.980
We women have it worse, guys--

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.960
self-doubt and
questioning everything

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.090
that we need to address.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.930
So doing all that eliminates
of the energy leaks.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.480
So it makes more
energy available to us

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.225
to simply get things done and
achieve groundbreaking things.

00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:15.600
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
OK, so here you

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.840
are with your awakening
and your research,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.280
and you're armed with it.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.400
But you're starting a company
like a lot of folks here--

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.220
small companies which
are fast growth.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.815
Did it worry you that maybe
this is not good for business,

00:05:28.815 --> 00:05:31.140
that this is good
for the person,

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.380
that the company may
need to be hard-charging?

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.470
How do the business
leaders in this room

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.710
make a change within
their organizations?

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.410
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
So being hard-charging

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.260
is absolutely the necessary
way to get anything done.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.840
Yardley Pohl, who
is here, who heads

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.210
product for Thrive
Global, and I call

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.730
it having a high metabolism.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.280
We don't want to hire
anybody who does not

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.990
have a high metabolism.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.108
We don't want to hire anybody
who is not hard-charging.

00:06:05.108 --> 00:06:06.900
And at the beginning,
there are some people

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.060
who thought, oh, this
company is about thriving.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.760
I can join and chill
under a mango tree.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.770
No, no.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.440
Wrong company.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.500
No.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.560
We just believe and we
have the data to prove it--

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.650
when I say believe, it's
not really the right word--

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.370
that when hard-charging
individuals then take some time

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.500
to unplug and recharge,
they are going

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.730
to be much more effective when
they return hard-charging.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.510
And that's really the key.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.420
And you know that.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.670
I'm so happy to be speaking
to an audience which

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.620
is so much about
getting things done,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.950
achieving, and
knowing that you need

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.580
to focus to be able to do that.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.330
And I think what
is key here is also

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.670
our relationship
with technology.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.320
Because we are all
a little addicted.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.120
I see a few people who can't
stop looking at their phones.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.590
Let me just tell you something.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:02.850
That's perfectly fine.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.280
But don't fool
yourself into thinking

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.430
you are also listening to us.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.670
You are making a choice that
clearing emails or texts

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.062
right now is more important.

00:07:13.062 --> 00:07:13.770
I totally get it.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.360
We are not offended.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.090
I just want to make it clear
that multitasking is a myth.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.110
You cannot do two things at
once that involve mental energy.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.160
Yeah, you can wash the dishes
and listen to a podcast.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.360
But you can't do two things
that require cognitive energy.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.680
That's why, at Thrive Global,
we don't allow devices

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.480
during meetings.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.490
Because you know
these incredibly

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.600
long and unproductive when
everybody, the minute there

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.850
is a moment of boredom,
goes to their phone.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.920
They pretend that
they are taking notes.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.147
But you know they're not.

00:07:55.147 --> 00:07:57.230
So we basically say, listen,
if you have something

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.050
more important to do, go do it.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.560
If you're here, just
be 100% present.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.990
And so there's an
enormous amount of stuff

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.640
that we can bring
to our companies

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.630
to be able to be hard-charging
in a sustainable way.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.180
Building a company
is not a sprint.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.880
It's a marathon.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.008
So we need to do it
for the long haul.

00:08:21.008 --> 00:08:22.800
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: You
have coined these two

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.300
kind of very interesting terms.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.240
You describe 2017 as the year
of the great awakening, where

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.610
we became aware of what
technology is doing to us,

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.270
and 2018 as the great reckoning.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.020
What's happening?

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.617
How did we get here?

00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:40.200
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well, as you know,

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.620
everybody here is involved
in building great products

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.730
or running great companies.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:51.180
So until 2017,
speaking generally,

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.390
we were completely
enthralled with technology.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.730
We did not really look at
the unintended consequences.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:02.040
There was a certain kind of
triumphalism around tech.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.370
2017 was the year
of great awakening,

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.510
when we also saw that,
even though there

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.980
is so much to celebrate around
the role of tech in our lives,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.460
there are also
unintended consequences.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.150
And they have to do largely
with the way technology is

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.610
infringing on our humanity.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.770
So we need to establish
rules of the road.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.330
We need to establish
sacred boundaries.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.950
And I love "take, not harm,"
the great Buddhist monk line.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:38.050
But it has never been easier
to run away from ourselves.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.290
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: That's kind
of a really interesting thing

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:42.100
to talk about.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.430
Because this morning,
I talked about what

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.780
we are doing in Digital
Wellbeing Most of the platforms

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.580
have announced some investments.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.730
We are giving users more
control over their tech.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.600
And we're expecting users
to choose what they can

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.220
and how much they use.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.855
Are we doing enough?

00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:03.480
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Well, first of all,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.280
I think the launch of Digital
Wellbeing was fantastic.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.650
I was there applauding.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.090
I loved seeing your CEO in
front of a screen that said

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:16.400
"JOMO- the joy of missing out."

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.760
I think it was one of
those great moments in tech

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.690
when a great tech
leader acknowledges

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:30.410
the responsibility of tech
to actually produce products

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.510
that help people manage their
relationship with technology

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.480
in a way that improves the
quality of their lives.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.270
And what I love about
that is that it is clearly

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.160
good for business, also.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.280
Because in the end,
if your consumers

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.730
recognize that you are
adding value to their lives,

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.990
their loyalty will
only increase.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.318
I think this is an
ongoing pursuit.

00:10:56.318 --> 00:10:58.610
I don't think there will ever
be a day when we can say,

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.710
we've done enough, we are done.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:08.250
I think, as Apple showed,
bringing screen time on iOS,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.120
which helps you manage your
relationship with technology,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.710
more and more tech companies
now are entering the field.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:20.090
Thrive launched an
app for Android.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:24.800
So anybody here on
Android can download it.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.720
It's called the Thrive app.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.488
And it can help you put
your phone in Thrive mode.

00:11:31.488 --> 00:11:33.530
Let's say you're having
dinner with your children

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.690
or your girlfriend
or your boyfriend

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.910
and you don't want
to be distracted.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.080
If I text you, I get a text
back, you are in Thrive mode

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.230
until such-and-such
a time, which I love,

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.490
because it also changes
the cultural norm.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.280
Right now, we sort of
congratulate people

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.880
for being always on, for
answering texts immediately.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.930
We need to change that.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.470
We need people to
say, hey, Arianna

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.420
has a real sense of priority.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:08.120
She really takes some time
to be undistracted when she's

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.650
doing something that matters.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.060
And the other
thing the app does,

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.130
it gives you a
dashboard everyday

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:18.410
of your social media, game,
and general app consumption.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.040
And it can help you set
limits if you so desire.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.830
Let's say the app shows that you
spend two hours on Instagram.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.110
And it asks you if
you want to limit it.

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.405
If you say, yes, I want to
spend an hour and a half,

00:12:32.405 --> 00:12:35.030
it will give you a notification
so that, in an hour and a half,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.080
it cuts you out.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.760
Tough love.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:44.600
So Apple has put it on
the operating system

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.280
for iOS users, which is great.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.540
They don't have the Thrive mode,
but they have everything else.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:55.850
So again, I think
tech for good, tech

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:59.450
that helps us improve
the quality of our lives

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:04.610
is just a great opportunity
for any developers in the room

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:06.675
to pursue in the future.

00:13:06.675 --> 00:13:09.050
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: And yet I'm
sure everybody sitting here

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.810
are measuring, what's
my engagement metric?

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.880
How many minutes is
somebody spending in my app?

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.590
It feels a little
scary that people are

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.830
going to get out of their app.

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.750
These folks in this
room, how should they

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:25.778
measure what's success?

00:13:25.778 --> 00:13:27.070
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Absolutely.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:31.190
We're all going to be
measuring consumer engagement.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.750
At Thrive, obviously, we
measure consumer engagement

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.220
on our media platform, on our
different social platforms.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.730
The question is, what are
they doing while they're

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.500
engaging with you?

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.230
Is what they are doing while
they're engaging with you

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:50.890
improving their life or
diminishing their life?

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.610
And also, are you
becoming so addictive

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.525
that other parts of their
lives are suffering--

00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:00.400
their relationships
with their loved ones,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.390
their relationship
with themselves?

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.860
These are the questions to ask.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.310
And the one thing
I can guarantee

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:10.690
is that these things are not
in opposition to your business

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.040
metrics.

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.900
Because in the
end, I'm convinced

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.110
that the people will win the
future are the people who

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:21.220
add value to consumers'
lives, often ahead

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.740
of what consumers
think they need.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.200
One of my favorite
marketing stories

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:32.560
is Henry Ford, who said, if
I had asked my customers what

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.410
they wanted, they would have
told me "a faster horse."

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.750
Instead, I gave them a car.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.380
So we all sometimes
give consumers

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.690
something they may not
even fully know they want.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.080
But if it improves
their lives, that's

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.152
an incredible source of loyalty.

00:14:49.152 --> 00:14:51.610
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: That leads
us really well into something.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.652
You and I just caught up
a couple of minutes ago,

00:14:53.652 --> 00:14:57.460
and you said, how about teaching
empathy and other things

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.260
through apps and games?

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.920
And you have talked a lot
about human-centered design.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.960
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.030
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes,
we are all fascinated

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.220
with AI and the growth of AI.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.340
And Kai-Fu Lee recently
wrote a very interesting book

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.330
predicting that 2/3 of jobs are
going to be eliminated by AI.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.060
But the jobs that are
going to be at a premium

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:24.880
are jobs that require
purely human qualities,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.890
like creativity, empathy,
compassion, love.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:36.070
These are the qualities that
we humans are unbeaten at.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:40.060
So in the war for talent,
these are the qualities that

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.080
are going to be at a premium.

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.780
So how do we cultivate them?

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.760
So my kind of plead with
anybody here who's a developer

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.760
is to build a product that
cultivate human empathy.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.370
And I think this is going
to be an incredible business

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.810
opportunity.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:03.310
Because empathy is going to be a
greater and greater requirement

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.320
for any interactions.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:10.030
In companies, in order to
build successful teams,

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.330
you need human
beings who know how

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.780
to empathize with each other.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.350
So if you can create games
that can teach empathy,

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:26.710
whether it's to kindergartners
or to people at any age,

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.850
it would be an
incredible benefit.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.710
And if anybody has any such
idea, please let me know.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.400
Because we would love to help
support it, help fund it,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.530
help amplify it.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.800
Basically, we are in
the business not just

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:48.520
of building our own company,
but helping that whole ecosystem

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.510
that produces tech
for good that improves

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.600
the quality of our lives.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.900
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: And taking
that one step further, one way,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.460
I suppose, to be empathetic is
to respect your user's time.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.200
And you've also
talked about building

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.109
more respectful experiences.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.829
How do you know you're
respecting your user's time?

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.770
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: The
question is, is your user

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:19.869
using your app or your game
or whatever intentionally?

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:26.920
Or are they just using
it in a compulsive way,

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:31.380
without getting any
benefit at the end of it?

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.850
You know when you have that
feeling of, oh, my god,

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:39.942
I can't believe I spent 40
minutes on "Candy Crush?"

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.800
And you have that kind
of sinking feeling.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.230
Well, that's not something
you want associated

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.330
with your program, long-term.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.700
Short-term, you may
get a benefit from it.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.220
But I think we may not have
superhero movies for coders

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.350
and developers, but
I think maybe you

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:04.950
should make some superhero
movies for coders

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.380
and developers who
are actually producing

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:12.090
products that are helping
people invest their time well.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:14.460
Because that's all we have.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.100
I've always been
fascinated by philosophy

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.550
and the meaning of life, ever
since I was a little girl.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:30.190
And in the end, how we spend our
time is how we spend our life.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:34.900
It's the cumulative result
of all these daily decisions

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.020
we make.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.270
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: I love that.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.730
How we spend our time is
how we spend our life.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.650
So maybe we started with
your great awakening

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:48.042
by literally hitting
your head on a table,

00:18:48.042 --> 00:18:49.750
and you went into it
trying to figure out

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.660
what everybody can do from
a business responsibility

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.860
perspective.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.530
I want to bring it back to you.

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.500
This has been an
amazing journey.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.390
First of all, thank
you for applying

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:05.480
your incredible journalistic
mindset to this problem.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.070
It's been an incredible
journey in learning this.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:12.040
What were the surprises
for you, individually,

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.490
in getting to this place?

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.530
Did you slip off the
bandwagon, as they say,

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:22.000
and did you have
to climb back in?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.290
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Well, I feel
so passionate about this topic

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.520
that I left the Huffington Post
two years ago to launch Thrive.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.400
And frankly, I never, ever
thought I would do that.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.770
Because Huff Post was
like a third child--

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.350
you know, two daughters
and Huff Post.

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:42.250
But I wanted to go beyond
just writing and speaking

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.900
about these topics
and actually do

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.530
something that helps
people go from perhaps

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:51.130
knowing what they want to
do to actually doing it.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.300
And what brought me to
journalism at the beginning

00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:00.140
was that desire we all have
to reduce human suffering.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.400
And there is a lot of human
suffering in the world that we

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.590
cannot really easily reduce--

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.970
when you I read the stories
of refugee children,

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.070
or children separated
from their parents,

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.420
or violence everywhere.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.890
But this is an incredible
cause of human suffering

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:25.300
that we can change simply
by changing beliefs.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:28.330
Because once you
eliminate the belief,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:34.780
which is unbelievably prevalent,
that all successful people

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.540
do it by being always
on and sacrificing

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:40.630
everything else to that cause--

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.940
once you eliminate
that delusion,

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:49.240
we are going to be eliminating
an incredible cause of disease,

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.630
of bad decisions, and
unnecessary mental health

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.080
problems.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.810
So that's an incredible cause.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.840
And that's really the very
ambitious cause of Thrive.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.990
And we do it through our
work with corporations,

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.270
and we do it through
the media platform.

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.080
But what we have found is
that the most effective thing

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.090
on the media platform is
not the data we collect.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.420
We collect all the latest
science on these topics.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.780
But what moves
hearts and minds is

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:21.820
the stories of very successful
people in the arena who

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.830
are living their
lives differently

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.880
as a result of their own
wake-up calls or epiphanies,

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.290
all very different, but
having a similar point

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.520
to my own epiphany.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.910
And actually, one
of your colleagues,

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.310
Philipp Schindler, the chief
business officer at Google,

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.310
had his own moment of epiphany
that he wrote about on Thrive,

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:47.990
which I love, which was
that he came from a trip,

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.010
and he has young children,
and he told his children,

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:53.500
Daddy is taking you
to the playground.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.930
And his five-year-old
said to him, oh, no,

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.390
can't the babysitter take us?

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:00.640
And he asked why.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.700
And his son said, because
when you're in the playground,

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.280
you're always on your phone.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.800
So that was his moment of
epiphany, when he decided,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.640
I'm busy.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.757
I travel a lot.

00:22:12.757 --> 00:22:14.340
When I'm going to
be with my children,

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.510
I'm going to be
with my children.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.250
And I'm not going
to be on my phone.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.080
And then after he
wrote about it,

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.460
he told me what an impact
it had in his own org.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.580
And I know it had an
incredible impact among people

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.840
who simply admired him.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.010
People need permission to
make these little changes.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.440
Because there is
a fear that, if I

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:41.430
get my foot off the gas
for even five minutes,

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.160
I'm not going to
be able to succeed.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.250
It's a very deep-seated fear.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.260
And so when we
collect the stories

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.030
of very successful people--

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.070
Jeff Bezos wrote
on Thrive that he

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.880
sleeps for eight hours a
night because he says it

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.190
improves his decision-making.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.230
And he analyzed his
decision-making.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.930
And he wrote that, when
he sleeps for less,

00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.660
his decision-making is
5% to 20% less good.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.900
And the piece went crazy viral.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.630
And so we bring in
people in the arena

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.400
and have them write about what
makes them most effective.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.220
I like to out very
successful people

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.590
and the good things they do.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.710
Because we've heard so much
about very successful people

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.400
bragging.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:34.150
OK, the other extreme,
which is a teachable moment,

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.750
is Elon Musk.

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.050
He started a company
with this delusionary

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:43.150
believe that he has to
do everything himself.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.860
He has to sleep under his desk.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.650
He cannot see his children.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.480
But we see the result of that.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.720
We see that he tweets in
the middle of the night

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.630
that he got the funding
to take Tesla private,

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.550
which was not true, which
led to an SEC investigation,

00:23:57.550 --> 00:24:00.120
which led to him having
to step down as chairman

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.285
and being fined $20 million--
not a very good decision.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.030
I'm saying that
I love Elon Musk.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.250
I think he's brilliant
and a great visionary.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:13.770
But he's also doing an
incredible service now

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:18.300
by demonstrating the delusion
of the way he is working.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:23.040
And that may be just an
incredible gift to humanity.

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.250
I wrote an open
letter to him saying

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.040
all that out-- saying,
the way you are working

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.590
is unscientific.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:35.290
You know, you claim to
really have developed,

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.450
and you have a new way to
manage energy to for cars.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.970
What about managing
energy for humanity?

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.325
And that's why this is
such an exciting time.

00:24:46.325 --> 00:24:47.700
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
Well, no wonder

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.520
you're so quotable--
managing energies for cars

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:54.390
versus managing
energies for humanity.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.820
The meme in the valley, of
which you are well aware,

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.010
is that sleep is for the weak.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.170
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: Yes.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:01.920
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: And
you have picked that

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.520
as your cornerstone
of well-being.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.290
Can you talk about why sleep?

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:08.832
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
Yeah, we actually

00:25:08.832 --> 00:25:11.730
have eight pathways broken
down into micro-steps,

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.310
and sleep is one.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.410
The reason why there is
so much focus on sleep

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:21.660
is because, for so many decades,
it's been so dismissed and held

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.220
in contempt.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.880
And yet all the science
makes it very clear

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.160
that it's the
foundation of health--

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.900
not just of our physical
health, but our brain health.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.200
And a lot of that
research was done

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.360
nearby here at Stanford, where
the first scientific sleep

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.460
center was founded,
only in 1970.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:45.830
So it's a relatively
young science.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:50.780
But we now see that the way our
culture has been contemptuous

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:57.890
of sleep has actually led to
tremendous problems and bad

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:02.460
decisions and health outcomes,
including heart disease,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.820
diabetes, Alzheimer's.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.940
Because the bottom line
is that, unless you

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.010
have a genetic mutation--

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.422
and 1% to 1 and 1/2%
the population does--

00:26:12.422 --> 00:26:13.880
and you don't need
a lot of sleep--

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.400
I'm sure there are people here
who don't, and that's great.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.360
And you know it.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.980
You can also be tested.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:22.010
But I know that, if I have
three or four hours sleep,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.970
it's not enough.

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:27.290
So the majority of us
need seven to nine hours.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:29.060
I'm an eight-hour girl.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:32.610
And when I get my eight
hours, it's like, bring it on.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:36.510
Whatever the challenge,
I can handle it.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.980
And also, I'm not robbed
of the joy of life.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.920
One of the things that I know--

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.380
when I'm sleep-deprived, I
can still be transactional.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.430
We can still go through
the motions of our day.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:52.100
But something is missing.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.200
And I don't want
that spark to miss.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.390
Because as far as
we know, that's

00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:58.460
our only life,
although reincarnation

00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.680
is a very good possibility.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.460
And I don't want to
just get things done.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.080
I want to experience the joy
and the gratitude of the fact

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.710
that I'm doing something
I love and I believe in

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.143
and what a blessing that is.

00:27:16.143 --> 00:27:17.060
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Wow.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.430
OK.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:22.570
So given that this is
where you find yourself,

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.352
what's next for you?

00:27:24.352 --> 00:27:25.810
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
So what's next?

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.770
As you know, Thrive Global
is the name of the company,

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.230
not just because we
could get the URL.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:37.150
[LAUGHS] This is
a global crisis,

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.470
and the solution is global.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:44.050
So our first international
launch was in India.

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.680
We launched in partnership
with "The Times of India."

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.660
And I love what
we are doing there

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.370
in the middle of what is
a mental health, crisis,

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.870
especially among millennials,
who are particularly addicted

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:58.090
to their phones.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.680
We launched in my
homeland, in Greece.

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:03.230
And we launched in Australia.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.110
We are going to China.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.200
And we are launching
around the world.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.260
And in every big culture,
we are customizing

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.260
what we are offering with
the culture of the country.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.460
Because there is such amazing
wisdom in India, in China,

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.570
in Japan.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:25.800
And I think it's so important
to bring everything we're doing

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.740
and integrate it with the
culture and the wisdom

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.510
of the region.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:36.810
And for me, I'm just so
incredibly grateful when people

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:38.520
write and tell their stories.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.460
So I want to invite you
to tell your stories.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.970
Because that's how we
learn from each other.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:49.800
Whether it's stories of wake-up
calls, like mine or Philipp

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.090
Schindler's, or whether they're
stories of your own life hacks

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.950
and what you do to
be most effective,

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.550
please share them
with the world.

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:00.600
It's just an incredible service.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.980
And also, Yardley
would not forgive me

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.870
if I didn't say
that we are hiring.

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:15.290
We have opened an
office in San Francisco.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.400
Our headquarters is in New York.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.600
And we really want to grow
our product and engineering

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.440
team very fast, because we
have so many projects in line.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.390
And for the women
in the room, I'm

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:31.230
also thrilled to say that we
have a head of product who

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:36.060
is a woman in Yardley and a CTO
in Cheryl Porro, who is also

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.250
a woman, who just joined
us from Salesforce.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.360
So I'm very happy
to recruit men.

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.310
Let me make that very clear.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.490
But I also think
it's an amazing time

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:50.430
to be a woman in
product and engineering.

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:51.280
Look at you.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:57.210
And it's great to
be building a team

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:02.860
that we hope is going to add a
lot of value to people's lives.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.360
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Well, you
have some super creative people.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.000
I know you're trying
to recruit them.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.520
But besides recruiting
them, if there's one message

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:13.085
you want to leave them
with, what would that be?

00:30:13.085 --> 00:30:14.460
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON:
So my message

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:18.190
is that you are the
architects of the future.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.460
And what you choose
to do and where

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.830
you choose to put
your own creativity

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:30.890
and your own imagination is
going to change the world.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:35.230
So it's really incredibly
important, whether you're

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:40.330
running businesses or developing
or coding or anything at all,

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.950
this is a pivotal moment.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:45.700
The decisions we make everyday,
the products we build,

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.410
the businesses we build are
going to affect dramatically

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.140
the way we live and
the world we create.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:56.490
And I'm not at all
worried about AI.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:01.300
Because AI may become
more intelligent than we

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.490
are, but it will never
become more loving,

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:09.460
more compassionate, more
empathetic, or more creative.

00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:11.170
That's our competitive edge.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.061
Let's cultivate it.

00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:13.978
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Wow.

00:31:13.978 --> 00:31:17.786
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.450
Thank you so much for sharing
your wisdom with us today.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:27.930
I hope every one of
us will take this.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:31.770
At least for me, I think
that I will remember,

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:35.010
am I transacting
or am I actually

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:38.840
feeling the joy of what I
am doing with gratitude?

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.090
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: And can
you please write about it?

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.007
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Yes.

00:31:42.007 --> 00:31:43.480
[LAUGHS] Yes, I will.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.438
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON: OK.

00:31:44.438 --> 00:31:47.220
She said that in front
of many witnesses.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:49.810
So we are going to
hold her accountable.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.350
And what was it like
having here, on stage,

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.994
for 30 minutes, two
women with accents?

00:31:55.994 --> 00:31:59.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:00.313 --> 00:32:01.480
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: All right.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.570
With that, give Arianna
a very, very big hand.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.220
[APPLAUSE]
