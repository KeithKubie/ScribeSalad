[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:07.120
SPEAKER 1: Robert, thank
you for being here.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.590
ROBERT LEE: Of course.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.280
SPEAKER 1: We're
happy to have you.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.230
So as we just
learned in the video,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.860
food insecurity is
very personal to you.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.322
Can you talk more about that?

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:16.030
ROBERT LEE: Sure.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.210
Yeah.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.780
My parents were Korean,
from South Korea,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.990
and they essentially
moved over without really

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.250
knowing any English.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.325
And so my dad was
a civil engineer

00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:29.787
and my mom was a banker.

00:00:29.787 --> 00:00:31.370
But when they came
over to the States,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.200
that really didn't
matter because they

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.580
didn't know any English.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.340
And so I remember the
times when we just

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.030
are one huge bowl of ramen
for a meal for the whole day

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.880
because that was pretty much it.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.790
And you know, as I
mentioned in the video,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.414
you just think that's normal and
you just kind of live with it.

00:00:49.414 --> 00:00:54.120
But it was to the point
where I just hated ramen

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.500
because we just had it so much.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.950
But I grew up with kind of
that kind of environment.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.470
And my parents would
always tell me about how

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.990
any food that you--

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.960
I'm sure people have the same
experience in terms of stories

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.710
that they're told.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.220
But I was told that any
food that I would waste

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.480
would basically have to be eaten
in my afterlife all at once.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.260
So I kind of grew
up with the values

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.550
of never wasting food and
really cherishing food

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.630
whenever we had it.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.366
SPEAKER 1: Wow.

00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.070
Very cool.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.600
And you won a CNN Hero Award
and you're on Forbes 30

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.300
Under 30 Social
Entrepreneurs list.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.790
Your parents must be very proud.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.420
So what prompted you-- you left
a very secure job in finance

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.570
and you started RLC.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.180
What prompted that?

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.326
ROBERT LEE: Oh, man.

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:46.950
So many things.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.190
I think because the two
issues were so close to me

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.450
and so personal, I think having
the opportunity to kind of give

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.590
back in this way, in such a
direct and commonsense way

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.910
and efficient way,
and the opportunity

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.020
to scale a solution that was
such a huge problem, food

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.840
waste and hunger and all
these different kind of facets

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.520
of those two things.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.950
And while I was
working at JP Morgan,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.200
I kind of compared my
time of how much time

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.430
I was spending and what
impact that had at JP Morgan,

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.140
and the same amount
of time and impact

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.973
it would have had
Rescuing Leftover Cuisine.

00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:26.380
It was just two worlds apart.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.100
And I just couldn't
take it anymore

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.220
and wanted to do something
more meaningful with my time,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.730
and had an outlet to do it.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.460
So I took the opportunity,
took the risk.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.530
And yeah, it was great.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.280
SPEAKER 1: A risk
analyst who took a risk.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.780
I love it.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.930
It's great.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.530
Thank you.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.212
OK, so what was the
process of starting RLC?

00:02:49.212 --> 00:02:49.920
ROBERT LEE: Yeah.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.490
So starting RLC pretty much
came from way back into college.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.420
So during college was when
I came across the concept

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.037
of food rescue.

00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:03.120
There was a club that
brought leftover dining hall

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.410
food to homeless shelters
called Two Birds One Stone.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.550
SPEAKER 1: At NYU, right?

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.670
ROBERT LEE: At NYU.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.820
And it basically kind
of opened my eyes

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.550
to food rescue as a
concept, and to the fact

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.880
that food can be
donated, and that there's

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.590
so much excess food.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.920
So we were basically--

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.950
a bunch of us, a couple
of friends and I,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.190
were kind of executive
board members

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.830
of that club and kind of
expanded it throughout the four

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.940
years of NYU, because it
started out as just one

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.310
dining hall to one
homeless shelter.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.920
But eventually,
under our leadership,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.320
were able to grow it out to
all the different dining halls,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.560
and basically grow it out.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.127
And that kind of opened
my eyes to the fact

00:03:49.127 --> 00:03:50.460
that it's not just dining halls.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.860
It's also restaurants and
different food businesses

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.250
that can donate their food, and
that there's such a huge need

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.240
at homeless shelters.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.130
And so that first
experience paved the way

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.980
for the first inkling of an idea
of RLC at Two Birds One Stone.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.400
We kind of did everything
on a Google spreadsheet,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.650
coordinating all these
different volunteers and things

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.160
like that.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.089
But we had this dream of
having an automated system that

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.390
would connect excess food
to homeless shelters,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.170
and have volunteers be the
solution because during college

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.900
years, we had the time
to do a bunch of research

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.980
and figure out that
solutions to food rescue,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.090
in terms of food rescue, existed
and had really great impact

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.240
in terms of great work of
City Harvest and Food Bank

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.780
and things like that.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.990
But there was a little bit of
a gap of how much food there

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.330
was out there versus
what they could pick up.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.840
And so we wanted to basically
tackle that specific gap

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.000
and operate in that
niche with the model

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.760
that we kind of learned and
perfected during the college

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.580
years.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.360
And so we took all
that kind of together

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.570
and then entered into
a venture competition,

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.410
ended up winning
some seed money,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.150
and pretty much launched it
from there and kept on going.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.149
SPEAKER 1: Very cool.

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:11.940
So what's the biggest
challenge that you've

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.410
faced as a social entrepreneur?

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.620
ROBERT LEE: There's so many.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.610
I think-- in general, I
think the uncertainty is

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.270
the biggest challenging aspect.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.400
There's no way to
project in terms

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.822
of how many new food donors
we're going to bring on board,

00:05:29.822 --> 00:05:31.280
how much pounds of
food we're going

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.860
to be able to bring on board.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:40.990
But you kind of rely on
the different aspects

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.270
that you can rely on, like
how much time you put in,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.640
how much effort you put
in, how many volunteers you

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.840
can corral to the cause.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.720
And you basically
see what happens.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.710
Because of how local it
is and how small it is,

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.360
it's sometimes outsized in terms
of expectations of what you

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.680
would think you get out of it.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.980
But it turns out to be
really good sometimes.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.480
So I would say just
that uncertainty

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.984
is the biggest challenge.

00:06:13.984 --> 00:06:14.650
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.420
So let's talk about
food waste, which

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.910
is astounding in this country.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.680
We heard a few
stats in the video,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.320
but since you're the
expert, I would love

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.090
for you to talk more about it.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.872
Give us all of your
wisdom on food waste.

00:06:26.872 --> 00:06:27.580
ROBERT LEE: Sure.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.620
I think-- yeah.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.040
When you think about food
waste, it is just food waste.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.120
But when you think about
the different facets of what

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.380
that means, it's kind of mind
blowing because it's not just

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.380
about food waste.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.440
It's about the
environmental impact

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.530
of that food waste, the
moral implications, what

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.912
that food has potential
to do, as well

00:06:50.912 --> 00:06:55.000
as the actual economic
impact of that.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.330
So on the environmental
issue, people don't really

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.090
know that food waste
is one of the largest,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.890
if not the largest component of
solid waste in the waste stream

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.880
and actually lands in landfills,
where it basically contributes

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.550
to carbon emissions through
methane gases, which

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.260
is actually 20 times
worse than carbon dioxide.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.850
And if you take food waste
as a kind of a global emitter

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.390
of carbon emissions and take it
out as if it's like a country,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.090
it would rank third right
after the USA and China.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.070
So just as a kind of
environmental issue

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.060
after the fact of wasting food,
it's a huge kind of issue.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.290
But even going
before that supply

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.890
chain of actually wasting
the food, the amount of land,

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.715
amount of natural resources
used to grow that food is all

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.140
wasted as well.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.930
To grow the food that we
all eat in this country,

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.050
we use half the US land,
80% of the US fresh water.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.525
10% of US energy budget
is used to transport

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:59.220
that food in trucks and supply
chain and things like that.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.290
So all of that is wasted when
you waste 40% of the food

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.490
that you're producing.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.790
So it's the environmental
impact on both sides.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.780
And so when you
combine those things,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:16.566
it's a huge, huge,
non-negligible amount.

00:08:16.566 --> 00:08:18.190
And that's just the
environmental side.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.174
I mean, there's a whole bunch
of studies and things like that.

00:08:22.174 --> 00:08:23.590
And I think there
needs to be more

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.720
studies on the environmental
impact of food waste.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.110
But the NRDC does a really
good job of telling people

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.485
about the issue of food waste.

00:08:33.485 --> 00:08:35.860
And one of the other things
that they mention, obviously,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:43.090
is the fact that the potential
of food waste is huge.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.080
It's a $165 billion
dollar problem in the US.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.190
It's obviously an
economic issue.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.370
People are buying food
from the supermarkets

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:52.900
and then wasting it.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:56.577
You might as well just
not buy 40% of the food

00:08:56.577 --> 00:08:58.160
that you're buying
at the supermarket.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.491
So it's a huge
economic cost as well.

00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:04.240
Obviously, the US
energy budget and things

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.820
like that, that's
our taxes going

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.890
into food that's like going to
be wasted, like corn, subsidies

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:09.580
for corn.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.640
Why do we do that?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.346
Yeah, it's a huge, complex
issue, and implications

00:09:18.346 --> 00:09:20.470
that people don't really
think about when you think

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.480
about it on a deeper level.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.140
Obviously, along the lines
of potential food waste,

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.380
the food that's actually
going to waste obviously

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.520
can feed people.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.130
So people can be fed with that.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.980
And what's more important
than feeding people that

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.290
are hungry and need that food if
you're going to be wasting it?

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.420
And when you think
about the flip side

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.890
to that equation of
food waste and hunger,

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.600
49 million Americans
are food insecure.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.790
And I mention in
the video, if you

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.190
think about the nutritional--
and obviously poverty is

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.090
a multi-faceted issue as well,
and it's not just nutrition--

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.280
but if you think about
just nutrition, reducing

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.554
30% of the wasted
food and bringing

00:10:06.554 --> 00:10:08.220
that directly to the
people who are food

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.780
insecure would eliminate hunger,
which means that there's still

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:17.700
2/3 of food waste leftover that
needs to be reduced as well,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.560
which is why there's the food
waste hierarchy of reducing it

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.050
on source and then
feeding people, feeding

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.410
animals, composting, and
then lastly, landfill.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.880
But I'm kind of going on
and on about food waste.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.900
You know, it's just so much.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.300
It's so much.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.400
And it's a huge, huge issue.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.950
SPEAKER 1: So how do we
compare to other countries?

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.430
ROBERT LEE: The US
throws out a lot.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.750
The average that people say
is 40%, according to reports.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:54.440
On the worldwide level,
we waste about 30% of food

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.400
that we produce in the world.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.740
It's a lot.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.460
It's a lot.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.760
And US is obviously
a little bit worse.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.610
But it's interesting
because the US,

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.330
obviously, as one of
the developed nations,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.880
seems to waste a lot
more food on our end,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.210
on the consumer end, which means
there's a lot of education that

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.510
needs to happen in terms of
recognizing that food waste is

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.880
a problem, but also
doing something about it,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.040
and doing easy things that
can be simply implemented

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.920
in all of our lives.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.830
In terms of developing nations,
a lot of their food waste

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.730
is happening on the
agricultural-- on the earlier

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.620
side of the supply chain because
they don't have the technology

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.870
or they don't have the
resources to implement

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.780
the kind of systems that
they have in the US.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:46.490
So it's a shame, because
obviously the story that I just

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.760
mentioned about having
enough nutrition in the US

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.520
is the same.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.710
It's parallel across
the world as well.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.250
In the world, if we reduce
just one third of the food

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.620
that we have going
to waste, that

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:02.030
could be easily enough to
eliminate food insecurity

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.640
in the world.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.911
So we talk about overpopulation
and the fear of feeding

00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:09.160
everyone and things like that.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.840
But no one is thinking about
why not reduce the food

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.780
waste that we have going
on to solve that problem?

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.810
I mean, we don't have
to increase production.

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.120
We can just be more
efficient with the food

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.840
that we're already producing.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.140
I think overall, people
are becoming more and more

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.310
aware of the issue.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.550
And I'm glad that people are
starting to pay attention.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:34.580
SPEAKER 1: So is food
waste getting better

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.780
or is it getting worse?

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:36.887
Is it sort of the same?

00:12:36.887 --> 00:12:38.720
ROBERT LEE: I think
there's not as much data

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.600
as there needs to be in terms
of measurement and things

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.140
like that.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.420
I think even more
granular reports

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.780
need to be published
in terms of where

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.180
specifically in the supply
chain food is being wasted.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.660
But in general, it seems like
the problem of food waste

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.480
is becoming more and more
of a mainstream issue

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.220
that people are
caring about, just

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.490
in terms of the sheer number
of articles and attention

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.230
that people are
putting on food waste

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.960
has been increasing in the
past three or four years.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.570
We're lucky in that we
just started in 2013,

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:13.114
and it's been a huge increase
in the level of attention

00:13:13.114 --> 00:13:14.780
that people are putting
into food waste.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:17.450
So we do believe that
it's getting better.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.797
But there's still obviously
a lot of work to be done.

00:13:20.797 --> 00:13:21.380
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.090
So you've started RLC.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.920
So how is RLC
solving the problem?

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.082
How is it different than
other organizations?

00:13:28.082 --> 00:13:28.790
ROBERT LEE: Yeah.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.950
That's pretty much the number
one question we always get.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.540
But we started it in 2013
because, as I mentioned

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.780
a little bit earlier,
we started to notice

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:43.320
that there was kind of a gap or
niche in the food rescue space.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.050
And when we started thinking
about outside the border of NYU

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.150
and how food rescue
can be applied,

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.540
we did a lot of research into
City Harvest and Food Bank

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.970
and even OzHarvest in
Australia and things

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.650
like that to figure out what
solutions already existed

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.170
and what was happening
and what was working.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:06.230
And so we realized that,
at least for New York City,

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:09.120
the current solutions
typically had a minimum pound

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.630
requirement, where
they would not

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:15.150
go by for food that was under
a certain number of pounds.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.210
So we decided to
essentially target

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:22.100
that specific gap, that
niche market, and essentially

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.720
kind of use our solution
to that problem.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.985
So we like to think of
ourselves as different in terms

00:14:27.985 --> 00:14:29.360
of that minimum
pound requirement

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.330
because we don't
have one, but also

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:36.200
in the fact that we use a kind
of technology-driven process

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.840
by using a web
application code on Ruby

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.690
on Rails that basically allows
people to kind of sign up

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.940
online for any
pickup that they want

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.180
and crowdsource that
transportation problem,

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.130
that distribution problem
between the excess food

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.210
and the hungry.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.950
So yeah, there's a whole
bunch of other kind of things.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.960
I think one of the other
ways we're different

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.570
is that we are
much more scalable

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.900
and that we have this kind
of platform that can just

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.790
be kind of basically put to use
in different geographic areas,

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.110
not just New York City.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.230
And in other
models, you may have

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.510
to actually own
trucks, and own trucks

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.610
and operate trucks in
each different city

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.990
that you're running in.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:24.030
So we don't have
that kind of issue.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.430
SPEAKER 1: So with RLC,
there's three parties.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:31.350
You have a food partner or a
donor, you have the volunteers,

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.800
and then you have the shelter.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.730
So if I'm a food partner,
what does that look like?

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:39.270
ROBERT LEE: For a
food donor, we try

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.300
to make it as easy as
possible because it's

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.570
sometimes difficult
for food donors

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.880
to feel comfortable
about donating food.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.440
There's always so many stigmas
and myths around donating food.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.210
So we try to make it
as easy as possible,

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:59.170
and we cater to the
food donors' needs.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.480
So as a food donor, when
they partner with RLC,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.930
they're first asked when
they throw out their food

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.800
and at what frequency.

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.790
So for example, just thinking
about any coffee shop,

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:15.120
they may have pastries and
muffins at the end of the night

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.160
that they throw out when
they're closing out for the day.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.159
And so they can tell
us, hey, we actually

00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:25.200
have these muffins and
pastries that we throw out

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.180
every single night at
9:00 PM when we close.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.410
And what we can do is
essentially basically

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.010
ensure that we're there at
that time every single day

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.220
and make it super easy for them.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.367
Instead of throwing it
out into a trash bag,

00:16:39.367 --> 00:16:40.950
just put it into a
different container

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.900
that they can actually donate.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.930
We do the transportation, we
do all the paperwork and things

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.570
like that for them
and make it super easy

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.870
for them to feel the
impact and understand

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.660
that their food is going to
the hungry without actually

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.000
doing that much work.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.580
SPEAKER 1: You mentioned there's
myths about donating food.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.970
So you often hear that it's
illegal to donate food,

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.099
you can't do it, which is
why restaurants throw it out.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.569
But that's not necessarily
true, especially with RLC.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.262
Can you talk more about that?

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:10.970
ROBERT LEE: Yeah.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.619
The number one pushback
we get from restaurants

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.849
and other food businesses
is that it's illegal,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:23.730
which is unfortunately just
widespread for some reason.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.460
There's a Bill Emerson
Good Samaritan Act of 1996

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.890
that's a federal law that
basically protects all food

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:33.570
donors from legal liability,
except in the case

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.540
of gross negligence, which is
basically extreme carelessness.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:39.750
So as long as they're adhering
to all the food safety

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.230
standards and ensuring that
they are a licensed food vendor

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.370
and they know how to
handle food and donating

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:50.230
food in the right way,
there's no legal liability.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.390
Of course, if they throw
the food on the ground

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.280
and then donate, that's
obviously not the same thing.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:00.870
But the federal law
existed since 1996,

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.560
but all 50 states have
also passed state versions

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.430
of that same exact
Good Samaritan Law,

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.540
in some cases actually
helping to provide even more

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.790
additional protections
for food donors.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:17.640
So it's kind of insane to hear
sometimes from restaurants

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.410
that they heard
that McDonald's got

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.740
sued for some reason or
another about food insecurity

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:26.850
and people being sick off of
that food that they donated.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.060
And there's no legal case.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.330
There's nothing in the
case record about that.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.950
So it's just myths.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.530
And people have been doing
food rescue for over 35,

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.450
40 years now.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.650
And as long as we are all
adhering to the same food

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.170
safety standards ensuring
that the food is safe,

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:50.320
food can be donated and
can be completely fine.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.760
So yeah, I think that's
the number one education

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.060
point that needs to happen
for people to really start

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.410
understanding that licensed
food vendors, people that

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.080
can actually prepare the
food correctly and safely,

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.650
can donate that food.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.310
SPEAKER 1: Good to know.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:10.500
So it's so great
you have restaurants

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.660
that donate the food.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.610
Do you report back any data,
you know, letting them know,

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.751
this is how much you're wasting?

00:19:17.751 --> 00:19:18.750
Can you talk about that?

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.458
ROBERT LEE: Yeah.

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:23.010
So one of the benefits that
we provide for restaurants

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:26.550
is the data piece
because there's

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:30.560
a hierarchy of what
food waste should go to.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.430
I mentioned it a little bit.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:37.830
The number one thing is to
reduce it from the get-go.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:43.530
And for that, it pretty much
is thinking about creative ways

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.630
to use excess food
and things like that,

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:51.240
or just from the very production
of it, just don't produce it.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:56.430
And so we provide monthly data
in terms of days and number

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.460
of pounds on how much
food is being donated

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.730
and thus would have been wasted
if they didn't work with us.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.320
And what that
allows the partners

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:09.070
to do is essentially analyze
that data and see, oh, hey,

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:13.540
I did not expect that much
food to be going to waste.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.517
There's a lot of partners that
we've worked with initially

00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:18.350
that have given us
estimates like, oh, yeah,

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.970
it's going to be
about 40 pounds.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.380
And it turns out
to be 40 pounds.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.213
For the first two, three
weeks, it turns out

00:20:24.213 --> 00:20:25.559
to be over 100 pounds.

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.600
And that's because they're
just not measuring it.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.170
And just like any KPI, if
you're not measuring it,

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.240
you can't do anything
about it, right?

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.260
And so basically having
that monthly data allows

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.000
them to do not just looking at
and measuring out food waste

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.550
data, but also thinking
about, oh, hey,

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.410
every Monday or
every weekend we seem

00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.430
to have much more food
waste than other days.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.680
And they can use that,
internalize that, and basically

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.510
reduce it on their own.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:59.310
Typically food donors
want to, obviously, keep

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.769
every single sale
that they have.

00:21:00.769 --> 00:21:03.060
So there's always going to
be a little bit of food that

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.060
is going to go to waste.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.430
But we typically see the
numbers kind of start

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.270
to come down and
plateau over time.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.410
And that's one of the kind of
key things that we like to do,

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:16.710
is ensure that we're measuring
our food waste in terms

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.530
of our success metrics,
but also keeping

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.690
in mind that we don't
want to necessarily

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.670
have more pounds of food.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:29.460
We retain our main KPI
and main success measure

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.130
as the number of
partners because that's

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:37.400
the real measure of success in
terms of what we're thinking.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.150
SPEAKER 1: So before
we get to volunteers,

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.670
let's talk about the shelters
or the food recipients.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.730
What does it look like for them?

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.540
ROBERT LEE: So for
the food recipients,

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.040
they're typically
homeless shelters,

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.510
soup kitchens, food
pantries, community centers,

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.440
things like that.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.790
They're 501(c)3
non-profit organizations.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:59.880
And typically what happens
is, after we find a restaurant

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.160
partner that has a certain
number of pounds of food,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.770
and they give us an expectation
of what type of food

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.603
is going to go to waste
and things like that

00:22:06.603 --> 00:22:09.650
and can be donated, we
go and match that up.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.700
We have great, wonderful
staff to help us do this.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.890
And they basically
help match the food

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.830
to what food is needed at
the homeless shelters, soup

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.950
kitchens, and food pantries.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.140
And that way it can be a
regular, recurring food

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.460
item that can basically
offset the food that they

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.350
would normally buy.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.660
So they can expect it.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.380
They know how much, typically,
on average, it's going to be,

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.230
and essentially they can take
that out of the food budget.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:44.670
And so that kind of
partnership really

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.120
starts with the food donor.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.000
And on the food recipient
side, they receive it,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.650
they give us a receipt
that basically helps us

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.510
measure the number of pounds.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.990
And that basically goes
back to the food donor

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.552
and helps us
maintain our records.

00:23:00.552 --> 00:23:02.010
SPEAKER 1: And so
for the shelters,

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:05.850
their goal is probably that
they never have to buy food.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.851
That's the goal for them,
because they still do.

00:23:07.851 --> 00:23:09.183
ROBERT LEE: Yeah, they still do.

00:23:09.183 --> 00:23:10.373
SPEAKER 1: Have to buy food.

00:23:10.373 --> 00:23:11.456
ROBERT LEE: They still do.

00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:11.850
SPEAKER 1: Oy.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:13.260
ROBERT LEE: Yeah, it's insane.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.430
There's just so
much food out there.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.792
But it's always about
the right type of food,

00:23:18.792 --> 00:23:20.250
because different
homeless shelters

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.916
have different
requirements because they

00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:23.076
do different services.

00:23:23.076 --> 00:23:25.200
Like some of them do just
breakfast or some of them

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.960
do just dinner.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.130
And so bringing a bunch
of bagels to someone

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.190
that just does dinner
is not helpful.

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:34.640
So it's just making
that matching.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:42.360
And that's kind of where we
can make that matching happen.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.630
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:44.130
OK.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.630
So let's talk about volunteers
because without volunteers,

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.300
the organization
doesn't really run.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.510
I mean, there are other reasons.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:57.749
So what does it look like if you
are a volunteer, if you sign up

00:23:57.749 --> 00:23:58.290
to volunteer?

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.200
ROBERT LEE: So anyone
can go online and sign up

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.290
to volunteer at Rescuing
Leftover Cuisine.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:08.580
It's just www.rescuingleft
overcuisine.org/calendar.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.980
And there's basically a
list of all the events

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.930
that we have in your region.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:19.980
And essentially the
events or rescues

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:23.490
are listed in
chronological order

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.990
and in different locations
within your region.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.545
So for example, in New
York City, there's FiDi,

00:24:28.545 --> 00:24:31.410
there's Midtown, there's Upper
West Side, Upper East Side.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.390
And essentially
people can filter down

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.120
and look on a map view
as well and figure out

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.100
what time and location
they're available to help out.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.830
These pickups are
volunteer opportunities

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.380
that are really easy to kind
of fit into your schedule

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.947
because it's just 30 minutes
of your time to an hour.

00:24:49.947 --> 00:24:51.780
So you can do it easily
on your way to work,

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.740
on your way between
classes or between the gym

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.120
and other things, or
in place of the gym.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.110
And you essentially can
help make direct impact

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.820
because you're going
to actually see--

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:05.250
after you sign up you'll get
an automated confirmation

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.250
e-mails and all this, and you'll
get the contact information

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.540
of the person who's going
to be leading your event.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.970
And once you meet
with everyone, you

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.366
can actually see the actual food
that's about to go to waste.

00:25:16.366 --> 00:25:17.740
The restaurant's
cleaning up, you

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.030
get to see the aluminum tins
or bags and things like that.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.720
And you can actually rescue
that and walk it over.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.675
Sometimes it will be
15 minutes walking,

00:25:28.675 --> 00:25:30.550
sometimes it will be
five minutes of walking.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:33.010
Sometimes it will be
a little bit more,

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.140
25 minutes of walking.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.540
But it will be within
that neighborhood,

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.610
same neighborhood.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.270
And that's kind of what
I love about the model is

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:42.350
it's just local.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.980
It's just local restaurants
helping local homeless shelters

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:47.410
with local volunteers.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:48.345
And that's it.

00:25:48.345 --> 00:25:49.970
They drop it off,
they get the receipt,

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.210
and they upload it online
through the application.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.964
And that's it.

00:25:54.964 --> 00:25:55.880
They made that impact.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.510
They can see the people,
the line of people

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.190
outside the homeless
shelter that's

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.991
going to be fed with that food.

00:26:01.991 --> 00:26:02.740
So it's immediate.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:07.010
It's that impact
that they get to see.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.710
So for a volunteer, it's
typically super easy.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.520
If people want to get
even more involved,

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.970
they can be a lead rescuer,
much like yourself.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.940
And people can lead
on a weekly basis

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:22.300
and actually help
lead other volunteers

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.830
and take them through
the route and be kind

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.540
of responsible for that route.

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.820
So yeah, there's a lot
of ways to help out

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.540
in your neighborhood.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.700
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
I am a volunteer.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.586
I volunteer every week
with the organization.

00:26:39.586 --> 00:26:40.710
It's exactly what you said.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:42.910
It's just very, very simple.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:47.830
I found you on VolunteerMatch,
which is where every volunteer

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.170
opportunity is listed.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:53.270
And I just couldn't
believe it was that simple.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.240
And I think for people with
busy schedules, like all of us,

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.050
it really is perfect.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:03.230
And it's also a great way to get
exercise, to bring your friends

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.730
and do it.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:08.080
Everyone's trying to save money,
not go to the bar at night.

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.310
Bring them to a shift.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:16.990
Yeah, and it truly is 30
minutes to an hour door to door.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:19.840
But yeah, to bring the food in
and to walk it into a shelter,

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.990
and to see the people who are
going to eat it right there,

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:24.920
is just so wonderful.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.800
That's what I love about RLC.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.910
With other
organizations, I think

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:33.250
there's a long orientation
process, and a wait list.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.220
And this is just click,
sign up, show up,

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.680
and just kind of do it.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.160
Very, very simple.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.652
Couldn't believe
it was that simple.

00:27:42.652 --> 00:27:43.360
ROBERT LEE: Yeah.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.270
We try to make it
easy because we really

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.420
need as many people to
help with this problem

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.040
because food waste is happening
literally everywhere around us.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:59.210
And we're all just
moving all the time.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.450
And if we were moving
with excess food

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.699
and dropping it off while
we were going to places,

00:28:03.699 --> 00:28:05.240
it would just make
it so much easier,

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.710
and we could solve this problem.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.350
So we didn't want
that to be a barrier.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.920
And we wanted to give
the power to the people

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.760
to basically make a
difference in this problem.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.440
But of course, there's
the lead rescuers

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.300
to make sure that
people are not stealing

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.090
the food and things like that.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:25.190
But the lead rescuers
are kind of--

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.200
all the volunteers are kind
of the crux of this model.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.380
SPEAKER 1: And so
you've expanded.

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.580
So you started in New York
City and you've expanded

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.346
to how many cities now?

00:28:35.346 --> 00:28:35.970
ROBERT LEE: 16.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.425
SPEAKER 1: 16 cities
around the US.

00:28:38.425 --> 00:28:40.577
How is that expansion,
and what are the--

00:28:40.577 --> 00:28:41.660
ROBERT LEE: It's exciting.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.430
I mean, it's a lot of work.

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:48.460
It's exciting to see that
it's not just New York City

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.100
because New York City
is such a unique city.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.010
We started here.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.051
We're headquartered here.

00:28:53.051 --> 00:28:58.150
But it's very different
in other branches.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.160
New York City, you
can walk because there

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.650
are homeless shelters and
kitchens literally 15 minutes,

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.460
20 minutes away on
foot from places.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.880
And you'll never know it.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:14.800
But in places like other
cities, any other city,

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.970
you'll have to drive.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:20.410
And we had to figure out
what's the right model

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.770
to tweak the
technology a little bit

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.610
to accommodate for that
and things like that.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.290
But it's working
out really well.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.710
It's also very different terms
of the types of food businesses

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.750
that are outside
of New York City.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:39.670
A lot of the pounds of food that
we get are sometimes larger.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.180
But it's exciting.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:45.520
We currently are working
on a lot of the lower

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.030
end of the supply chain
in terms of restaurants,

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:50.170
retail businesses.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.830
But eventually, obviously
the food waste problem

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.400
is so complex that we
wanted to help out--

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.620
with the same technology
and the same system--

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.990
help out with any level
of the supply chain

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.500
wherever excess
food is happening.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:09.060
So it's exciting, but obviously
a lot of things to consider.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:09.870
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.140
If anyone has any
questions, you can line up

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:17.830
at the mics in the aisles, and
I'll keep asking you questions.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.270
So what can people do?

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.390
Of course they can volunteer.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:27.810
What other types of things
do you need help with?

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.900
I believe you got
a grant last year.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.670
What does your
organization need?

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.430
ROBERT LEE: So yeah,
last year we actually

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:38.184
got a grant from Google,
which was really amazing.

00:30:38.184 --> 00:30:39.100
Thanks again for that.

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:41.200
SPEAKER 1: It wasn't me.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.370
ROBERT LEE: But it helped
us develop our technology.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:48.660
And at the crux of it, this
is a technology-driven system.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.160
Without the technology
we would have

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.140
to have five more
staff members that

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.540
are coordinating and sending
emails and sending reminder

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:56.640
emails and things like that.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.685
But with this technology
we were able to scale it

00:30:59.685 --> 00:31:01.360
up and be much more efficient.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.570
So in terms of ways that people
can help, there's so many.

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.180
On the most basic level,
you can give time,

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.650
you can give resources,
you can give contacts.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.440
So on the time
side, obviously, you

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.030
can sign up as a
regular volunteer

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:21.480
and sign up whenever you want,
whenever you're available.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.684
And if you want to
invest even more time,

00:31:24.684 --> 00:31:26.850
you can be a lead rescuer,
you can be a core rescuer

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.020
doing 10 times a week.

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.010
And you can help us out in the
office with your skill sets

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:34.090
and things like that.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:37.380
And then on the resources
side, obviously we're a 501(c)3

00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.950
nonprofit organization.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.720
And so we basically depend
on monetary donations

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.270
to continue to grow and expand.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:50.460
We do have operations that
allow us to organically grow

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.460
in terms of having the
operations covered by

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.870
earned revenue.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.640
So any donations
that people make

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.720
are contributing directly to
the growth, which is really

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.640
why we have been able
to expand so quickly

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.930
over the past few years.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.290
So for example, last
year we doubled.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.450
The year before
that we quintupled.

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:11.910
So we were able to
do this because we

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.180
have the kind of model
that we can continue

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.450
to be able to be sustainable.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:23.010
And then on the contact
side, we are an organization

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:27.150
that works with a lot of
different parties, restaurants,

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.340
catering companies, farms,
wholesalers, retailers.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.180
There are so many
different food businesses,

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.730
food-related organizations.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.640
There's food waste everywhere,
places that people don't even

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.100
think about like stadiums,
fashion shoots, photo shoots.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.430
It's just literally everywhere.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.555
It's not just the restaurants
and things like that.

00:32:46.555 --> 00:32:51.570
So contacts that people
have to these people that we

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.970
can basically set
up a relationship

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:58.110
and make it really easy to
donate their food is ideal.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.390
And obviously, on the
homeless shelter side,

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:03.060
if people have
contacts to places

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.960
where we can partner with
to distribute the food,

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.470
that's a huge help as well.

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.140
So lots of ways.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.060
But I would say number
one, just volunteer time.

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.320
Go onto our website,
sign up online.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.830
SPEAKER 1: It's so fun.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.022
You meet really cool people.

00:33:20.022 --> 00:33:20.730
ROBERT LEE: Yeah.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:21.771
Great way to meet people.

00:33:21.771 --> 00:33:23.430
SPEAKER 1: It really is, yeah.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.050
We have a question over here.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:26.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:28.650
So I think the work
you guys do is amazing,

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.629
and also it's in an area I
don't know that much about.

00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:32.670
So I learned a lot today.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:33.880
Thank you.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.530
I kind of had a question
around food insecurity

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:41.530
is not a problem like
medicine or something,

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.740
where a person needs
a one-time treatment

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.010
and then you've fixed them.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.990
You need food every single day.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.260
And so it is a
structural problem.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.874
And I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about some

00:33:52.874 --> 00:33:54.540
of the stuff you
mentioned earlier about

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:58.400
do cities have programs where
they do some food waste pickups

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.764
and stuff for shelters already?

00:33:59.764 --> 00:34:01.680
Or is that an area where
there is room for you

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.770
to expand from the
volunteer and nonprofit side

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.140
to policy advocacy at all?

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.890
ROBERT LEE: Yeah.

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:10.780
That's a really great question.

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.090
There's a bunch of different
levels to that question.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:16.469
But in terms of
what RLC is doing

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:20.909
to help with the food insecurity
issue, as I mentioned,

00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:22.949
food insecurity, and
poverty in general,

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:24.300
is a really complex issue.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.929
And nutrition is just
one piece of the problem.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.760
And food waste is going
to help contribute

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.500
to the overall solution
to that problem.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.150
And the way we see it
is the amount of money

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:39.159
that we can save the homeless
shelters from buying food,

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:42.270
they can use that money to have
much more long-term solutions

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.760
like job skills
training, shelter,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.110
and basic needs and
things like that.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:52.360
And we see ourselves as part of
the solution to that problem.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.280
So in terms of policy
and things like that,

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.550
we're really excited
about making sure

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:59.490
that food rescue becomes
more and more mainstream,

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:01.320
and hopefully even
required in the future,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.970
maybe, similar to what France
is doing and things like that.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:10.879
But it seems like that's
a bit further away,

00:35:10.879 --> 00:35:12.170
especially with current events.

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:15.890
But it seems like
policy is something

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:20.470
that's really important to
make this a requirement,

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:25.710
to make this at least much more
mainstream across food business

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:26.210
as a whole.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:30.408
So hopefully that
answers both questions.

00:35:30.408 --> 00:35:31.722
SPEAKER 1: Question over here?

00:35:31.722 --> 00:35:32.329
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:33.620
Thank you for coming out today.

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:34.970
ROBERT LEE: Of course.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.094
AUDIENCE: Obviously you're
founded here in New York

00:35:37.094 --> 00:35:38.210
and based here.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:41.450
You're talking about expanding
to other cities and whatnot.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:44.480
If somebody wanted to start
this same kind of program

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.350
in any other city, and still
go under your same brand

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:50.060
and be part of your
organization and your resources,

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.110
how would we do that?

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.402
Do you have franchising
opportunities or things?

00:35:53.402 --> 00:35:54.110
ROBERT LEE: Yeah.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.690
Basically I guess it's
kind of like franchising,

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.450
but it's for a nonprofit.

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:00.950
But it's the same
type of process.

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:04.520
We have a branch application
process that you go through.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:09.390
Happy to give out
that information.

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.300
The number one way is
to go onto our website

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.540
and contact us about
the opportunity,

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:18.510
or email us at info@rescuinglef
tovercuisine.org.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.670
And essentially
it's just kind of

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.300
to create a branch
in any area, you just

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.380
need to have a certain
number of people

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.720
that are dedicated to the
cause to grow the branch

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.980
and things like that.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:34.850
But yes, we require
help from people

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.300
that are local to understand
the local environment,

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.030
and do the research of what
exists and what's working,

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.867
what's not working
in that specific area

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:44.450
because the worst
thing that we can do

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.930
is duplicate effort
that's already happening.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:50.060
And we did a ton of
research in the beginning

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.290
to make sure that we
weren't duplicating efforts,

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.860
we were targeting
that niche market.

00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.150
And so we would basically
figure out that together.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:00.582
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:37:00.582 --> 00:37:01.540
SPEAKER 1: I'm curious.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:03.623
You mentioned that what
sets you apart from others

00:37:03.623 --> 00:37:07.580
is that you have this
technology component.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.830
Is there a bigger goal
for the technology of--

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:15.579
what?

00:37:15.579 --> 00:37:16.620
What does that look like?

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:17.328
ROBERT LEE: Yeah.

00:37:17.328 --> 00:37:19.426
There's so much we can do.

00:37:19.426 --> 00:37:20.800
Currently it's a
web application.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:23.090
And it's code on Ruby
on Rails, and we're

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.210
trying to push towards a
progressive web application,

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.710
which I think, actually,
is a Google thing.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.740
But what we would love to do
is make this a more mobile app

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:36.460
type of situation that uses
location settings, that

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.020
uses push notifications
and things like that.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.370
Right now we're relying on
texts and emails and things

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:41.870
like that.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:44.390
But push notifications
and location settings

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.060
would be huge
because as we scale,

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.710
as we have more and
more restaurants

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.810
and pickups, that
kind of randomly,

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:54.222
logistically in terms of
sheer number of volunteers

00:37:54.222 --> 00:37:56.180
and sheer number of
pickups that are happening,

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.180
there are going to be more
opportunities of people calling

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.575
out or not going to be
able to make the event

00:38:02.575 --> 00:38:03.450
and things like that.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.480
And if we had the
mobile capability

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.060
to basically say, hey,
you're in the area,

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:11.810
and have a push notification
that goes and asks those people

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:13.760
to basically cover
that event, that

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:17.240
would be a huge game changer.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.550
And there's so many
other things we

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:23.510
want to do with the
technology out there.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:27.930
There is also the
whole transportation

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:32.090
industry right now is
going through the automated

00:38:32.090 --> 00:38:34.110
transportation system going on.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.880
And one of the things
that we want to,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.600
and we're excited
about trying to pilot,

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:42.650
is figuring out how that kind
of automated driver situation,

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:45.290
or drone situation, can
be applied to food rescue

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.735
because it totally
can, and it could

00:38:47.735 --> 00:38:55.310
be a great solution to applying
technology to age-old issues.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:57.271
So yeah, there's so
many exciting things.

00:38:57.271 --> 00:38:57.770
Yeah.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.460
There is great potential there.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.190
SPEAKER 1: So in a perfect
world, no food is wasted.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:05.794
What happens to RLC?

00:39:05.794 --> 00:39:07.460
ROBERT LEE: Well,
see, that's the thing.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.437
I think because--

00:39:09.437 --> 00:39:10.770
I've always struggled with that.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:15.020
I think it's also because of my
background working at JP Morgan

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.580
and for profit.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.700
I think when I went to
the nonprofit space,

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.820
it was difficult to
have the right KPI.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:26.010
And I mentioned that number of
partners was most important.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:27.890
And one of the reasons
why we consciously

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.550
decided to go with a
volunteer-driven model

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.910
was so that we can scale
up and down as needed.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:37.400
If the restaurant
starts at 120 pounds,

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.210
we can have 10 volunteers
carrying 12 pounds each.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.190
But then if it goes
down to 40 pounds

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:45.530
and they're able to
reduce it on site,

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.170
then we can just
bring four volunteers.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:52.010
And so the way we see
it is we basically

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:56.420
can use whatever we have at our
disposal in terms of volunteers

00:39:56.420 --> 00:40:00.294
to accommodate whatever
capacity is required.

00:40:00.294 --> 00:40:01.460
But we're not reliant on it.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.950
We're not looking to have
a lot of pounds of food

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.320
so that we can pare employees.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.890
We want to be able to
remain nimble and actually

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.500
solve the problem rather
than perpetuating it.

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.000
Very

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.864
SPEAKER 1: Cool Any
other questions?

00:40:16.864 --> 00:40:17.865
All right.

00:40:17.865 --> 00:40:19.964
Well, if you have one call
to action or one thing

00:40:19.964 --> 00:40:21.380
you'd like to leave
with, and also

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:23.213
if you could remind
everyone of the website.

00:40:23.213 --> 00:40:24.350
ROBERT LEE: Yes, of course.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:27.780
So yeah, the number one thing
is going onto our website

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.590
at rescuingleftover
cuisine.org/calendar

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:33.430
and signing up for
your first pickup.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:37.280
It's a really great way to check
us out, go on to a delivery

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.442
and figure out what we do.

00:40:38.442 --> 00:40:39.650
SPEAKER 1: All day every day.

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:40.899
ROBERT LEE: All day every day.

00:40:40.899 --> 00:40:42.110
Seven days a week.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.190
The video said, I think,
10:00 to midnight.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.400
Now we do pretty much
like 8:00 AM to 2:00 AM.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.281
So no excuse.

00:40:48.281 --> 00:40:48.947
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:40:48.947 --> 00:40:50.371
It's 30 minutes.

00:40:50.371 --> 00:40:50.870
Yeah.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:52.536
ROBERT LEE: But yeah,
it's really great.

00:40:52.536 --> 00:40:54.590
It's a really great
way to help out.

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:55.540
SPEAKER 1: Robert,
thank you for coming.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:57.373
ROBERT LEE: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:40:57.373 --> 00:40:58.470
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.
