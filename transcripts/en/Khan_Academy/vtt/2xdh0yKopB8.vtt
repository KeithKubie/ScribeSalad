00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.350
- [Instructor] Let's
think a little bit about

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.910
limits of piecewise functions
that are defined algebraically

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.020
like our f of x right over here.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.890
Pause this video and see
if you can figure out

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.640
what these various limits would be,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.890
some of them are one-sided,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.500
and some of them are regular
limits, or two-sided limits.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.980
Alright, let's start with this first one,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.120
the limit as x approaches four,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.180
from values larger than equaling four,

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.400
so that's what that plus tells us.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.050
And so when x is greater than four,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.750
our f of x is equal to square root of x.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.750
So as we are approaching
four from the right,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.400
we are really thinking about
this part of the function.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.710
And so this is going to be
equal to the square root of

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.950
four, even though right at four,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.630
our f of x is equal to this,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.260
we are approaching from
values greater than four,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.380
we're approaching from
the right, so we would use

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.320
this part of our function definition,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.470
and so this is going to be equal to two.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.010
Now what about our limit of f of x,

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.420
as we approach four from the left?

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.440
Well then we would use this
part of our function definition.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.460
And so this is going to
be equal to four plus two

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.580
over four minus one,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.140
which is equal to 6 over three,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.210
which is equal to two.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450
And so if we wanna say
what is the limit of f of x

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.160
as x approaches four, well
this is a good scenario here

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.440
because from both the left and the right

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.760
as we approach x equals
four, we're approaching

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.340
the same value, and we
know, that in order for

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.120
the two side limit to have
a limit, you have to be

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.200
approaching the same thing
from the right and the left.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.460
And we are, and so this is
going to be equal to two.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.920
Now what's the limit as x
approaches two of f of x?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.560
Well, as x approaches
two, we are going to be

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.360
completely in this
scenario right over here.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.270
Now interesting things do
happen at x equals one here,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.770
our denominator goes to
zero, but at x equals two,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.930
this part of the curve
is gonna be continuous

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.640
so we can just substitute
the value, it's going to be

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.050
two plus two, over two minus
one, which is four over one,

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.010
which is equal to four.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.633
Let's do another example.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.770
So we have another piecewise function,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.030
and so let's pause our video
and figure out these things.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.670
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.670
So what's the limit as x
approaches negative one

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.660
from the right?

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.640
So if we're approaching from the right,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.920
when we are greater than
or equal to negative one,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.740
we are in this part of
our piecewise function,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.490
and so we would say, this
is going to approach,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.150
this is gonna be two, to
the negative one power,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.550
which is equal to one half.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.920
What about if we're
approaching from the left?

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.430
Well, if we're approaching from the left,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.130
we're in this scenario right over here,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.130
we're to the left of
x equals negative one,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.080
and so this is going to
be equal to the sine,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.010
'cause we're in this case,
for our piecewise function,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.330
of negative one plus one,
which is the sine of zero,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.440
which is equal to zero.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.860
Now what's the two-sided
limit as x approaches

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.690
negative one of g of x?

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.630
Well we're approaching
two different values

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.760
as we approach from the right,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.220
and as we approach from the left.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.190
And if our one-sided
limits aren't approaching

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.640
the same value, well then
this limit does not exist.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.030
Does not exist.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.740
And what's the limit of g of x,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.080
as x approaches zero from the right?

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.070
Well, if we're talking
about approaching zero

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.960
from the right, we are
going to be in this case

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.650
right over here, zero is
definitely in this interval,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.570
and over this interval,
this right over here

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.660
is going to be continuous,
and so we can just substitute

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.470
x equals zero there, so it's
gonna be two to the zero,

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.293
which is, indeed, equal
to one, and we're done.
