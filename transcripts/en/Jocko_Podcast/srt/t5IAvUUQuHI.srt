1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,130
What are things to look for when you're
debating whether to raise your voice or

2
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:10,060
yell do to those under you
being lazy or unmotivated.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,770
Y'All talk a lot about the importance
of self control and not just losing it,

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,900
but would you say there's a time and place
for raising the intensity while still

5
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:24,340
being respectful towards your guys? So
there you go. Yelling and screaming,

6
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,960
get some. Sometimes you gotta
just drop the Hammer. Jocko,

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,110
uh, yelled and screamed at us
all the time. Like, I've, I've,

8
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,310
I've talked about it on this, you know,

9
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:36,370
I think on the podcast we started talking
about all the time and the number of

10
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:40,780
times that Jocko screamed
and yelled at me zero,

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,270
zero times in all the years
that we worked together.

12
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:46,000
And I know I gave him a least dozens,

13
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:48,500
maybe hundreds of opportunities
to want to travel.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,850
He done that and he didn't do that because
he realized that it wasn't effective.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,830
So, uh, now listen, there, there is,
uh, there is a time where, you know,

16
00:00:56,831 --> 00:00:57,664
if there's a,

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,970
a major safety issue going on and you're
trying to get people's attention and

18
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:03,070
you want people to cease fire, uh, our,

19
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:05,560
you need to rally the troops where you
got to raise your voice and get people's

20
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:09,190
attention. Uh, and I think that's, you
can't be afraid to do that as a leader.

21
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:10,740
Certainly Times where I'd
say, Hey, life pictures,

22
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:12,970
get those Bobby's lined up for
there or stuff like that. I mean,

23
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:15,250
for sure that's, is that
yelling? Well, yeah,

24
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:19,780
I'm definitely raising my voice and
using a loud voice, but I'm not doing it.

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,430
Whatever with anger, it's just,
hey, you got to hear me. And so,

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,090
and also, you know, there is
times where you've got to,

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,660
you've got to pick up the intensity in
your voice so that people realize there's

28
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,370
something important happening, right?

29
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,390
There's just enough now you don't want
to yell and scream and get all crazy.

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,190
But to be like, Hey, I need vehicles here
now. Like that is different than, hey,

31
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:43,390
can you get the vehicles over here? Now,

32
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:48,250
those are two different things and you
I would react differently if I heard

33
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:52,300
those two voices. So yes,
now to go [inaudible] now,

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,460
no one that we're creating
a whole panic situation.

35
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,200
But that's a great point too, right?
And it's, it's kind of, you know,

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,480
never cry wolf story.
So when, when you're,

37
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:02,840
if you're yelling all the time,

38
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,920
how do you do these vehicles over here
right now when there's nothing at stake

39
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:09,620
and it's no big deal and it's
just a routine movement, you know,

40
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,300
then when you do that and you really
need it, then no one's paying attention.

41
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,910
They think, oh, that's just Lafe
yelling again into the radio.

42
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,330
So I think that's another reason why I
actually have seen Jocko raise his voice

43
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:25,330
on one occasion. And when there was a,

44
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,250
a serious issue that needed to be
addressed and you needed to get a person's

45
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,770
attention to show just how
serious of a situation it was.

46
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,670
And it got everybody's attention. It
got everybody's attention right away,

47
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:40,670
cause you never did that. And when you
did do it, it was like, oh man. Yeah, I,

48
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,900
and I was always tell that to
leaders, like being on the radio,

49
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,630
and this goes for being in a meeting,
right? If you go to a meeting,

50
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,970
if you're in charge of a meeting
and you talk the whole time,

51
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,940
and then you have something important
to say at the end, well that's great,

52
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,100
but it's not as impactful as when you
say very few things during the meeting.

53
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,390
And then at the end you
say, hey guys, listen up.

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,630
Here's what's going on with this. And
everyone, everyone pays attention.

55
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,500
So I've said this before, the less
you talk, the more people listen.

56
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,340
And that goes true here. The more
you yell, the less people listen.

57
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,450
And it takes away the opportunity.
If you ever do have to yell,

58
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,860
it's going to have zero impact.

59
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,010
So my blanket statement is used to hardly
ever have to raise your voice and you

60
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,080
should just barely ever happen.
