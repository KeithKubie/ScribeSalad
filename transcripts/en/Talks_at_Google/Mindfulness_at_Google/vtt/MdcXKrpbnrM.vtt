BILL DUANE: Good
morning everyone.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.670
Super happy to see you all.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.380
My name is Bill
Duane, and I look

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.390
after the well-being learning
programs here at Google.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.140
And we're here today to speak
with a friend and partner, Andy

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.980
Puddicombe, from Headspace.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.660
And the intention of today is to
mostly practice, and to try out

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.240
a number of different
styles of meditation.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.110
And also to talk a little
bit about meditation itself.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.680
But for the most part,
to actually get our hands

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.670
dirty, and get
into the practice.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.890
So I'd like to start
off by introducing Andy.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.620
Andy is the founder
of Headspace,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.600
which is a mindfulness
app that we

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.710
use in conjunction with our
in-person sits, and detachment

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.890
days and a number of
other meditation programs.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.810
And it's really been
remarkable, it's

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.010
been remarkable to get to
know Andy and his team.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.190
And also to get the benefits
of the Headspace app, which

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.970
probably some of you guys
have also checked out also.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.639
So in some ways, Andy
could be a Googler, right?

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.930
There's a lot of people here
with interesting and weird

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.640
backgrounds.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.380
I'm looking at my friend,
Mario, who teaches SAY,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.840
and on the side is a medical
doctor and has a Ph.D.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.510
In neuroscience.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.020
There's many other stories
like that in the audience.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.540
And Andy was a monk.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.600
You know, normally
it's like a technology

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.420
founder, monastic background.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.670
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: There are
a few clues, though, right?

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.969
BILL DUANE: So how long
were you a monk for?

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.010
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: So I
trained for about 10 years.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.390
First in the Burmese tradition,
and then for about five years

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.644
in the Tibetan tradition.

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:55.060
So I trained first
as a layperson,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.030
then as a novice monk, and
then as a fully ordained monk

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.520
in the Tibetan tradition.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.150
BILL DUANE: And then what
drew you into the position

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.610
that you're in now?

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.150
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Yes, so
I'd finished my training

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.180
at the monastery.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.930
You never really finish it, but
I finished a period of training

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.840
at the monastery.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.300
And I'd been sent
away to go and teach

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.230
meditation in the
Meditation Center in Moscow,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.640
of all places.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.010
It was as far away as
they could send me.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.910
And I was there and
a lot of ex-pats

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.090
used to come along to
the Meditation Center.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.660
And there was one
in particular who

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.610
was really keen for me to go
in and work with his staff.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.850
And it was in an oil company.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.730
Again this is in Moscow.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.850
And he d I'd love to have you
in, but dressed like that?

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.040
So I was in my robes, and
for all intents and purposes,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.970
for anyone not familiar
with Tibetan Buddhism,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.236
I was basically a
bald guy in a skirt.

00:02:54.236 --> 00:02:56.360
So he's all, we're never
going to get you in there,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.109
dressed like that.

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.895
And it got me
thinking, you know?

00:02:58.895 --> 00:02:59.890
What do I care about?

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.750
What am I passionate about?

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.375
Am I passionate about
the being a monk,

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.140
or passionate about
teaching meditation?

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.056
It was a really easy
choice to make, actually.

00:03:06.056 --> 00:03:08.300
So when I spoke to my teacher,
and I finished my time

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.432
as a monk, and I started working
more in that type of space.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:15.640
BILL DUANE: Now, I'm curious.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.770
When did you get the time to do
the voice acting with the Geico

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.130
gecko commercials?

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.220
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: See, I didn't
get this until this morning.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.570
They actually had to take me
through this, this morning.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.480
I said, what?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.945
And even when he
did play it, I was

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:30.630
like, what, that sounds like me?

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.250
Really?

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.909
BILL DUANE: Wait,
wait, am crazy?

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.950
When I first started
listening the Headspace app,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.575
I was like, shit,
that guys sounds just

00:03:37.575 --> 00:03:39.375
like the Geico gecko.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:40.040
Am I alone?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.546
Or is there anyone else?

00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:42.212
And I'm sorry if I've
ruined it for you.

00:03:42.212 --> 00:03:45.034
ANDY PUDDICOMBE:
So, I don't know

00:03:45.034 --> 00:03:47.200
if there's an especially
high adoption rate to Geico

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.280
insurance, so I've
been dropping in

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.050
throughout take 10,
take 15, take 20.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.507
You will buy our-- no.

00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:54.840
BILL DUANE: Subliminal messages.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.430
That's why the app is so
inexpensive for Googlers.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.555
It has subliminal messages
to get you to buy Geico.

00:03:59.555 --> 00:04:01.054
ANDY PUDDICOMBE:
Sponsored by Geico.

00:04:01.054 --> 00:04:03.140
BILL DUANE: I thought this
might go off the rails,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.473
but I wasn't-- I didn't think
it would quite so quickly,

00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:06.460
but fair enough.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.020
So, practice.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.490
I was curious who's
in the room, in terms

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.279
of practice experience.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.512
That will sort of help
us guide and curate

00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:20.470
what we're doing today.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.720
So who here is brand new?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.122
OK, awesome, welcome, welcome.

00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:26.830
Thank you for coming
to a tech talk, even

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.310
those who knows what
you thought it might be.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.100
We'll make sure
that this is geared.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.239
And how many people
have a daily practice?

00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:36.780
ANDY PUDDICOMBE:
Great, look at that.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.960
BILL DUANE: How
many people would

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.966
like to have a daily practice,
but aren't quite there yet?

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:43.090
Thank you for being honest.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.732
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: There's many.

00:04:44.732 --> 00:04:45.690
BILL DUANE: Super cool.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.862
All right, I think that gives
us a good cross section.

00:04:48.862 --> 00:04:49.820
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Great.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.240
Well, I had a teacher who
always used to say to me,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.590
unless you can
improve on silence,

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.300
it's better not to
say anything at all.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.789
And I thought about
that for today.

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.080
And I thought, it probably
wouldn't be that interesting

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.810
if we just sat here
for 90 minutes,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.334
and really didn't
say anything at all.

00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:10.250
It's an interesting kind
of balance to strike.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.010
Because we have
to say something.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.590
Right?

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.560
I think we can't just come
to meditation and just sit.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.310
For most of us that's
a bit of a struggle.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.726
And even when we
learn to do that,

00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:22.390
it then becomes a struggle
to do it every day.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.420
But I do think that
balance is important.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.952
There's so much
chatter around, I

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:27.660
don't know how you
feel about this, Bill.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.243
There's so much
chatter and discussion

00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:30.850
around my mindfulness
at the moment,

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.230
that we're at kind of risk of
creating so much noise in that,

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.790
that we miss out
on the very thing

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.140
that we set out to discover
in the first place.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.270
It reminded me of a chef.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.366
When I was much, much
younger working at school I

00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:44.960
used to work in the kitchen.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.935
And he was really
kind of a hectic chef.

00:05:46.935 --> 00:05:48.810
He used to run around
and make lost of noise.

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.530
Even when he was
pretty calm, he was

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.284
kind of running around, kind
of really stressing out.

00:05:53.284 --> 00:05:54.950
And we'd just be
standing there, cutting

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.390
the vegetables, same
old pace every day.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.900
And it was amazing.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.844
He was the only one
running around going,

00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:05.760
it's so noisy in here,
it's so hectic in here.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.610
And we'd just be, yes, chef.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.580
And just carry on with
what we were doing.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.320
And there's a
similar kind of risk,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.370
you know we read a
lot about mindfulness,

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.810
we talk a lot about it, but
we don't actually do it.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.810
And there's just one more.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.397
There's a little
quote from a teacher

00:06:23.397 --> 00:06:24.980
that I remember in
the Tibetan school,

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.210
and he was like,
of all the people,

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.970
of all those who think
about meditation,

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.710
very few people actually begin.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.360
Of those that begin,
very few continue.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.464
And of all those that continue,
very few continue to the end,

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:42.380
whether we see the end
as the end of our life,

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.230
or some kind of
lasting peace of mind.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:49.920
And so Headspace has really
grown out of that one quote.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.200
How do we get people
excited enough to try it?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.940
When you try it, how can we
keep you engaged in some way?

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.370
And then how can we make
that a lifelong practice?

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.210
So I thought today
we'd look at not just

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.940
mindfulness, but a few
different types of meditation.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.660
Because for me, that daily
practice-- mindfulness

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.320
is a fantastic way of
introducing meditation

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.550
to the West, I think.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.420
And the beauty of it,
it translates so well

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.260
into everyday life.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.780
So you have your daily
routine, your daily practice,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.020
your daily sit.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.550
But then you can apply
that to everyday life.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.890
But it doesn't necessarily
have to be the only way

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.630
to have your daily sit.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.290
And my own experience-- So
I spent about five years

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.560
training quite strictly in
the Burmese school, which

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.500
is very, very serious.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.390
And it's all just kind
of straight mindfulness.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.630
And it was wonderful, and it
was an amazing introduction.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.340
But for me personally, I still
felt like it hadn't quite

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.460
unlocked all the doors.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.240
I didn't necessary
find the warmth in it

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.570
that I'd been looking for.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.486
And I was introduced to
some other techniques,

00:07:57.486 --> 00:07:58.890
and that immediately did it.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.810
So it's really important to
recognize we're all different,

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.640
and all of us relate to
different types of techniques.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.480
So I though today,
still very down-to-earth

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.830
stuff, nothing too
wacky, nothing too crazy.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:14.870
But just looking at maybe
visualization and reflection

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.780
and just to see how
you get on with those.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.530
And these are all
things that are included

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.410
as part of Headspace journey,
so this isn't something kind

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.039
of out there or
separate from that.

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:26.580
BILL DUANE: Yeah,
really look at this

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.800
as trying out
different practices

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.049
in the laboratory of
your own experience.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.740
We know the research, the
directionality of the research,

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:35.750
is clear.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.320
That the more you practice
the more benefit that you get.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.559
And we know it's really
hard to practice.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:43.440
I mean to me, the
dirty little secret

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.690
of mindfulness and
meditation is that it works,

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.750
and most people don't do it.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.670
Therefore, this group
of people, which

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.420
is not only the
people here at Google

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.950
thinking about mindfulness, but
our partners outside of Google,

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:00.730
how can we help, how can
we support, how can we

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.700
be of service for you to
find a practice that works

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.910
for you, so you can do
this thing that we know

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.180
will bring benefit for you?

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.010
In this case, for this company?

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:13.990
And then for the people who
you meet and in the world,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.850
it all hinges in finding a
practice that works for you

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.340
and that you can
do consistently.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.370
So my invitation is to
take some joy in the buffet

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.650
you're about to
sample at, and also

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.780
feel OK with how this
experience lands with you.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.979
This is an investigation.

00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:33.520
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: A
meditation buffet.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.330
Never heard of it.

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.130
Only at Google.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:44.000
The stories of your buffets
are out there everywhere.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.950
What I'd like you
to do is to just,

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.770
and this is for no
particular reason

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.311
other than my own
enjoyment, I'd just

00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:53.410
like you to start with just
patting your head, if you can.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.480
OK, now you know
where this is going.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.430
OK, I'd just like you to start
rubbing your stomach, as well.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.750
All right.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.490
Now, if you can continue
that, try to keep it nice

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.780
and even, if you
can, patting the head

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.450
and rubbing the stomach.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.780
Now at the same time,
I'd like you just

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.460
to visualize your
front door at home.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.980
They start to notice how
everything's-- I'm already

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:21.010
starting to see a bit of this
going on, as you visualize.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.630
OK, just come back to
the physical movement

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.970
and then visualize
the front door again.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.410
Now to add to that, I'd like you
to just very slowly, quietly,

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.742
under your breath, just start
whispering your zip code,

00:10:31.742 --> 00:10:32.450
just to yourself.

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:37.350
(WHISPERING) Say it a
little bit louder than that.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.940
OK, and I'll be
back in 90 minutes.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.220
Now so now how many
of you found yourself

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.040
thinking about, I
don't know, what

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.930
you're doing later in the day?

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.799
No one.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:56.340
So something really
interesting here.

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.740
You weren't trying
not to think, you

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.660
were simply directing your mind
with a sense of playfulness,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:04.480
kind of interest, curiosity,
whatever you want to call it.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.570
And actually the mind
was quite focused.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.480
So the temptation
is, when we sit down

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.980
to meditate first
thing, right, this

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.354
is really kind of
serious, right?

00:11:12.354 --> 00:11:13.730
I need clear my mind.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.120
Right, focus.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.220
And of course, the mind
resists against that.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.340
You then start to
think a lot, usually.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.960
OK, so if you can bring that
same sense of playfulness

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.630
and ease and lightness
to meditation,

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.730
then it can make
a real difference.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.170
So we're going to start off
with just a short exercise.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.700
How many of you have done
Take 10 from Headspace?

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.380
Wow, loads of you.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.160
Great, so we're going to start
off with a basic exercise which

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.440
brings in a little bit of the
calming aspect, a little bit

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.510
of the focus, the clarity
aspect, just as a start.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.026
And we'll then move on
to some visualization

00:11:52.026 --> 00:11:53.750
and some reflection, as well.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:55.770
And I'll just pause
between each one,

00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:00.090
just in case you've got
any questions at all.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.532
Anything to add, Bill?

00:12:01.532 --> 00:12:03.365
BILL DUANE: Sounds good,
I'm excited for it.

00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:07.360
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: I'm sure you've
already turned your phone off,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.430
or put them on
silent, but if there

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.091
is anyone who wants
to double check,

00:12:11.091 --> 00:12:13.340
so you're not sitting there
thinking about whether you

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:17.410
should double check,
you might like to.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.430
And just get yourself
into a position

00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.150
that feels comfortable for you.

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:27.970
So you can do this either
eyes open or eyes closed.

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.630
I'm going to suggest
you do it eyes closed,

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.354
but it's just because maybe
a few less distractions.

00:12:33.354 --> 00:12:35.020
But it's entirely up
to you and whatever

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.255
feels most comfortable.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.490
I'm just going to
step to the side here.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.370
I'd like you to begin by just
looking directly forward,

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.560
directly ahead.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.260
Bill, you're on stage.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.070
So just a very, very soft focus.

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.610
So you're not staring
at any one thing.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.170
You can see out of your
peripheral vision, either side,

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.045
above, below.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:15.060
And just maintaining
that nice, soft focus.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.930
Just take a couple
big, deep breaths,

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.180
breathing in through the nose,
and out through the mouth.

00:13:22.896 --> 00:13:25.020
So as you breathe in through
the nose, just a sense

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.850
that you're taking in some
fresh air, feeling the chest,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:31.360
the lungs expanding.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.710
And as you breathe
out through the mouth,

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:39.100
just a sense of the body
softening a little bit.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.700
Just a couple more times,
breathing in through the nose,

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.454
and then out through the mouth.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.390
And with the next exhalation,
just gently closing the eyes.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:05.220
And as soon as you
close the eyes,

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:11.580
you're going to become more
aware of the other senses.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.860
To begin with, I'd like you
to become particularly aware

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.140
of the feeling of touch.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:23.170
The weight of the body
is pressing on the chair.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.130
The souls of the
feet on the floor.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:43.610
And the hands and the arms
just resting on the legs.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.710
Remember, even at the
beginning, just allowing

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:55.120
thoughts to come and go.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.780
We're just shifting
the attention

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.090
to those physical sensations.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.050
We're starting to notice
the space around us,

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.000
noticing any sounds.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.370
Noticing any resistance
to any sense.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.970
And then just gently bringing
the attention back to the body.

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:48.260
I'd just like you to gently
scan down through the body now.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.470
Starting at the top of the head,
take the next 30 seconds or so.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:57.215
Just to scan downwards,
noticing how the body feels.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.385
What feels comfortable,
or feels uncomfortable.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.080
And not thinking
about the feelings,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.910
just noticing the
feelings as you

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.575
continue to scan down
towards the toes.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.450
Before shifting the
attention to the breath,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.710
just take a moment, just to
be really clear in your mind

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.480
why you're doing what
you're doing right now.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.569
Just a sentence in your mind.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:16.470
A sense of why you're
doing what you're doing.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:26.329
And then just letting that
go, bringing the attention

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:29.270
to the breath.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.930
Now you may feel the
breath in your stomach,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.691
in your chest, diaphragm.

00:17:36.691 --> 00:17:38.190
If you can't feel
the breath at all,

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.675
just gently place your
hand on your stomach.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.290
And just notice, what
does the breath feel like?

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.360
Are the breaths long?

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.530
Short?

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.760
Is it breathing deep or shallow?

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:50.590
And just to help maintain
the focus on that sensation,

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.210
if you like, you can
just gently start

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.060
to count the breaths
as they pass.

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.850
As you feel the rising
sensation, you count one.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.280
Following sensation, two.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:07.700
Three, then four, just
up to a count of 10.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.120
Just try that a couple
times for right now.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.250
Remember, allowing
thoughts to come and go.

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.660
If you do get distracted,
as soon as you realize,

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.400
just gently bring the
attention back again.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.200
A rising and falling sensation.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:21:04.445
And just for a moment now,
just letting go of any focus.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.480
Letting the mind
be completely free.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.830
So for 10, 15, 20
seconds, just let

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:18.970
it do whatever it wants to do.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.470
Let it think, if
it wants to think.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.870
And then just gently bringing
the attention back once again

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.690
to the body.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:58.540
Starting to notice the physical
sensations again, the weight

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:10.900
of the body, body on the
chair, the feet on the floor,

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.875
the weight of the arms.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.830
You starting to notice
the sounds again.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:35.470
As you just become more aware
of the space around you,

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.600
and in your own time,
when you're ready,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.720
you can just gently
open your eyes again.

00:22:54.711 --> 00:22:55.210
OK.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.020
And everyone is back with us?

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:06.580
It was suggested, at one
point, that we do this session

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.027
immediately after lunch.

00:23:09.027 --> 00:23:10.610
Which I thought was
a really bad idea.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.540
Because I think right
now I'd be asking you

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:17.367
all to nudge the person
next to you to wake up.

00:23:17.367 --> 00:23:17.867
OK.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.630
So we're just taking a couple of
questions in between each one.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.690
One, as a way of
kind of just clearly

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.120
separating each
type of exercise,

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.350
but also quite
useful, just to get

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.917
some sort of immediate
feedback and comments.

00:23:33.917 --> 00:23:36.250
AUDIENCE: First of all, thank
you for the Headspace app.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.760
For me, having kind of a
structured obvious progression

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.960
has been a real difference
in whether or not

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.150
I could keep it going, versus
searching for YouTube videos

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.560
and trying to link
them together.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:50.620
And I work for YouTube, so
that's saying something.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:52.870
My question is--
And you're probably

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.321
familiar we have a few
other courses in Google,

00:23:55.321 --> 00:23:57.820
we have Search Inside Yourself,
and Mindfulness-Based Stress

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:58.860
Reduction.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.360
And as I started taking those
around the same time I started

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.360
the Headspace app, I
started having a-ha moments

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.677
about why we do certain
things within the progression.

00:24:07.677 --> 00:24:10.010
And I was wondering if you
could share some of the goals

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.970
or ideas behind the
structuring of it.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.020
Especially in the Take 10,
but I guess the first 15 or 20

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.520
of them.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:22.330
Why we're doing certain things
in the order that we're doing.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.610
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Yeah,
OK, within this exercise,

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:25.541
for example?

00:24:25.541 --> 00:24:27.040
AUDIENCE: Specifically
this exercise

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:28.140
would be perfect for the
group, since we all just did it

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.810
together.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.620
ANDY PUDDICOMBE:
For sure, for sure.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.720
Happy to.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:36.630
I think to begin
with, as I said,

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.720
very often we come to
meditation it's kind of like,

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.380
OK, I need to focus now.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.200
So to begin, when
we first sit down,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:46.570
the whole idea of this kind
of the spacious kind of focus,

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.460
is to remind ourselves
of actually the mind's

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.770
a lot bigger than we
often imagine it to be.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.260
So we're just trying to
set the scene and the tone,

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:55.240
if you like.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.730
The deep breaths
just help us kind

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.930
of ground ourselves
a little bit.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.050
And by reminding ourselves
of the physical sensations,

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.090
we start to feel a little bit
more grounded in the body.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.470
Very often our mind and
body is very separate.

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:09.290
We might sit at our
desk, typing away,

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.790
but we're thinking
about something

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.020
that happened last week.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.240
Or something that
might happen next week.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.159
So it's kind of bringing
the two together.

00:25:17.159 --> 00:25:18.450
There's then the focus element.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.200
By focusing on the
breath-- the breath

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.640
is the connector between
the mind and the body.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.810
By focusing on the breath, not
trying to adjust in any way,

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:31.080
we give ourselves a very nice
object, very flexible object,

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.280
to focus on.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.674
And the focus bit's important.

00:25:34.674 --> 00:25:36.340
But we also need the
relaxation element.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.470
And the interesting bit of
that entire exercise for me,

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.450
is the last like 10, 15 seconds.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.440
You know where I say, OK,
now don't try and focus.

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.480
So what happened?

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.400
That for me was like
the biggest a-ha moment.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.954
I can remember a teacher
of mine saying, OK, right,

00:25:54.954 --> 00:25:56.620
I want you to sit
down, close your eyes.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.650
Now I don't want
you to meditate.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.330
It was like something had
short-circuited in my brain.

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.400
I didn't know what to do.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.530
I said, what?

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.700
And so I sat down, and in
not trying to meditate,

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.610
I discovered meditation.

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:15.070
So it's there at the end
really as just a reminder

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:19.035
that we don't need
to focus too much.

00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:20.410
There needs to be
focus, but it's

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:22.380
a balance of focus
and relaxation.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.610
When there's a
sense of letting go,

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.940
then we generally
find the sweet spot,

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.500
where we're able to view
thoughts and emotions

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.140
without getting too
involved in them.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.160
So that's really kind of a very
rough outline of that process.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.760
And obviously the
Headspace journey

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.150
tries to refine and develop
that process over time.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.000
The biggest bit that
we try to incorporate,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.080
is bringing elements of
compassion, kindness, empathy.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.680
For me that's the
biggest neglected

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.000
part of the move of
mindfulness from East to West,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.750
is the lack of heart in it.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.450
It's understandable, it's become
quite clinical in some areas,

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.760
and it's appropriate that
it's become clinical.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.920
But for me, that is what
gives it its warmth.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.590
It's what causes the
transformation, the change,

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:15.940
most of all in the
relationships in our lives.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:18.380
Which I think is very important.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.380
BILL DUANE: I'd agree
with both of those points.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.010
The point at the end
about providing structure,

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.230
but not too much structure.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:26.670
Let's say hypothetically
amongst a group of compulsive

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:30.990
over achievers, there's this
sense of, am I doing it right?

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.500
there's this sense of the
moment of realization.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.560
A lot of time it's like, oh,
I'm f-ing this up, right?

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.910
My mind was wondering.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:41.190
So I think there's
that beautiful lesson

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.880
of having some
structure and realizing

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.280
the benefit of structure,
and then also not grabbing it

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.300
on too tight.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:53.227
And then the compassion
part, plus 100.

00:27:53.227 --> 00:27:55.060
I think part of the
reason why, particularly

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.520
in the corporate area,
it's a lot easier to speak

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.010
about performance and
cognitive ability,

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.220
and I think the science
of understanding.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.510
That cognitive part of
it as much in advance.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:10.280
And now is the time to continue
the efforts to do the research

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:15.280
on compassion and empathy, in
particular Meng helped fund,

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.040
with the Dalai Lama--
you know you're

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.790
sort of a philanthropic
baller when you're

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.110
going in on stuff
with the Dalai Lama.

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.710
created a department
at Stanford to study

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.390
the science of
compassion, so that when

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.780
we take these practices
to the greater community

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.300
we can do it standing on our
ground of science and data

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.270
in service of something that may
not seem directly scientific,

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.650
but is an absolute core part.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:46.540
So we're certainly--
This idea of practicing

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.820
in the spirit of compassion.

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.590
And to that end, I'm not
sure if Lindsay got this.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.530
There's a badge reader
over by the door.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:58.390
The [? gPause ?] program gives
$0.50 for every 20 minutes that

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:03.680
you sit to groups providing
meditation instruction for kids

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.930
in jail, and teachers being
taught to teach mindfulness

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:12.010
like this in their classrooms,
and also veterans with PTSD.

00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.270
So I encourage you
to badge in and have

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:16.540
this count towards that.

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:18.510
And therefore the
practice we're doing here,

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:21.830
in this very awesome,
privileged environment,

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.509
can also then create
benefit for the folks.

00:29:24.509 --> 00:29:27.050
So this is the way that we're
trying to have these compassion

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.844
practices also show
up in the real world.

00:29:29.844 --> 00:29:32.260
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: That's a
really nice, amazing initiative,

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.360
I think, by Google.

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.530
And there's something
you can do to impact

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.290
the people in your
immediate circle, as well.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.040
On v2, for those of
you that have already

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.080
made the transfer--
apologies for any bugs,

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.671
I'm aware there
might have a couple.

00:29:47.671 --> 00:29:50.970
I heard rumors.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.770
So those of you that have
successfully made the transfer,

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.800
there is a reward
mechanic in that now.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.520
But we've tried to flip the
game mechanic on its head.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.640
So you're rewarded for doing
a certain number of days

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.940
in a row, and you're then
given free subscription

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:07.770
to give away to your
friends and family.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:09.630
So it encourages a
sense of altruism,

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.800
but it also kind of encourages
your friends and family

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.820
to start doing what we all
know is extremely beneficial.

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.899
So it's a good thing to
have a look at on that.

00:30:22.899 --> 00:30:23.690
What do you reckon?

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.780
Do you want to do one
more question, and then

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.640
we'll do the next exercise?

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.380
Yeah.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.480
There's a mic just
on its way over.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.320
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Got to say,
you're looking man, Andy.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.530
As one bald guy to another.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:44.972
I assume there was no irony
in calling the app Headspace?

00:30:44.972 --> 00:30:45.930
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Sorry?

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.846
AUDIENCE: I assume there
was no irony involved

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:49.920
in calling the app Headspace?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.530
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: No obvious
irony that I'm aware of.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.710
No, none whatsoever.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.460
AUDIENCE: Silliness aside,
I've derived tremendous benefit

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.250
for using the app,
and I naturally

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.110
have a fairly
anxious disposition.

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:07.840
I've fought it all my life.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.490
My dad has chronic OCD,
and he visited recently.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:17.850
And I was like, Dad,
Headspace is dynamite.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.870
Even if you don't
use Headspace, start

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.120
meditating on a daily basis.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.440
You are a classic
example of a guy

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.640
who would benefit
greatly from it.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.390
And he said, I know.

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.330
I said, so Dad, when
are going to do it?

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.310
He said, I'm not going to do it.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:34.824
And I said, why not?

00:31:34.824 --> 00:31:36.740
He said, I'm afraid of
what I'm going to find.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.960
How do I-- I mean, you
can't bring a horse to water

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.950
and make it drink, but do you
have any suggestions for me

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.116
on how I might approach
the conversation.

00:31:50.116 --> 00:31:51.990
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Yes,
it's a really good one.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:55.760
It's definitely a story
I've heard so many times.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:01.190
People who know they
would benefit from it,

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.700
but are fearful of
what they might find.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.050
And often people who aren't even
in that bracket of experiencing

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:12.740
severe patterns of
thought like OCD.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:17.630
My own experience has
been, spending time

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.880
with that individual
and meeting them

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.070
where they are, is the
most important thing.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.074
So if they're in
one place-- yeah,

00:32:26.074 --> 00:32:27.490
I'm not really
interested in this,

00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.640
and we're in the other place,
you should really do this,

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.473
you should really do
this-- there inevitably

00:32:31.473 --> 00:32:33.990
is going to be some tension.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.940
For me it's like a dance.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.550
You go with them.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.090
Where are they going with it?

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:40.484
OK, why don't they
want to do it?

00:32:40.484 --> 00:32:42.900
So you go with them, and you
go down that story with them,

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.740
and you listen to them
and hear them out.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.640
And what I found very
useful is getting

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.980
them to not do meditation.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.150
Get them to say
quietly for 10 seconds.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:53.780
And see what happens.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.330
And after 10 seconds,
based on experience,

00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.430
was that terrifying?

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.490
And often, 10 seconds
feels kind of manageable.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:04.040
Doesn't feel too scary,
doesn't feel too threatening.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.860
OK what does 20
seconds feel like?

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.640
What does 30 seconds feel like?

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.910
I do think with some people
it's about building it up.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.400
And always it's
about experience.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.400
So if you go right back to the
very beginning of the tradition

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.360
of these teachings,
it's like try it.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.420
If it works for
you, then try this.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.020
Try that.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.190
If that works, you try this.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.670
So what is the smallest
unit we can get someone

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.210
to engage with to experience
that sense of trust

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:36.000
and confidence, so they can
then go on and try the next bit?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.320
And it is always unique
to every person, at least

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.680
that's my own experience.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.150
And we can put out an
app like Headspace,

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:46.440
but it is quite
generic by nature.

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.200
And so in situations like that,
definitely having a family

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.000
member or friend who can
help shape it a little bit,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.620
and help them
experiment with it I

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.560
think is a really useful thing.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.481
I don't know.

00:33:58.481 --> 00:33:59.980
BILL DUANE: Yeah,
I agree with that.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.990
And I think if
someone doesn't want

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.030
to meditate, that's
completely fine.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:04.957
That was me.

00:34:04.957 --> 00:34:07.290
People were just like, you
should really try meditation.

00:34:07.290 --> 00:34:09.560
I'd just be like,
forget you, hippy.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:10.330
Right?

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.194
It's clearly in
the same box as--

00:34:12.194 --> 00:34:13.610
and I apologize
if there's anybody

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.790
who's into this-- like
crystals, and auras.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:17.564
And I'm a scientist.

00:34:17.564 --> 00:34:18.230
I'm an engineer.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.951
That's not for me.

00:34:19.951 --> 00:34:21.659
And it wasn't until
I went to a tech talk

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:25.250
on the neuroscience of
emotion, and my own discomfort

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.429
and suffering was great
enough where I'm like,

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:30.110
OK, maybe this is for me.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.159
And I think if someone had tried
to force it on me before then,

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:35.960
it would have actually
driven me farther away.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.060
So I think that
saying, not for me,

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.429
is a perfectly
acceptable answer.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:43.610
This is difficult.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.580
This is joyful and rewarding
work, but it's also difficult.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:49.850
And I think it's
important for people

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:54.000
to make an informed choice
to engage with this practice.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.120
Realizing it's hard.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.950
So I think just saying, not
for them right now, is fine.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:03.780
And I firmly believe that
a big part of practice

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:07.670
is for the benefit of the people
who have to deal with you.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:13.260
And I know that a lot of times
the changes in how I show up

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:16.510
and how I am in the world, a lot
of times people will be like,

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:17.710
what happened?

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.585
A little disturbed that it's--
What was it like before?

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.530
And really they're saying, wow.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:31.260
It's not like reading about the
neuroscience, it was just like,

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.690
man, I really noticed you
just seem a lot happier, more

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:37.420
effective, the parts
of your personality

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.380
that most annoy
me are less there.

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.690
So working on yourself,
and showing up

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:49.270
in the world as focused, as
compassionate, as generous,

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:50.350
and as a good listener.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:52.870
These are all the things that
come out of this practice.

00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:54.620
Just work on that,
and then that's

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:57.550
the best billboard
for it, I find.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:04.270
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: So shall
we do another exercise?

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:08.470
How many of you have done
virtualization before?

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.935
Any kind of visualization?

00:36:09.935 --> 00:36:11.230
OK, not so many.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:18.620
OK, so I'm going to try to theme
the exercises today so they all

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:22.130
have a link between all of them.

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:24.650
The visualization we're
going to do right now

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:28.346
is still kind of body
based, if you like.

00:36:28.346 --> 00:36:29.970
And there's a benefit
to that, and I'll

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:32.700
explain why afterwards.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:35.340
I'm going to ask you
during the visualization

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.990
to imagine sunlight.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:40.790
Now this is really important.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.790
You can see there's nothing
weird or wacky about sunlight.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.820
Imagine bright sunlight,
streaming through the trees,

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.390
or whatever it might be.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:53.120
So if I talk about light
during the exercise,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.540
I'm not talking about a
bright white light or anything

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.340
like that.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.150
I'm just talking about sunlight,
just the quality of sunlight.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.410
It's warm, it's
open, it's spacious.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:04.470
There's something kind
of really useful in that.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.920
BILL DUANE: Any unicorns
in the visualization?

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.110
Is the light coming
from the unicorn?

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:11.318
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: I think
unicorn comes in, yeah, it's

00:37:11.318 --> 00:37:12.910
about two thirds
of the way through.

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:14.660
But that's OK, I'll
just slip it in there.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:17.160
It comes right
after the Geico bit.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.400
Is he a lizard or something?

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.800
I can't remember what he is.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.792
All right, has anyone struggled
with visualization before?

00:37:22.792 --> 00:37:24.250
People who have
tried it, or anyone

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:26.360
here who thinks they
can't visualize?

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.790
Because quite often
there are some people.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:35.320
OK, so if you could just
think back to something,

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.430
a pleasant experience
from last weekend.

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.680
If you didn't have a pleasant
experience last weekend,

00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.670
you can go back to the
weekend before then.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.310
Go back as far as you need to.

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:46.970
Maybe it was with
friends, with family.

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:51.110
Just remembering
a nice situation.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:52.880
Maybe you were outside
having a barbecue,

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.171
or out for a walk or something.

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.530
Everyone think of something?

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:03.290
Yeah?

00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:04.780
OK, all right.

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.700
It's that amount
of effort that's

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.920
required for visualization.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.370
Just imagining something.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:14.290
In fact, imagination could be
another word for visualization.

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:17.650
There's no kind of special,
extra thing that's needed.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.630
And often people struggle
with visualization,

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:24.470
because there's a little bit too
much effort that goes into it.

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:26.910
So I'd just like you to do
another thing for me now.

00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.610
So that's something
you've already done,

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.430
so you might think,
yeah, well I'm

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:33.190
remembering that rather
than imagining that.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:36.890
OK, so just imagine a good
friend of yours standing

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.860
there in front of you.

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.680
And just get in to
do, I don't know,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.650
jumping jacks or
something like that.

00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:47.120
Whenever, you ask them
to do anything they like.

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.910
Just get them to do
some physical movement

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.950
in front of you.

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:52.810
Everyone imagine that.

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:53.570
Yeah?

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.150
OK.

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:56.646
So again, it's something I'm
assuming it hasn't happened,

00:38:56.646 --> 00:38:58.020
maybe it did happen
last weekend.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.311
Maybe that's part of the thing.

00:38:59.311 --> 00:39:00.150
I don't know.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.260
But I'm assuming it
hasn't, and yet it's

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.880
quite easy to turn
you mind towards that.

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.130
Just that very kind
of gentle imagination

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:12.890
is really all that's
required here.

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:14.770
So again, I'm going to
lead you through it.

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.490
These exercises, I know,
they're quite guided.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.290
There's quite a lot
commentary through it.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.120
We'll talk a little
bit afterwards

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.832
about how to yourself
off the commentary.

00:39:26.832 --> 00:39:29.290
But to begin with, I think this
is quite useful, especially

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:34.010
if it's a new type of
technical or exercise for you.

00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.720
So if you'd just like
to set yourself up

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:40.310
in exactly the same way
as you did previously.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.280
You're going to start
the exercise in exactly

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.940
the same way.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:48.290
So still looking directly
ahead of yourself,

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:52.890
not staring at any one
thing in particular.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.920
There's just that
very spacious sense,

00:39:55.920 --> 00:40:00.170
being able to see either
side, above and below.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:08.510
And when you're ready,
when you're comfortable,

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.870
just taking those
deep breaths again.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:15.980
Breathing in through the nose,
and out through the mouth.

00:40:19.659 --> 00:40:21.950
We're a little bit easier
this time, as you breathe in,

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:25.400
just a sense of the lungs
expanding as you breathe out,

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:27.670
a sense of the body softening.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:28.840
Just two or three times.

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:35.990
And then with the
exhalation, just

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:38.020
gently closing the eyes again.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:51.930
OK, and still taking the
time just to ground the mind,

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:54.960
be aware of the
physical sensations.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.570
The weight of the body
against the chair.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.728
Feet on the floor.

00:41:05.728 --> 00:41:11.072
Hands and arms on the legs.

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:28.390
Starting to notice any sounds,
either inside or outside

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:32.542
of the room,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:48.130
And just bringing the
attention back to the body.

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.950
Before we begin
the visualization,

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.750
just scanning down
in the same way

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:57.560
as you did before,
without any expectation,

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.140
without trying to
change anything.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.970
Just scanning from the
head down to the toes.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.590
If the mind wanders
off, just gently

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.680
bring it back again
as you carry on.

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.900
And just as before,
just touching

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.375
on the breath, just
taking 20, 30 seconds.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.640
Just to notice how the
breath feels in the body.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:35.670
I'd just like you to
imagine, for a moment,

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.340
that directly above
your head there's

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:46.220
a steady flow of warm sunlight,
streaming down into the body.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:51.310
And just the same way on
a very bright day, you

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.270
can see the sun streaming
through the clouds

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.540
or the trees.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.000
In just the same
way, streaming down,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.220
flowing down, into the body.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:08.110
And we're going to imagine as
though this sunlight slowly

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:10.760
fills the body up.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.630
And just notice what
happens as you move along.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.400
So I'd like you to
imagine it, streaming

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.270
down through the body, down
the left hand side of the body,

00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:22.180
down the left leg
and all the way

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.340
down to the foot and the toes.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.940
So it's almost as though
we're filling up a vase.

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:35.180
And you just watch as
the small toes fills up,

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:41.324
and the next, and
the next, next.

00:45:41.324 --> 00:45:41.824
Big toe.

00:45:41.824 --> 00:45:47.610
And it continues to flow
down, now filling the foot.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.670
Just that very warm,
spacious quality.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:58.435
Now moving up past the ankle
into the lower half of the leg.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:10.030
You just feel any tension
melting away, dissolving,

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:14.040
as it moves up past the knee
into the upper half of the leg.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:24.370
The gentle, steady stream
flowing down through the body.

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:30.770
Now all the way up towards
the hip and the pelvic area.

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:33.510
And before we continue,
just notice the difference

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:36.810
in feeling between your left
and right leg right now.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.840
But it continues to stream down.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:47.670
This time we go down the right
side, down the right leg,

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.980
into the right foot.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:55.140
Starting with the small
toe, just watching

00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:00.970
as each part of
the foot, each toe,

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:03.065
replaced by this very
spacious quality.

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:19.240
Filling up the foot,
past the ankle,

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:20.710
the lower half of the leg.

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:33.010
Just watching as it
continues to travel upwards,

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:36.770
past the knee into the
upper half of the leg,

00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:39.240
and just feeling any
tension melting away.

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:51.390
All the way up to the waist.

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:53.730
In just the same way as
with the other exercise,

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.360
if the mind wanders, let
it wander, no problem.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.200
But when you realize
it's wandered, just

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.670
gently bring the focus back
again to this visualization,

00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:09.890
this sense, this feeling
of warmth, spaciousness.

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:15.014
As you watch now as it
begins to fill upwards.

00:48:15.014 --> 00:48:23.460
The lower stomach, the lower
back, as though everything just

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:25.640
starts to give
away a little bit.

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:43.110
Upwards towards the diaphragm,
the middle of the back,

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:46.720
and up towards the chest,
in between the shoulders.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.970
Remembering where
that's coming from,

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.940
above the head,
still streaming down.

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.330
Dissolving any discomfort.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.860
It moves now up towards
the neck and the throat.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:19.260
Now coming down from above the
head up through the jaw area.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.015
Just feeling
everything dissolve.

00:49:27.687 --> 00:49:41.830
Up past the nose, the eyes, all
the way to the top of the head.

00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:44.090
And even when you get
the top of the head,

00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:50.040
even though the body is now
completely full of sunlight,

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.440
it still continues to flow.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.950
And it's as though it just gets
a little bit bigger, a bit more

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:02.860
spacious, going beyond
the confines of the body

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:04.477
into the space around you.

00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:12.790
You can either just
sit comfortably,

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:16.910
just for a few more
seconds with that feeling.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.730
Or, if you find it
helpful, you can just

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:22.910
imagine that continuing on
outwards in every direction,

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:27.260
as far as the mind
can imagine it,

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.457
and just everyone else
benefiting from that experience

00:50:30.457 --> 00:50:31.290
as it goes outwards.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:03.720
Now as with last time, nothing
really to do at this stage,

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:09.270
just allowing the mind
to expand outwards,

00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:13.755
enjoying that sense of
warmth and spaciousness.

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:33.490
And then just gently bringing
the attention back again,

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:37.030
becoming more aware of the body
and the physical sensation.

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:39.910
Still maintaining that
sense of lightness,

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:41.540
that sense of
clarity, but becoming

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.340
more aware of the weight
of the body again.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:52.970
More aware of the
feet on the floor.

00:51:58.980 --> 00:51:59.960
Hands on the legs.

00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:06.610
Noticing any sounds.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:23.630
And in your own time, when
you're ready, and just

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:25.790
gently open the eyes again.

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:42.600
OK.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.740
Any thoughts?

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:50.870
I don't mean any thoughts, I'm
sure there were some thoughts.

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:54.930
Anybody have any questions or
anything they liked to share?

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:55.509
Yeah.

00:52:55.509 --> 00:52:57.050
AUDIENCE: Just want
to reiterate what

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:59.851
you said about the Headspace
app being a way of doing it

00:52:59.851 --> 00:53:01.350
that I otherwise
wouldn't have done.

00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:04.370
I've even tried visualizations
with other sort of people,

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:06.660
and they don't sound
like my sort of people.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:10.380
Sort of having this
nasally, New England voice.

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:14.450
I don't think it's xenophobia
thing, but maybe, I don't know.

00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:16.870
So I really appreciate
checking in with you everyday,

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:20.300
my virtual, mental gym buddy.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.120
I really appreciate that.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.490
Bit when I'm doing
mindfulness, as

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:30.780
with Headspace where we try to
just sit there and be clear,

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.860
I can't help but find
that I get bored.

00:53:32.860 --> 00:53:35.630
I think MTV ruined
me in that regard.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:38.230
Whereas visualizations,
I feel like I can,

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:39.890
at least with this
one in particular,

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:40.900
I can just keep going.

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:43.950
And I don't feel like,
oh time is passing,

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:45.500
I should be doing
something else.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.757
I don't have to
battle those thoughts.

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:49.590
So is there a reason
why, the Headspace app,

00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:52.900
why you chose to not
go with visualizations?

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:56.350
Because it seems like it's
an easier entry point.

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:58.330
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:02.330
I think for some people
it's an easier entry point.

00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:05.600
I think not for everyone.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:09.580
The thing that struck me was
when I went into the Tibetan

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:13.101
tradition, I found there
was so many techniques.

00:54:13.101 --> 00:54:15.600
If I looked at it first, before
I went to the Burmese thing,

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.058
and there were too
many techniques.

00:54:17.058 --> 00:54:19.520
It was like walking into a
shop and being just paralyzed

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.020
by choice.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.436
And I was like,
OK, I'm just going

00:54:21.436 --> 00:54:23.560
to find something
really simple, actually,

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.424
where there's no choice.

00:54:25.424 --> 00:54:27.340
And when I went back to
the Tibetan tradition,

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.210
I found all these different--
it was really quite rich,

00:54:30.210 --> 00:54:30.950
actually.

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:32.870
I know it exists in other
traditions, as well,

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:35.520
but this was my only
experience of it.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.700
And every single one
unlocks something different

00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.240
for somebody else.

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.620
I'm not sure about
the entry point.

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:46.620
I actually think in
the West, particularly,

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:50.650
mindfulness is a
fantastic entry point.

00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:53.850
Because it's not threatening.

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:56.490
That one, that exercise we
just did, for some people

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:57.907
I know-- like my
mates in the pub.

00:54:57.907 --> 00:54:59.531
They wouldn't be
listening to me rattle

00:54:59.531 --> 00:55:01.620
on about on about
beaming sunlight

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:02.690
coming down from the sky.

00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:07.150
They'd be like, yeah, just
go and get another drink.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:09.020
And sharp.

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.140
So I think there is
something very down to earth

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.565
about the approach
of mindfulness.

00:55:14.565 --> 00:55:17.307
And I personally feel if we
can get the language right,

00:55:17.307 --> 00:55:18.890
and it's still
transitioning actually,

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:21.470
that we can start to bring in
all of these other techniques

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:26.680
and make them feel part
of our holistic approach

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.430
to meditation.

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:30.930
BILL DUANE: And I would
add that even the stuff

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:33.570
that you might not traditionally
think of as meditation,

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:34.580
like yoga, right?

00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:37.950
There's a lot of people for whom
they have an existing, maybe

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:39.910
they'll call it
secular yoga, there's

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:45.300
also the opportunity to
apply the same reflective and

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.200
contemplative frame
to that activity.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.130
And our friend Gopi here has a
lot of activities around that.

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:54.250
So if you're into
visualization, I

00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:57.250
think it's fine to seek
out those resources.

00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:01.200
If body movement is a way for
you keeping from being bored,

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.079
I think that's another
great way to do it.

00:56:05.079 --> 00:56:06.370
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Yeah, I agree.

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.170
That direction,
there is definitely

00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:10.650
like a visualization, it
tends to have a direction,

00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:13.010
so you feel like you're
on a bit of a journey.

00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:16.910
And so, for some people, and
sometimes and some situations,

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:19.510
it can feel much easier
to stay with that.

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:21.920
But the boredom bit, that's
a really important bit.

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.310
It's quite an exciting,
juicy bit in meditation.

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:26.750
It's underrated, boredom.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:29.220
Once you get to experience
boredom within meditation,

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.020
you're starting
to get somewhere.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.690
And it's a really,
really valuable thing.

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:35.180
I would just say be curious.

00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:37.720
Be interested in boredom,
and the something

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.770
kind of in that definition.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:43.740
BILL DUANE: To extend that also,
we spend so much of our time

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:46.020
desperately avoiding boredom.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.980
You know that urge
to pull the phone out

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:52.070
in the elevator,
other places, right?

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:54.640
To me, it's really
interesting to note boredom.

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:57.490
What's it like to be bored?

00:56:57.490 --> 00:56:59.430
It's almost like needing
to scratch an itch.

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.830
It feels weird to disobey
when you're bored.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:04.620
So I think it's a
great area to get

00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:06.300
curious about, because
if you can have

00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:10.742
some mastery over that
compulsion to occupy boredom,

00:57:10.742 --> 00:57:12.450
it unlocks a whole
bunch of other things.

00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:14.640
So we can either be
like, oh-- And as

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.840
usual there's a balance
to be had, right?

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:19.260
Sometimes If I'm really
bored, it's just tough to sit.

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.760
You just want to get up.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:23.250
So then you provide yourself
with a little more stimulation

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:24.951
so you can stay in the game.

00:57:24.951 --> 00:57:26.450
And sometimes it's
[? interesting ?]

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:28.449
to get curious about
what's it like to be bored.

00:57:28.449 --> 00:57:30.800
What's my relationship
with being bored?

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.190
For me personally, why
do I dislike it so much?

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:37.370
And there's a lot of the
usual thing of examining

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:39.600
a relationship to our
compulsive behaviors,

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.442
and boredom is a
huge field for that.

00:57:42.442 --> 00:57:44.970
For me at least.

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:46.730
AUDIENCE: My question
is, so I'm really

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:50.690
enjoying the guided aspect
of the Headspace app,

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:54.530
and I noticed the amounts of
silent time increase over time,

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:56.000
and that's great.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.316
I'm just wondering if you view
the guided stuff as a means

00:57:59.316 --> 00:58:00.690
to an end, where
ultimately we're

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.740
aiming for completely
silent meditation?

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:06.940
Or is that just a fine way
to continue, indefinitely,

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:08.730
having guided meditations?

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:11.245
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: I
would like to think

00:58:11.245 --> 00:58:14.010
that I'm not making
the decision for you,

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:15.960
that ultimately you
make the decision what

00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.900
works best for you, and
what you find most helpful.

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.810
I think it's something we
took quite a lot of-- Have

00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:23.180
you played around with v2 yet?

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:24.700
Have you had a look?

00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:25.290
OK.

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:30.400
So you'll see in v2, we've
included a whole series

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:33.090
of unguided meditations
in the single section.

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:35.460
So if you do decide,
wow, I've just

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:39.020
had enough of that bald
guy, there is somewhere

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.970
to go within the app where
you can listen to silence.

00:58:41.970 --> 00:58:44.321
Amazing.

00:58:44.321 --> 00:58:45.820
BILL DUANE: Like
the John Cage song?

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:48.094
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Genius.

00:58:48.094 --> 00:58:49.510
No, there's a
little gentle intro.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:56.300
Or, if you haven't
sat in silence before,

00:58:56.300 --> 00:59:00.190
and it comes back to not
really knowing what to expect,

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:02.510
or being fearful, perhaps,
of what might come,

00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:05.590
there's another whole section
in there called Headspace Pro.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:08.440
I didn't come up with
a name, by the way.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.230
And that's really about how do
you learn to sit in silence?

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:16.450
So in the first 10 days,
there's an introduction

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:18.090
to the type of
obstacles that tend

00:59:18.090 --> 00:59:20.250
to arise when you sit
in silence, so you

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:22.330
know what to expect.

00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:24.720
As you move into the
second lot of 10 days,

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.710
slowly I'm weaning you off,
and the periods of silence

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:30.430
are getting bigger and bigger.

00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:32.600
And then it's starting to
go into a bit more depth

00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:35.000
at the beginning and
at the end, looking

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.070
at the obstacles that arise.

00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:41.010
But the meditation itself, the
exercise itself, is in silence.

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:44.380
So that would be my
preference, where we're still

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.840
getting some contacts
and some teaching,

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:50.660
but we're learning to sit
and to enjoy the silence.

00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:55.110
Because we get to listen to
other people all the time.

00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:57.530
BILL DUANE: I think it's
important to not hold the idea

00:59:57.530 --> 01:00:01.600
that you graduate beyond
counting, or labeling,

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.360
or listening.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:06.879
Because something that
I find difficult is,

01:00:06.879 --> 01:00:08.670
when I first started
sitting, was this idea

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.700
of coming back to square one.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:12.850
That felt like losing to me.

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:15.350
That felt like screwing it up,
because you had this progress

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:16.960
and now you're
back to square one.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.460
Whereas in coming
back to square one

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.600
is actually the heart
of the practice.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.600
And sometimes,
even despite having

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.030
sat for a fair amount of
time, guided meditations

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.980
are really good.

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:31.780
Labeling, sometimes even
labeling out loud for me,

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.080
is really useful
during a time of storm.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.220
So it's not something
you graduate from,

01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:38.280
it's just that you
add other options.

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.070
And silence becomes
one of those options.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:43.080
There's not a damn thing wrong
with counting, or labeling,

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.760
or listening to a guided
meditation, either.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.730
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Yeah, and
I really believe that, just

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:53.170
in terms of over time, whether
we're talking about effort,

01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:55.155
or whatever it is.

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:56.590
It's always different.

01:00:56.590 --> 01:00:57.240
Every time.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.400
If our practice is
honest and open,

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.480
and every time we
sit down, and we're

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.650
simply present with
the mind as it is,

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.857
every single day
will be different.

01:01:05.857 --> 01:01:07.940
And it will be based on
what we've just come from,

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:10.750
maybe what we're going to, and
all these other kind of things.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.814
So we're always just
a little bit this way,

01:01:13.814 --> 01:01:14.730
a little bit that way.

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:16.730
Maybe adding a bit of this,
maybe taking a bit of that

01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:17.350
away.

01:01:17.350 --> 01:01:19.160
Foot on the gas,
foot off the gas,

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.280
and just finding that spot.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:24.300
And that's always
the case, I think.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:27.650
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
there is any tip or any way

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.580
to fight physical
uncomfort or pain.

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:37.640
I did Take 10 just
fine, sitting down.

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.970
But the transition between
Take 10 and Take 15,

01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:44.830
I find myself thinking at
the end, OK, I'm hurting,

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:45.880
I'm hurting.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:51.160
And if I shift, I basically
go back to square one.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:57.490
So I'm not sure if
I'll be the strength

01:01:57.490 --> 01:02:00.930
to do Take 15, Take
20, and go beyond that.

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:05.120
Or if I should go back
and stick to Take 10.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.510
I've tried sitting in
different positions,

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:10.260
and so far it's been
the same outcome.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.699
So I was thinking if
there's any tip for that?

01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:14.240
ANDY PUDDICOMBE:
OK, there's actually

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.940
some great tips in Take 20,
but that's a terrible thing

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:19.480
to suggest.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:24.980
As soon as you said it,
well that's what Take 20 is.

01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:28.930
It's all about settling into
discomfort, and how approach it

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:29.930
and how to deal with it.

01:02:29.930 --> 01:02:33.700
But don't worry, I'm not
going to suggest that.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:36.870
Does as the pain
continue after you get up

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.495
and you finish you meditation?

01:02:38.495 --> 01:02:40.120
OK, so that's a really
important point.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.870
So if it does, then there maybe
something about your sitting,

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:45.270
or there maybe something a
bit more structural there,

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.570
and you might want
to get that seen to,

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:49.230
or speak to someone about it.

01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:51.850
If it doesn't, there are certain
kind of pains and discomfort

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:54.152
which arise during meditation.

01:02:54.152 --> 01:02:55.860
And if you're really
cautious about this,

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.160
and if you are at all
concerned, of course

01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:59.800
you need to see your doctor.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.920
It's really important.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.004
But my only experience
has been, and I

01:03:03.004 --> 01:03:05.690
know the experience of many
friends is, when we sit,

01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:07.960
sometimes we
experience discomfort.

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.030
And there can be a
temptation or tendency

01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:13.880
to really want to move
away from that discomfort.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.190
It's like we just
can't bear it anymore.

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:18.250
But as long as
it's not pain which

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:20.030
is causing us
further discomfort,

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:23.630
there is some benefit
sometimes to sitting with that,

01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.340
and being interested in it.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.580
Again, it's a bit like
the boredom thing.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:32.000
Can we step back from it
enough to step out of that loop

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.014
where it hurts, physically,
and therefore our mind is

01:03:35.014 --> 01:03:36.180
like, oh, that really hurts.

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.920
And therefore it gets
a bit more tense.

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.660
And then the mind goes,
oh, now it really hurts,

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.118
I've got to stop,
I've got to stop.

01:03:41.118 --> 01:03:43.730
OK, if we can step out
of that circle and go,

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:45.560
OK, that's interesting.

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:49.780
What is that?

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.980
How does that feel?

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:53.130
What is the discomfort?

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:58.410
Is the discomfort either a heavy
dull feeling, is it a sharp,

01:03:58.410 --> 01:03:59.920
stabbing feeling?

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:03.870
Start to be more interested
in the feeling itself.

01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:06.720
And very often when we
do that, the feeling

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:11.100
starts to change and shift,
and our relationship to it

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.710
changes, as well.

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:16.480
So you might just want to have
a play with that, and just see.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:19.720
But if not, send
us in an e-mail,

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.577
put it as a title
heading, Andy's Answers.

01:04:22.577 --> 01:04:24.410
And we've got a little
section, because that

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:26.480
would make a really nice
blog thing, as well.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:29.179
So happy to add
some more to that.

01:04:29.179 --> 01:04:30.720
BILL DUANE: And it's
always a balance

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.680
between engaging with
the difficult to be

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.030
curious about it, and self care.

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:39.690
I really believe
everything that Andy said,

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.590
and I really had some
interesting experiences

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:44.120
with instead of doing the
automatic thing, which is ow,

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.090
stop it.

01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:47.640
More like, what's my
relationship to ow?

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.960
And then you actually build
up a much greater sense

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:53.470
of possible responses, other
than make it stop right now.

01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:55.620
But sometimes we don't
have that available to us.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.580
And it's important not to
turn this into an iron man.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:05.070
Like grrrrr, oh, I hurt
so much, this is-- No.

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:08.670
We started off with saying that
meditation provides benefit,

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:10.190
and a lot of people don't do it.

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:11.960
And if you set up
a situation where

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.314
it's so unpleasant
for you-- So I

01:05:14.314 --> 01:05:16.480
would say that it's important
to challenge yourself,

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:20.250
but also to have a sense of
balance of the challenge.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:23.210
If you find yourself not
wanting to sit because it's

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:25.990
going to be painful, you're
probably veering more

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:27.990
towards the overly
challenge. side.

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.323
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: I would say so.

01:05:29.323 --> 01:05:31.570
And just as on
from that as well,

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:33.630
I personally, I don't
have a problem--

01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:35.460
I know some meditation
teachers who

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:38.562
don't like the idea of lying
down or anything like that.

01:05:38.562 --> 01:05:40.020
Meditation was
taught traditionally

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:41.980
in four different
postures, and one of them

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.850
was lying, actually.

01:05:44.850 --> 01:05:48.290
If you do lie, try and do
it in a way that you're not

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:50.060
setting yourself up
for sleep, because it

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.190
is very easy to
drift towards sleep.

01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:55.720
So lie on a soft mat,
but on a firm surface.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.164
Have the knees
bent at 90 degrees,

01:05:58.164 --> 01:05:59.580
so you don't hurt
your lower back.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:00.560
Feet flat on the floor.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.120
And a very thin pillow
under your head.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.370
And see how you go, as well.

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:09.240
So I think you can be confident
in experimenting, a little bit.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.305
BILL DUANE: And even on long,
multi-day silent retreats,

01:06:12.305 --> 01:06:13.680
there will always
be a few people

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.110
for whom that's their posture.

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:17.240
And that's totally fine.

01:06:20.164 --> 01:06:21.080
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Cool.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.705
I know there's a
couple more questions.

01:06:22.705 --> 01:06:24.745
Have we got time for
one more quick exercise?

01:06:24.745 --> 01:06:26.620
BILL DUANE: Why don't
we do a quick exercise,

01:06:26.620 --> 01:06:28.620
and then also we have
the Dory questions.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.536
I want to make sure
particularly for the folks

01:06:30.536 --> 01:06:32.397
on video conference,
and for the folks here.

01:06:32.397 --> 01:06:34.730
Let's do an exercise, then
we'll do some more questions.

01:06:34.730 --> 01:06:36.271
ANDY PUDDICOMBE:
OK, we're just going

01:06:36.271 --> 01:06:39.010
to do a really quick,
not really quick.

01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:41.950
Not a hurried meditation.

01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:43.850
We're going to do
a short excise.

01:06:43.850 --> 01:06:45.390
It's reflection.

01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:48.930
Anyone done this type
of exercise before?

01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:51.640
It's where you're
asking a question,

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.830
but you're not
trying to answer it.

01:06:54.830 --> 01:06:57.950
Which is a challenge
for most people.

01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:59.940
But it's a really
interesting challenge.

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:02.860
And it's quite an exciting
space to get into, just

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:04.190
generally in life.

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:06.880
Not always trying to use the
rational intellectual mind

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:09.680
to try and answer stuff.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.540
So it's an excise I've
found really helpful.

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.020
It was described
to me a bit like,

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:17.570
we help create the
conditions, a framework,

01:07:17.570 --> 01:07:18.690
for a still pool of water.

01:07:18.690 --> 01:07:21.242
And then we just
drop the question,

01:07:21.242 --> 01:07:23.980
and we just sit back and watch.

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:27.120
Maybe something pops
up, maybe it doesn't.

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.550
No answer is OK.

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:30.420
We're not necessarily
looking for an answer,

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:33.090
we're just watching
to see what happens.

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.800
Sometimes it will
come as a feeling,

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.940
sometimes it will
come as a thought.

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:37.690
It's OK.

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:39.570
I'll talk you
through the exercise.

01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:42.364
But there's just one
little bit about this.

01:07:42.364 --> 01:07:44.030
And because the
intellectual mind always

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:46.441
wants to take over
the whole time,

01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:47.690
it's a really important thing.

01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:49.980
There's a guy that
came along to-- I

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.110
used to work at a
clinic in London--

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:56.070
and we were doing this exercise.

01:07:56.070 --> 01:08:00.760
And I said, OK, I can't remember
what the question was exactly,

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.970
it was something to the effect
of, what would you miss most

01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:08.400
if you weren't around anymore?

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.590
Now we did the
exercise together.

01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:14.010
And afterwards, I
said OK, how was it?

01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:15.020
And he told me.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:18.477
And he said, but I feel
really a bit uncomfortable.

01:08:18.477 --> 01:08:19.560
Do you mind if I tell you?

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.460
I said, well you don't have
to tell me what it was.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:23.600
And he said, no, I want
to tell you what it was.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:26.279
He said, look, you know
I have an amazing wife,

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:29.870
I have amazing kids,
I've got a brilliant job,

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.080
I've got my business.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.140
My life's incredible.

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:37.399
He said but, honestly the
thing that about the feeling

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:41.492
of what I'd miss most, is
my morning cup of coffee.

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:43.700
And so he said, I really
kind of struggled with this.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:48.040
I spent most of the rest of the
meditation thinking, oh, shoot.

01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.653
My wife?

01:08:49.653 --> 01:08:51.040
My kids?

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.560
Really?

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.670
So he felt really
guilty about it.

01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:58.140
There are no judgments
on what comes up.

01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.568
There is no right or wrong.

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:01.109
And actually when
we talked about it,

01:09:01.109 --> 01:09:02.984
it was really interesting
because his morning

01:09:02.984 --> 01:09:05.450
cup of coffee was his moment.

01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:09.460
His wife was still in bed
asleep, he got up very early.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:12.510
He didn't have to communicate,
talk with anybody.

01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:14.120
The kids were still sleeping.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.109
He hadn't yet got
in to his work.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:19.300
And he had those 10
minutes on his own

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.060
where he would just smell
the coffee, taste it.

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:25.060
It was kind of like a little
mini mindfulness thing.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.870
He didn't even know
he was doing it.

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:30.160
And yet, it was
that feeling-- when

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:33.319
he asked that question--
it was that feeling which

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.229
had arisen in him.

01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:37.029
And that's what
gave the feeling.

01:09:37.029 --> 01:09:39.180
This is more about
feeling than thought.

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:41.490
So don't think that
has to be like a,

01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:43.720
oh yes, I would miss
my mother-in-law.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.250
Or whatever it is.

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:45.870
OK?

01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:48.010
It doesn't have to
be like that, OK?

01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:50.420
It can just be
perhaps a feeling.

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.779
So we'll lean in that direction.

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:55.570
We're going to set up
in just the same way,

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:57.440
so take a moment
to get comfortable.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.190
If you've already done
a couple of-- I normally

01:10:05.190 --> 01:10:08.122
spend a little bit longer
on the set-up to this.

01:10:08.122 --> 01:10:10.080
I know I'm conscious we
don't have lots of time

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:12.310
as we've just done a
couple of exercises.

01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:14.980
We'll just move
through it steadily.

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.776
But you already know the
beginning part of this,

01:10:18.776 --> 01:10:21.400
of course, which is just
getting yourself comfortable,

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.140
eyes open, nice soft gaze.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.610
And just taking just
two or three nice big,

01:10:26.610 --> 01:10:29.910
deep breaths where you
breathe in through the nose,

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:31.020
and out through the mouth.

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:45.160
And on the next exhalation,
just gently closing the eyes.

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:53.460
You're already conscious,
aware, in touch

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:58.950
with those feelings of the
body on the chair, feet

01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:02.855
on the floor, hands on the legs.

01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:13.150
We're already starting
to notice the sounds.

01:11:27.126 --> 01:11:28.875
Now as you just turn
the attention inwards

01:11:28.875 --> 01:11:31.770
and begin to scan once more.

01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:36.170
Just take 20, 30 seconds just
scanning down through the body.

01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:38.410
Maybe it feels the
same as before,

01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:41.130
perhaps different this time.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.950
Just scanning down
towards the toes.

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:19.760
As you scan downwards,
just starting

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:26.340
to become more aware of the
breath and that movement

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.720
of the breath again.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:32.102
Just pausing to notice the
breath, if only for 20,

01:12:32.102 --> 01:12:33.875
30 seconds.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.700
Now just settling
the mind in that way.

01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:19.220
And I'd just like you to
ask yourself that question.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.920
The one we just used,
in the second person.

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:29.650
Now who or what would
you miss the most

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:31.220
if you were no longer around?

01:13:38.466 --> 01:13:40.090
And we just put the
question out there.

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:48.120
Perhaps something
immediately comes to mind.

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:51.180
If they're thoughts, just
let the thoughts bubble up,

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.190
that's fine.

01:13:53.190 --> 01:13:59.150
If it's a feeling that arises,
we just sit with that feeling.

01:14:03.854 --> 01:14:05.770
Feel present with that
movement of the breath.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.300
If nothing comes up,
that's fine, too.

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:25.274
We can just come back to the
breath again for a moment,

01:14:25.274 --> 01:14:26.440
staying with that sensation.

01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:43.140
And then if no particular
feeling arose the first time

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:46.180
around, without
forcing it, just gently

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:50.470
asking that same question again.

01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:56.717
Who or what would
you miss the most

01:14:56.717 --> 01:14:57.925
if you were no longer around?

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:20.870
And this exercise is about
the feeling, rather than

01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:22.700
any particular idea or thought.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.920
It's almost as though
we're watching the breath,

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:58.740
but the breath is flavored
with a particular feeling.

01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:03.840
And we just stay with that,
not wanting the failing

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:06.325
to continue, not wanting to end.

01:16:06.325 --> 01:16:14.830
But just watching it as
It arises and falls away.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:20.120
And if there's no feeling
whatsoever, that's OK, too.

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.430
Just staying with the breath.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.250
And then typically
in these exercises,

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:58.550
we work through a number
of different questions.

01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:02.050
But for today, I'd just like you
to gently bring your attention

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:04.840
back once again.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:09.870
The body to the
physical sensations,

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:15.610
back to that feeling
of weight on the chair,

01:17:15.610 --> 01:17:18.795
feet on the floor,
hands on the legs.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:26.800
And in your own time,
when you're ready,

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.150
you can just gently
open your eyes again.

01:17:36.370 --> 01:17:38.940
It's always a
tricky balance when

01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:40.900
you want to do a
meditation excise,

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.100
but there's not a lot of time.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.530
Didn't want to try and
squeeze too much in there,

01:17:46.530 --> 01:17:49.280
but hopefully enough
to give you a flavor.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.079
So typically there are
four, in an exercise

01:17:52.079 --> 01:17:53.620
like that, there'd
be four questions.

01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:56.150
And we'd work through
one after another.

01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:58.210
If you do more of
the Headspace packs,

01:17:58.210 --> 01:18:00.750
you'll come across that
exercise quite a lot.

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:04.340
It's used a lot within the
Tibetan tradition I trained in.

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:07.270
And it's really interesting.

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:10.150
One letting go is, I
say, is that ability

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:12.470
to-- of that instinct,
that impulse,

01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:15.610
to always try and
rationally work it out.

01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:18.650
Instead getting in touch
with feeling and instinct

01:18:18.650 --> 01:18:19.970
and intuition.

01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:23.040
Really, really
valuable for that.

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.290
But the kind of
questions that arise,

01:18:25.290 --> 01:18:31.930
or the feeling that arises,
is often very surprising.

01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:33.730
In my own experience,
and the feedback

01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:36.279
from people that use it, is
that they're often taken aback,

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:38.070
and they never even
knew they felt that way

01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:40.120
about the question being asked.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:43.700
So something to have a look at.

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:47.180
But Bill, I know you wanted
to go through some questions

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:50.140
before we wrap things up.

01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:52.620
BILL DUANE: Yeah, just a
quick few ones from the Dory.

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:56.960
The first one was
concerning interleaving

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.850
different kinds of practice.

01:18:58.850 --> 01:19:01.320
In other words, so you have
the skills and stuff that's

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.240
coming from Headspace,
and then someone

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.942
had attended a
[INAUDIBLE] retreat,

01:19:04.942 --> 01:19:05.900
was the particular one.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.880
So how can people combine
different practices

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.190
from where they are?

01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:11.630
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Did you
have any thoughts yourself

01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:12.980
that you'd like to share first?

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:14.140
BILL DUANE: No, curious.

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:15.890
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: OK.

01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:21.780
My only experience has been
that when-- it's important

01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.570
that we stay with a
particular practice

01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:27.960
for a defined period of time.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.210
It's OK to do lots of
different practices,

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:32.790
but as much as possible,
we need to stay

01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:33.870
with a defined practice.

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:36.680
And that can be as
little as 10 days.

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.370
But the reason I say
that is, otherwise

01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:40.600
it can become a little
bit pick and and mix.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.370
And it's like you're
doing an exercise,

01:19:42.370 --> 01:19:44.240
and maybe it becomes difficult.

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.310
So it's, oh, that exercise
really isn't for me.

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:48.050
I'll do a different one.

01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:49.945
And then we get into
this thing, where

01:19:49.945 --> 01:19:51.570
we're always jumping around.

01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:53.110
And we don't really
get the benefit

01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:55.960
from actually staying
with that, and learning

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.780
through that process.

01:19:57.780 --> 01:19:59.500
Because the difficulties
and obstacles,

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.710
they are the learning process.

01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:08.700
So I would just encourage you
as much as possible-- Maybe you

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.850
have your Headspace time
each day where you check in.

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:14.520
And that's in a way
compartmentalized

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:18.760
as an exercise, but you
feel the mindfulness

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.900
feeds into your everyday life.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:23.420
And equally isn't so
different, actually,

01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:27.350
from the community sittings
that you might have.

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:29.590
But definitely in
terms of techniques,

01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:32.339
I would try to stay with them.

01:20:32.339 --> 01:20:33.880
And that's why the
packs are designed

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:36.320
as they are, for
10 days or 30 days,

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.037
so that you do stay with that.

01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:43.467
BILL DUANE: The
next one is, I've

01:20:43.467 --> 01:20:45.550
been trying to use Headspace
for a few months now.

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:47.350
I'm currently in
the 15 days series,

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:50.170
but find myself spending a lot
of days without practicing.

01:20:50.170 --> 01:20:52.610
Better to go back to the
beginning, or picking up

01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:53.410
where I left off?

01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:54.580
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: OK.

01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:56.788
This is a really good one,
because everyone falls off

01:20:56.788 --> 01:20:58.560
to the meditation wagon.

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:00.600
It happens to us all.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.740
So how to get back on.

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:05.410
General rule of thumb, for
me at least with the app

01:21:05.410 --> 01:21:10.070
is, if you've missed more
than a couple of days,

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:13.480
I recommend going back to
the start of the series

01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.960
that you're on.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:20.410
I don't mean like on a 40-day
series, you go back to day one.

01:21:20.410 --> 01:21:22.760
It's split into 10-day chunks.

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:25.390
So if you've missed
more than a few days,

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:26.890
let's say for more
than five days,

01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:29.400
I would go back to
day one of that part.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.660
So you pick up the
sense of continuity,

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.340
the sense of teaching
that goes along with it.

01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:37.070
If you've missed more
than a couple of weeks,

01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:40.060
so we go back to the start,
day one, of that series.

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.830
And if you've had a
really long time out,

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:44.650
just to ease yourself back
in, go back to Take 10.

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:48.630
As Bill said earlier, there
is no regression here.

01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:52.000
Going back to the start doesn't
mean you're going backwards.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.810
It just means that you're
finding what works best for you

01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:56.350
at that particular time.

01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:58.800
So don't be shy
about going back.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:01.910
And I've met some
people who they've

01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:04.480
been doing the Headspace
app for a couple of years,

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.600
and I met some just
recently, and they said,

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.301
oh I'm still on Take 20.

01:22:08.301 --> 01:22:10.050
And I said, oh, do you
miss a lot of days?

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:12.196
They're like, no,
never missed a day.

01:22:12.196 --> 01:22:14.320
So I was doing the math,
and my math is really bad,

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:15.236
but I'm like, hang on.

01:22:15.236 --> 01:22:18.130
That's 45 days, two years--
And she said, oh, I just

01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:21.810
didn't want to move on until
I'd absolutely perfected it.

01:22:21.810 --> 01:22:26.330
So each to their own.

01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:29.289
BILL DUANE: So to wrap up--
and we can hang around here

01:22:29.289 --> 01:22:30.830
for a little bit
for questions, but I

01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:33.910
want to respect people
who have places to go to,

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:40.080
is the last note we wanted
to sound was an encouragement

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.770
to keep going, to
do this practice.

01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:46.010
As Andy was talking
about in the beginning,

01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:47.890
you don't get the
benefit, and the people

01:22:47.890 --> 01:22:50.330
around you in your community
doesn't get the benefit,

01:22:50.330 --> 01:22:55.240
from talking about practice,
but from actually practicing.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:58.630
So our encouragement,
our hope for you guys,

01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:03.040
is that this is sort of a
push into making a practice

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.440
commitment for yourself
with whatever works for you.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:10.160
I think Andy was recommending
that the Headspace app,

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.834
if you're new to it,
committing to do Take 10.

01:23:13.834 --> 01:23:15.250
ANDY PUDDICOMBE:
Absolutely, yeah.

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:17.070
10 minutes a day for 10 days.

01:23:17.070 --> 01:23:19.720
If you're completely
new to Headspace.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.470
That feels to me like a really
achievable challenge, or goal

01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:25.680
for us all, if you like.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.700
And if you're
already doing it, OK.

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.237
Commit to a pact, a 30-day pact.

01:23:31.237 --> 01:23:32.070
Have a look-through.

01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:35.580
See what calls out
to you, right now.

01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:39.719
And see how you can establish
that daily practice.

01:23:39.719 --> 01:23:42.010
Bill, I know I mentioned just
briefly earlier, but I do

01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:44.410
think that the buddy system
within v2, I'm really

01:23:44.410 --> 01:23:48.560
hoping that will
help people engage.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:50.890
If you've got close
friends or family,

01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:53.750
and you can let them know,
you can just e-mail them.

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:56.910
There's a little thing on the
app, as long as they agree,

01:23:56.910 --> 01:24:00.120
do they want to buddy up, you
can see each other's progress.

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.220
And you can give them a
call and say, how amazing.

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:05.710
I've just seeing you've
done 10 days in a row.

01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:07.510
Just want to say well done.

01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:09.494
You've inspired me
to do the same thing.

01:24:09.494 --> 01:24:11.410
That kind of thing makes
a massive difference,

01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:12.850
it really does.

01:24:12.850 --> 01:24:14.810
BILL DUANE: And
outside of the app,

01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:19.840
there is also daily
sits that are now in 26?

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.060
28 locations.

01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:23.620
That's pretty amazing.

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.220
So those are available
for you to be

01:24:25.220 --> 01:24:30.050
in meet space with other
practitioners here.

01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:32.900
There's also a
detachment day coming up

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.510
this weekend that
still has space.

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:37.376
OK.

01:24:37.376 --> 01:24:38.500
And then one on August 3rd.

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.640
So that's an entire day
of this sort of thing,

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.780
with a secular sort of retreat.

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:49.340
So [INAUDIBLE] go check out
those out in [? gPause ?].

01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:53.320
And I think that's about it.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.537
Thank you so much.

01:24:54.537 --> 01:24:57.120
ANDY PUDDICOMBE: Thanks so much
for giving up your time, guys.

01:24:57.120 --> 01:24:58.670
Thank you.
