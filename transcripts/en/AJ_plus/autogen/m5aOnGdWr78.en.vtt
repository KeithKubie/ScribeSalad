Murray has the cause and effect reversed

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300
Murray has the cause and effect reversed
 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.300
Murray has the cause and effect reversed
studies have found that exposure to

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310
studies have found that exposure to
 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.550

poverty leads to a significant IQ drop

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:03.560
poverty leads to a significant IQ drop
 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.860
poverty leads to a significant IQ drop
and so taking away welfare creates this

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870
and so taking away welfare creates this
 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.900
and so taking away welfare creates this
