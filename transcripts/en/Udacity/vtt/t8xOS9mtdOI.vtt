00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.380
Now let's move on to numerical summarizations. These are some of

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.600
my favorite. These are the summarizations you're going to want to use when your

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.455
boss says, "show me the numbers". These are the numbers you're

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:11.840
going to want to show your boss. And,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.880
what kind of numerical summarizations? Well,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.300
we've talked about it a bit already. We might want to do

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.080
a word or record count. And for a word or record count,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.850
which is something you've already done with the web server log

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.220
files, the [UNKNOWN] just outputs the thing you're interested as the key,

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.960
and outputs one for the value. The reducer then chugs along, sums up the values,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.070
bada bing, bada boom, problem solved. This is like the Hello World of map

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.550
produce. Slightly more difficult are things like

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.670
calculating the mean or the median, or

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.380
if we really want to get really fancy, the standard deviation of a set of data.
