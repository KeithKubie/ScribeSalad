Hey everyone, Trace here.

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.590
A Biologist and an Astronomer go to dinner.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.700
That’s not the start of a joke, but it is
actually how that astronomer got the inspiration

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.559
for a new way of thinking about the stars.

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.340
That astronomer was the University of Cambridge’s
Dr. Paula Jofré, and she realized that she

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.880
could chart stars in the milky way the same
way we chart the family tree of animal species.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.890
She and a team picked 22 stars (including
our sun) and observed their chemical makeup,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.199
their age, and their movement to plot them
on a stellar “tree of life.”

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.160
They found that the stars they looked at could
be plotted on three branches of the tree,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.680
with a few miscellaneous ones that didn’t
fit with the others.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.760
They can tell which stars are related based
on their chemical makeup, almost like their

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.390
stellar DNA.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.550
If they were born in the same gas cloud then
their makeup would be similar.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.650
This study found 8 of stars they looked at
were the sun’s siblings.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.760
The researchers also suggested some of the
stars may have originated from another galaxy

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.870
that was absorbed by the Milky Way.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.079
Of course, they only looked at 22 of 100 billion
stars, so maybe those 6 that didn’t fit

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.560
with the others have some long lost brothers
and sisters out there.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.090
The more they look, the more complete our
galaxy’s tree of life will be.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.920
Jofré’s goal is to get astronomers to think
about the history of stars in a new way, so

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.670
if you’re an astronomer don’t be afraid
to take a scientist from a different field

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.670
out to dinner.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.540
It’s not so much a tree of life as maybe
a spiral, which is appropriate considering

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.329
we do live in a spiral galaxy.

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.439

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.220
Has one branch of science taught you something
you didn’t expect about another branch?
