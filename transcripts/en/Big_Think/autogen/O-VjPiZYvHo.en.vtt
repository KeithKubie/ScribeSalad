00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.549
OÄŸuzhan, you asked, why is mathematics the
universal language?

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.430
And this is something I've actually thought
a lot about.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.369
Mathematics is in some ways kind of scary
in how useful it is at really describing how

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.830
the universe works around us.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.040
Now, to give you an idea, the origin of mathematics
seems very straightforward.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.880
We can count on our fingers up to 10, and
maybe it was useful to understand how many

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.880
sheep you had?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.210
So you could start counting sheep and then
you either added or subtracted sheep as you

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.270
got more or as you lost some.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.340
It was a simple thing.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.390
We learned how to count.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.880
We learned how to add and subtract.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.430
The idea of multiplying and dividing is a
little more abstract, but that also makes

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.430
sense.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.570
That's something that we can kind of visualize.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.240
But then what amazes me is that this led us
on a tremendously complicated journey that's

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.060
still going on to this day.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.830
And we had no idea where this would lead us.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.520
If you can do multiplication and subtraction,
it's not too long before you begin to develop

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.060
the basic building blocks of calculus.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.189
And calculus describes how moving objects
can change, how things can accelerate.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.329
If you want to describe an apple falling from
a tree to the ground or a ball rolling down

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.220
a hill, that's calculus.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.189
It's the mathematics of how things can change
over time.

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.170
That's really interesting, and the amazing
thing is it works so well.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.840
If you use these equations to predict how
a ball will roll down a hill, reality matches

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.840
that.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.850
It really does tell you how something is going
to behave.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.639
So now we've gone from counting on our fingers
how many sheep we have to being able to predict

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:46.679
what the universe around us is going to do.

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:48.810
That's incredibly powerful.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.319
Now we look around us and we see things like
planets orbiting the stars or the galaxy turning

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:58.609
around, and we realize those equations of
motion apply to everything else in the universe.

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:59.929
It's not just here.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.549
It's not just on the surface of the Earth,
but we can look at things literally billions

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.910
of light years out in space, and they're following
those same rules of mathematics.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.210
But now things got strange.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.209
We started to play with calculus.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.050
We started to see where it would go.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.280
What happens if you put in more variables
and you solve for more things at once?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.569
And we end up with some very strange abstract
concepts that turned out to be surprisingly

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.569
useful.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.980
One of the things that kind of worries me
is something called imaginary numbers.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.050
Imaginary numbers are numbers that don't really
make sense in our proper definition of mathematics.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.549
Take, for example, the square root of negative
1.

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.480
Now, in mathematics, if you multiply something
by itself it always turns out to be a positive

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.480
number.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.849
That's never a negative number.

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.520
But somebody said, what happens if we start
to do the mathematics of how an imaginary

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.209
number -- this can't be real.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.480
The square root of negative 1 doesn't make
any sense.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.030
But it turns out to be able to describe how
things rotate, and that became the foundation

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.870
of quantum mechanics.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.959
And here's the thing, now when you use a number
that shouldn't exist -- that doesn't make

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.299
any sense -- it predicts exactly how an atom
will vibrate, It will predict how quantum

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.489
mechanics at a very small scale runs, and
it needs a type of math that doesn't make

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.220
any real sense to us but it works.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.940
It works perfectly.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.120
So we keep getting led farther and farther
down this rabbit hole.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.120
Where does math lead us?

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.200
Now we realize that you can describe physics
incredibly well if you allow the universe

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.560
to exist in many different dimensions-- more
than three dimensions that we're familiar

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.560
with.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.430
In fact, specifically, if you want to do particle
physics, it requires 11 dimensions.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.340
That's not something our minds comprehend,
but we can do the math.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.450
We can do the math of how things would behave
if they could move in 11 different directions.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.879
And it turns out to predict exactly the results
we get from particle physics.

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:59.879
That's kind of scary.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.060
Does that mean that's real?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.480
Are there really 11 dimensions?

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.749
The math works so well, and the predictions
are so strong that it can't just be nonsense.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.329
But now we've gone to the limit of what I
can tell you; is it real or not?

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.450
Our math has given us something incredibly
useful, but it's taken us completely out of

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.190
our realm of common sense, of human scale
of how our minds work and even our sense of

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.190
space and time.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.130
I don't think that journey's over yet.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.550
Where is math going to lead us?

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.780
It may lead us to understand things like the
universe is a type of a hologram?

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.600
That was a mathematical solution to How things
work around a black hole, and it works really,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.010
really well.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.410
So I think it's wonderful and a little bit
scary that you start counting on your fingers.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.390
You get to 11 dimensions of space and time.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.620
And where else?
