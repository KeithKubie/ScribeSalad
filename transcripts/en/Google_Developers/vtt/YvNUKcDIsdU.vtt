MIHAI IONESCU: Hey, guys.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.090
We're back with another session
of Segments Live on

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.570
Google Developers.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.700
Today we're going to have an
Office Hours style session.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.520
We got a lot of questions on
Moderator and in the Groups,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480
so we're going to try to answer
as many as we can.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.505
But first, let's start to make
a few announcements.

00:00:39.505 --> 00:00:41.640
PENG YING: What's
going on, Mihai?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.440
MIHAI IONESCU: A lot of
stuff is going on.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.420
Last week we told you about
Google DevFest.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.180
The West Coast edition is going
to happen this weekend.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.130
And I'm going to switch
now to the screen.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.780
If you guys signed up, great.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.110
Unfortunately, it looks like
we are sold out for the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.876
Saturday and Sunday events.

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:05.990
PENG YING: Oh, it's sold out.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.740
What's going on?

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.460
Can you tell them a little bit
more about DevFest and what

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.520
we're trying to accomplish?

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.800
MIHAI IONESCU: It's going to
be very cool this weekend.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.920
We have a lot of talks
on Wallet.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.840
We have talks on various Chrome
APIs, Code Labs, so if

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.500
you signed up, you're really
going to enjoy it.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.455
And of course, there's
going to be a party.

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:26.810
PENG YING: Nice.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.590
I love those parties.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.510
MIHAI IONESCU: That's what
I'm looking forward to.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.935
PENG YING: I think people are
just coming for the parties.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:32.340
The Code Labs, eh--

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.830
no, I'm just kidding.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.700
It's a great way to
learn more about

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.240
different technical aspects.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.090
MALE SPEAKER: We noticed that
your computer is not sharing

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.210
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.945
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:47.050
Oh, so we'll fix that.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.140
MALE SPEAKER: So let's make sure
you're fully mirroring

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.230
before we continue.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.228
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:53.140
PENG YING: [INAUDIBLE] out.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.510
So how does it look?

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.166
MALE SPEAKER: Well, what we
could do, we could run the

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:59.350
[INAUDIBLE] again
and start again.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.230
PENG YING: Well is
it mirroring?

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.140
MALE SPEAKER: What we're
seeing, we see your

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.500
background.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.690
We don't see the rest of it.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.910
PENG YING: Oh, it's
not mirroring.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.200
It's doing the--

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.610
MIHAI IONESCU: It's on--

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.356
PENG YING: No, just-- it's--

00:02:08.356 --> 00:02:09.860
do you have the mirror
up here?

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.150
MALE SPEAKER: Just say, for
everyone who's listening,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.090
we're going to take a
couple of minutes.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.180
MIHAI IONESCU: How about now?

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.173
Is it working?

00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:15.940
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes,
we're good.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.570
MIHAI IONESCU: OK.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.560
So let's keep going.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.630
Slight technical delay here.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.050
PENG YING: Technical
difficulties.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.690
MIHAI IONESCU: It happens
when you're live.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.310
But now we're good.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.380
So I just talked about
the Dev Fest West.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.275
We're sold out, but for those
who signed up, we are looking

00:02:34.275 --> 00:02:36.390
forward to see you guys.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.830
And the other announcement--

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.668
we keep on mentioning
every time--

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:45.570
but we love people who are
passionate about APIs, and

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.715
we're hiring in the Developer
Relations Team, in the Wallet

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:50.940
Team as well.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.670
So if you're interested, you
want to play with the latest

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.220
and greatest, check out the
Developer Relations Jobs page

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.090
and apply for advocates, program
engineers, program

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.380
managers, wherever you feel you
can make the most impact.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.550
PENG YING: And the URL is
developers.google.com/jobs.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.040
We're really looking for a few
new folks to help out.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.814
So please apply if you're
interested.

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:17.080
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.330
Let's move on to
the questions.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.720
Lots of them, very
little time.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.620
PENG YING: Yeah, so--

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.480
MIHAI IONESCU: Do you want
to take the first one?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.720
PENG YING: I will take
the first question.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.710
And the first question is--

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.560
it's related to right
now Google

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.450
Wallet deals with goods.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.180
It's "How do I verify that the
JSON web token I create is

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.235
correct?" And first, let's
talk about what a

00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:39.530
JSON web token is.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.170
It's a method to ensure that
content you send over to the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.010
client's browser hasn't
been altered when you

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.310
go through a purchase.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.490
So the way that we do it is we
append a signature to the end

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.560
of a body content.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.860
So a JSON web token consists
of three things, a basic

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.360
C4-encoded header appended to a
content body, appended to a

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.850
signature, all concatenated
with periods.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.210
So in order to ensure that the
JSON web token you create is

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.450
correct, what you can do is
you can take the content

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.285
between the two periods and
then Base64 decode it, and

00:04:21.285 --> 00:04:24.940
then take a look at that
JavaScript Objects.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.150
You can also use our JSON
web token decoder.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.000
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, I'm going
to put it up on the screen

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.630
right now so you guys
can see it.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.360
It's on the documentation under
Resources Tools, a very

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.790
useful tool.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.280
PENG YING: With this tool, you
can just copy and paste the

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.690
entire JSON web token that
you've created, and then this

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.030
tool will decode the main body
using the technique I

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.750
described earlier.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.800
It does some additional things,
like HTML encoding, or

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.420
HTML decoding, so if your
slashes or something are

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.090
incorrect, it'll automatically
correct that for you, which

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.070
isn't the best.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.800
But there are caveats to it.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.730
But If you really want to ensure
that the content's

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.310
correct, what you can do is you
can open up the Developer

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.260
Tools in Chrome and then go to
the Console and use atob,

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.870
which will convert your
Base64 string to

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.500
just a regular string.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.410
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.090
So the next question--

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.740
I'm going to take the next one--
looks like it's somewhat

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.520
related also for the
digital with API.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.260
And the question is, "I get the
following error message on

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.990
an [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.000
request." And the message is,
"We could not complete your

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.950
purchase because of technical
issues." "How do I figure out

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.170
the problem?"

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.810
So the first thing you do when
you get something like that,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.600
you check the error codes that
you receive in the client

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.630
failure handler.

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:54.460
So that's a client-side handler,
which will be called

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.010
when the payment fails,
the transaction fails

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.550
for whatever reason.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.210
And I'm going to put up on the
screen, again, the reference

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.830
to those error codes.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.750
So if you watch the screen now,
you will see that we have

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.730
four error codes in the Error
Type field that will give you

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.220
an indication of what
went wrong.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.380
So the first three are the most
important ones that you

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.310
should bluelight.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.800
For example, Merchant Error
will tell you that the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.220
purchase request contains an
error, for example, a badly

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.940
formatted JWT that my colleague

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.440
talked about earlier.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.510
You can use the decoder, see
if one of the field is an

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.760
incorrect format, fix
that, and move on.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.490
The other two are Purchase
Canceled, either the buyer

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.310
cancelled the purchase
or there is a

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.020
payment declined error.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.820
Not much you can do there, but
it's a good indication where

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.150
the problem is coming from.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.690
And the third one is Post Back
Error, which means you failed

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.050
to acknowledge the Post
Back notification

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.970
sent to your server.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.270
You have 10 seconds
to do that.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.810
Otherwise, the transaction is
automatically cancelled.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.880
So check that you received the
Post Back notification.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.610
Look at your logs,
and make sure you

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.400
respond in 10 seconds.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.830
And finally, the last one is
Internal Server Error.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.250
It can happen.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.880
It seems it means something
went wrong on Google side.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.820
If you see that, let us know in
the forum, and we'll help

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.870
you debug that or check
if there's something

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.180
wrong on our side.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.610
PENG YING: Cool.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.020
So I'll take the next one.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.930
It's a question from a forum
about recurring subscriptions.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.940
"When is a subscription first
and second payment charged?

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.150
I'm confused about the phrase
'you'll be charged at the end

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:49.600
of the billing period starting
on.'" Yeah, so I guess we want

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.280
to take a little bit of time to
clarify the billing cycle

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.394
for recurring billing.

00:07:55.394 --> 00:08:00.410
The first subscription payment
starts on the start date that

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:06.310
you set in the recurring item
in the JSON web token.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.520
Well, depending on how
you schedule your--

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.520
how you create your recurring
item and your initial payment

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.920
inside the JSON web token, the
first payment is taken at the

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.560
time the customer purchases,
which is that

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.980
initial payment segment.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.422
And then the recurring billing
starts at the start date that

00:08:28.422 --> 00:08:30.930
you set within your
recurring item.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.020
So those are the two
differentiations.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.299
The second payment will occur
one month after the start

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.260
date, exactly one month after
the start date, and

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.175
so on, and so forth.

00:08:42.175 --> 00:08:44.970
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, so it's a
little confusing statement.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:48.960
And I think we're working
on making it better.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.110
Because there are a lot of
technical terms there, and

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.736
probably it's not the best.

00:08:52.736 --> 00:08:53.650
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.530
Subscriptions are a
confusing thing.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.330
MIHAI IONESCU: All right, I'll
take the next question.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.270
It's related to Google Wallet
Mobile, so we're switching

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:04.030
gears a little bit here.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.780
And the question is, "Does
Google Wallet Mobile require

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.030
an internet connection to
authorize a payment at an NFC

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.970
reader?" And the answer is no,
it does not require an

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.070
internet connection.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.640
It will work 100% without
a data connection.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.970
And this is a big misconception
that you'll

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:25.410
always need to be online, either
wireless or on your

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.810
carrier network, so you
can make a payment.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.650
It is not required.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:33.770
All the phone is doing is
transmitting your card

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.640
information to the reader.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.350
And then the reader voice
processing the entire

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.510
transaction.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.110
So all you have to do is enable
your phone, tap, and

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.195
you're good to go.

00:09:44.195 --> 00:09:45.100
PENG YING: Yep, simple.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.920
MIHAI IONESCU: Very simple.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.080
PENG YING: OK, I'll
take the next one.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.830
"I'd like the ability for users
to purchase physical

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.930
goods with Google Wallet
inside my app.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.965
The in-app purchase API cannot
be used for this purpose, as

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:01.020
it is restricted to
digital goods.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.060
What API should I use?"

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.590
So right now, for--

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.200
I'm guessing they're talking
about web applications and not

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.990
Android applications.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:13.670
Or what do you think, Mihai?

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.930
MIHAI IONESCU: Oh
yeah, let's see.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:19.670
So it looks like he's mentioning
it could be either

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.330
an Android web application or
an Android application.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:27.160
In either case, physical goods
are not supported at this time

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.140
on mobile apps.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.180
You could use the
Checkout API.

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.680
Right now, that's your
only option.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:38.030
But that is only available to
merchants in the United States

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.060
and the United Kingdom.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.390
So there's a big limitation
right there.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.820
The good news is that we are
working on expanding the

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.410
current Digital Goods API to
support physical items.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.700
So that will come,
and it'll also be

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.300
available in more countries.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.330
PENG YING: There's a few
different payment method APIs

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.950
that we're currently
working on.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.740
And then these are geared
towards physical goods for

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.200
mobile or for the web.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.585
Should I take the next one,
or do you want to

00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:10.770
take the next one?

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.960
MIHAI IONESCU: I can
take the next one.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.880
PENG YING: OK.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.820
MIHAI IONESCU: So the next
one also related to

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.410
Google Wallet Mobile.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.090
The question is "If I lose my
phone, how can I prevent my

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.580
Google Wallet Mobile from being
used to make payments?

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.250
What other security components
are part of

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.670
Google Wallet Mobile?

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.800
So it's a very good question
and a question

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.380
that comes up regularly.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.920
There are lots of protection
layers to prevent

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.440
unauthorized use.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.040
First, you have two layers
of passwords.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.170
The first one is your
Android screen lock.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.920
You have to turn on your screen
in order to enable any

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.470
NFC type of payment.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.340
And then unlike leather wallets,
you have an extra

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.170
four-digit Google Wallet
pin that prevents

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.470
unauthorized access.

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:59.400
So that's the first layer.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.880
The second layer, if your
wallet ever gets lost--

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.680
your phone wallet-- ever gets
lost or stolen, you can

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.530
remotely disable it.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.280
And that would prevent
any unauthorized use.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.580
Your credit cards will continue
to work normally.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.800
It's just your phone is
completely disabled right now.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.680
And other security enhancements,
we can mention

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.650
encryption, the debit and credit
cards you store are

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.320
stored securely online
in the Cloud.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.910
They're not even on the phone.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.210
On the phone, you use
a virtual card.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.780
So your credit card numbers
are not even

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.730
passed to the merchants.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.590
So there are lots of layers
that prevent any type of

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.030
unauthorized use.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.356
PENG YING: All right, I guess
the next one I'll take.

00:12:48.356 --> 00:12:49.270
MIHAI IONESCU: You'll
take the next one?

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:53.500
PENG YING: "What advantages does
Google Wallet Mobile have

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.650
over making a payment by swiping
a credit card?" I

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.150
think there are a few different
advantages.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.350
One is simplicity, I suppose.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.330
What happens when you tap to
pay is that multiple things

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.800
are transmitted.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.360
So for merchants who accept
it, it will also transit

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.410
things like loyalty cards,
offers, and then possibly any

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.085
clipped coupons that
you've stored.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.500
We hope that Wallet will, in
the future, enable you to

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.730
store more things within
the Wallet.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:29.460
So like we were talking about
previously on one of our

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.980
Google Developer Live sessions
is that the idea of storing

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.450
maybe a transit card in the
Wallet or something like that,

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.890
tickets, and so on,
and so forth.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.390
So we hope that it's a thing
of convergence and it

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:47.620
simplifies the user's life.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.910
In addition to that, it's
pretty convenient.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:57.520
So instead of carrying maybe
your loyalty cards, your

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.590
credit cards, your gift cards,
your whatever else that you

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.680
may store in a Wallet, you
can all have it digitally

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.390
represented within the phone.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.550
And it's much more--

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.290
the space isn't as large
of a concern because

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.390
everything is digital.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.770
And the last thing
is security.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:21.170
As Mihai previously mentioned,
it's much more secure than

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:22.490
your physical device.

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.298
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, and less
worries if you lose it.

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:27.540
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:28.400
MIHAI IONESCU: Cool.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.580
Next question, "Can you
demonstrate using a phone to

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.410
make Google Wallet mobile
payment at an NFC reader?" We

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.390
don't have an NFC reader
here, but we can demo.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:39.540
We have lots of videos--

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:39.900
PENG YING: YouTube.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.070
MIHAI IONESCU: That show
it, how it's done.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.620
So I'm going to switch to my
computer now, again, and I'm

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.050
going to launch a video here.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.950
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.320
PENG YING: I don't know if HTMI
gets the audio out, but--

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.150
-With Google Wallet--

00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.470
PENG YING: We'll--

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.090
-You can pay with your phone
at hundreds of thousands of

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.450
merchants with any
card you want.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:06.687
To get started, select
your card--

00:15:06.687 --> 00:15:07.970
MIHAI IONESCU: Pick a card--

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:09.620
-Visa, MasterCard,

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:09.800
MIHAI IONESCU: Any card.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.263
-Or Discover, credit or debit.

00:15:12.263 --> 00:15:15.070
If you don't see the card you
want, it's a snap to add

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.070
another one.

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.210
All your payment info is
encrypted and stored securely

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.640
in your Google account online.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.920
And with Google offers that
automatically sync to your

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.900
phone, saving is simple.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.830
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes, coupons.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.780
-Let's say you're buying
a smoothie.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.270
Just tap the back of
your phone on the

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:34.090
terminal and that's it.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.290
A confirmation screen will let
you know you're good to go.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.800
Enjoy your blended beverage.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.674
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.280
PENG YING: Cool.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.720
MIHAI IONESCU: Wasn't
that great?

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.080
Tap and pay, and then
enjoy your smoothie.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:52.800
PENG YING: It's the future.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.330
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.170
And you guys see the
page I just put up?

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.640
It's very useful.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.100
If you go browse it, you can see
lots of merchants that are

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.950
accepting Google Wallet.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.560
And if you want to try it, just
go ahead and go to one of

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.700
these merchants, buy
something you like.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.452
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:16:10.452 --> 00:16:12.520
I'll take the next question.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.610
"How are payments by Google
Wallet processed?

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.430
Would a bank charge me
a fee for using it?"

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:22.580
So the way that Google Wallet
works right now, as Mihai

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.820
mentioned, that Google provides
a one-time card for

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.070
the merchant to process.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:36.670
It's a prepaid MasterCard debit
card, I believe, so that

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.440
when the merchant processes it,
they just go through their

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.320
typical merchant processor
or a merchant gateway.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.510
So as a user, you
incur no fees.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.360
And as a merchant, you would pay
the typical fees that you

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:54.080
do to your credit-card
processor.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.290
MIHAI IONESCU: And if I can
add, a lot of questions on

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:02.625
security or related to what's
just been asked right now

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:06.670
about fees, the answers can
be found in our FAQ page.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:11.130
I'm going to put up again the
page so everyone can see it.

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:16.829
It's one click away,
google.com/wallet/faq.html,

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.119
and lots of good
answers to most

00:17:19.119 --> 00:17:20.650
frequently asked questions.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.660
So if we didn't answer something
on this session or

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.220
not to your satisfaction,
please go

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.340
check out the FAQ page.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.180
And with that said, let me move
on to the next question.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.870
Oh, it's an easy one.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.280
"How do I know if a payment
terminal will accept Google

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.040
Wallet Mobile?" So
very simple.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.940
I'm going to put the
page up again.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:46.630
Look for the PayPass sign.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:48.180
You can see it right there--

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.111
PENG YING: Yep.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:52.530
So we're using the same
communication protocol that

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.960
your credit card uses, that your
MasterCards use, PayPass.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.930
MIHAI IONESCU: So if you see the
PayPass sign, you can tap

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.270
your phone and pay.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.930
PENG YING: Yep.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.330
I guess I'll take the next one.
"Can I attach a debit

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.850
card to my Google Wallet
Mobile?" Yes.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.290
Now, because we're aliasing the
credit card and providing

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.030
a one-time card to the merchant,
you can actually add

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.720
any type of card to your Google
Wallet and use it at

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:24.020
any store that can accept
payments through PayPass.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.360
So you can add debit cards.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.596
You can add Discover.

00:18:27.596 --> 00:18:31.840
You can add MasterCards,
anything that is in your

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.230
wallet as a method of payment.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.300
Or I would say not anything,
but most things that are in

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.680
your wallets as a method of
payment, you can likely add to

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.580
Google Wallet.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.300
MIHAI IONESCU: Just right,
most likely will work.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:40.575
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:18:40.575 --> 00:18:40.850
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:43.310
You just saw the demo
video before.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.860
It had the credit card
or debit card screen.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.370
Just try, see what works.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:54.440
On top of that, if I can add,
you are able to add your gift

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.450
cards to the phone.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.590
So that's great.

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.810
Macy's, Bloomingdale's,
you name it.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.950
You get a gift card.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:01.930
Put it on the phone.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:02.660
It will be there.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.580
You're not going to lose it.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.500
PENG YING: A few gift
card partners.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.780
Some stored value.

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:10.198
MIHAI IONESCU: And
very convenient.

00:19:10.198 --> 00:19:15.050
OK, let me take the
next one, another

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.650
security and risk question.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.400
"Is any information
stored at risk?

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.390
How is the user protected?"

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.590
So I think we covered it
in a previous question.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:28.170
To recap, linked credit or
debit-card credentials are not

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.230
locally stored on the phone.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:30.440
They're in the Cloud.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.590
The merchant will not get
your information.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:37.980
If your phone is lost or stolen,
there is no fear that

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.320
your information
is compromised.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.450
You can remotely disable it.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:47.788
All kinds of security layers
that protect you.

00:19:47.788 --> 00:19:50.165
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:19:50.165 --> 00:19:50.900
I guess I've got the next one.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:51.826
MIHAI IONESCU: Take
the next one?

00:19:51.826 --> 00:19:52.290
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:57.540
So "Does Google Wallet Mobile
work on the Nexus 7?" And the

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:59.180
answer to that is yes.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.310
It should be working
on Nexus 7.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.370
MIHAI IONESCU: A
resounding yes.

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:02.520
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.760
I would hope that it works
on our own device.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.410
MIHAI IONESCU: If it works,
it works on all devices.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.820
PENG YING: Yeah, so there's
an FAQ that-- do you

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.480
want to show the FAQ--

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.760
of the list of devices that
Wallet is supported on.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.720
And if we can bring that up--

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.320
MIHAI IONESCU: Let's see.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.590
So if you can see my screen,
then actually I think we go to

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.910
the Help Center, which is at
the bottom of the page.

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:36.320
And in the Help Center, it
should be Eligible Devices.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.460
So you see here on the left
side at the bottom of the

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.600
navigation sidebar, we
click on Eligible

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.790
Devices, and it's in there.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.050
The Nexus 7 Tablet.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.285
PENG YING: Nice.

00:20:47.285 --> 00:20:49.670
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah, I think
it was available the moment

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.130
the tablet shipped.

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.690
And to come back to a previous
question, now that the tablet

00:20:54.690 --> 00:20:58.370
is Wi-Fi only, you don't even
need Wi-Fi to make a payment,

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.280
as we said.

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.830
Any Google Wallet payments do
not require any connectivity.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.630
So I think you are somewhat
related to this aspect.

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:11.650
So just take your Nexus 7
out there and buy stuff.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:17.050
And this is the list of devices
currently supported.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:18.970
PENG YING: I think you get
the next question.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.110
MIHAI IONESCU: I'll get
the next question.

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.940
So actually, let me see.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.320
We have quite a few questions
about international

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.850
availability, and we get
them every session.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:35.340
And the answer is invariably
we cannot make any firm

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.430
announcements at this time.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:42.140
But we can point you to the
newly launched Google Wallet

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.640
page on Google+.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.300
It has a lot of timely
announcements and a lot of

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.960
discussion on these topics.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.690
They are much more frequent
than our biweekly session.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.810
So please check it out.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:57.470
And that's the first place
you're going to hear about the

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.420
new launches and availability.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.846
PENG YING: Yep, social media,
it's taking over.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.550
I guess I'll take
the next one.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.440
"Does a transaction using Google
Wallet Mobile look any

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:15.180
different than a credit-card
swipe to the cashier?" Well,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.190
other than going up to the
PayPass terminal and then

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:22.110
tapping your phone, the
transaction should look

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.440
identical in the sense that if
you were to take a credit card

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.030
and tap it, the credit card
transmits on the pin, the

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.270
[INAUDIBLE] number, or the
account number, to a terminal.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:35.910
And then you would be able to
process it normally like that.

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:37.210
The phone is doing
the same thing.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.390
So it's riding the same
payment rails.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:44.870
And to a cashier, it should
look like the same flow.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.110
MIHAI IONESCU: They may
be a little surprised.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.740
PENG YING: Yeah, like,
what's that, a phone?

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.040
MIHAI IONESCU: It's magic.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:49.790
What did you do?

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:50.290
PENG YING: Can you
do that again?

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.310
Can you make a few
more purchases?

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.640
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.280
Did you really pay?

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.030
I'm not going to give
you your stuff.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:57.390
So that's fun.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:01.230
I would say I experienced that
with merchants, and they were

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:06.190
really amazed of how fast it
was and how convenient.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.660
And yeah, go try it.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.131
I'm sure you'll have fun.

00:23:10.131 --> 00:23:12.660
I'm looking at a couple
of questions which

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.320
are somewhat related.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.080
The question is "How will a
store handle a Google Wallet

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:22.210
transaction if they require a
signature?" And the second one

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.850
is if they require
to see the card.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.710
So generally, stores are asking
you to see the card and

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.660
the signature to make sure the
card is signed, to make sure

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.450
you sign with the same
signature, to double check

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:38.710
that the card is not
a duplicate or

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:40.270
a compromised card.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.250
So none of this really applies
when you make a payment with a

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.505
mobile device.

00:23:45.505 --> 00:23:48.330
Your card is already
stored in there.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.980
It is saved in the Cloud.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.610
There is no reason if the
transaction goes through for

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.400
the merchant to check the

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.270
physical card or the signature.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:02.020
So I think those are corner
cases, and probably the

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.130
merchant is not educated.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:07.090
PENG YING: Well, I think before
you can enter in a

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.380
card, you have to enter in some
identifying information

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.370
associated with the card so that
Google Wallet can ensure

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:15.590
that the card belongs to you.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.960
It's pretty minimal information,
but it's to know

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.610
your consumer and make sure that
it's not a stolen card

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.650
that we're adding
to our network.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.260
MIHAI IONESCU: So the security
check already happened.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.510
The merchant is protected and
doesn't need to actually check

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:32.930
your physical signature.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.160
PENG YING: Yep.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.060
MIHAI IONESCU: All right,
getting closer to the end.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.240
Let's--

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.110
PENG YING: Should I take
this last one?

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.422
MIHAI IONESCU: Yes,
let's do that.

00:24:39.422 --> 00:24:41.820
PENG YING: All right. "Does
Google Wallet Mobile protect

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.410
me against unauthorized payments
the same way my

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.410
credit card does?" Because we're
using your credit card

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:53.060
as the back instrument, you
should receive the same

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.290
protections--

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.820
you would receive the
protections that your credit

00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:59.340
card provides for you.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:03.260
We're simply putting an alias
card in front of it, or

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.470
putting a one-time card in front
of it that is backed by

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:10.400
your card, which means that all
payments will eventually

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.370
end up on your card.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:13.430
And we're working--

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.880
or we have ties in place
to ensure that this

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.380
kind of stuff happens.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.760
So yes, you will be protected
against unauthorized payments.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.160
MIHAI IONESCU: So again, lots
of good answers to questions

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.290
on the security, privacy,
and merchants

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.770
are in the FAQ section.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.440
So if something we
didn't answer,

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.930
please go check it out.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.410
All right, we got close
to the end.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.780
Thank you, everyone, for
submitting questions.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:42.620
PENG YING: A reminder to if
you signed up for DevFest

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.070
West, we'll see you
this weekend.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:49.440
And then be sure to check out
developers.google.com/jobs for

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.340
information about our
jobs availability.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.425
We hope to see you next time.

00:25:53.425 --> 00:25:54.780
MIHAI IONESCU: All
right, bye-bye.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.030
PENG YING: See ya.

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.680
