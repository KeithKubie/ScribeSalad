00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.880
&gt;&gt; Robert L. Gallucci: Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to the Library

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.860
of Congress to the Kluge Center

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.830
and to our meeting today
Exploring Important Questions

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.930
around Depression and
its Treatments.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.230
I'm Bob Gallucci.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.720
I am the director of Kluge Center.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.140
I'd ask you at this time
to do what I'm going to do

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.240
which to put your cellphones
on stun or silence

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.930
or whatever works well for you.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:01.620 position:56%
Also a word of announcement/warning,
today's program is being filmed

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.060
for the Library of Congress and
the Kluge Center websites as well

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.960
as well for Kluge Center
YouTube and iTunes' U Channels.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.290
The Kluge Center where you now
are was created 15 years ago

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.340
through a generous gift from
philanthropist John W. Kluge.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.430
It brings together scholars and
researchers to distill wisdom

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.370
from the library's rich
resources and to interact

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.480
with policy-makers and the public.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.500
The center also awards the Kluge
Prize which recognizes achievement

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.060
and the study of humanity.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.300
It was awarded to philosophers
JÃ¼rgen Habermas

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.370
and Charles Taylor last year, 2015.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.540 position:56%
The scholars' council is here today.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.860
The panel we are hosting is led

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.240
by Scholars Council member
Philip W. Gold as a part

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.940
of the annual Scholars Council
meeting at the Library of Congress.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.890
Scholars Council is a body of
distinguished scholars convened

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.930 position:56%
by the Library of Congress to advise
on matters related to scholarships

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.490
at the library with
special attention

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.490
to the Kluge Center
and the Kluge Prize.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.900
Information since 2001, the council
comprises 14 leading thinkers

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.470
and includes winners of the
Pulitzer Prize, the Holberg Prize,

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.810
Balzan Prize, Guggenheim-Fulbright
Fellowships,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.640
and those listed among Time
Magazine's Most Influential People.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.520
Dr. Philip Gold has been a member
of the Scholars Council since 2004.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.010
He received his undergraduate
medical degrees at Duke University

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.870
and his post-graduate
medical training

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.430
at the Harvard Medical School.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.370
He has been at the NIH Clinical
Center since 1974 where he served

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.090
as chief neuroendocrine research

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.240
in the NIMH intramural
research program.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.740
Dr. Gold and his colleagues
had pioneered the elucidation

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.600
of fundamental mechanisms of
the neurobiological-- biology--

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.780
excuse me-- of the stress response

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.050
and its dysregulation
in major depression.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:37.620
He is an author of more than 500
publications including a series

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.700
of 9 full-length articles in the
New England Journal of Medicine.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.210
The Kluge Center is all about
bringing scholars together

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.160
from different disciplines
and encouraging conversations

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.910
and reflection that might
not otherwise happen.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.710
Our panel today does exactly this.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.390
Dr. Phil Gold has been
thinking about these topics

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.310 position:56%
for decades from a scientific angle.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.330
In addition, as a medical
doctor, he brings a deep concern

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.320
for the human condition and a drive
to improve the lives of patients.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.960
As he wrote for a recent
interview for the Kluge Center blog

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:28.230 position:56%
and I now quote Dr. Gold, depression
is an insidious illness infiltrating

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.980
core attributes that
define our humanity.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.110
For this reason I have an abiding

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.000
and profound antipathy
for its treachery.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.200
Depression humbles us by making
us seem far less than who we are.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.630
In so doing it robs of the
major epics of our lives,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.010
past, present, and future.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.530
I'm glad he and his distinguished
colleagues are with us today

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.470
and will be reflecting on
these important topics.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.510
Dr. Gold.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:13.690
[ Applause ]

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.850
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Thank you
very much for those kind words.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.470
It's a pleasure to be here and back
at the Scholars Council meeting.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.800
This will be my last.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.410
And it's been a magical experience.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.950
We have three speakers today.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:33.360
I will start and speak on general
aspects of major depression

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.720
and how we've come to understand it

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.330
as a neurodegenerative
systemic disorder.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.250
And then Dr. Ray DePaulo who
is chairman of the department

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.880
of psychiatry at Johns
Hopkins University and head

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.760
of their depression
research program and one

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.470
of the world's outstanding
geneticist

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.200
and psychiatry will be speaking on
genetics of psychiatric disorders

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.810
and especially depression
and bipolar disorder.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.960
And Dr. Carlos Zarate
who is a laboratory chief

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.750
at the NIH has made, I think, one
of the most important discoveries

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.350
in the last 25 years in
psychiatry by finding

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:25.110
that the drug ketamine is able to
produce rapid and full remission

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.870
in treatment-resistant patients
in as little as an hour.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.060 position:56%
And just yesterday I saw a
preprint of his paper which appeared

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.860
in the journal of nature where
they have worked out the mechanisms

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:45.490
of action of ketamine and
discovered other compounds

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.990
that have similar effects
with fewer side effects.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.150
We'll each speak for about 40
minutes and take 10 or 15 minutes

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.330
of questions after our talks and
that will still about 15 minutes

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.760
at the end of the session
for questions.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:12.700
Let me just type in my information
here so I can get online.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:27.280
Pardon me just a moment.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.220
Oh no. All right.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.720
This is bound to happen.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.560
I'll try it again.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.860
Forgotten my initials here.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.270
I don't believe it
as I have assigned.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.540
Now I don't even have a hint here.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.710
I've been using this
password for years.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.750
All right.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.050
Ready to go.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.350
Thank you.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.950
OK. Not seeing my [inaudible].

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.600
Oops! I'm at the back here.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.900
I'm so sorry.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.200
This is going so slowly.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:40.240
I do research in stress and
now I know what it's like.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.820
Let's see.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.120
OK.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.660
Here we go.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.990
What I'm talking about
depression is a dysregulation

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.080
of the stress response and
we'll be describing some

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.040 position:56%
of the newer findings that have
emerged which established depression

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.930
as a full-blown disease, a
systemic full body disorder

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:10.960
which neurodegenerative aspects
and is a progressive disease,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.890
much more serious, I think, than
we had previously appreciated.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:21.380
The slide there is a
schematic of something

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.710
that Hippocrates said 2000
years ago that we're all beset

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:30.910
by disturbing forces that
maintain, balance, equilibrium,

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.630 position:56%
and fortunately they're
counteracting, reestablishing forces

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.310
that reestablish the
balance, equilibrium.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.260
And today we call the disturbing
factors, stressors, the balance

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:49.350
or the equilibrium homeostasis
and the counteracting,

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:55.990 position:56%
reestablishing forces as adaptive
responses and two adaptive responses

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.580
so the stress system
and the immune system.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.330 position:56%
Galen referred to these
counteracting, reestablishing forces

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:08.510
as these [inaudible] the
healing forces of nature.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.700
And as I mentioned, we know that
depression is a dysregulation

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.000
of the stress response and
I'll talk with you a bit

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.500
about what the stress
response is all about.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.670
We first presented this
in a two-part series

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.840
in the New England Journal of
Medicine entitled "Clinical

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.550
and biochemical manifestations
of depression,

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.500
Relation to the neurobiology
of stress."

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.140
And what is the stress response?

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.300
Say you're being chased by a
bear and you fear for your life.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.080
The first of fear-related
behaviors and anxiety

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.270
and these are essential
for survival.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.610
Without them, there is
not sufficient motivation

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:50.140
to escape the threatening stimulus.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.370
There is a very extensive
central nervous system apparatus

00:10:54.370 --> 00:11:00.420
for generating anxiety deep in
the brain and it sends many,

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:04.390
many fibers to the cortex

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:10.590
to announce the conscious
experience of fear.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:15.230
But the cortex sends relatively few
wires down to the anxiety center

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.960 position:56%
and for that reason, we can't really
persuade ourselves not to be afraid

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.650 position:56%
or not to be anxious and that's the
price we pay, I think, for survival.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.420
But I think it's one of the
tragedies of human evolution.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.740
There is a decreased capacity for
pleasure and the reason for that

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:39.580 position:56%
or one of the reasons for that is
to prevent distraction along the way

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:45.230
since the attention must be focused
only on the threatening stimulus.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.210
Similarly, there's an
inflexible mood and cognition.

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.090
The mood should not
be bouncing around

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:58.220
and cognitive style is really
very fundamental either programs

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.940
that had been generated during
past stressful experiences

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.660
or somewhat instinctive responses.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.130
Stress hormone production
is always an invariable part

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.720
and I'll be talking a bit about
some of these stress hormones,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.770
cortisol and norepinephrine.

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:17.260
There is redirection of fuel to
the bloodstream and the brain

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:24.680
and this increases plasma
glucose which the brain--

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.190 position:56%
the stressed brain needs in order to
mount an effective stress response.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.780
It occurs through insulin
resistance.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.040
And I can talk a little
bit about that later on.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.500
I'm going to show you some data.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.710
There is premonitory inflammation.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.920
And so when we are stressed,
whether it's psychological stress

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.890
or whether it's a physical stress,
there is a premonitory activation

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.990
in the inflammatory response.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:55.220
And presumably, that occurs perhaps
to prime the system to respond

00:12:55.220 --> 00:13:00.900
to a possible injury
that is inflicted

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.820
by the stressful situation.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.520
And there's also similarly an
activation of coagulation as a stay

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.190
against plasma hemorrhage
so that the body is ready

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.940
for this before it happens.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.920
Inhibition of neurovegetative
program for one of these--

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:24.370
again, these occur in order to
prevent distraction or the wasting

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.840
of calories on programs
that are not essential.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.130
So that if you're being
chased by a bear

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.490
or if you're very stressed,
you won't stop and eat.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:39.480
You won't stop and look
at a beautiful scene.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.780
You won't stop to rest.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.310
You won't stop to sleep.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.500
You won't stop to participate
in sexual activity.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:52.300
All of these are suspended
during the acute stress response.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.960
And there is something called--

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.750
increased neuroplasticity
and neurogenesis.

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.010
We just learned that not long ago.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:02.240
And I'll mention a little bit
about that in the next few slides.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.430
But these are intercellular changes

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:13.980 position:56%
that occur invariably during a
stress response that is controllable

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:19.710
and of which the individual
fields they can master.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:24.190
And as to the effective termination
of the response, it has to stop

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.240
when it's no longer needed
rather than to linger

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.610
for long periods of time.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:37.310
Now, what do I mean by
neuroplasticity in b there and c?

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:44.230
You see these are projections
from neurons.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.230 position:56%
They're like trees, dendritic trees.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.430
And normally, they're quite robust

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.970
with very severe stress
down at the bottom.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:01.490
They are diminished significantly.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:08.490
And with stress that is
manageable, mild manageable stress,

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:11.810
actually this neuroplasticity
increases.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.160
On the right you see two slides.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.180
The bottom one shows neurogenesis.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.170
We now know the brain
makes new neurons.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.060
They're born and they make
connections with other neurons

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.340
and they're essential for
an adaptive response stress.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:32.840
The bottom micrograph shows
what that is like at baseline.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.800
And on top, that is the staining

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:45.960
of these new cells during
controllable stress response.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:54.440
This shows again on the left the
control, normal dendritic tree

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.050
and below, how it's paired off

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.940
in the prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:08.710
On the right, what happens actually
is that this tree actually burgeons

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:12.350
in the amygdala, the amygdala
fear center which is essential

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.520 position:56%
for the conscious experience of fear

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.110
and which plays a very
important role

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:23.520
in the experience of depression.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.530
Now, there are several
forms of depression.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.260
I'll talk about two principles.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:35.430 position:56%
The first is melancholic depression
and it affects about 35% of patients

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.510
who develop major depressions.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.100
And this term-- this form

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:42.830
of depression belies the term
depression in that in a state

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:47.810
of hyperarousal, its cardinal
manifestation is anxiety,

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.700
directed at the self, and
experienced as a sense

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.980
of worthlessness and
meaninglessness.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.640
And so it's an existential state.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.400
Inhibition of the capacity to
anticipate or experience pleasure.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:05.820
Inhibition of sleep,
appetite, and interest in sex.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:10.780 position:56%
There is-- Inflammation is activated
during depression really rather

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.400
considerably and there's
some data to suggests

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:19.510
that not only it may be premonitory
but that it may even occur

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.670
and predate the onset
of the depression.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:28.640
Insulin resistance, so blood sugar
rises to help the stressed brain.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.740
Increased blood clotting.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:37.290
And these events occur even
during psychological stressors,

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:44.140
just as powerfully as if when
we're chased by a dangerous animal.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.710
Inhibition of the growth hormone
and reproductive endocrine systems

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.090
to save energy for
the stress response.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:56.990
And there's a marked decreased
in depression of neuroplasticity

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:01.470
and neurogenesis which
are not very much involved

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.960
in a depressive pathophysiology.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:09.440
So, melancholic depression,
this really is a rendition

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.780
of virtually exactly to
what I had earlier showed

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.860
as what transpires
during a stress response.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.470
Fear-related behaviors, the
inflexible mood and cognition,

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:26.050
stress hormone production,
redirection of fuel

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:31.910
to the bloodstream and brain,
inflammation and coagulation,

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.100
inhibition of neurovegetative
functions, here,

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.800
decreased neurogenesis
and neuroplasticity,

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.360
and there is insufficient
termination of the stress response.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:44.560
It gets stuck as it
were in the on position.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:50.490
Here is a schematic of the brain.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:55.700
If you look at the green area,
sort of in the center to the left,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.840
that's called the subgenual
prefrontal cortex

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.150
which Wayne Drevets discovered
was significantly reduced in size

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.970
and its activity is
abnormal in patients

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.710
with familial major depression.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.260
These are people who are depressed

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.460
and who have first degree
relatives who are depressed.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.640
And this plays a very important
role in the depressive syndrome

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.810
and during the stress response.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:26.260
It regulates and restrains
the amygdala fear system

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:30.900
and hopes to-- and
is working properly.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:36.940
It prevents being maladaptive
levels of high anxiety.

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.340
It plays a large role
in self-assessment

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.630
on how we feel about ourselves.

00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.410
It estimates the likelihood
of punishment or reward.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:51.270
It modulates the pleaser
and the reward centers.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:56.990
It restrains cortisol secretion
and norepinephrine secretion.

00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.280
And in patients with
familial depression,

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.090
it's reduced by as much as 40%.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:08.100
And here you see the healthy
volunteers and the bipolar,

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:13.070
unipolar depressed patients
showing how a significant decreases

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.990
in the volume of the prefrontal--
of the subgenual prefrontal cortex.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:22.340
And so what you get is a syndrome
where there's excessive anxiety;

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.460
self-assessment is feeling of
worthlessness that goes along

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:29.010
with anxiety about the
self; increased the estimate

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.960
of the likelihood of
punishment, down regulation

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:38.140
of the reward center;
release of increased cortisol

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.540
and norepinephrine secretion;
and this neuropathic change

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.560
which is one of many in depression.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.170
This is not the only one.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:51.350
But there are many that
occur in various centers

00:20:51.350 --> 00:21:00.980
that control cognition, bodily
functions, sleep and so on.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:07.470
Down at the bottom you see
amygdala and there is--

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.440
the arrow goes to the--
that yellow structure.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.800
And the amygdala fear
system is essential

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.110
for the conscious experience
to fear.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.680
It restrains that subgenual
prefrontal cortex.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.280
It makes it more abnormal.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.640
And it really puts a break on
the pleasure and reward center.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.950
It's very hard to anticipate
your experience pleasure

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.820
when you're very anxious.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:37.610
Severe anxiety is virtually the
absence of any good feeling.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:42.480
It stores negatively
charge emotional memories.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.050
It activates cortisol

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.590
and norepinephrine secretion
stress hormone secretion.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.540
It's increased in size and
there is more neuroplasticity

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.840
during depression.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.820
So the amygdala is really
firing at full force

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.860
in the midst of a depression.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.490
And its neuroplasticity is actually
increased during depression,

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.910
which is what we wouldn't
like to see.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:19.150
And there's an area
called ventral striatum,

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.350 position:56%
which you see there's an arrow there
to the red structure which is just

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.980
to the right of the
subgenual prefrontal cortex.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:33.270 position:56%
The ventral striatum plays the most
significant role in the anticipation

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:36.220
and experience of pleasure
and it's involved

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.480
in reinforcement and
in drug addiction.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.780
It sets the tone of
motivational salients.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.440
In response to pleasurable
stimuli patients

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:52.890
who are depressed have a subnormal
activation of the ventral striatum,

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.480
do not respond to pleasurable
stimuli.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.750
And its size is significantly
diminished in depression

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.450
which is lost during
the act of depression.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:07.840
And so this is responsible for
one component of the depression

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:13.190
which we termed anhedonia or the
inability to experience pleasure.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.760
And one last structure I'm
talking about is the hippocampus.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.940
And it's a horseshoe-like
shape structure.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:29.780
This is a different cut
of [inaudible] brain.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:36.010
The hippocampus served
multiple memory functions,

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.550
regulate special relations.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:43.090
It modulates the subgenual
prefrontal cortex as an area

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.950
in the front of the hippocampus
called the anterior hippocampus

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:53.940
which sends a single wire
without prior connections

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.240
to the subgenual prefrontal
cortex and is thought

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.030
to modulate it significantly.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.820
It sustains cortisol and
norepinephrine secretion.

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.620
It's the principle site where
neurogenesis takes place

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:09.740
in the brain where it increased
during normal stress response

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.550
and decreased during severe
stress with depression.

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:14.700
And its size and we've known this

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.950
from quite awhile is
significantly reduced

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.840 position:56%
in patients with depressive illness.

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.180
So there's loss of tissue.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.640
There's more loss of
tissue in depression

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.420
than there is in Parkinson's
disease.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.530
And depression is all
more problematic.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.020
Parkinson's disease
is a terrible disease

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.930
but it's generally a
disorder of older individuals.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:40.120
Depression has its own, so
not infrequently in children

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.800
and adolescents and young adulthood
and it's a lifetime disorder.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.120
And there's an area called the
hypothalamus which you see there

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.910
at the base of the brain and
it connects to the pituitary

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.290
and it produces a hormone
called CRH,

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:05.370
which our lab has worked
considerably.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.400
CRH is released from the brain,

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.690
stimulates the anterior pituitary
just outside of the brain,

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:14.940
and that stimulates the
secretion of cortisol.

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.990
But it's the brain that
drives cortisol secretion

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:24.210
and its secretion is highly
elevated with depression.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.520
We've now finally nailed down that
depression is really a full-blown

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.230
systemic neurodegenerative
disease rather

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.980
than a simple chemical imbalance.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:43.150
This concept comes a lot
in research that shows

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:48.030
which I just shown you
will also gain tissue

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.000
in several highly specific
sites in brain.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.360
And these pathologic
changes in brain progress

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.300
if the depression is
not effectively treated.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.510
The damage to the areas
perform functions relevant

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.810
to the core biological

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.470
and psychological dimensions
of depression.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.050
And I'll just repeat these again.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:12.320
But you'll see these are the
major components of depression.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.490
Anxiety, how we perceive ourselves,
the likelihood of punishment

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:20.100
and reward, the capacity to
anticipate or experience pleasure.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.400
We now know precisely
where these tissues are,

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.280 position:56%
what the tissues look like, which
cells are destroyed and what's going

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.780 position:56%
on in remaining dysfunctional cells.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:34.480
One new thing that we've
learned about antidepressants is

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:37.300
that almost all antidepressants
significantly improve

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.830
neuroplasticity and neurogenesis.

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:44.740 position:56%
This makes some remarkable compounds
that few others if any compounds

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.760 position:56%
which actually increase neurogenesis

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:52.200
and people are experimenting
using antidepressants to try

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.090
to treat disease of the
retina, for instance,

00:26:55.090 --> 00:27:02.860
to get neurogenesis active there
and other sites of the body.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.230
So neurogen and if you
give an antidepressant

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.820
which increases neurogenesis
and neuroplasticity,

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.140
if you block the neurogenesis you
don't get the antidepressant effect

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.880
so that for reasons that we don't

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:21.030
yet understand neurogenesis
is essential

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.060
for antidepressant efficacy.

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.940
And so this leads us to a
search for other compounds

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.450
that promote neuroplasticity and
neurogenesis for the treatment

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.340
of depression and in
tissue engineering.

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:38.630
One other thing that we know which
is disturbing about depression is

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:43.010
that there are systemic or
total body manifestations.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:46.630
The pathological losses or gains
in tissue in specific sites set

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:50.460
into motion pathologic
changes outside of the brain.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.360
They're responsible
for the premature onset

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.110
of coronary artery disease,
stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.930
So depression is really
the tip of the iceberg

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:03.740
of the syndrome is a serious
and systemically widespread.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.780
Patients with depressive illness
lose approximately seven years

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.520
of life, much is untreated
hypertension predictably shortens

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.430
a life.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:16.990
Now I'm going to talk
a little bit about CRH

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:20.260
which is the main driver
of cortisol.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:23.600
It actually does many things
in addition to driving cortisol

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:27.480
and I don't think it's core
abnormality in depression

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.430
but it confers many of
its observable features.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:35.420
And if you give it centrally

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.580
to experimental animals it induces
fear-related behaviors, anxiety,

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:45.020
and increased vigilance,
inflexible mood and cognition,

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.940
the hypercortisolism and
increased norepinephrine secretion.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:52.050
It produces the enzyme resistance,
the proinflammatory state,

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.590
and increased coagulation.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.750
And it inhibits food intake,
sleep, sexual activity

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.920 position:56%
and the endocrine program
[inaudible] growth and reproduction.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:07.390
Now here's a study that we
did sort of an ambitious study

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:13.230
to really get a good picture with
this where we put lumbar drains

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:17.740
in where you would do a
spinal tap and left in there

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.440
for 30 consecutive hours.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.380
The neurosurgeons would do this

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.290
after all much all
neurosurgical procedures,

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.170
the incidence of infection
is virtual nil

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.630
and there are virtually
no side effects.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:33.990
And what we saw is cortisol
was elevated around the clock

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:41.030
in the upper left even while
people slept so that this anxiety

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:44.970
and hyperarousal does not
require consciousness.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.780
And in the lower right,

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.050
you see [inaudible] reverse the
CRH is significantly elevated

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.970
around the clock in patients

00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:01.140
with major depression
including when they are asleep.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:06.610
Now, I've mentioned, Norepinephrine
before, norepinephrine has many

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:13.250
of the same effects
as CRH and it's--

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.740
induces fear-related behavioral,
inflexible mood and so on,

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:20.290
activation of the amygdala,
increased blood pressure

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.550
and pulse rate, the
insulin resistance

00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:25.880
and proinflammatory state,
increased coagulation

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.670
and it inhibits the
neurovegetative programs.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:32.730
And in that study,
when we execute CSF

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.830 position:56%
for 30 hours, this is what we found.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:40.610
First thing that we
found, this is a picture

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:45.550
of showing the 24 hour
levels of norepinephrine

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:49.790
and the cerebral spinal fluid and
it's elevated around the clock.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:54.620
And the slide below shows the
restoration of normal secretion

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.750
after electroconvulsive treatment.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:02.580
And electroconvulsive treatment
seems to be very draconian

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.740
and we try to avoid using it.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.920
But actually, if we had
say an 80-year-old person

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.360
who become very depressed and
stop eating and was wasting away

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.360
and we wanted to get a rapid
antidepressant response before Dr.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.170
Zarate came along, we will
use ECT and it would work

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:24.930
in over 90% of the cases.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:31.920
This is the curve in red of the
24 hour norepinephrine secretion

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.390
in plasma and it is
restored to normal after ECT.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:42.090
And here is the 24 hour
pattern of cortisol

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.750
and its level comes
down after ECT as well.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:51.220
The top three showing you curves
that are virtually superimposable,

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:54.710 position:56%
these are all cardiotoxic compounds.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.620
And when they peak early
in the morning, near end--

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:04.870 position:56%
at the very end of the slide,
what-- that is the time that occurs,

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:09.320
that is the maximum
time of susceptibility

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.020
to heart attacks and
to sudden deaths.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:19.300 position:56%
And here's epinephrine or adrenaline
which is elevated around the clock

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.760
and only is partially
restored after the ECT.

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:30.010
This is a study we did in another
group of depressed patients

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:35.660
who are not as severely depressed
and we put a cannula in an artery

00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.360
and infused radioactive
norepinephrine

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:43.490
so that we could get calculation
of its disappearance rate

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.810
and this gives us the
spill of rate and you see

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.710
in melancholic depressed
patients the baseline is elevated.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:55.190
They get an increased
response during a video game

00:32:55.190 --> 00:33:00.490
which is a mild stressor and rather
substantial rise after [inaudible]

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:04.390
which is a drug that increases
norepinephrine secretion.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:08.830
So, both CRH and Norepinephrine
are excavated and they synergize

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:12.680
with one another, they
stimulate each other's response

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.150
and each other's activities.

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:21.520
Now, I mentioned earlier,
the systemic manifestations

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.820
of the depression

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:30.460
and the pathophysiology is
essentially what I've shown you

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.510
before, the inflammation
is part of depression.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.530
It's a very much a part
of this pathophysiology.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:40.250
Coronary artery disease is
principally an inflammatory disease

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:43.160
and the major marker for
coronary artery disease,

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.720
CRP which you get drawn in your
doctor's office is an index

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.510
of the cardiovascular risk
and if it levels over two,

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.160
you're at somewhat high risk
[inaudible] at greater risk

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.800
and CRP is an inflammatory marker

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:04.900
because the atherosclerosis is
largely due to an inflammation

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.710
of the veins-- of the arteries.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:11.250
Increased cortisol secretion
has multiplicity of effects.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.680
Every cell in the body
has a cortisol receptor.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.420
Sympathetic nervous
system activation,

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:23.370
the insulin resistance causes
much physiologic morbidity

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.000
and the increased clothing.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.590 position:56%
Let me show you some data that we've
done looking at insulin resistance.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.100
I'll describe insulin
resistance a little bit.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:42.840
I hope this seems clear.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.030 position:56%
Insulin is a hormone that secreted--

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:51.670
that causes glucose to exit
the bloodstream into the cell

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:55.250
and if you lack insulin
you have diabetes.

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.860
And so, blood does not get into
the cells and instead it builds up

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.340 position:56%
and you have very high blood sugars.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.100
During stress and in depression,
we get slightly insulin resistance,

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:10.590
so what happens is that the
insulin doesn't really promote

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:13.460
as much glucose transported
into the cell.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:20.580 position:56%
It builds up in the blood supply and
high glucose levels go to the brain

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:25.280 position:56%
which doesn't need insulin to
transport glucose across the neuron.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.930
And for that reason insulin
resistance is a clever way

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.600
to increase plasma glucose acutely

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:40.220
and to promote optimal brain
function during distress.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.380
And we see that in our depressed
patients who are remitted,

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.130
they're not suppressed any longer,

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:48.560
they have increased
plasma insulin levels.

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.550
The insulin is going
up and up trying

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.230
to get the glucose into the cell.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.140
It does mange to do it completely

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.350
and the plasma glucose
levels are elevated

00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:59.830
in patients with depression.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:01.190
They're not abnormally elevated.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:06.160
The insulin levels don't
get abnormal, 100, 110.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.220
So, here, it's really 90s or a low
90s but it's significantly higher

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.480
than we see in healthy
controls who are matched

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.000
for BMI, age, and gender.

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.930
Then we see elevated fasting
triglycerides and total cholesterol

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:33.430
in remitted patients
with major depression.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.040
They have high triglycerides.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.500
They're not outside the normal
range which is about over 160,

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.850
they have high cholesterol
not outside the normal range

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:47.830
but it's 185 compared
to the total cholesterol

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:51.310
in very closely matched controls.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:54.810
And next is a compound
call adiponectin

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:59.920
which is very essential
for insulin sensitivity.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.810
I won't go into this in detail.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:04.760
But adiponectin promotes
insulin sensitivity

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:09.940
and its levels are reduced
completely in patient

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:14.960
with major depression around
the clock at every time point.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:19.660
One of the things that
happens during depression

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:24.230
because of high cortisol levels
and at the top of that sphere,

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:30.980
high insulin level, high IL-6
which promotes inflammation.

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:38.330
And that increases the secretion of
adipose tissue but a special form

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.660
of adipose tissue

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.940
which intraabdominal,
we call it visceral fat.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:49.360
And visceral fat is a very
active biochemical machine.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.090
And on there right there,
you see it makes a variety

00:37:53.090 --> 00:38:00.180
of proinflammatory compounds
that cause inflammation.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.410
IL-6 for the side with receptor,
you don't need to know these,

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:09.610
TNF-alpha resistant and so forth.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:11.260
And actually, the levels

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:17.280
of the circulating proinflammatory
compounds correlate with BMI.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.540
So, if you have child who's
moderately overweight,

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.040
they're in a proinflammatory state.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:27.390
And anyone who's overweight or
obese is in a proinflammatory state

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.940 position:56%
and that confers along the mobility.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.610
It goes all along with obesity.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:41.060
The insulin has a variety of--
it's elevated in depression,

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.730
a variety of negative effects.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.030
It promotes inflammation

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.750
and it stimulates the
sympathetic nervous system,

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:52.300
it produces bad liquids
and increases clotting.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:57.090
Now, this is some studies we've
done, there are many others done

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:02.650
by others that show inflammation
in patients with major depression.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:04.200
And there-- the inflammation story

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.210
in depression is very
exciting, really.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:11.780
It's present in a very large
percentage of depressed patients.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:18.210
It's present in the bloodstream,
it increase stimuli compounds

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.720
that stimulate inflammation,

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.840
and there is increased
inflammation in the brain.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.500
And this seems to precede
the major depression.

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.040
So some people feel

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.700
that inflammation may be a
primary trigger to depression

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:39.060
and some have used antiinflammatory
compounds and with mix results,

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.660
but there have been
several which show

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.710
that they have antidepressive
effects.

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:48.170
This is an around the clock
study we did with plasma IL-6

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.290 position:56%
which is a proinflammatory compound.

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:54.630
It's elevated around the
clock in our patient.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:40:00.090
These are in patients who are
no longer depressed and not

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:05.290
on medication and they
have high levels as you see

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.590
on the right there, CRP,

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:10.270
this compound that predicts
coronary artery disease

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.580
and they have high levels

00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:19.320
of something called serum amyloid
A. There is a peripheral CRH

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.050
that we've shown and it comes out
of sympathetic nerve terminals.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.150
And it is proinflammatory.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.580
It stimulates white cells

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:30.440
and it stimulates a cell called
the mast cell which contains--

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.020
it's a bag of proinflammatory
compounds

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:42.310
that can do great harm
if uncontrolled.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:52.600 position:56%
And IL-6, one of the proinflammatory
compounds has a whole variety

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.900
of other effects.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:55.590
These things all influence
one another.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:58.430
They are synergistic
in their actions,

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.450
the positive feed back loops.

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:03.160
Nature has really designed
this system

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.600
so that you can really
get the stresses ramped

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.720
up in dire emergency.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.760
But I think that provides
the context for being

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:19.020
so much depressive illness because
depression apparently affects 16%

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:26.040
of the American population at
one time during their lives.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.720
Now, why my patients with
major depression be inflamed,

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:32.390
this is speculative on my part.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.730
But there is a new
form of inflammation

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:37.860
which has been described
called parainflammation.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.320
And it occurs in the
context of stimuli

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.310
to which we're not exposed
in our early evolution.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:50.040
And so, it become inflamed in
this context during at old age,

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:55.160
which was not present long, long
ago during overfeeding or obesity

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:02.620
and underactivity with disruption
of the ordinary light-dark cycle

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.180
with artificial lighting

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:10.370
with synthetic chemicals
and drugs and so forth.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:15.400
And I suggest again speculatively

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.410
that major depression may be
apparent inflammatory disease.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:24.640 position:56%
Because early in our evolutionary
history, we may not have experience,

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.240
the everyday multiple small
stressors that are incurred

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:35.950
in our everyday social interactions
or living in chronic conditions.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:40.460
There are several markers for
parainflammation that we're looking

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:45.450
for to see if we can verify
that this process is transpiring

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:47.910
in patients with major depression.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.420
And in coagulation,
we see the patients

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.740
with the major depression have
increased plasma fibrinogen

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:00.250
which is a clotting factor.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:04.230
And the next slide, I
won't dwell on these.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:07.740 position:56%
But just to show you again that
both in the morning and the evening,

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:11.110
patients with depression have
increased clotting factors.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:14.470
One is called PAI-1 and the
other is called factor-VIII.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:19.650
We reported in the New
England Journal of Medicine

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:25.600
that even premenopausal women with
major depression have osteoporosis.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.350
And here is the schematic
slide of the hip.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.970
And if you look at that normogram,

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:34.920
you'll see that the darkened
area is the normal range

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.380
and this patient is way down
in the osteoporotic range.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.670
This is 35-year-old woman
with major depression.

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:48.150
Now, they don't get fractures
because of their youth,

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:53.420
the protein [inaudible] ammonia
is very strong and intact.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.980
But as they age, they become
progressively more susceptible

00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:03.690
to osteoporosis or its
precursor of osteopenia.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:11.140
These are the bone mineral
density markers at various sites.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:16.180 position:56%
They're all reduced in a depressed
patient in multiple sites in the hip

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:20.410
and multiple sites in the spine.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:24.650
This next slide are--
the first is ostocalcium.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.130
It's a compound that
promotes bone growth

00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:29.080
and it's reduced in
depressed patients.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:34.280 position:56%
And it's-- On the right side there's
something called deoxypyridinium

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:41.530
links, cross links which go up
when there is bone reduction

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:45.900
and they are reduced in
patients with depression.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.920 position:56%
Here's a biopsy that we did from one

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.300
of our most severely
osteoporotic premenopausal women.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.860
On the left is normal
architecture of the bone.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.650
They are what we called
trabeculae or canals.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:04.790
Oh yeah. They are trabeculae
or canals that are made

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:12.280
of tough material that suspend the
bone and give them a strong matrix.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:17.030
And in the osteoporosis, the
patients with major depression,

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:22.600
that structure is markedly
disrupted.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.460
And I just mentioned something
about atypical depression.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.400
I don't have enough time to show
you the data that we have in it.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.490
But atypical depression
is another form

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:36.570
of depression affects
another 30 to 40%

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:39.140 position:56%
of patients with depressive illness.

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:42.250
And in contrast to
melancholia which is a state

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:46.620 position:56%
of pathological hypoarousal,
atypical depression is characterized

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.460
by profound lethargy and fatigue.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:54.060
The patients feel much less alive
than usual rather than anxious.

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.480
They also have decreased
capacity to experience pleasure.

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.320
Instead of losing their appetite,
they have increased appetite

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.650
and weight gain, increased sleep.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:07.520
Whereas in melancholia, the
depression is worse in the morning

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.910
and gets a little better
in the evening.

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:13.000
In atypical depression, the
severity is less in the morning

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.340
and more severe in the evening.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:20.030
And the patients feel ward off
from themselves and others and say

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:24.300
that they feel painful loneliness
which is hard to escape even

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:25.950
when they're around other people.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:32.450
And we've shown that these patients
have those stress hormone levels,

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.370
have increased indices
of inflammation,

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:38.440 position:56%
have decreased activity of the
growth hormone or reproductive axes,

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:41.510
and they have increased
heart disease.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:45.530
I'm going to close
this with a concept

00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:47.350
that people becoming
more interested in

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.410
and I think will have
more biological markers

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:54.420
for in the next few years, but
it's the concept of resilience.

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:59.100
The American Phycological
Association defines resilience

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.680
as the process of adapting well
in the face of adversity, tragedy,

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:10.740
trauma, threats, and even
significant sources of threat.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.400
Then what confirms resiliences?

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.530
There are genetic factors.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:18.690
If one identical-- in identical
twins, if one has PTSD,

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:23.190
the other twin has a
40% chance of having it.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:27.200
So even though they share
100% of their genes,

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.370
there's not a 100% of concordance.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.370
So 60% of it is environmental.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:38.030
Repeated childhood trauma
to uncontrollable stressors.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:44.590
And people that study children
who were housed in institutions

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.660
and those who were adopted
later, they study them,

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.360
they were more anxious, and
they did bring scans on them,

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:54.950
and they had amygdala-- amygdalae

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:57.490
that were increased
in size and activity.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:02.690
On the other hand, mild to
moderate controllable stress early

00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:06.400
in life can have an
inoculating effect.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:10.990
Such experience leads to increased
neuroplasticity and neurogenesis,

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:14.470
and increases the size of the
subgenual prefrontal cortex.

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:19.480
An enriched, nurturing environment
and early life with exposure

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:24.650
to manageable novelty increases
resilience later in life.

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:29.690
Positive emotion, optimism,
loving caretakers, flexibility,

00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:32.970
the capacity to reframe adversity,

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:37.190
and strong social support
also increase resiliency.

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:41.300
And finally altruism,
commitment to a valid cause,

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.880
a capacity to extract meaning from
adverse situations, and a tolerance

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.640
for emotional pain and sadness
promote resiliency as well.

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:53.810
And people are developing a panel
of biomarkers for resiliency

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:58.290
that hopefully can-- will be
validated in the years to come.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:02.160
So I'll stop at this
point and take questions.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.960
OK.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:11.060
[ Applause ]

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.690
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure, I actually
understood some of the chart

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:20.150
and things that when you're
talking about a depressed person

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:26.000
and then a nondepressed
person and compare things,

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.450
did you have a depressed person

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:34.530
and then a depressed person
who-- after treatment?

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:35.830
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Most

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:37.400
of the depressed people
we've studied we hope

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.580
to study while they're
not on treatment

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:47.650 position:56%
so that the studies are not
confused by the impacts of the drug.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:51.560
So all the patients that
I showed you were people

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.370
who were depressed
but medication free.

00:49:54.370 --> 00:49:55.670
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:57.970
Thanks.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:03.960
&gt;&gt; Well, in response to the last
question, I'm a little bit puzzled

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.290
by the definition of depression.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:11.310 position:56%
Is there a neurobiological correlate
that enables you to identify it

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.370
or do you just go by
patient's report?

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:15.590
Is it just that the patient
is seeking treatment?

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.720
I mean, I look for lessons in
your account and it seems to me,

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.330
one of the lesion is we all ought
to be taking antidepressants

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:23.210
because it's going to
improve our brains.

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:24.880
I'm sure that's not
what you intended?

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.180
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Yeah.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.040
&gt;&gt; But it would be nice to know
what exactly is the working medical

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.900
definition of depression
and then a correlate

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:34.830 position:56%
that is is there a precise
neurobiological correlate in a sense

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:38.090
that with runner's high we know
it's in Keflins and endorphins.

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:39.390
What is it for depression?

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:40.690
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold:
Well, runner's high--

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:42.300
it's the same problem
with runner's high.

00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.950
There is overlap in
these abnormalities

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.540
between depressed patients
and controls.

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:49.770
They're not completely separated.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:54.190
So we don't have what is a
definitive biomarker and that is,

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.740
I think, one of the
most active areas

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:59.630 position:56%
of research, in depression research.

00:50:59.630 --> 00:51:02.870
They have many abnormalities that
is levels of things that are higher

00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:10.080
or lower, systems that seemed
to be going array together

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:16.700
and complications which make sense
in terms of those abnormalities,

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.290
but not a definitive
biological marker,

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:21.310
which I think would
be the holy grail.

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:24.880
And I think it'll probably
be a genetic marker.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.510
&gt;&gt; OK. So why shouldn't we take
antidepressants for neurogenesis?

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: I don't know.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:35.610
&gt;&gt; Well, I got a lesson
from you then.

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you for that.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.610
In addition to genetics
and childhood trauma,

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:58.220
I'm wondering to what extent
environmental factors like air,

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:03.620
food, et cetera play in the
development of depression?

00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.920
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: I don't
know if there are any data

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:09.160
about environmental
factors like air.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:14.830
There are scattered reports for
that being one predisposing factor

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:20.860
to depression with a number
of other factors involved.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.740
But they're not real
systematic studies of these kinds

00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.040
of environmental factors.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:32.360
There are more studies that have
to do with adverse psychological

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:38.820
and physical environments for
children and so forth and adults.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.960
Yes?

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you Phil.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.120
That was a really interesting talk.

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:51.620
You seem to-- well, more
than suggest, but you--

00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:58.480 position:56%
we are stacking an evolutionary
loop in the sense that we are living

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:05.270
with a system that is
wired for a primitive time.

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:06.570
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Yes.

00:53:06.570 --> 00:53:12.840
&gt;&gt; And, you know, there are course
in the evolutionary trajectory.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.130
We have lost hair, we have
increased our head size,

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:24.310
we've done enormous advances to
adjust to our modern lifestyle,

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:29.780
how-- what do you-- how can you
speak to the fact that this is one

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.920
of place where the human
body has not evolved?

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.330
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold:
It's a very good question.

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:35.630
I don't know.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:41.200 position:56%
Because the anxiety is so necessary
for survival and we're so surrounded

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.690
by stressors and especially early
in our environment but even now,

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.870
that I'm not sure there
have been mutations

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:53.790
that weaken stress response
that increase survival better.

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:56.510
I don't have a really good
answer for that, but it's true.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:54:08.060
We've evolved in some ways,
apparently not in this way.

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.360
Yes.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.290
&gt;&gt; You pointed out that depressed
people have increased insulin

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:17.390
resistance and other markers that
normally would lead to obesity

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:19.130
in depressed peo-- yet, so--

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:23.490
but the medications also get
blamed for causing weight gain.

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:24.790
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Right.

00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:26.400
&gt;&gt; So, if you don't treat the
patient then they're going

00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:30.640
to gain weight, so what-- which
is really the better way to go?

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.940
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Right.

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:34.950
The insulin resistance usually
occurs in the melancholic patients

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:38.890
who are also lose their appetite.

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:41.570
So they don't become
obese in that regard.

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:46.200 position:56%
And there are some
antidepressants do cause weight gain

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:49.020
but newer antidepressants
are coming along

00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:50.780
that don't have that side effect.

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:58.290
But there are serious side
effects of some antidepressant.

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:02.020
&gt;&gt; Phil. This goes back
to the first question.

00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:06.960
And I'm not sure I fully
understood the answer so I'm going

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.280
to press you a little on this.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:14.340
If I understood correctly, you
have characterized depression

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:20.020
as a progressive disease and
not a simple biochemical issue.

00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:24.470
You have described different
kinds or variations on the theme

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:29.690
of depression that different
kinds of depressed people.

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:36.520 position:56%
The phenomenon I'm mostly interested
in is that the confidence--

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:44.230
scientific confidence that can
be expressed to capture this

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:51.410
in that way that when I'm
getting to hear is the indicators

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:56.520
and the extent to which they are
definitive markers for depression

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:00.980
and what's behind the
question is in the experience,

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:05.410
and I suspect they're not the only
one who has had-- has people--

00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:10.180 position:56%
have people with depression in their
family, but there's a large part

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:13.920
of the family that rejects
depression as a disease

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:19.420
or a physical illness and instead
looks for a character weakness.

00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:22.780
And if there were definitive
scientific marker

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:26.080
that would I think help
in terms of reactions.

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.380
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Well,

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:31.660 position:56%
I think that there have longitudinal
studies, neuroimaging studies

00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:33.950
that show that the loss of volume

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:39.050
of that subgenual prefrontal
cortex is progressive over time.

00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:43.430 position:56%
And that the changes in the amygdala
are also progressive over time.

00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:45.800
There are also some
data, this doesn't apply

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.090
to every depressed
patient by any means,

00:56:48.090 --> 00:56:51.150
but there's an epidemiological
sense especially

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:55.770 position:56%
with recurrent depressions that this
is already gets worse over time.

00:56:55.770 --> 00:57:00.430
The episodes are more severe
and they come closer together.

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:05.740
And rather than requiring an
environmental precipitant,

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:08.530
they occur autonomously.

00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:14.690
But I think those are
the data that we have.

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:18.140
But I think that given
all the imaging data,

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.960
the physiological data,

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.760
the responses to pharmacological
treatments and so forth,

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.830
the fact that it's a-- and the
systemic disease that patients

00:57:29.830 --> 00:57:34.180
with depression get, that it's
fundamentally incontrovertible,

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:35.840
that really is a systemic disease.

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:40.430
The World Health Organization
recently had an international

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:47.940
conference where they decried
the propensity for people

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:52.980
to see depression as a
personal failure in view

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:58.390
of the incontrovertible data
about its biological roots

00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:01.480
and urged more money for research

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:05.180
and treatment facilities
to treat it.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:09.270
Sixty percent of depressed patients
in the United States are untreated.

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.560
Yes.

00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:24.090
&gt;&gt; Thank you for bringing
this and talk.

00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:28.510
You mentioned at one point
that in terms of a certain type

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:32.890
of depression, anxiety is
the cardinal manifestation.

00:58:32.890 --> 00:58:36.800
So I'm wondering what
is the difference

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:42.740
between an anxiety disorder and
depression which has anxiety

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.990
as its cardinal manifestation?

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:47.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: You
know, I think, you know,

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:49.730
they both respond to
similar medications.

00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:53.190
They have some genetic
roots in common.

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:54.930
I think there's an overlap.

00:58:54.930 --> 00:58:59.620
One of the things that is absent in
anxiety disorder is the upsetness

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:02.930
with itself, a feeling
of worthlessness.

00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:06.490
People with that kind of
anxiety disorder are more worried

00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:13.470
about accidents, things happening
that could harm them and so forth

00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:19.500
or coming down with certain disease
that can shorten their lives,

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:24.580
but not this anguish
over the state itself

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:29.710
that is the cardinal manifestation
of melancholic depression.

00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:33.840
Anxiety disorders generally are
not associated with alterations

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:39.390
in appetite or sleep and some
of the neurovegetative findings.

00:59:39.390 --> 00:59:45.070
They don't necessarily
have increases in secretion

00:59:45.070 --> 00:59:46.880
of cortisol and norepinephrine.

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.410
They're generally normal
in patients with anxieties

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:53.480
or where there is genetic
and clinical overlap.

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.780
That's a good question.

00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:02.720
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] depression that
hopefully will go away in its own.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.130
But is there a current
research that we can learn

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:11.480
from like how long is too long
to have situational depression

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.520
and if it might turn into major
depression and should we run

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.410
for treatment after
a certain timeframe?

01:00:17.410 --> 01:00:18.710
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Right.

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:21.480
Well, you know, the diagnostic
criteria, say, only after two weeks

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.570
of major depressive symptoms.

01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:28.120
But ones that are really
severe, early morning awakening,

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.760
loss of weight, loss of appetite,
terrible upsetness with self,

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.790
relative incapacity and so forth.

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:38.110
So they say that really
after two weeks,

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.100
but I would watch longer than that.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:45.810
But I think if something
going on for a month or so,

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:50.330
I would begin to feel
concerned about it.

01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:53.760
That one issue is there
used to be the idea

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.630
that if there were a situation

01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:58.400
that cause a depression,
it was not biological.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.850
I don't think that's the case.

01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:03.020
I think stress often
precipitates depression,

01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:09.580
a loss in the personal
realm or of a loved one.

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:12.050
And people can become depressed

01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:15.640
and remained depressed
after those losses.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:20.340
And they should-- it should not be
considered that they are impervious

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.740
to depression, but are merely sad,

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.040
if they really show
all the manifestations

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.600
of depressive disorder.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.830
It is the phenomenology rather

01:01:30.830 --> 01:01:39.890
than the precipitant
I think that matters.

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:41.420
Yes.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.790
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:01:42.790 --> 01:01:49.710
Just as we have public awareness
on drugs, STDs from your lecture,

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:54.020
I'm beginning to think that
we may now be at this stage

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:56.830
in which we have to mount
the public awareness on this?

01:01:56.830 --> 01:01:58.330
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold:
I think that's right.

01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:02.990
The NIMH is mounting that but
it has a limited resources.

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:08.790
But I think that over time and as
the new findings are coming out,

01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:12.890 position:56%
more neuroimaging findings, the
kind of findings that Dr. Zarate has

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:18.420
with immediate responses
to new drugs and genetics,

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:21.080
I think we'll capture the
imagination of the public

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:25.460
and make it clear that it's a
serious disorder that's progressive

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.100
and it needs to be treated.

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.320
&gt;&gt; Hi there.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.550
I'm a psychotherapist working
in East Tennessee with children,

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.990
adolescents and adults, and
I was particularly interested

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:41.040
in your brief tour
resilience in children.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.480
And when you're working
with children

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.380
who have not necessarily
have that resilience,

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:48.360
perhaps have reactive
attachment disorder,

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.490
is there research being going on,
are you doing some things about how

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:57.120
to help a child get resilience
if they don't already have it?

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.600
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: You
know, I'm not an expert

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:02.560
and I've read some papers
and there are strategies

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:07.750
to develop resilience, you
know, promoting challenges

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:15.130 position:56%
that are manageable with the support
of assistance of an adult and

01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:18.700
or ward and progressively
increasing the challenge

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.400
and systematically
going ahead like that.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.490
&gt;&gt; It's over time.

01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:26.790
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Yeah.

01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:28.090
OK. One more question I think.

01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:29.950
Yes.

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:33.380
&gt;&gt; Sir, perhaps this is
appropriate for the last question.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.030
What is the state of the art

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:38.700
in repairing the brain
from this disease?

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:43.990
What can we do, what do you
expect we'll be able to do

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:48.320
to repair the neurology
that's the genesis of this?

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold:
There's been--

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:54.650
They're into efforts to do pcych--
so-called psychosurgery, you--

01:03:54.650 --> 01:03:57.440
implanting electrodes

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.990
in treatment-resistant depressed
patients who had terrible

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:04.380
and completely treatment-resistant
depressed patients.

01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:07.080
The insertion of an electrode

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.540 position:56%
and stimulating the subgenual
prefrontal cortex produces immediate

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:18.190
and sometimes lasting response.

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:21.960
And also there have been
electrodes that have been placed

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.100
into the reward center

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:27.180
and stimulating the
reward center also seems

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:32.980
to produce an antidepressant
response.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:37.450
I think people are working on all
kinds of ways trying to influence,

01:04:37.450 --> 01:04:44.380
you know, the brain activity
without being invasive.

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:49.320
There are now magnetic resonance
treatments for depressions.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:54.000
Some people even say that
MRIs are helpful for treatment

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.380
with depression and
other noninvasive ways

01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.260
of affecting many areas.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:06.730
As we learn more about the areas
that are affected and find others

01:05:06.730 --> 01:05:12.230
that may be larger and more
amenable to external manipulation.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:17.330
That may be new strategies for
treating depression that way.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:21.630
&gt;&gt; Do you believe it will actually
prepare ourselves eventually?

01:05:21.630 --> 01:05:23.840
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold:
It's a good question.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.630
I think that we will know
enough about cellular repair

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:38.100
in neurogenesis and other factors
that repair would be possible.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:42.120
Also, psychotherapy is very
important in treating depression.

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.570
And the best treatment for
depression is a combination

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:46.920
of psychotherapy and medication.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.900
That is by far more effective.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.030
And there have been data
that show that people

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:57.830
who have successfully responded to
psychotherapy have positive changes

01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:00.390
in the subgenual prefrontal
cortex and the amygdala

01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:02.060
and in the ventral striatum.

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:07.520
So experience can also
modify the brain.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:11.510
Thank you.

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:18.510
[ Applause ]

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:30.250
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

01:06:30.250 --> 01:06:34.080
Our next speaker is
Dr. Carlos Zarate,

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:38.530
who runs a very large
laboratory and research program

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:42.730
at the NIH Clinical
Center, looking for new

01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:45.480 position:56%
and rapid antidepressant treatments.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:49.910
He's made, where I considered
many do conceal the most important

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:53.700
discovery perhaps in the last
25 years in studying depression

01:06:53.700 --> 01:07:00.810
and that is the capacity of
economy to induce a remission

01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:06.270 position:56%
in treatment-resistant patients with
depression in as a little as a half

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:09.460
in hour and sometime
lasting for days.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:11.000
And I know he's just
published the paper

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.950
that is actually has
discovered other compounds

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:23.360
that can do this even better that
they're attempting to develop

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.510
and synthesize to treat depression.

01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:28.830
And anytime you get an effective
treatment with depression,

01:07:28.830 --> 01:07:32.080
you also have a tremendously
important tool for figuring

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:36.680
out the mechanism of
the depressive syndrome.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.190
If you know what's the drug is
and it's make people better,

01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:43.120
then you learn something
about the underlying disease.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.320
So I'd like to call on Dr. Zarate.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.510
He will reveal his experience
with this very promising field.

01:07:49.510 --> 01:08:06.790
[ Applause ]

01:08:06.790 --> 01:08:09.090
&gt;&gt; Sure.

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:15.970
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate
Jr: Good afternoon.

01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:19.440
Thank you so much Dr.
Gold and others

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.760
for inviting me her
to speak of our work.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.510
And I've a series of cartoons
and animation, hopefully,

01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:29.460
will summarize our work
and make it understandable.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:33.010
And at the end, I'll be
glad to take questions.

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:36.070
So the title of today's talk is
Relief from Severe Depression

01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:38.430
and Suicidal Thoughts from--

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:46.160
within hours and our work going
from synapses to symptoms,

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.350
and most recently two
candidate drugs

01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:52.610
that can actually accomplish
this rapid response.

01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:53.930
This is my disclosure.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:56.720
I'm a full time employer
in the federal government

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.820
with the National Institute
of Mental Health.

01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:02.480
So, briefly summarizing,

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.850
mood disorders is common
chronic and recurrent.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:08.140
We have major depressive
disorder and bipolar disorder.

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:12.840
Our next speaker will go more
in detail into bipolar disorder.

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.880
But it's not only-- presents itself
as manifestations of problems

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.570
of mood, but there's problems of
behavior, now circadian rhythms

01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:22.380
and activity level is crucial.

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:25.390
We'll see problems with excess
activity levels or mania

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:28.390
and decreased activity
levels during depression.

01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:29.690
And why is that?

01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:33.500 position:56%
Well, if you ask our patients or
their family members, it's very hard

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.140
to recall in the past
states of elevated energy

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:40.090 position:56%
and mood based on subjective report.

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:44.040
What is very easy or
easier to recognize is

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.580
when they have increased activity
levels that they can go on

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:50.650
and on our patients for
hours without sleeping.

01:09:50.650 --> 01:09:53.620
And now it's not viewed
as Dr. Gold mentioned,

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:57.000
simply as neurochemical
disturbances, but the mood

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.940
and the behaviors are
the-- in circadian rhythm,

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:02.370
disturbances are the
results of disturbances

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:04.040
as synapses and circuits.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.410
But these synapses and
circuits, of course, are--

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:10.570
have influences from genetics
and environment as well.

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:14.380
Now, we have a general negative in
mood-behavior has been reported.

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:16.710
Most of our patients
have both depression

01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:19.060
and anxiety at the same time.

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.060
There is irritability.

01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:23.950
Many of our patients are
very angry and hostile

01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:27.010
and that's unfortunately a concept
that has been lost over the years

01:10:27.010 --> 01:10:29.680
in terms of what you see
with your patients is really

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:33.130
that there's hostility and
risk of violence and suicide.

01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:36.630
There is also the opposite extreme

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:38.960
which is the manic
mood and behavior.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.780
We have excess energy
levels, activity levels

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:43.080
and increased risk-taking behavior.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:46.280
We're not going to get more into
that because our next speaker will.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.990
But towards the right,
you see an image

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:51.990
of the same person during their
state of depression, sitting still,

01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:55.460
looking in a distance, probably
have a poverty of thoughts,

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:57.960
thinking probably of death,
not eating and not sleeping.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:00.960
And that's actually what
you see in the same woman

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.750
at the opposite extreme, where
you could see probably dressed

01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:09.700 position:56%
with many layers of clothes, given
belongings away, so on and so forth.

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:13.990 position:56%
Our patients can have also psychotic
symptoms or cognitive symptoms.

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:18.160 position:56%
The psychotic symptoms are impaired
reality test and psychotic symptom--

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:20.300
and cognitive symptom
is destructibility

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.000
and impaired cognition.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.160
And what's very interesting in
our patients with both depression

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.850
and with bipolar disorder, you
could have a mixture of any

01:11:27.850 --> 01:11:31.010
of these symptoms over
the course of your life.

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:34.340
And one episode is not necessarily
the same as another episode.

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:37.460
You may have had 30 years
which makes it very difficult

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.970
to diagnose our patient's
accurately.

01:11:40.970 --> 01:11:43.330
Now, we talk about
symptoms and categories,

01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:45.940
but this is a real
patient, one of our patients

01:11:45.940 --> 01:11:48.680
on the research unit
here in Bethesda.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.120
This is Bob, a 53-year-old
married male with a 35 year history

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:57.640
of severe, refractory major
depression, co-morbid anxiety,

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.560
phobia, PTSD, and alcohol
dependence.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.490
Has had 10 major depressive
episodes.

01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:07.200
Mother had anxiety disorder,
brother had a history

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.700
of depression and alcohol abuse.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:13.460
He, very smart, went to school,
the best schools, got a BS, was--

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:18.730 position:56%
running big prominent organizations,
had a suicide attempt with overdose

01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:21.620
of nortriptyline, that's one
of our treatments or Pamelor

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:24.790
for depression, and nearly died.

01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:27.940
Was admitted to our hospital
with thoughts of stabbing himself

01:12:27.940 --> 01:12:32.980
with a knife or driving
off a cliff with a car.

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.280
I'll come back to Bob later on.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:39.920
Now, as been mentioned before,
these are very commonly associated

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.780
with manic conditions,
other psychiatric disorders,

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:46.240
if you have depression, but
the very impair and in terms

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.870
of the amount of disability.

01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:51.900
This is a rank order list of
the conditions or disorders

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.560
that are associated from
number one to number seven

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.430
of those causing major disability.

01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:59.450
And you can see what is at the top.

01:12:59.450 --> 01:13:01.090
Neuropsychiatric disorders.

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:04.020
We have mental-behavioral
disorders much more

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:05.910
than neurological disorders.

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:09.700
But this group of categories
are much more disabling

01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:13.260
than cardiovascular disease,
musculoskeletal disease,

01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:15.460
diabetes and so on and so forth.

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:19.720
And remember, these are chronic
disabling disorders of the young

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.330
as already mentioned before.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.470
Cardiovascular disease
starts later in life.

01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:28.580 position:56%
But you have deprived and robbed our
young ones with having this illness.

01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.100
They have not been able
to date, finish school,

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.270
be able to buy their house,
get a job and so forth,

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:35.620
and they start with
disabling symptoms.

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.150
So we have to do better.

01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:39.340
These are the-- and not
only it is associated

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.810
with significant morbidity
but significant mortality.

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:43.620
These are lethal illnesses.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:48.220
If you look towards the left,
this is the peak, 1965 to 1995,

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.400
peak percent of the illness.

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:54.770
And what's happened with our-- with
the treatments over those decades

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:58.380
and how it's-- it affected
the prevalence or the rates

01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.680
of these illnesses over time.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:02.760
And you can see in general,
leukemia, ALL leukemia has come

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.720
down with new information
in terms of pathophysiology,

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.170
new treatments, so on and so forth.

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:09.680
We're doing a good job there.

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:11.060
And also in heart disease,

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:15.850 position:56%
you can now decrease one million
deaths per year with exercise, diet,

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:17.750
better medications and treatment.

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:19.460
We've also made progress in AIDS.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:24.840
As you know, people can now
live into very late age--

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:27.690 position:56%
years of their life with treatments.

01:14:27.690 --> 01:14:31.640
And also stroke, we can now, if
you show up to an emergency room

01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.650 position:56%
within two hours, one-third of there
can really have a good outcome.

01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:38.030
So very important, if you
have symptoms of stroke,

01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:39.940
go to emergency room right away.

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:43.560
However, look what
happens with suicide.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:49.440
Despite 50 years, 30 to 40
different antidepressants,

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.440
the rates of depression
have not decreased and--

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.140
for suicide has not
decreased over the years.

01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:58.320 position:56%
In fact, if you think of a measure
of success is decreased in the rates

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.040
of serious mental illness.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.260
Despite all our treatments, we've
not made a significant then.

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.520
In fact, the suicide is wrong.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.830 position:56%
In fact, there has been an increase.

01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:13.430
Recent report show actually there's
been a 24% increase in suicide.

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:16.370
That's a major issue and I'll
talk about a little bit later.

01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:20.350
Not only do you die
from-- because of suicide,

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:23.160
but the excess deaths
are due to other factors.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:27.450
Many of what Dr. Gold
has mentioned, problems--

01:15:27.450 --> 01:15:31.160 position:56%
proinflammatory conditions,
coagulation, homeostatic conditions,

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.720
so on and so forth, there's
an excess risk of death

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:37.540
from cardiovascular disease,
from suicide and from accidents.

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.350 position:56%
So our patients with mood disorders,

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:41.950
particularly bipolar
disorders die at younger age.

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:44.870
It's not unusual to
live 10 to 20 years less

01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:46.820
if you have a major mood disorder.

01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.560
And I'll already mentioned,
you start already

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.670
with significant disability
from young age.

01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:55.380
Now, this summarizes a little
bit what Dr. Gold was talking.

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:56.680
This is the course of illness.

01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:01.770
You have in the upper left corner
a diagram showing in the blue,

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:04.300
major depressive episodes,
yellow are the well-being,

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:06.170
the euthymic intervals and then

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:09.410
in green are the hypomanic
or manic episodes.

01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:12.890
And generally, for significant
number of our patients,

01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:15.940
as time goes by, your
depressions last longer.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:18.340
You can see in the figure,
they're more severe.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:21.190
And the good times are
the well being is shorter

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:23.160
and shorter, the yellow,
you can see.

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.670
Each of those episodes
have a significant impact.

01:16:25.670 --> 01:16:29.630 position:56%
We're already told about
significant impact on bone, on brain

01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:31.320
and heart and so on and so forth.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.780
You can see the personal disruption
to one's life, personal family,

01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:38.110
occupational disruption
significantly affected with each

01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:39.910
of those episodes, as well

01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:43.260
as economic well-being,
society is affected.

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.300
And then there's a risk
of suicidal behavior.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:50.620
Towards the bottom, you can see
how problematic our disorders are.

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:53.260
But it's even made worse that most

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.740
of the time you do not find
bipolar disorder alone.

01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:00.390 position:56%
Ninety percent of the time, you
find some other comorbid psychiatric

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:02.290
syndrome or disorder.

01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:06.220 position:56%
Seventy percent of the time you have
three or more psychiatric disorders,

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:09.630
each sometimes requiring
different types of treatment.

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:13.120
Towards the upper right, you see
a figure looking at the time of--

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.790
this study was about 120
patients with bipolar disorder

01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:20.300
that were followed for 13 years.

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:24.700
And you can see in the bars is
the percent of time in weeks

01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:26.450
that they have been affected.

01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:31.660
Half of the time of that 13
years, 6.5 years they spent in--

01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:35.000
having symptoms of the
illness, half of the time.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.210
One-third of the time
was in depression.

01:17:37.210 --> 01:17:38.860
The killer and the big
problem of our patient

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:41.530
with bipolar disorder
is the depression.

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:44.850
In about 5%, they had rapid for--

01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:48.230
rapid cycling or mixed forms
of the illness having both high

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.250
and low at the same time.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.080
Now, each episode causes

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.450
that significant social
individual disruption

01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:56.220
but it has the toll on the brain.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:59.060
And we talked about, has
already been mentioned,

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.280
towards the bottom
right are neurons,

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.580
the dendrites and the branches.

01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:07.020
There's atrophy and
shrinkage of the spine,

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.300
those places where
you have connection

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:10.790
from one circuit to another.

01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:14.850 position:56%
In this diagram, you can see here
that there's a, in the bottom right,

01:18:14.850 --> 01:18:18.140
a little circuit, and that

01:18:18.140 --> 01:18:23.780 position:56%
if it's intact might explain why are
patients have different symptoms.

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.240
Dr. Gold and I made both--

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.550
made criteria for major
depressive episode,

01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:29.760
but we overlapped on
only one symptom.

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.680
That's very common
and very possible.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:35.320
So depression, and people
are asking the definition is,

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.990
hundreds of disease.

01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:39.320
Hundreds, each with its
separate etiologies.

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:42.470
So, you can see how the clinical
presentation might vary from him

01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:43.980
to me and so on and so forth,

01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:46.510
depending on the circuits
that are affected.

01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:50.000
We see that, for example here, the
circuit is missing or it's affected

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.410
and you have anhedonia,
lack of drive and pleasure,

01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:54.690 position:56%
very common problem in our patients.

01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:56.250
And another circuit
might be affected

01:18:56.250 --> 01:19:01.150
and you have suicidal thoughts
or in fact suicidal behavior.

01:19:01.150 --> 01:19:03.780
So, towards the upper
left, we see the spines

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.100
and the circuits are very intact.

01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:07.040
That looks like a tree in spring.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:11.590 position:56%
We have branches and leaves that
can absorb the moisture and the rain

01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:13.850
and propagate the neurochemical
signal.

01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:17.260
Unfortunately, because of the
cortisol as mentioned by Dr. Gold,

01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:20.940
the gluco-- excess glucose and
glutamate, I'll talk about,

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:23.800
it looks like a tree on
winter, deprived of the branches

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:27.130
and the leaves that can absorb
the chemicals, the moisture

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:30.570
or the neurochemicals and
propagated downstream.

01:19:30.570 --> 01:19:33.870 position:56%
Towards the right, we see that
there are many possible explanations

01:19:33.870 --> 01:19:37.230
for the shrinkage or
atrophy of those branches,

01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:39.350
so it looks like a tree in winter.

01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:42.780
We have towards the
bottom right, we have BDNF,

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.120
brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.830
Those are the Miracle-Gro factors
which have you have in your garden

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:49.230
and make things branch out.

01:19:49.230 --> 01:19:52.780
There are also these natural
endogenous brain chemicals

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:56.010
that maintain the neurons
and the branches healthy.

01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:58.920
And you have the cortisol and
stress and so on and so forth.

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.220
So there's a different mechanisms.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:02.400
The one I will talk
is in the right--

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:04.920
on right side of the
figure called glutamate.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.720
Glutamate is an excitatory amino
acid and its regulation seems

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.660
to be important to depression.

01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:17.670
So, we talked about-- we have and
people have talked about criteria.

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:21.680
We have what we called DSM,
Diagnostic Statistical Manual,

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:25.820
and that has been one way of how
we communicate with each other

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:28.500
with families, our
patients and with clinicians

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.010 position:56%
on our patient who's in front of us.

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:34.080
So it is a common language for
describing psychopathology.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.570
In general, we do a fairly good
job describing and agreeing

01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:40.800
that this person has a
major depressive episode.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.730
There, unfortunately,
is a significant overlap

01:20:43.730 --> 01:20:45.150
in symptoms and syndromes.

01:20:45.150 --> 01:20:49.160
I already mentioned
how there's 40 to 50%

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.880
of our patients have many
comorbid psychiatric disorders

01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:56.320
and the symptoms unfortunately
do not map onto the brain.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.310
And so that has been one of the
reasons why we have not been able

01:20:59.310 --> 01:21:00.970
to find more effective treatments.

01:21:00.970 --> 01:21:04.130
And so, what had-- has been
proposed at the National Institute

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:08.370
of Mental Health, NIMH, is to break
it down into the more simpler--

01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:13.750
to more simple elements, anhedonia,
motor activity or drive, suicide.

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:18.620
In those trends, you can then
understand it in a better way.

01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:22.470
Going into units of analysis
all the way, for example,

01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:25.500
in anhedonia from the behavior lack
of driving pleasure, staying in bed

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:28.850
and not enjoying things all the way
to genetics, going through circuits

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:31.720
and cells and that will give
us a better understanding

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.440
of these illnesses.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.270 position:56%
And RDoC does focus on understanding
the more simple elements

01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:40.810
that cross-- go across
many of these disorders.

01:21:40.810 --> 01:21:44.400
You can have anhedonia and panic
and obsessive-compulsive disorder

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:48.330
and depression or schizophrenia
for that matter.

01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:50.520
Now, what do we know--
need new treatments?

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:53.360
Well, OK, there's you know, 30,
40 different antidepressants,

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:58.880
and this is the time course
of discovery from the 1950's.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:01.600
And we've started-- the first
antidepressant was discovered

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:05.170
by serendipity, and that's
unfortunately what happens

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:06.470
in psychiatry.

01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:08.900
Clinical observation which is a
good thing, and I think will lead

01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:13.070
to continued discoveries is
really the only way we've come

01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:16.350 position:56%
up with better treatments, just by
observing our patients being exposed

01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:18.050
to different medicines out there.

01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:21.480
The first was a drug, an
antibiotic given for tuberculosis.

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:24.740
It was given at high doses and they
noticed the patients were dancing

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:26.790
in their units and
enjoying themselves

01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:29.410
and talking a mile a
minute and not sleeping.

01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:33.320
And so, then people thought,
Oh, this, you know, you're high,

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.710
that means it's probably good for
your depression and started coming

01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:39.470
up with different forms of it,
known as the MAO inhibitors,

01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:41.200
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:44.970
And then the next 50 years,
it was trying to go, well,

01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:47.600
the first few drugs were
nonselective affecting serotonin,

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.840
norepinephrine, dopamine,
choline, cholinergic systems.

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:54.670
And people said, the industry said,
"Oh, they're not well tolerated

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:56.980
and they're very lethal
in overdose", like tric--

01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:00.090
like nortriptyline, like
Bob was taking, Pamelor.

01:23:00.090 --> 01:23:02.010
So let's go to more
simpler antidepressant

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:06.280 position:56%
that affect predominantly serotonin,
you know that as the SSRIs, Prozac,

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:08.610
Zoloft, Paxil, so on and so forth.

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:10.810
And then some of the clinicians
out there and patients said, "Well,

01:23:10.810 --> 01:23:12.530
probably they're not as
effective as the older one."

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:15.870
OK, let's go back to two,
dual reuptake inhibitors,

01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:18.620
two neurotransmitter, SNRIs.

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:22.090
And then now there's-- going back
to triple reuptake inhibitors.

01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:25.670
So most of drug discovery
has been about me, two drugs.

01:23:25.670 --> 01:23:28.910
They're pretty much the same,
serotonin-norepinephrine.

01:23:28.910 --> 01:23:32.290 position:56%
Most of the patients probably do not
benefit much more than what we have

01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:33.590
from existing treatments.

01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:36.940
So they are suboptimal.

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:39.320
Clinicians, patients
and family said, "Well,

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:41.250
probably our medications
are not effective.

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:45.500
And so not effective or effective
for some, let's figure it out."

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:49.860
So NIMH did do this very
large study called STAR D.

01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:53.090
That was a systemic way
of giving levels of care.

01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:56.250
Everybody at level I started
with the first antidepressant,

01:23:56.250 --> 01:23:59.380
citalopram, for 10 to 14 weeks.

01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:01.330
If you didn't respond, you
went to the next for 10

01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:03.420
to 14 weeks, so on and so forth.

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:07.170
OK. What we've-- What we
see in the first bar is

01:24:07.170 --> 01:24:10.950
that about 33%, 36%
achieve remission.

01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:12.420
Remission means doing very well.

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:14.960
But it took 10 to 14 weeks.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:19.690
Moving to the second bar, 50%
achieved remission, but that takes

01:24:19.690 --> 01:24:23.000
about 6 months to antidepressant
transfer half

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:24.420
of our people to achieve remission.

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:27.110
That's way too slow in my opinion.

01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:30.520
And then after four treatments
including psychotherapies,

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.900
I didn't mentioned here,
one year later, only--

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.840
one-third are still not
achieving remission, one-third.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:41.420
And not only that, of those
who responded, begin 40 to 60%

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:45.100
in those first two
bars are relapsing.

01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:51.140
So what we see is low remission
rates, a significant lag of onset,

01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:54.110
personal-social problems and
the risk of killing yourself

01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:57.560
if the medication is not
working or the therapy.

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.600 position:56%
OK. This is drug discovery for those

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.550
who are interested in
the economics of it.

01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:04.740
This is how we develop drugs.

01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:08.780
OK. We come up with-- we have
preclinical and clinical phases.

01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:11.990
This takes about 15 years and 4

01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:17.120
to $11 billion studying 10,000
compounds to get one possibly

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.140
that might make it to the market.

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.580 position:56%
OK. And these are the success rates.

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:23.510
Infectious disease, the highest.

01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:25.600
Why? Because we know
what the targets are.

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:29.430
OK. The lowest are, what, brain
disorders because they're complex

01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:32.210
and we really don't know
what the exact targets are.

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:34.920
The success rates for
CNS is about 8%

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.300
after spilling all--
spending all that money.

01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:43.960
And you can see why industry has
been leaving psychiatry altogether.

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.470
Now, this is a summary of why
we need improved therapeutics

01:25:47.470 --> 01:25:48.840
and what happens.

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:53.160
In this cartoon, you see in
blue the depressive episode.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:54.510
We started antidepressant.

01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:56.720
OK. Any of them currently
on a market,

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:58.830
it takes about 10 to 14 weeks.

01:25:58.830 --> 01:26:02.500
They affect monoamine systems which
is serotonin and norepinephrine.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:03.800
That's what I mean.

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.880
Our goal is to shift this
curve towards the left

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.400
so that the next generation
treatment, we will have treatments

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.890
that work in a few hours that
way [inaudible] depression use

01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:14.330
[phonetic] suicidal thoughts.

01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:17.630
And if you remember, that
time I showed the figure

01:26:17.630 --> 01:26:20.330
over your lifespan, how much
time you spend in depression.

01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:24.160
Imagine for each of those episodes
which range from 4 to 9, average,

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.250 position:56%
number of episodes for each patient,

01:26:26.250 --> 01:26:29.420
or half of the time you
spent ill in your life.

01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:32.950
Within one to three days, if
you have symptoms of depression

01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:34.500
and you treat that, it goes away,

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:36.210
and the next one it
comes it goes away,

01:26:36.210 --> 01:26:39.290
you can imagine the
cumulative number of episodes,

01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:42.990
accumulative depression of your
lifetime will be very short,

01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:45.850
thus your health, physical, as
Dr. Gold said will be better

01:26:45.850 --> 01:26:47.150
and your brain will be better.

01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:51.240
So that is the goal of our program
is to develop rapid-acting agents.

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.910
We come up with targets,
in this case, glutamate.

01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:58.110
Our studies are what was
mentioned, drug-free, double blind,

01:26:58.110 --> 01:27:02.170
placebo control on our inpatient
unit here, a few miles from here.

01:27:02.170 --> 01:27:06.590
And we study multiple biomarkers,
both peripheral blood measures

01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:10.160
and brain measures at the same time
to better understand our patient.

01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:12.660
So our patients are great
and they really spend--

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.030
altruism was mentioned.

01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:17.370 position:56%
They're really altruistic and really
want to understand these diseases

01:27:17.370 --> 01:27:20.730
and help others to come
up with better treatments.

01:27:20.730 --> 01:27:24.430 position:56%
So towards the upper right, you see
that we are looking at interventions

01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:27.590
that cause rapid antidepressants
effects such as ketamine,

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:28.890
an anesthetic, I'll take

01:27:28.890 --> 01:27:31.080
about scopolamine,
that's for sea sickness.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.770
We're also looking now
at neuro devices, TMS,

01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:35.920
electroconvulsive therapy.

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.710
So our studies are double
blind, placebo controlled,

01:27:39.710 --> 01:27:41.840
and what we do is at the beginning,

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:46.010
we obtain multiple biological
measures and what we try

01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:49.570
to do is link these with our
traditional rating scales

01:27:49.570 --> 01:27:53.170
of depression which are not good,
but it's all we have at this time.

01:27:53.170 --> 01:27:55.980
And we obtain responders
or nonresponders.

01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:58.240
The goal of this is to link
the biological measure,

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:02.220
whatever that might be,
with our depression scores

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:04.650
to see who's the respondent and
nonrespondent so that we can come

01:28:04.650 --> 01:28:07.610
up with more biologically-enriched
subgroup.

01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:10.280
I already talked about
depression is hundreds of diseases.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.180
This strategy will lead to more
enriched group to really tease

01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:17.510
out what is the etiology
of these illnesses.

01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:21.450
And not only that, we obtain
these biological measures before,

01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:22.990
during the study, and
after the study.

01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:25.760
And I'll give very brief
examples about that.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.810
That rather than focusing on
what is the cause of depression,

01:28:30.810 --> 01:28:33.210
because we talked it's hard,
hundreds of depressions.

01:28:33.210 --> 01:28:36.130
We're going to figure
out what is the mechanism

01:28:36.130 --> 01:28:38.230
of the response process.

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.190
Who response and not response?

01:28:40.190 --> 01:28:41.490
And why is that important?

01:28:41.490 --> 01:28:43.880
Well, response is probably going to
be more similar across individuals

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:46.970
in depression and at
least that's the belief.

01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:50.400
So, one area let's look at
is the glutamate system.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:52.670
OK. And I'll talk a
little bit what this does,

01:28:52.670 --> 01:28:55.890
evidence in postmortem studies,

01:28:55.890 --> 01:29:00.840
looking at people who've had
depression or who have suicided.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.210
There is evidence that some of the
glutamate receptors are affected

01:29:04.210 --> 01:29:07.630
in the brain and there's
also evidence through--

01:29:07.630 --> 01:29:12.070
we use assays or what we called
animal models of depression,

01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:13.830
animals that are stressed.

01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:18.380
And for example, forced swim test,
you have animals in the cylinders,

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:21.300
Plexiglas that are
struggle, struggle.

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:23.840
That's viewed as a good sign,
but when they stop struggling,

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.520
that's viewed as helpless
as they've given up.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.590
And that's supposed
to mimic depression.

01:29:28.590 --> 01:29:30.870
And I said, well, you know,
you do that in a few minutes,

01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:32.900
but our patients have been
depressed for 30 years,

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:34.200
is that a really good model?

01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:35.500
Probably not.

01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:39.260
But it's what we had been
relying on for 50 years or so.

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:44.460 position:56%
But there was early evidence that
the-- or antidepressant affected a--

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:46.330
or glutamate receptor called NMDA,

01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:49.940
and that's going be very
important as I talk about.

01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:52.710
And that if you give drugs
that block that receptor,

01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:57.040
those animals that were made to be
stressed and depressed got better.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:05.730 position:56%
And so in early study done in the
year 2000, trying to study cognition

01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:08.350
because that's really affected in
our patient with schizophrenia,

01:30:08.350 --> 01:30:09.780
psychosis and depression,

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:11.700
notice that the depressed
patients got better.

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.900
Seven or 8 patients got better

01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:17.140
within a few hours
and that was ketamine.

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:21.760
And so we have done for the work on
that and I'll talk about that now.

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:25.990
OK. This is a very simple
diagram explaining the glutamate.

01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:28.940
OK. Glutamate are those
little white balls there.

01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:33.110
We have three, the top is
the presynaptic neuron,

01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:34.730
the bottom is the postsynaptic
neuron

01:30:34.730 --> 01:30:36.610
and towards the right,
we have the glia.

01:30:36.610 --> 01:30:40.870
This is the tripartite system,
important for regulating glutamate.

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:43.230
Glutamate is an excitatory
amino acid.

01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:44.950
It's very important for learning,

01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:48.130
memory and the plasticity
Dr. Gold mentioned.

01:30:48.130 --> 01:30:50.830
OK. So it synthesized and store

01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:54.330
in these little presynaptic
vesicles and it's released.

01:30:54.330 --> 01:30:56.750
And it's very tightly regulated.

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:59.330
And it's believed that if
the levels are excessive,

01:30:59.330 --> 01:31:02.520
that leads to neurodegenerative
disease such as Alzheimer's,

01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:05.480
Parkinson's and in
this case, depression.

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.660
Depression might be
more the regulation

01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:09.750
or the cycling of the system.

01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:13.490
There're mechanisms to
control the amount of glutamate

01:31:13.490 --> 01:31:16.530
within that space,
extracellular space.

01:31:16.530 --> 01:31:20.820
One is the EAAT, excitatory
amino acid transporter,

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:23.790
that grabs the glutamate
and puts inside the glia.

01:31:23.790 --> 01:31:25.090
That's the cell in the right.

01:31:25.090 --> 01:31:28.470
And there is this metabotropic,
mGlu.

01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:31.780
That's the thermostat that goes up
and down based on the temperature

01:31:31.780 --> 01:31:34.360
of the room, goes up and down
based on the amount of glutamate.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:39.290
And then there's the postsynaptic
receptors, NMDA and the AMPA.

01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:43.090
All these, the Miracle-Gro,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor

01:31:43.090 --> 01:31:45.830
that leads to the spines,
very healthy trees

01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:51.070 position:56%
in connections is what the glutamate
is important for, plasticity.

01:31:51.070 --> 01:31:53.560
And what happens in depression?

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:56.450
The nondepressed looks like this,
very health, we talked about,

01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:58.270
and in our depressed patients.

01:31:58.270 --> 01:32:02.190
OK. So it's not s much about
regulating glutamate but even

01:32:02.190 --> 01:32:06.420 position:56%
if you regulate dopamine, serotonin,
glutamate, what is important

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:07.720
to have that tree healthy.

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.460
And so our treatments have
to be plasticity enhancers,

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:13.850
make that tree going from
winter to spring and be healthy.

01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:17.910
OK. Now, as you can see
it is a complex system.

01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:19.210
I tried to summarize it here

01:32:19.210 --> 01:32:21.930
but there are multiple
targets that one can pursue.

01:32:21.930 --> 01:32:24.650
We and others had been
looking at that over the years.

01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:27.010
And this is just a
summary of the studies.

01:32:27.010 --> 01:32:31.670
About 8 to 10 years ago, most
of the companies had dropped

01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:33.300
out of psychiatry developing drugs

01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:35.880
and we're just using
off-label drugs, I mean,

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.920 position:56%
drugs that their patent had expired.

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.180
Now since the ketamine
started 2006 or so,

01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:43.880
many of these companies have jumped

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:47.390
in to pursue drugs that
regulate glutamate.

01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:51.620
Predominantly, if you look at
the bottom, NMDA, that target is

01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:55.090
where everybody has been going
on, NMDA receptor antagonist

01:32:55.090 --> 01:32:58.180
through our studies and other
studies, and I'll talk an example.

01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:01.300
The prototype drug is ketamine.

01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:05.690 position:56%
OK. Ketamine is an anesthetic agent
that's been out for several decades.

01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:08.450
It's one of the most
safest anesthetics.

01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:11.700
In fact, it's used in many
countries around the world

01:33:11.700 --> 01:33:15.450
without a physician, nurses
in really remote areas

01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:19.520
because it doesn't affect-- it
doesn't cause CNS depression,

01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.540
problems with breathing and
other complications that might--

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:27.160
you might need a significantly
trained anesthesiologist to manage.

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:28.460
There are many drugs.

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:31.800
I'm not going to go into detail,
but if we understand ketamine,

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:34.600
we can get a sense of where we
were heading in our research.

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:38.350
OK. Now, that receptor I
mentioned is blown up here.

01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:39.650
You can see.

01:33:39.650 --> 01:33:41.810
This is a channel,
inotropic channel.

01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:46.680
This is one receptor where you
have the sodium and calcium

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.140
into the channel and point for
learning, memory and plasticity.

01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:53.230
OK. Now, in the channel,
you can see PCP.

01:33:53.230 --> 01:33:54.950
That is the drug called PCP.

01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:59.360
Ketamine is a derivative
of that drug of abuse, PCP,

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:03.140
but it's 10 times to
40 times less potent.

01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:06.130
It happens to bind
to the same receptor.

01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:10.330
When it does bind to that
receptor, the channel closes.

01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:14.550
And so while you receive ketamine
or infusion, what is affected?

01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:17.360
Your learning, memory,
and plasticity, right?

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.640
Because we say that's important
to the function of the channel.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:24.110 position:56%
And you might say, why are we
exposing our patients to these drugs

01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:28.190
that affect learning, memory and
cause symptoms of dissociation?

01:34:28.190 --> 01:34:31.800
Well, the important thing is,
I'll mention that in a minute,

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:35.300
is our patients are
very severely ill.

01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:37.680
Now, when you block that
channel with ketamine,

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:40.800
you have psychological
symptoms, decreased awareness,

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.950
you might be disconnected,
distractible,

01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:45.650
have trouble communicating
while during infusion.

01:34:45.650 --> 01:34:47.950
You stopped the infusion and
that reverts very rapidly

01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:50.120
within 30 to 40 minutes.

01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.760
You might have symptoms of
out-of-body experiences,

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:55.640
thrills of like muffled sounds,

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.960
and your blood pressure
and pulse might go up.

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:03.220 position:56%
Now, when our patients came, because
we were interested in the question,

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:08.200
if you block the NMDA
receptor, will that bring

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.170
about rapid antidepressant effects

01:35:10.170 --> 01:35:14.150
because this is the most
available direct blocker of NMDA.

01:35:14.150 --> 01:35:19.700
And for that reason,
we studied patients,

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:21.650
because of the side
effects, were severely ill.

01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:25.100
And this is in our research
unit a few miles up the road.

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:30.380
Our patients had been ill for
24 years, most were disabled,

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:32.810
90% were not able to work.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:34.420
They had failed seven
antidepressants,

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:39.900
60% have failed ECT, one of
the most effective treatments,

01:35:39.900 --> 01:35:43.940
50% of our patients had
suicide attempts, some multiple.

01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:47.390
And so we really made sure
they had failed everything.

01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:52.540
OK. And you'd expect very little
chance of respondent, wouldn't you.

01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:56.050
OK. And this is what happened
in our study exactly almost

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:58.360
to the date 10 years ago.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.380
And you see towards the left,
these little lines on the y-axis,

01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:04.210
you see the Hamilton depression,

01:36:04.210 --> 01:36:06.910
higher number greater
severity depression.

01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:10.890
Towards the x-axis, you see
the time in minutes and days.

01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:14.810
One infusion of ketamine,
that's one infusion of ketamine

01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:17.810
for 40 minutes led to rapid
antidepressant effects

01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:23.250
within two hours, lasting about one
week, with just in one infusion.

01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:25.160
You can see in red
the control condition.

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.210 position:56%
Towards the right are response rate.

01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:30.650
It means you are 50% better
than when you start it.

01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:33.370
To the extreme right,
you see in light blue,

01:36:33.370 --> 01:36:36.100
monoaminergic antidepressants
already mentioned.

01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:40.410
You get about 60 to
65% response rate.

01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:44.730
But at eight weeks, taking
the pill everyday in people

01:36:44.730 --> 01:36:48.380 position:56%
who are not treatment-resistant
depression and if you look in green,

01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:50.270
it's ketamine response rate.

01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:54.410
You got comparable response rates
within a few hours that is the same

01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:58.060
as taking a pill everyday for
weeks, but in people who failed,

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:00.040
on average, six antidepressants.

01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:01.520
Same thing here.

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:03.380
Well, what about Bob?

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:08.300 position:56%
Bob participate in a study, you know
about him, 53 year old, depression,

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:10.600
10 episodes, suicide attempt.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.330
This is what happens within
a few hours, his depression

01:37:13.330 --> 01:37:17.420
and suicidal thinking was gone
and it lasted 20 days, OK,

01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:20.080
with one infusion,
drug-free, no other treatment.

01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:22.130
Now, I'm not saying
everybody responds,

01:37:22.130 --> 01:37:25.220
but about 50 to 60%
will have a response.

01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:27.900
So then the trick is, how do you
go from something that you know

01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:31.240
that does work much
more effectively?

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:35.530
Get rid of the side effects, get
rid of the risk of addiction,

01:37:35.530 --> 01:37:39.910
because there's a risk of addiction
and continue maintaining response.

01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:42.110
We made some progress there.

01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:45.370
Now, in the psychological sciences,
one of the biggest problem also

01:37:45.370 --> 01:37:47.900
in other areas of medicine
is replication.

01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:49.870
Other labs cannot find it.

01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:51.280 position:56%
OK. If you look at the figures here,

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:53.850
these are two other
studies than by our lab.

01:37:53.850 --> 01:37:57.530
Depression scores MADRS
goes down within one hour,

01:37:57.530 --> 01:37:59.410
lasting a good part of the week.

01:37:59.410 --> 01:38:02.970
Another replication study
showing exactly the same.

01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:08.870 position:56%
What is very eerie, strikingly eerie
here is the curves almost overlap

01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:11.040
which is unheard of in
psychiatry especially

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.080 position:56%
with antidepressant treatment speaks

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.450
to a true biological
phenomena that's going

01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:17.440
on and really a mechanism.

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:21.510
People have moved onto, then after
five of our controlled study,

01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:26.790
and NIMH decided to a
larger two sites study

01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:28.660
and you can see here
exactly the same.

01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.740
Within one day, no earlier
time points were obtained.

01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.050
Rapid antidepressant effects

01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:35.860
with ketamine lasting a
good part of the week.

01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:40.630 position:56%
More recently, Johnson &amp; Johnson,
and this study was led by Jas Singh,

01:38:40.630 --> 01:38:44.040
who actually was my fellow in the
first study but went to industry,

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:48.220
decided to pursue this with
Dr. Manji and they looked

01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:52.410
at giving ketamine two times a
week versus three times a week.

01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:55.520
If you look in the green dots,
down means greater improvement

01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:58.040
and then time over
the next two weeks.

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:01.420
So we'd repeat those is two
times or three times a week,

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:03.680
you bring down depression
scores and they still will--

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:06.010
stay well for at least two weeks.

01:39:06.010 --> 01:39:10.950
Now, the question is how do you
go about making safer ketamine

01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:13.320
without the side effects
that I mentioned

01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:15.920
that it won't affect the
brain, cause problems

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:17.440
and the risk of addiction?

01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:20.230
OK. Now, Johnson &amp;
Johnson has gotten the way

01:39:20.230 --> 01:39:25.660
of developing Esketamine, one
of the isomers of ketamine

01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:29.890
in the hopes it's going
to lead to and improve.

01:39:29.890 --> 01:39:32.400
And so if you see towards
the top right,

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.370
Esketamine by Johnson &amp; Johnson has
received breakthrough designation.

01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:40.130
They are doing phase three studies
and are planned to be on a market

01:39:40.130 --> 01:39:42.830
for 2018 based in the
work we've been doing.

01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:44.650
So we're excited about that.

01:39:44.650 --> 01:39:47.690
People have jumped
in back into industry

01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:51.190
but specific glutamate drugs
and not drugs for all psychiatry

01:39:51.190 --> 01:39:52.540
at some point to keep in mind.

01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:55.360
There are multiple grants being
funded by NIH on this line of work

01:39:55.360 --> 01:39:57.410
with preclinical and clinical.

01:39:57.410 --> 01:40:02.740
The second area is can we develop
more ketamine-friendly drugs,

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:06.830
meaning ketamine, if you look
at is like this building.

01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:10.650 position:56%
OK. In this room is the efficacy and
some other room it's the side effect

01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:12.940
so that's what we called
units or subunits.

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:16.380
So how do you figure to get the
drug in this unit and stay in room

01:40:16.380 --> 01:40:19.610
and stay away from the other rooms
or units and that's the trick.

01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:22.250
Well, you can come with
more subunit selected drugs.

01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:24.310
And there have been
some studies doing that

01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:27.950
and I'll talk about
that in a minute.

01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:31.110 position:56%
So, we have done a number of studies

01:40:31.110 --> 01:40:34.150
with these other more
subunit selected drugs

01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:37.100
and this is the summary
of all those studies.

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:41.480
Ketamine has rapid onset, robust
effect and sustained action.

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.950
No doubt about that, but
it has its side effects.

01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:47.550
OK. Dr. Insel, who's no longer
a director in the NIMH moved on,

01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:50.480
but summarized this, after
all our studies and others,

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:51.940
and says that other medications

01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:55.470
that block these receptors
are not antidepressants.

01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:57.610 position:56%
OK. I would say that's not the case.

01:40:57.610 --> 01:41:00.390
I would say, they are but
probably not as robust

01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:01.690
and sustained as ketamine.

01:41:01.690 --> 01:41:03.630
I do think they have
antidepressant properties.

01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:06.030
But they still have that
side effect liability.

01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:08.370
OK. In fact, this is a summary.

01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:11.610
We've done all these studies
except for the one of them.

01:41:11.610 --> 01:41:13.960
But we have-- you could
see memantine is

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.800 position:56%
for Alzheimer's disease, blocks that
NMDA receptor and there's others,

01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:20.480
MK, a drug by Merck, now Cerecor.

01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:22.580
Then there's a Pfizer
drug and AstraZeneca.

01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:24.270
These are the companies
that went back in.

01:41:24.270 --> 01:41:27.820
And you could see some
minuses, maybe a plus and minus.

01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:31.050
So bottom line, these
drugs are not as robust

01:41:31.050 --> 01:41:34.230
and as effective acutely
as ketamine is.

01:41:34.230 --> 01:41:36.830
And so that's another
we have to go into.

01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:42.850
So I think the other area we've
gotten into is mechanism of action.

01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:45.920
So-- And what we called
this is reverse engineering.

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.430
OK. So we talked about how
ketamine is very unique

01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:50.790 position:56%
and different than other treatments.

01:41:50.790 --> 01:41:53.720
So, you know, why not science
the heck out of this drug.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:57.320
OK. As-- I'm borrowing
a quote from a movie.

01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:00.100
And we could take advantage
of our facilities

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:01.800
at the intramural program.

01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.500
OK. We have polysomnography,
sleep studies,

01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:07.740
the ability to do neurochemical
studies, look at glucose

01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:09.370
or glutamate in the brain.

01:42:09.370 --> 01:42:11.370
We could do magnetic
encephalography.

01:42:11.370 --> 01:42:17.020
That is a machine that measures how
one neuron talks to another neuron.

01:42:17.020 --> 01:42:20.110
We can do functional studies,
structure imaging studies,

01:42:20.110 --> 01:42:23.260
so on and so forth, to understand,
if you look at the bottom,

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:26.020
every thing that goes from
genes, cells, circuits,

01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:30.310
all the way through symptoms
to the RDoC criteria.

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:34.160
If you can understand and
fill in the gaps of knowledge,

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.820
you might be able to understand
how this rapid antidepressant works

01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:40.720
and develop other treatments
and we have done those studies.

01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:45.090
First of all, towards the top
right, this represents rats

01:42:45.090 --> 01:42:49.330 position:56%
that had measurements in, while they
were moving around glutamate levels.

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:53.190 position:56%
And you can see here when you give
an injection of ketamine, at 20, 40,

01:42:53.190 --> 01:42:57.290 position:56%
60, 80 and 100 minutes, keep in mind
those minutes, That's very similar

01:42:57.290 --> 01:43:00.090
to the response rates,
the time of response

01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:02.060 position:56%
to ketamine, but this is in rodents.

01:43:02.060 --> 01:43:06.710
You see very quick increases in
glutamate extracellular levels.

01:43:06.710 --> 01:43:11.110
So we did a study in the forced
swim test in 2008, Dr. Manji.

01:43:11.110 --> 01:43:12.610
And this is the forced swim test.

01:43:12.610 --> 01:43:16.690 position:56%
It's that's rodent that's
struggling and you can see in green,

01:43:16.690 --> 01:43:18.520
ketamine decreased the mobility.

01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.610
That means it has
antidepressant-like properties.

01:43:22.610 --> 01:43:24.700
Towards the right, you
see an AMPA blocker,

01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:26.770
remember next to the
NMDA receptor was

01:43:26.770 --> 01:43:29.520
that other glutamate
receptacle, AMPA.

01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:32.410
And so here, the study
was looking if we pretreat

01:43:32.410 --> 01:43:36.550
with an AMPA blocker would that
abolish the antidepressant effects

01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:40.650
of ketamine, OK, because
NMDA is blocked by ketamine.

01:43:40.650 --> 01:43:41.950
And the answer is yes.

01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:45.760
You can see towards this-- the
right and ketamine plus AMPA,

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:49.130
the antidepressant effects
of ketamine go away in mice.

01:43:49.130 --> 01:43:52.660
So it seems that these AMPA
receptors are important.

01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:54.670
And I'll come back in a minute.

01:43:54.670 --> 01:43:57.860
Going back to that-- those
apartments or the rooms,

01:43:57.860 --> 01:44:02.040
subunits selective drugs
and are to be antagonist,

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:05.610
we see that it does
decrease the mobility.

01:44:05.610 --> 01:44:08.140
It means it has antidepressant-like
properties.

01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.510
But also if you pretreat
with AMPA blocker,

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:12.810
the antidepressant effects go away,

01:44:12.810 --> 01:44:15.310
suggesting AMPA receptors
are important

01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:19.330
for the antidepressant effects
of this compound as well.

01:44:19.330 --> 01:44:21.770
Now, here's a cartoon that
puts everything together what

01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:23.070
I've mentioned.

01:44:23.070 --> 01:44:25.970
OK. You have the presynaptic
neuron, the postsynaptic neuron.

01:44:25.970 --> 01:44:30.570
OK. So you have ketamine binds to
the NMDA receptors as we mentioned

01:44:30.570 --> 01:44:34.060
on this GABA interneurons,
another part of the brain.

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:37.300
So the scopolamine, it's
a sea sickness patch,

01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:40.390 position:56%
but here we give it
intravenously, binds to its receptor

01:44:40.390 --> 01:44:42.350
on the same GABA interneuron.

01:44:42.350 --> 01:44:46.380
What both appear to have in common
is this glutamate surge burst,

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:49.490
I already talked about
that increase in glutamate,

01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:52.590
that preferentially targets,
in yellow, this AMPA receptors

01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:55.920
and causes this intracellular
signaling cascade,

01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:00.170 position:56%
similar to what Dr. Gold was talking
about, and causes this increase

01:45:00.170 --> 01:45:04.020
in BDNF, brain-derived
neurotrophic factor.

01:45:04.020 --> 01:45:05.510
Those are the growth factors

01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:07.740
that maintain the neurons
and dendrites healthy.

01:45:07.740 --> 01:45:13.140
And so in this cartoon, you
increase the number of spines,

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:16.790 position:56%
you restore the synaptic connections
that were affected that I talked--

01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:18.980
that I began talking about.

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:22.600
And you restore that homeostatic
balance that was affected

01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:25.020
because of stress,
glutamate, and cortisol.

01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:28.190
And that's at least
the prevailing theory.

01:45:28.190 --> 01:45:31.900
Now this study is quite complex
but we haven't just finished

01:45:31.900 --> 01:45:36.030 position:56%
where we obtained all these measures
in our patients who are depressed

01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:39.830
to better understand the
biology of the response process.

01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:41.150
In here, they're listed.

01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:43.450
But the goal to understand
the neurobiology

01:45:43.450 --> 01:45:45.310 position:56%
of the response and relapse process.

01:45:45.310 --> 01:45:47.910
And just to show, very similar.

01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:50.420
The study I just finished
is identical the curve

01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:51.720
to all the previous studies.

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:56.080
Very rapid onset, people stay
better for one week or more.

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:59.610
OK. And this is the example, some
of the tasks we used that taps

01:45:59.610 --> 01:46:03.400
into these regions or circuits
that Dr. Gold was talking about.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.100
One is you exposed on
anybody healthy, control

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:08.440
or depressed patients' faces.

01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:10.710
And the faces will
light up certain parts

01:46:10.710 --> 01:46:13.370
of the brain, the visual cortex.

01:46:13.370 --> 01:46:17.130
Of course, the back of the head
occipital is one of the regions.

01:46:17.130 --> 01:46:21.110 position:56%
And you will pay attention to the
gender or the valance, meaning happy

01:46:21.110 --> 01:46:24.940
or sad in the face and you have to
react very quickly when it's shown.

01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:27.740
And it's shown in milliseconds
and so it's supposed

01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:30.280 position:56%
to be subconscious when you do this.

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:34.520
And you can look to the left is
the accuracy rate of being exposed

01:46:34.520 --> 01:46:37.960
to these faces when it's
positive and before ketamine

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.950
and after ketamine
in depressed patients

01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:43.100
and you can see the negative
valance, the bias towards going

01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:46.680
to a person that trigger the
button so the negative goes down.

01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:50.980 position:56%
OK. And towards the right, these are
what we called evoked potentials.

01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:55.280
It's a electrophysiological
measure of the visual cortex taken

01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.150
into account the gender
or the valance

01:46:59.150 --> 01:47:01.500
that is happy or sad or angry face.

01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:06.050 position:56%
And you can see here with
ketamine, it increases the positive.

01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:10.160
So you start biasing your
responses to more happy things

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:13.230
and the bias towards the negative
angry, sad face start going

01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:15.650
down precisely what you
want in depressed patients.

01:47:15.650 --> 01:47:18.580
And so, this is an example
of a noninvasive biomarker

01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:20.930
that could predict ahead
of time who might respond

01:47:20.930 --> 01:47:23.820
or not to a certain drug.

01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:27.190
Now, to get into a little bit
more complex but I'm trying

01:47:27.190 --> 01:47:29.270
to make it simpler
is Dr. Gold talked

01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:32.490
about subgenual anterior
cingulate cortex ventral striatum.

01:47:32.490 --> 01:47:35.340
OK. And if you look into the
figure towards the right,

01:47:35.340 --> 01:47:39.160
you see all those little regions
lined up one after another.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.640
And this is what we refer to
as a matrix of correlations,

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.710
how one region correlates
to another.

01:47:45.710 --> 01:47:50.570
It's now viewed as a bit simplistic
to study one region in isolation.

01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:55.920
Now what we try to do is to study
one region related to another.

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.490
The brain talks-- oops, sorry.

01:47:57.490 --> 01:48:01.400
The brain-- sorry.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:04.810
So, one area of the brain
is talking to another.

01:48:04.810 --> 01:48:07.630
So if you have a computer in your
office, OK, and there's a problem

01:48:07.630 --> 01:48:10.880
with the computer, many times it's
not the problem over the computer,

01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:13.620
that's one region, but it's the
problem with all the network.

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:16.050
OK. You have networks of
computer and you have a server

01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:18.930
and that server is the
hub of the networks.

01:48:18.930 --> 01:48:21.530
And so that's what we try to
understand is not one computer

01:48:21.530 --> 01:48:23.580
at time but every computer
at the same time,

01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:25.480
how one computer talks to another.

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:27.970
And not only that, you can go
from your building to the building

01:48:27.970 --> 01:48:29.900
across the street into
the whole community.

01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:32.460
That's how we're studying
now our mental illnesses

01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:35.280
and this is referred to as
functional connectivity,

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:37.330
how one region talks to another.

01:48:37.330 --> 01:48:39.620
And these matrices you
can see in the warm

01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:42.380
or red colors are positive
correlations.

01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:43.840
They work in sync.

01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.870
And the lighter, cooler colors are
how they work against each other.

01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:51.730
And you could measure this
through functional imaging.

01:48:51.730 --> 01:48:56.920
This is to show-- towards the
top is 101 represents one subject

01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:01.720
to receive five scans during
the study, five function scans.

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:05.640
And if you look to the
bottom is at baseline,

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.980
two days after ketamine,
why at two days?

01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:10.750
Well, we already said the
peak of response is there.

01:49:10.750 --> 01:49:12.990
So you can understand
the biology response.

01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:15.180
And then 10 days later,
why 10 days later?

01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:18.770
Because I said the ketamine
effects last about seven days.

01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:20.070
So you're looking at the relapse.

01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:23.770
So here, we're looking
at biology, the response,

01:49:23.770 --> 01:49:26.280 position:56%
nonresponse process and the relapse.

01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.230
So that's very important because
you might be able to predict

01:49:29.230 --> 01:49:33.760
who will respond and who will
relapse, OK, as an example.

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:35.720
OK. I should move on.

01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:39.130
Getting into some examples of
anhedonia or lack of pleasure.

01:49:39.130 --> 01:49:43.020
I talked about we pull out the
strings to better understand it.

01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:46.250
One example is we looked at
lack of drive or anhedonia

01:49:46.250 --> 01:49:48.340
and this is measured by the SHAPS.

01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:54.200
Ketamine produces a rapid decrease,
stays down and for about two weeks,

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.040
people's lack of drive
and anhedonia stay well.

01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:03.040
And this is measured FDG,
fluorodeoxyglucose scan.

01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:04.840
That's a surrogate of
glutamate function.

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.470
And we can show here towards
the left is the relationship

01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:10.770
or correlation between
ventral striatum,

01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:14.260
that's the reward circuit
in glutamate levels, OK.

01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:18.140
So the greater the bold
signal, the better the response.

01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:21.260
And in this area happens to
be dorsal cingulate cortex.

01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:22.950
And finally, I'm going to get

01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:25.490
into last three slides I
hope I have is the paper

01:50:25.490 --> 01:50:26.790
that came out yesterday.

01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:32.210
OK. So this was-- it was a-- this
is a collaboration by Maryland

01:50:32.210 --> 01:50:35.350
and Chapel Hill and I
mentioned several institutes.

01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:39.730
And in terms of trying to
understand the mechanism

01:50:39.730 --> 01:50:42.000
of ketamine, the better ketamine.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.060
OK. And this started
when I was bothered,

01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:46.230
remember in green are
the response rates.

01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:49.690
OK. The side effects
go away in 40 minutes.

01:50:49.690 --> 01:50:51.690
The half-life of the
drug is about one hour.

01:50:51.690 --> 01:50:54.640
So why does it last in seven,
you know, days or longer?

01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:58.900
And so, what we said is let's
look at the metabolites.

01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:01.890
In older papers, it said
it's inactive some of them.

01:51:01.890 --> 01:51:04.230
Well, inactive for
anesthesia but they didn't know

01:51:04.230 --> 01:51:05.530
about depression back then.

01:51:05.530 --> 01:51:08.160
So we looked at all of
them, a bunch of them.

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.220
And I have come up
with a can of drug.

01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:14.270 position:56%
So this is a cartoon, hopefully,
that explains the study now in here.

01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:17.020
OK. RS are the two
isomers of ketamine.

01:51:17.020 --> 01:51:18.890
OK. That's the chemical structure.

01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:21.100
Here, we give ketamine
intravenously.

01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:23.840
OK. It goes through the
liver and within 10 minutes,

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:26.450
you have towards the right,
hard to see, but what was that,

01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:29.220
all those metabolites
within 10 minutes in the--

01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:31.100
in periphery and the brain.

01:51:31.100 --> 01:51:35.180
OK. And towards the extreme
right you see are the measures

01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:37.280
of those metabolites.

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:41.430
And we found that metabolites will
last in three days and seven days.

01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:42.730
That's interesting.

01:51:42.730 --> 01:51:45.050
If the half life of
ketamine is gone in an hour

01:51:45.050 --> 01:51:47.770
and the response last seven
day, maybe it's one of these.

01:51:47.770 --> 01:51:50.440 position:56%
We know that ketamine is associated
with side effects, risk of addiction

01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:52.260
and rapid antidepressant effects.

01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:56.000
So, through the collaboration,
NCATS, National Center

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.560
for Advance Translational Research,

01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:00.270
the principal investigator
is Todd Gould from University

01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:01.760
of Maryland and our collaboration.

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:08.540
What was done is one creates a
deuterium form, a dideuterium form

01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:11.780
of ketamine, means what you do
is you attach something to one

01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:14.310
of its molecules or add carbons

01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:16.830
and what you do is you
prevent its metabolism.

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.950
And when you do that,
this is what happens.

01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:23.540
OK. You don't have the rapid
antidepressant effects anymore,

01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:26.290
or very little, but you
still have the side effects

01:52:26.290 --> 01:52:27.590
and the risk of addiction.

01:52:27.590 --> 01:52:28.890
Interesting.

01:52:28.890 --> 01:52:31.500
OK. So then you go to one of
those metabolites who are hanging

01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:34.500
around HNK, hydroxynorketamine.

01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:38.330
In animals, in mice we found it
had rapid antidepressant effects

01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:40.210
but without the side
effects of ketamine.

01:52:40.210 --> 01:52:42.210
OK. So, that's about it.

01:52:42.210 --> 01:52:44.050
I'm going to stop there and
thank you for your attention.

01:52:44.050 --> 01:52:46.090
[ Applause ]

01:52:46.090 --> 01:52:49.600
&gt;&gt; Philip W. Gold: Our
last speaker today,

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:55.560
I'm pleased to introduce Dr.
Raymond DePaulo who is the chairman

01:52:55.560 --> 01:53:02.580 position:56%
of the Department of Psychiatry and
Behavioral Medicine at Johns Hopkins

01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:09.020
and is the psychiatrist and
chief there and has been one

01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.420
of the world's experts

01:53:10.420 --> 01:53:15.630
on psychiatric genetics
especially in bipolar disorder.

01:53:15.630 --> 01:53:17.920
And he's going to share some of--

01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:22.090
what has really become an
extraordinarily exciting area

01:53:22.090 --> 01:53:23.390
of medicine.

01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:25.230
And as I mentioned
earlier, I think the one

01:53:25.230 --> 01:53:29.920
that will yield us the
biomarker that we lack.

01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:31.220
Yeah.

01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:32.700
&gt;&gt; Raymond DePaulo: OK.

01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:35.770
OK. How it worked?

01:53:35.770 --> 01:53:37.260
&gt;&gt; Philip W. Gold:
I didn't use that.

01:53:37.260 --> 01:53:38.670
&gt;&gt; Raymond DePaulo: Oh,
you didn't use that one?

01:53:38.670 --> 01:53:39.970
OK. Well, we'll figure it out.

01:53:39.970 --> 01:53:41.270
&gt;&gt; Philip W. Gold: OK.

01:53:41.270 --> 01:53:42.570
&gt;&gt; Raymond DePaulo: All right.

01:53:42.570 --> 01:53:43.870
Well, thanks very much everybody.

01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:45.170
It's nice to be here.

01:53:45.170 --> 01:53:47.560
You know, I haven't regularly
come to the Library of Congress

01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:50.600
since I was-- since
1966 when I was--

01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:53.680
spent my summer in DC on
Capitol Hill, and I loved it

01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.990
because it was the most
peaceful place around.

01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:58.730
And you didn't have to do
anything particularly special

01:53:58.730 --> 01:54:00.030
like you do these days.

01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:01.770
Didn't have to go through
any-- didn't have to take--

01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:04.030
I didn't have an iPhone but you
wouldn't have had take it off them.

01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:10.110
OK. Well, listen, I'm a clinician
first, OK, teacher second

01:54:10.110 --> 01:54:11.410
and then I'm researcher third.

01:54:11.410 --> 01:54:13.440
OK. I've had a lot of
fun doing research.

01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:15.370
And I have a lot of opinions.

01:54:15.370 --> 01:54:18.660
OK. And I've loved the first two
talks but even more than the talks,

01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:20.760 position:56%
I've really liked the questions, OK,

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:23.180
because that's really what
our field is about, OK,

01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:25.300
is getting the right questions.

01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:28.300
OK. So let me see if I can
start this little talk.

01:54:28.300 --> 01:54:32.490
And by giving me the issue of the
genetics of depression, you know,

01:54:32.490 --> 01:54:36.270
I thought that sort of ruled out
proclaiming victory on the genetics

01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:39.710
of bipolar disorder, OK, which is
not exactly victory but it's a--

01:54:39.710 --> 01:54:42.030
it's certainly a heck of a
bunch bigger start than we have

01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:44.740
on so-called the unipolar
depression, that is people

01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:46.820
that have depressions
but not bipolar disorder.

01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:49.270
So I'm going to talk and I'm going
to show you some genetics studies

01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:52.030
but I'm going to show you the
genetics studies really of kind

01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:54.330
of in stairstep fashion
of schizophrenia just

01:54:54.330 --> 01:54:58.290
to show the rapid progress that's
been made there for whatever it is.

01:54:58.290 --> 01:55:01.810
OK. Then a little bit on bipolar
disorder and then, oh my God,

01:55:01.810 --> 01:55:04.000
depression, why haven't
we done more there.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.320
OK. And then I'm going
to talk about what--

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:09.890
why is that and also
where is the problem.

01:55:09.890 --> 01:55:12.560
And I think, let's say the genetic
understanding of depression,

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:16.960
there are two operative words
there, genetics and depression.

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:23.520
OK. So, what is the right genetic
question and what is depression,

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:24.820
which you all have already asked.

01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:27.320
OK. So, let's go at it.

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:30.440
OK. So, I do have no
financial conflicts

01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:33.090
with this although whenever
my faculty get up and do this,

01:55:33.090 --> 01:55:35.090
they always say I'm
employed by Johns Hopkins,

01:55:35.090 --> 01:55:37.380 position:56%
they make me do all kinds of things.

01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:40.520
And I'm saying that you
will understand what we know

01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:42.430
about the genetics
of major depression,

01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:43.930
that is the big challenges.

01:55:43.930 --> 01:55:47.490 position:56%
And that you will see how the
genetics of depression may be harder

01:55:47.490 --> 01:55:49.350
than for bipolar and schizophrenia.

01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:51.490
And that you will understand
the need

01:55:51.490 --> 01:55:53.410
for large stable collaborations,

01:55:53.410 --> 01:55:56.040
more careers studying
serious mental disorders

01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:58.460
like depression, and better ideas.

01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.610
The technology is getting
better every day.

01:56:00.610 --> 01:56:04.520 position:56%
OK. And I've been blessed to be able
to work with the people starting

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:08.100
since 1985 with the people who made
the first map of genome and I got

01:56:08.100 --> 01:56:10.020
to work with them starting about
two years before they made it.

01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:13.850
And by the way, the progress
has just catapulted since then.

01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:17.280
And so I made-- Eric Lander
who was 29 at the time

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:19.040
and didn't really have
an appointment.

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.400
He was an unofficial fellow
at Whitehead Institute.

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.320 position:56%
He now runs the Broad Institute, OK,

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:26.550
which is a very large
genetic operation.

01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:28.490
I was just there about
two weeks ago.

01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:31.070
And it's progressed just like
the field has progressed.

01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:32.370
What do you expect?

01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:33.670
It's really cool.

01:56:33.670 --> 01:56:34.970
All right.

01:56:34.970 --> 01:56:36.270
So, one of the reasons I
like to do science is I get

01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:37.780
to meet really smart
people and listen

01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:40.860
to the talks and Carlos' work.

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:43.190
You know, today he showed me
some things I haven't seen before

01:56:43.190 --> 01:56:44.490
which is really great.

01:56:44.490 --> 01:56:48.850
That is the active-- the parent
compound may not be the ticket.

01:56:48.850 --> 01:56:50.410
Well, that's important news.

01:56:50.410 --> 01:56:51.710
Now, let's see here.

01:56:51.710 --> 01:56:53.010
Ah, I can see it right here if I--

01:56:53.010 --> 01:56:55.290
now, I just put on my
glasses and I can read it.

01:56:55.290 --> 01:56:57.660
Well, this is disease
burden by illness.

01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:59.250
I'm not going to spend
much time here.

01:56:59.250 --> 01:57:03.440
Carlos and Phil and I have all
referred to this the global burden

01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:06.140
of disease studies, OK, in one
way or another to make the point

01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:08.330
that depression is big, OK.

01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:12.590 position:56%
And so you can see that that's the
number one on this particular thing.

01:57:12.590 --> 01:57:13.890
That was 2004.

01:57:13.890 --> 01:57:15.650
I noticed Carlos had it
a little differently.

01:57:15.650 --> 01:57:17.650
He was looking in 2010.

01:57:17.650 --> 01:57:20.840 position:56%
The main thing is-- by the way, this
was the biggest surprise in the--

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:23.570
in these global burden
of disease studies.

01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:25.000
They were actually
had to be persuaded

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.710
to include psychiatric conditions.

01:57:26.710 --> 01:57:29.830
OK. And actually the person that
persuaded them was the brother

01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:32.790
of one of my faculty members,
Kay Jamison's brother Dean,

01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:35.260
a health economist persuaded
them, they needed to do it.

01:57:35.260 --> 01:57:37.370
And now they say, "Oh my God,
why didn't we do it before?

01:57:37.370 --> 01:57:38.830
OK. These are big."

01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:41.530
OK. And-- OK.

01:57:41.530 --> 01:57:42.910
So, what is major depression?

01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:45.740
OK. And so let me go right at that.

01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:48.740
And then the second question
really is that is, is it--

01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:51.280
is that's what is it,
what DSM-5 says?

01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:54.280
OK. Is that really it, a
checklist of nine things?

01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:58.540
And by the way, I was on DSM-5.

01:57:58.540 --> 01:57:59.840
Carlos was a consultant.

01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:01.140
You are on it.

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:02.440
You are member, too.

01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:03.740
You and I both members, right?

01:58:03.740 --> 01:58:07.910
And we both have gotten, you
know, witness protection.

01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:11.090
So don't try anything funny.

01:58:11.090 --> 01:58:14.190
But it is great that we've had
the challenge to this approach.

01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:16.800
OK. And it's not that
these things are wrong.

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:20.030
If you were going to
come up with a checklist,

01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:22.330
way back when these things
started, George Winokur from Iowa,

01:58:22.330 --> 01:58:25.900
now the late George Winokur, and I
said I didn't really like this way

01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:27.880
of doing it in DSM-3
and it's very similar.

01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:29.860
And he said, OK, just come
up with something better.

01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:31.160
Just come up with a
better checklist.

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.460
I want a checklist.

01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:33.760
So just give me a better one.

01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:35.060
And I tried 4 and 5
and I said, OK, George,

01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:36.360
one works about as
well as the other.

01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.430
But these things came--
oops, I'm sorry.

01:58:38.430 --> 01:58:42.970
These things came from some bright
people at Wash U in St. Louis

01:58:42.970 --> 01:58:46.770
and where they came from
was the walls inside

01:58:46.770 --> 01:58:48.170
where the clinical
research groups were.

01:58:48.170 --> 01:58:52.010
OK. And so what the
young fellow named Finer

01:58:52.010 --> 01:58:55.020
in the FINER criteria became to
DSM criteria, sort of, you know,

01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:58.940
by little switches and committees
that morphed [inaudible] other.

01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:02.680
He went around to the anxiety
group and the depression group

01:59:02.680 --> 01:59:05.370
and said how do you--
who gets into your study?

01:59:05.370 --> 01:59:07.430
OK. Here son, go mimeograph this.

01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:08.730
OK. That's how they get in.

01:59:08.730 --> 01:59:10.030
That's our checklist.

01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:11.330
OK. And that's what this is.

01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:14.340 position:56%
And he-- When he initially published
it, it was for research, OK.

01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:17.840
And I think that's what they
serve and not in the sense

01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:20.010
of guiding the research at all.

01:59:20.010 --> 01:59:22.510
Just in saying we got to have
some minimal qualification.

01:59:22.510 --> 01:59:25.460
OK. So, OK.

01:59:25.460 --> 01:59:28.240
So anyway, so this will
do pretty well, OK,

01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:31.240
especially when it's recurrent,
especially when it's early onset.

01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:32.540
You've heard about that.

01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:34.850
And then especially if it
has the other manifestations

01:59:34.850 --> 01:59:39.220
that Carlos talked about,
psychotic symptoms, suicidal--

01:59:39.220 --> 01:59:41.670 position:56%
severe suicidal symptoms, et cetera.

01:59:41.670 --> 01:59:45.110
But-- So but anyway, as this
is going on, the controversy

01:59:45.110 --> 01:59:48.530
about this approach of diagnosis
which has been very much deserved.

01:59:48.530 --> 01:59:53.140 position:56%
OK. Some have said we even invented
it and I just want to make one slide

01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:55.530
to say we didn't invent it.

01:59:55.530 --> 01:59:58.610
OK. This is Burton's "The
Anatomy of Melancholy", 1621.

01:59:58.610 --> 02:00:00.640
But you've already heard
about Hippocrates and Galen.

02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:02.310
They knew about this too, OK.

02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:04.060
So, that question is answered.

02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:07.220
OK. By the way, I do want
to come up with an answer

02:00:07.220 --> 02:00:09.390
about why we haven't evolved out
of it and I'll tell you that later.

02:00:09.390 --> 02:00:13.330
OK. OK. So, melancholia, OK,
and as you know this comes

02:00:13.330 --> 02:00:18.720 position:56%
from the ancient disease model which
had to do with the four humors.

02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:20.610
OK. And in this room,
people know what that is.

02:00:20.610 --> 02:00:23.210
When I go to medical students
and I ask who knows, you know,

02:00:23.210 --> 02:00:24.510
the derivation of the
word melancholia

02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:27.940
and essentially it's zero to two
people in a room of 50 will know.

02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:32.620
OK. So, too much black bile
was thought to be the source.

02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:34.140
But Kraepelin really
didn't buy that.

02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:36.590
And Kraepelin was an early applier

02:00:36.590 --> 02:00:39.320
of the modern disease
model to psychiatry.

02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:43.520
OK. And he was a pretty
fair pathologist.

02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:46.960
He had a better one as one of his
students, Alois Alzheimer, OK.

02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:49.710
And the guy who started our
department, Adolf Meyer,

02:00:49.710 --> 02:00:53.320
was a very good pathologist and he
didn't like Kraepelin doing this

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:55.970
because for what he
call dementia praecox

02:00:55.970 --> 02:00:57.270
and manic-depressive insanity.

02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:59.270
He says because you don't
have a pathology yet

02:00:59.270 --> 02:01:02.540
and that's the centerpiece
of the modern disease model.

02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:05.590
And he said, if you do that,
if you allow these things

02:01:05.590 --> 02:01:08.290
to be called diseases without
a pathology, there is no limit

02:01:08.290 --> 02:01:10.670
to the number of things you
might call diseases, right?

02:01:10.670 --> 02:01:14.770
And Dr. McKee [assumed
spelling] used to hold up DSM-4

02:01:14.770 --> 02:01:18.290
in its thick form and say this book
should be called Meyer's Revenge.

02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:22.310
OK. Anyway, but here's
a patient and--

02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:24.310
but, you know, I can't
get away from.

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:28.540
This is also from Kraepelin's text
and he showed the woman who had,

02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:31.400
in two pictures, I'm showing
the man who had two pictures.

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:32.730
It took a little work.

02:01:32.730 --> 02:01:34.880 position:56%
You had to go through it a couple
of times because these pictures were

02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:37.280
about 50 pages apart and
they didn't tell you, "Hey,

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:39.050
this is the same person
who's on page 20."

02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:41.880
OK. So-- But here's the
fellow in melancholia.

02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:45.310
He have been said to be
like this, wide-eyed stare,

02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:47.940
having maybe persuaded to pull
the covers down a little bit

02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:49.320
so they could take
a photograph of him.

02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:51.320
OK. He had no interest in anything.

02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:53.540
And you can see he's unshaved
and he looks a lot better

02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:56.950
than he probably felt
at this moment.

02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:59.730
OK. And so that's melancholia
and that's the picture

02:01:59.730 --> 02:02:01.210
of melancholia, all right?

02:02:01.210 --> 02:02:03.950
Now here's another patient that has
melancholia and I'm going to talk

02:02:03.950 --> 02:02:05.250
to you a little bit
about these two patients.

02:02:05.250 --> 02:02:06.550
I'm not going to talk about Bob.

02:02:06.550 --> 02:02:08.580
I'm going to talk about
these two people.

02:02:08.580 --> 02:02:12.970
So, here is a woman and by
the way, without a checklist,

02:02:12.970 --> 02:02:15.790
what would we say are the
central features of the syndrome

02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:17.090
of depression, if you will?

02:02:17.090 --> 02:02:20.360
And we would say it's a
change in mood or affect,

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:22.630
change in self attitude
and a change in vitality.

02:02:22.630 --> 02:02:25.250
OK. And they express
themselves slightly differently.

02:02:25.250 --> 02:02:27.520
Actually, only about 50% of
people that I would diagnose

02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.860
with depression would say

02:02:28.860 --> 02:02:31.160
that that's a good description
of what they're feeling.

02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:34.590
They also often say they're not
so much sad as they are anxious,

02:02:34.590 --> 02:02:37.570 position:56%
apathetic, don't care, or even numb.

02:02:37.570 --> 02:02:40.040
And people have told
me I can't even cry.

02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:42.020
I didn't-- I couldn't cry
at my father's funeral.

02:02:42.020 --> 02:02:44.010 position:56%
OK. There's something wrong with me.

02:02:44.010 --> 02:02:45.720
I can't feel anything.

02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.400
OK. The change in self attitude
which is so characteristic

02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:55.150
of what we call melancholia, OK,
is really-- it comes in degrees.

02:02:55.150 --> 02:02:56.970
You can have just decreased
self-confidence.

02:02:56.970 --> 02:02:59.940 position:56%
You know, I don't trust any of my
decisions now, tells the businessman

02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:01.780
to me even though he's
still going to work.

02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:04.260
But in the worse case, a lady

02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:06.490
like this often feels
hopeless and worthless.

02:03:06.490 --> 02:03:11.120
OK. And then vitality-- some
people use the word vital since

02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:13.640
but I like just the word vitality
and that is lacking normal,

02:03:13.640 --> 02:03:14.940
physical and mental energy.

02:03:14.940 --> 02:03:17.500
OK. And the issue we talk
about poor concentration.

02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:19.400
But that really is
that it takes energy.

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:20.830
That's one of the reasons
many people don't want

02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:22.130
to see other people.

02:03:22.130 --> 02:03:23.430
I got to get up.

02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:24.730 position:56%
I got to look half decent, you know.

02:03:24.730 --> 02:03:28.570
And actually, I've gotten a number
of patients to appear on various--

02:03:28.570 --> 02:03:29.920
be filmed in one thing or another.

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:32.730
And, you know, when the people
come and say, hey, look,

02:03:32.730 --> 02:03:34.200
we want to film a patient
before and after

02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:37.320
and I say, well, OK, good luck.

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:39.700
Most patients tell me when
I go in and they're feeling

02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:42.650
like this lady is feeling, you
know, Dr. DePaulo, you know,

02:03:42.650 --> 02:03:44.280 position:56%
I'm not sure I really want my family

02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:46.390
to see me making a debut
while I'm feeling like this.

02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:48.720
Could we go a few more days till
I'm feeling a little bit better?

02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:52.050
OK. And because this is the
time in which you don't feel

02:03:52.050 --> 02:03:53.350
like doing much of anything.

02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:54.650
And in fact, here's
what she's saying.

02:03:54.650 --> 02:03:55.950
"I'm falling down in my head."

02:03:55.950 --> 02:03:57.890
She-- This is in Paris,
so it's a translation.

02:03:57.890 --> 02:04:00.610
"I'm falling down in my head,
I no longer wish to live,

02:04:00.610 --> 02:04:04.080
to see anything, hear
anything, feel anything.

02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:05.400
I'm fed up with life.

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:06.700
I've had enough.

02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:08.000
I don't want to live any more."

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.300
I mean, now, therein
the better description

02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:10.770
of depression that we've got.

02:04:10.770 --> 02:04:13.250
But of course, it's a
cross-sectional thing

02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:15.950 position:56%
and so let me talk to you about her.

02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:18.240
This lady had Parkinson's disease.

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:19.540
She'd never had depression before.

02:04:19.540 --> 02:04:22.760
OK. And when they put in
the electrodes and let

02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:25.290
that surgery heal, they were
going to try to help her tremor

02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:28.930
in Parkinson's disease with this
deep brain stimulation electrode.

02:04:28.930 --> 02:04:31.970
OK. And the first time
that they had her on,

02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:33.590
because this is an early case,

02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:35.610
they videotaped her
when they turned it on.

02:04:35.610 --> 02:04:38.220
They were, hey, this is
going to be good, right?

02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:41.960
And the-- it didn't come up
the way they anticipated.

02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:44.560
OK. And so you could see here in A,

02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:46.650
and I don't think I have
a pointer here, do I?

02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:47.950
Do I really?

02:04:47.950 --> 02:04:51.100
No, I just screwed
that up, didn't I?

02:04:51.100 --> 02:04:53.920
OK. And in section A there,
there she is as she came

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.390
in to get ready for the thing.

02:04:55.390 --> 02:05:00.500 position:56%
And then in B is after 17 seconds
after they turned on the stimulator.

02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:03.040
Four minutes and 16 seconds
is when she's telling us

02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:06.640
that this life is worthless, OK,
that there's no point in going on.

02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:09.460
And then of course being very
smart and one of the great things

02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:11.920
about surgeons and
people that use treatments

02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:14.740 position:56%
like this is somebody said turn that
blasted thing off, you know, bang,

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:17.850
hit the thing and very
quickly she recovered.

02:05:17.850 --> 02:05:21.660
OK. And said something like did
somebody get the license plate,

02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:24.400
you know, on that truck
that just ran over me?

02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:28.730
And in fact, as she recovered, she
actually had a little over-recovery

02:05:28.730 --> 02:05:30.750
and started playing
with her surgeon's tie.

02:05:30.750 --> 02:05:36.550
OK. But that-- and that went
away very fast, just momentary.

02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:39.800 position:56%
So, this is one of the reasons why
we think the modern disease paradigm

02:05:39.800 --> 02:05:42.330
is appropriate for this.

02:05:42.330 --> 02:05:44.620
But this paradigms,
these models, you know,

02:05:44.620 --> 02:05:49.990
you got to remember what the
great statistician Box said--

02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:51.730
George E. P. Box said
to his students,

02:05:51.730 --> 02:05:54.490
all models are wrong
but some are useful.

02:05:54.490 --> 02:05:56.630
OK. So, it's a contract.

02:05:56.630 --> 02:05:57.930
That's all it is.

02:05:57.930 --> 02:06:00.370
OK. Only the patients are
real, I tell my students.

02:06:00.370 --> 02:06:01.670
All right.

02:06:01.670 --> 02:06:02.970
So, now that's one patient.

02:06:02.970 --> 02:06:04.840
Now here's the other
patient from his depression

02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:06.550 position:56%
to show him now in an altered state.

02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:10.960 position:56%
You know, a year or so or several
months later and you may not be able

02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:13.870
to make it out but he's-- you
can see the cigar he is smoking.

02:06:13.870 --> 02:06:17.910
And if you're good, you can
kind of see the pipe in his--

02:06:17.910 --> 02:06:19.770
and on his lap, that's
actually another pipe.

02:06:19.770 --> 02:06:22.350
OK. So this guy is really indulging
at least one particular appetite.

02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:24.470
OK. And it seems-- and he--

02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:26.960
and by the way, he's also wearing
a boot [inaudible], take notice.

02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:28.650
And he no longer has that big beard

02:06:28.650 --> 02:06:30.550
but he does have a nice
handlebar mustache.

02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:32.860
OK. So-- And this, you know,

02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:34.730
Kraepelin said I don't have
any particular treatments

02:06:34.730 --> 02:06:36.030
for this disorder.

02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:37.490
These were people who
were living there

02:06:37.490 --> 02:06:41.710
and they were just
mostly observing them.

02:06:41.710 --> 02:06:44.450
OK. So-- And just to make the
point, the central features

02:06:44.450 --> 02:06:47.620
of mania are similar,
almost a mirror image

02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:49.090
of depression, not completely.

02:06:49.090 --> 02:06:51.500
And so the mood is mostly elated

02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:54.470
but not just elated,
irritable, expansive.

02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:58.520
Self attitude is up, grandiose,
overconfident and imperious often.

02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:03.050
And vitality is increased,
energy, and the decrease--

02:07:03.050 --> 02:07:06.550 position:56%
a perception of a decreased need for
sleep and in fact patients can go,

02:07:06.550 --> 02:07:08.370
as you know three or
four days without sleep.

02:07:08.370 --> 02:07:12.670
And then increased speed of
thinking and speech usually.

02:07:12.670 --> 02:07:15.160
And again, with both of them, there
tends to be an episodic course

02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:19.270
and in fact, in Kraepelin's
day, he grouped people together

02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:22.740
who had only depressions and
manias and depressions together

02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:26.170
because he thought, look, that's
the best predictor I have.

02:07:26.170 --> 02:07:29.550
And so, that's actually one of the
ways we had to divide depressions.

02:07:29.550 --> 02:07:31.590
OK. Those that have mania
and those that don't.

02:07:31.590 --> 02:07:33.860
OK. And it's still salient.

02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:36.820
OK. Well, here's the modern
disease model, if you will.

02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:39.110
I don't-- this is not a
definition of the word

02:07:39.110 --> 02:07:41.970 position:56%
because you can't get anybody to
agree on the definition of the word.

02:07:41.970 --> 02:07:43.390
But this is the structural model.

02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:46.030
We doctors like simple things
that you can operationalize.

02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:47.890
OK. And so here's the model.

02:07:47.890 --> 02:07:49.710
You have a clinical syndrome.

02:07:49.710 --> 02:07:52.210
You validate that as a modern
disease with a pathology

02:07:52.210 --> 02:07:54.860
and abnormal body part,
OK, in some patient.

02:07:54.860 --> 02:07:58.250
And then you-- then that leads
you to search if you do things

02:07:58.250 --> 02:08:01.010
in that order, in the
right order in a sense

02:08:01.010 --> 02:08:02.980
for an original cause or etiology.

02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:09.850
OK. Now, the problem for us is that
none of these areas are simple.

02:08:09.850 --> 02:08:15.210 position:56%
In cancer, etiology is very
complex and we learn a lot from them

02:08:15.210 --> 02:08:17.710
in studying etiology because
they know the methods,

02:08:17.710 --> 02:08:19.010
they know how to go at that.

02:08:19.010 --> 02:08:20.310
OK. It's really good.

02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:22.540
But once you get a
cancer, by the way,

02:08:22.540 --> 02:08:23.870
the pathology is not complicated,

02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:26.120
it's just stuff growing
where it shouldn't be.

02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:27.420
OK. It doesn't look very good,

02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:29.300
kind of ugly stuff growing
where it shouldn't be.

02:08:29.300 --> 02:08:32.430
OK. And the syndromes
were also not complex.

02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:34.740
They usually block something
or it causes pain, right,

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:36.490
or it causes a protrusion.

02:08:36.490 --> 02:08:39.890
OK. So-- And the reason I'm
mentioning this is I was invited

02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:42.830
to speak at the Salk
Institute annual symposium

02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:45.490
on biological complexity.

02:08:45.490 --> 02:08:53.340 position:56%
And I saw that much of their earlier
ones were on cancer and I said,

02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:56.170 position:56%
well, Jiminy Christmas, if you're
going to make me talk, I got to say,

02:08:56.170 --> 02:08:59.180
you know, my talk was
entitled complexity squared.

02:08:59.180 --> 02:09:01.070
I should have said cubed, OK,

02:09:01.070 --> 02:09:04.930
because each of these
is a complex state, OK,

02:09:04.930 --> 02:09:07.170
and it is not in all
likelihood going

02:09:07.170 --> 02:09:10.220
to be explainable solely
by its parts.

02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:12.650
OK. And that's really a key thing.

02:09:12.650 --> 02:09:15.610
Now that's what makes it
so wonderful and amazing

02:09:15.610 --> 02:09:18.230
to study the patients
and to work with them.

02:09:18.230 --> 02:09:21.790
But, this is complicated,
folks, and therefore,

02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:23.980
we're working on systems
within systems.

02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:28.760
OK. So, now, I said the
course was episodic.

02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:31.150
This is an early slide,
one of the slides

02:09:31.150 --> 02:09:33.610
that where they used
lithium in patients.

02:09:33.610 --> 02:09:35.870
By the way, unipolar
and bipolar in here.

02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:38.030
The black bars are the depressions,

02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:40.290
the hatched bars are
mostly the manias.

02:09:40.290 --> 02:09:42.120
And the-- and you can
see the lithium is

02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:44.000
where that little pencil
underlinings are.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.150
OK. And each line is a patient,
OK, from 1960 to 1968, OK.

02:09:49.150 --> 02:09:50.580
And it looks pretty
good, doesn't it?

02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:51.880
That looks terrific.

02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:53.180
You're going, man, you
should keep yourself

02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:55.010
with that pencil line
going underneath you.

02:09:55.010 --> 02:09:57.790 position:56%
And it didn't turn out to be that
good but it did turn out to be good.

02:09:57.790 --> 02:09:59.090
OK.

02:09:59.090 --> 02:10:02.250
So-- And this was 1969 and the--

02:10:02.250 --> 02:10:04.710
and my teacher from the Maudsley
Hospital Institute of Psychiatry

02:10:04.710 --> 02:10:07.040
in London though didn't
like this study.

02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.560 position:56%
And so, he wrote a paper with his
fellow called "Prophylactic Lithium:

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:11.860
Another Therapeutic Myth".

02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:14.890
OK. That generated both
heat and eventually light

02:10:14.890 --> 02:10:16.190
because they got some
really good studies.

02:10:16.190 --> 02:10:21.580
But everybody was really
mad for awhile and so forth.

02:10:21.580 --> 02:10:23.100
Now, why did I end up going there?

02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:24.400
OK. I'm not sure.

02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:25.700
I'm going to come back
to this a minute.

02:10:25.700 --> 02:10:27.000
OK. Right.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.300
OK. So, here we're
going to talk about--

02:10:28.300 --> 02:10:31.380
I'll come back just a minute.

02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:34.270
That in general, genetics of
psychiatric disorders that is

02:10:34.270 --> 02:10:36.440
at least the ones schizophrenia,
bipolar,

02:10:36.440 --> 02:10:39.930
and depression have been
difficult and I started

02:10:39.930 --> 02:10:42.870
in the area got our grant
in 1988 and, you know,

02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:47.370
through about 2005 it was--
what we got was experience

02:10:47.370 --> 02:10:49.850 position:56%
and of course experience is the name
you give to your mistakes, right?

02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:54.390
And I did discover, had
three great discovers

02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:56.270
and those are three young people
that were much smarter than me

02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:58.880
and they are now actually running
great programs around the country.

02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:03.350
But eventually when we
started coalescing samples

02:11:03.350 --> 02:11:07.840
into very large samples and
had access to every, you know,

02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:10.370
sequence variant in the genome

02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:14.110
and easily could do a
million variants at one time.

02:11:14.110 --> 02:11:17.380
And now it can actually sequence
the whole genome as well.

02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:18.920
We-- Things started coming out.

02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:20.290
OK. And this is just to show you.

02:11:20.290 --> 02:11:23.050
This is the 12 or so
for bipolar disorder.

02:11:23.050 --> 02:11:24.980
Although you'll notice
down at the bottom

02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:26.890
that it says BD plus schizophrenia.

02:11:26.890 --> 02:11:32.480
OK. So that there are both
overlapping ones with schizophrenia

02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:34.780
and ones that don't
appear to be overlapping.

02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:37.030
Down at the very bottom, you
see bipolar disorder and RUD.

02:11:37.030 --> 02:11:39.660
That is recurrent unipolar
depression.

02:11:39.660 --> 02:11:43.750
OK. And so, you know, that's--

02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:46.530
it's very interesting but
the one that's been toughest

02:11:46.530 --> 02:11:49.800
to do is depression
in any of its forms.

02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:54.190
Bipolar depression better than
non-bipolar depression, but why?

02:11:54.190 --> 02:11:55.490
It's so much more common?

02:11:55.490 --> 02:11:57.760
It's about eight times more
common than bipolar disorder.

02:11:57.760 --> 02:12:00.390
And we've-- and I'll show
you some of the samples

02:12:00.390 --> 02:12:01.930
that have been ascertained.

02:12:01.930 --> 02:12:03.230
But I'm going to probably--

02:12:03.230 --> 02:12:04.630
I'm thinking if the
slides are in the order.

02:12:04.630 --> 02:12:05.930
I'm hoping they're in.

02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:09.270
Yes. I'll be telling you a little
bit about how the progress has gone

02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:12.830
when you have funding-- sufficient
funding and sufficient samples.

02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:17.680
OK. And basically, the sampling
methods when Dr. Insel stop wanting

02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:21.940 position:56%
to pay for phenotypes, the
investigators are resourceful people

02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:25.190
and they went and purchased
everybody in Sweden, right.

02:12:25.190 --> 02:12:28.290 position:56%
All their DNA is from Sweden or
from Denmark and that's really good.

02:12:28.290 --> 02:12:31.320
Those people have health systems,
that absolutely was the right thing

02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.700
to do and they had a reasonably
robust way of making diagnoses.

02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:39.490
And so, by 2011, once they
started doing that, they did--

02:12:39.490 --> 02:12:40.940
they could do a million markers.

02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:45.340 position:56%
OK. Each one against-- and this is--
you can see here it's chromosome 1

02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:48.060
on the left if you can see
it, and the chromosomes are 1

02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:52.360
through 22 living out
the X and Y chromosome.

02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:55.580
And so, these are-- if
you can think of them,

02:12:55.580 --> 02:12:57.710
is tipped over on their side.

02:12:57.710 --> 02:13:00.790
And then up at the top, going
up above this line where you see

02:13:00.790 --> 02:13:02.730
between 7 and 8 is the point

02:13:02.730 --> 02:13:05.370
at which things become
statistically significant.

02:13:05.370 --> 02:13:10.350
But this requires like
10,000 samples to do it.

02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:12.030
And that's not easy to come by.

02:13:12.030 --> 02:13:15.870 position:56%
OK. And so, the group,
particularly, at the Broad Institute

02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:20.090
and with collaboration from the
clinicians and toilers in the field

02:13:20.090 --> 02:13:23.640
who actually see the patients
came up with this in 2011

02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:25.560
and then they just got
a few more samples.

02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:29.120
Double the sample size,
triple the sample size.

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.490
And by 2013, they actually
ended the red line,

02:13:34.490 --> 02:13:36.000
it's at the same place
by the way folks.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:37.600
It's just the scale
here has changed.

02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:40.360
The top of the other scale was
12, the top of the scale is 30

02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:42.360
and that's the exponent
of the P value.

02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:47.860
OK. For those of you
who live in that world.

02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:53.740
But the point is they now have
here 108 loci, presumably,

02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:55.040
for the most part, genes.

02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:57.220
OK. Sometimes, they
can't tell if a loci is

02:13:57.220 --> 02:14:00.760
of this particular gene
or that one or both.

02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:04.150
But-- And you can see by the way
the tallest one, there is that--

02:14:04.150 --> 02:14:06.910
in schizophrenia forever has
been on chromosome 6 right

02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:10.470
in the major histocompatibility
region which has been in one sense,

02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:13.370
the Bermuda Triangle for
geneticist trying to dissect it

02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:14.670
because it's so complicated.

02:14:14.670 --> 02:14:18.210
OK. But that has now been dissected
quite well in schizophrenia

02:14:18.210 --> 02:14:22.710
and we now have a component
of the compliment system, C4,

02:14:22.710 --> 02:14:25.620
that appears to be quite
abnormal in schizophrenia.

02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:27.810
OK. Not necessarily
in all schizophrenics,

02:14:27.810 --> 02:14:31.660
but with the sample size like
this they could dissect it down.

02:14:31.660 --> 02:14:34.000
And so, it looks like it's
going to be an important clue.

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.970
And by the way, did I ever expect

02:14:35.970 --> 02:14:38.160
that we would fine the
cause of all forms of these?

02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:39.500
No, I didn't.

02:14:39.500 --> 02:14:43.790
Keep in mind, these are syndromes,
you know, going back to that model.

02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:47.480
And whether it's congestive heart
failure, if we did a genetic study

02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:49.890 position:56%
of congestive heart failure, you
know, that would be too complicated.

02:14:49.890 --> 02:14:52.640 position:56%
Well, these are syndromes and we
don't know really if there's a level

02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:56.130 position:56%
of congestive heart failure, for us
which might be simple versus dropsy.

02:14:56.130 --> 02:15:01.520 position:56%
OK. So that-- we don't know where
we are because haven't yet created--

02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:02.820
we don't have a pathology.

02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:04.780
OK. Really the simplest
way looking at it.

02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:07.450
Now, these studies have been
very important and I'm going

02:15:07.450 --> 02:15:12.060
to go backwards here to pick up
this slide and that people notice

02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:16.150
that so many of the genes that
were being identified had multiple

02:15:16.150 --> 02:15:17.740
diseases they were associated with.

02:15:17.740 --> 02:15:21.450
OK. And so this early on
led some people to say well,

02:15:21.450 --> 02:15:24.200 position:56%
Kraepelin was wrong, it isn't manic,
depress, insanity, schizophrenia,

02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:25.500
it's all really one thing.

02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:29.210
OK. They are now, I think,
not saying that anymore.

02:15:29.210 --> 02:15:32.900
And you do want to wait and
see how things turn out.

02:15:32.900 --> 02:15:35.670
And-- But there's no doubt
about it that there are a lot

02:15:35.670 --> 02:15:37.760
of shared genes in this thing.

02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:40.050
OK. And I'm going to get to
the question a little bit

02:15:40.050 --> 02:15:43.030
about why have we not
evolved out of depression.

02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:48.390
OK. And so that what you can see
is ADHD, BPD or bipolar disorder,

02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:52.810
schizophrenia, major depression
and autism spectrum disorder,

02:15:52.810 --> 02:15:55.780
and that's just the
heritability for each.

02:15:55.780 --> 02:15:59.360
OK. And then what they've done then
is looked at the co-heritabilities

02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.370
between disorders and you
can kind of to see that.

02:16:01.370 --> 02:16:05.620 position:56%
And what you can see is that bipolar
disorder and MDD are related,

02:16:05.620 --> 02:16:07.960
it seems, but no more
so than schizophrenia

02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:10.530
and unipolar disorder are.

02:16:10.530 --> 02:16:14.260
OK. And schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder do seem related

02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:16.550
at least in some significant way.

02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:19.440
OK. So that's-- shouldn't
be too surprising, I mean,

02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:23.080
the genetic overlap between asthma
and Crone's disease is substantial.

02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:25.320
But they are importantly
different diseases.

02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:27.340
Not-- But they also are
importantly the same

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:30.240
in some ways, some molecular level.

02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:32.030
OK. So I've done that.

02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:34.250
So look that's the
kind of, if you will,

02:16:34.250 --> 02:16:35.930
the sort of the story of genetics.

02:16:35.930 --> 02:16:37.310
Now the real issue is you got to--

02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:43.230
what we want though is if we
can't find everybody's model

02:16:43.230 --> 02:16:45.660
of their disease, what we'd
like to do is at least find one.

02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:48.050
OK. And say, can I figure

02:16:48.050 --> 02:16:50.410
out how Mother Nature made
one case of bipolar disorder?

02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:52.640
In fact that was my goal
when I started these things.

02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:55.850
Just need to find one because that
will at least gives us something

02:16:55.850 --> 02:16:57.380
to look for other things to come.

02:16:57.380 --> 02:16:59.550
And just like the-- in
Alzheimer's disease,

02:16:59.550 --> 02:17:03.150
the APP mutation amyloid
precursor protein was tremendous

02:17:03.150 --> 02:17:06.150
in that way even though it counts
for less than 1% of the disease.

02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:07.500
But it gave him a model.

02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:10.590
And the model by the way, now, has
put the amyloid hypothesis on the--

02:17:10.590 --> 02:17:13.130
little bit on the back burner--
whoa, I did something bad.

02:17:13.130 --> 02:17:15.110
What do I do?

02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:16.550
Hit, hit, right, oh, good, thanks.

02:17:16.550 --> 02:17:17.850
Thank you.

02:17:17.850 --> 02:17:19.150
I feel much better.

02:17:19.150 --> 02:17:20.630
My stress level just went
down, oh, everything.

02:17:20.630 --> 02:17:24.810
But I stop degenerating
there for a minute.

02:17:24.810 --> 02:17:27.420
OK. The-- sorry, where
the heck was I?

02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:30.690
At any rate, I want to find out how
Mother Nature made one case, OK,

02:17:30.690 --> 02:17:33.080 position:56%
and then [inaudible] other diseases.

02:17:33.080 --> 02:17:37.130
OK. Now, OK, this is
the one [inaudible].

02:17:37.130 --> 02:17:38.430
This is the study I
was going to show--

02:17:38.430 --> 02:17:41.890
last study on this to show you when
they put five disorders together,

02:17:41.890 --> 02:17:44.180
OK, and pretended that
they all had the same,

02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:46.390
the five that you've already seen,

02:17:46.390 --> 02:17:49.070
they could still find things
that were significant.

02:17:49.070 --> 02:17:51.190
I think this is-- to be honest
with you, kind of child's play.

02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:53.350
OK. I don't think it's
terribly helpful

02:17:53.350 --> 02:17:57.790
because we know ADHD is different
than bipolar disorder and the fact

02:17:57.790 --> 02:18:00.000
that they have some
overlap, terrific, good,

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.920
that should tell us
something important.

02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:04.980
But that-- this is not
to me too surprising

02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:07.650
or too informative,
but it is what it is.

02:18:07.650 --> 02:18:11.660
So, now, here is-- look, the point
is that people have now gotten

02:18:11.660 --> 02:18:14.530
on to major depression and
they've collected large samples.

02:18:14.530 --> 02:18:18.520 position:56%
And the thing is we don't have much
to show for it and we should by now.

02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:24.250
In fact, with these disorders that
are so heterogeneous and complex,

02:18:24.250 --> 02:18:27.100
you can actually calculate
and since,

02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:29.110
we assumed they are
basically polygenic

02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:31.670
because we haven't done
any autosomal dominant

02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:37.210
or autosomal negative or x link
forms of it that are simple.

02:18:37.210 --> 02:18:39.300
OK. You would think by the
number of people we've collected

02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:41.830
with major depression
now, we should have 20

02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:44.470
or 30 loci link to
it, OK, and we don't.

02:18:44.470 --> 02:18:47.280
And so, well, you could say that's
terrible, you can feel discouraged.

02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:50.200
But you can also say, all
right, time for an idea, right,

02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:52.020
time for somebody to look
at this in a different way.

02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:53.580
OK. And we'll just talk about that

02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:55.140
because there's some
simple ways to do it.

02:18:55.140 --> 02:18:57.940
But I'm-- But there is some
interesting ways as well.

02:18:57.940 --> 02:18:59.240
They might be a new treatment

02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:01.870
that gives you insight
or lot of other things.

02:19:01.870 --> 02:19:04.550
OK. So, they-- if the group--

02:19:04.550 --> 02:19:06.750
the major depression
disorder working group, again,

02:19:06.750 --> 02:19:13.160
a large collaboration had 18,759
independent, unrelated subject

02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:16.120
of Europe ancestry, 9000 and
some were had major depression

02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:18.010
and 9500 were controls.

02:19:18.010 --> 02:19:20.250
And then, they had a replication
phase because in these days,

02:19:20.250 --> 02:19:22.200
with this big machinery
you don't want

02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:24.110
to publish a finding unless
you can also replicate it.

02:19:24.110 --> 02:19:25.700
They had second sample waiting

02:19:25.700 --> 02:19:28.900
where they have 6700
cases and 50,000 controls.

02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:34.440
OK. And no gene or a locus
achieved genome wide significance.

02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:37.290
OK. Now, again, that doesn't
mean there aren't any.

02:19:37.290 --> 02:19:39.380
It just means that with
all these multiple testing,

02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:42.880
testing a million markers
at one time is going

02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:47.000
to cost statistical issues for you
because you can-- you don't have--

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:51.130
if you lower your threshold
you'll have more false positives

02:19:51.130 --> 02:19:52.430
than true passers.

02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:53.810
No, we don't want that, obviously.

02:19:53.810 --> 02:19:56.850
Now-- And so, it' interesting.

02:19:56.850 --> 02:20:02.270
The-- And then, actually,
even in their secondary looks

02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:06.120
at major depression, they took
ones were males and females

02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:07.660
because there's a big
difference there,

02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:10.770
recurrent versus nonrecurrent,
recurrent and early onset,

02:20:10.770 --> 02:20:13.160
and just age of onset by itself.

02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:14.630
And none of them came up either.

02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:17.240
Now, each of those by the way
would shrink the example size.

02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:20.480
OK. But that's where we are.

02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:23.010
And in the MDD-bipolar
cross-disorder analysis

02:20:23.010 --> 02:20:26.640 position:56%
which is the thing-- one the things
that we think is going to important.

02:20:26.640 --> 02:20:28.450
There were 15 SNPs that did--

02:20:28.450 --> 02:20:30.540
but they're all at one
place on chromosome 3.

02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:34.290
OK. That did exceed the
genome-wide significance.

02:20:34.290 --> 02:20:36.820
But in bipolar disorders, I was
saying, we now have about 12,

02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:39.650
some people would say may be it's
going to be up 30 in a few months.

02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:44.410
But the issue for schizophrenia
and for us is for the most part,

02:20:44.410 --> 02:20:48.790
we still can't turn those genes
into a story, into a model.

02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:52.360
OK. And that's the-- And
that's why we need insights,

02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:55.610
non-genetic insight, as well
as digging away at the genes

02:20:55.610 --> 02:20:57.010
and looking at what
they actually do.

02:20:57.010 --> 02:21:00.870
OK. And the technology even for
doing that is amazing these days.

02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:03.520
And like the CRISPR
technology actually allows you

02:21:03.520 --> 02:21:07.440
to keep modifying a variant
and seeing what it does

02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:09.990
in cell cultures, you know,
about how it acts differently.

02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:11.370
And so that's really cool.

02:21:11.370 --> 02:21:13.540
It blows my mind.

02:21:13.540 --> 02:21:16.810
OK. So, now, here's a
point I want to mention.

02:21:16.810 --> 02:21:19.740
OK. And actually on the
one hand of replication,

02:21:19.740 --> 02:21:22.580
its true Carlos is
hard in psychiatric.

02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:26.450 position:56%
But there are a thousand slides that
look like this, OK, as you know.

02:21:26.450 --> 02:21:28.720
And this is some antidepressant
and placebo.

02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:30.400
This one is actually lucky.

02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:31.700
They were very lucky.

02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:34.380
And I have-- they got [inaudible]
in 28 days, as Carlos says,

02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:36.330
it usually takes longer than that.

02:21:36.330 --> 02:21:38.960
But basically, what this is showing
is two things to keep in mind,

02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:41.130
that do make this not so easy.

02:21:41.130 --> 02:21:44.900
One is, the first week placebo is
working darn well, wouldn't it?

02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:46.560
OK. That's number one.

02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:49.460
And the restoration of hope, you
know, I know what's wrong with you.

02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:50.760
I'm going to treat you.

02:21:50.760 --> 02:21:52.060
You're going to get better.

02:21:52.060 --> 02:21:54.490
But as I tell my young psychiatrist

02:21:54.490 --> 02:21:59.420
after a week you better
have something in the pill.

02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:04.250
OK. And then after the one week
is over, they separate but it's--

02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:06.180
this doesn't really
show you the scatter.

02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:09.470
OK. And what you'll see
with the tricyclics is

02:22:09.470 --> 02:22:11.250
that some people get
just flat out well.

02:22:11.250 --> 02:22:15.530
OK. And some people might go back,
go-- get even worse than this.

02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:20.790
OK. Having said that, but there's--
as you saw from the STAR D study

02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:24.650
that about 30%, only about 30% of
patients will go into remission

02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:26.170
in some reasonable time period.

02:22:26.170 --> 02:22:30.430
OK. And the others will get, you
know, at least 50% improvement.

02:22:30.430 --> 02:22:33.390
By the way, 50% improvement if you
have a bad depression, you know,

02:22:33.390 --> 02:22:37.450
do not brag about that one.

02:22:37.450 --> 02:22:40.950
OK. Because people still, you know,
don't want to get up the next day

02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:43.900
on 50% improvement with these
kind of patients who, by the way,

02:22:43.900 --> 02:22:45.930
these people are starting
with the Hamilton score of 30.

02:22:45.930 --> 02:22:47.890
That's big.

02:22:47.890 --> 02:22:50.120
That's a patient that
[inaudible] patient unit.

02:22:50.120 --> 02:22:52.800
OK. Now, everybody says, but
wait a second, we're treating

02:22:52.800 --> 02:22:54.660
so many people with
antidepressants now.

02:22:54.660 --> 02:22:56.610
OK. And we got them.

02:22:56.610 --> 02:22:59.160
You know, why aren't we reducing
suicide rates and why aren't we,

02:22:59.160 --> 02:23:00.790
you know, reducing the prevalence,

02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:02.720
at least the point
prevalence f depression?

02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:06.050
And here's part of the answer and
this comes from a young man who's--

02:23:06.050 --> 02:23:08.030
he did this work when
he was at Colombia,

02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:09.670
Ramin Mojtabai, whose
a joint recruit.

02:23:09.670 --> 02:23:13.990
He's in the Department of Primaries
and Department of Mental Health,

02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:17.620
Hopkins has the only Department
of Mental Health in any school

02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:19.100
of public health in the world
as far as we could tell.

02:23:19.100 --> 02:23:21.810
If somebody knows differently
I'll be happy to hear it.

02:23:21.810 --> 02:23:23.430
But I think that's tremendous.

02:23:23.430 --> 02:23:25.410
And they have a group of people.

02:23:25.410 --> 02:23:27.900
They are kindred spirits
and our secret weapon.

02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:31.330 position:56%
OK. So, Ramin went out and looked at
this and what he saw was that most

02:23:31.330 --> 02:23:35.160
of the increase, OK, in the use
of antidepressants is in patient

02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:39.390 position:56%
where the doctor isn't even giving a
psychiatric diagnosis in the chart.

02:23:39.390 --> 02:23:42.160
Now, many of those people
probably have anxiety disorders.

02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:44.530
These things-- The SSRIs
work quite well for anxiety.

02:23:44.530 --> 02:23:48.130
OK. Some of them-- who knows
what they're getting for.

02:23:48.130 --> 02:23:51.920
OK. So-- And the interesting thing
is you can study severe forms

02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:53.840
of major depression.

02:23:53.840 --> 02:23:56.030
There's not an appreciable
in the percentage

02:23:56.030 --> 02:23:58.690
of them being treated
actively with the treatment

02:23:58.690 --> 02:23:59.990
that would be a sugar pill.

02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:03.780
OK. So, the antidepressants
are multiplying.

02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:05.080
Their use is multiplying,

02:24:05.080 --> 02:24:06.630
80% of course are prescribed
by non-psychiatrist.

02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:08.130 position:56%
But the psychiatrist aren't perfect.

02:24:08.130 --> 02:24:10.310
I don't want to put us up is
the-- as the goal standard.

02:24:10.310 --> 02:24:14.510
But we-- But it is true that in
the primary care clinic, thank God,

02:24:14.510 --> 02:24:16.490
they're now talking about
putting us with them

02:24:16.490 --> 02:24:18.440
in the primary care clinics
and trying to help them

02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:20.270
because they know this
is a problem for them.

02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:23.120
OK. So, now, how else
might get there?

02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:24.470
Carlos showed you one way.

02:24:24.470 --> 02:24:28.890 position:56%
If we can track back through the MDA
receptor and he showed us both the--

02:24:28.890 --> 02:24:30.270 position:56%
that receptor and the AMPA receptor,

02:24:30.270 --> 02:24:31.870
each of those look
like great targets.

02:24:31.870 --> 02:24:34.640
OK. That's can't-- we're going
to-- well, that'll be useful.

02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:37.970
Here's one that we heard the other
day in bipolar disorder from one

02:24:37.970 --> 02:24:41.130
of the members-- by the way the--
I'm going to stop being chairman

02:24:41.130 --> 02:24:43.750
of the department at
Hopkins in June after 7--

02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:48.970
after 14 years, seems like
17, but it's only been 14.

02:24:48.970 --> 02:24:51.480
But I am already the
chairman of the board

02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:53.270
of the National Network
of Depression Centers.

02:24:53.270 --> 02:24:55.770
I do want to mention
that because we're going

02:24:55.770 --> 02:24:57.930
to need that, OK, I think.

02:24:57.930 --> 02:25:00.470
OK. I think-- and so-- But
here if you can see it,

02:25:00.470 --> 02:25:04.130
if you can make it out, the red and
the purple and then the light green

02:25:04.130 --> 02:25:08.220
and the darker green are cell
lines, OK, that are occurring.

02:25:08.220 --> 02:25:09.560
These are deprogrammed cells

02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:11.760
that are then programmed
to be like neurons.

02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:16.400
OK. And what you can see in the top
bar, the red and the light green,

02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:18.110
these are in their native state

02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:20.720
without lithium onboard
in the cell culture.

02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:23.550
OK. And they are firing
in a hyperactive way.

02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:24.970
Actually, I don't' know
that you can tell that.

02:25:24.970 --> 02:25:26.860
But this is hyperactive firing.

02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:29.910
OK. But these people that
we're sell lines were made

02:25:29.910 --> 02:25:34.510 position:56%
from were already treated for number
years for their bipolar disorder.

02:25:34.510 --> 02:25:37.520
And some of them were selected to
be excellent lithium responders.

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:39.680
They're kind of people that
just seem to get well on it.

02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:42.290
OK. And others were not so
good lithium responders.

02:25:42.290 --> 02:25:45.650
OK. And in the ones that
were lithium responders,

02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:47.020
that's LR up here.

02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:50.090
OK. OK. And in LR,
look what happened

02:25:50.090 --> 02:25:51.840
in the purple compared to the red.

02:25:51.840 --> 02:25:54.520
OK. So-- And only in them though.

02:25:54.520 --> 02:25:56.590
You go down below light
green to dark green,

02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:58.140
really not much happen at all.

02:25:58.140 --> 02:26:02.080
OK. So, it does seem that there may
be something about this, you know.

02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:04.900
And if it were hyperexcitable
neurons, that would be great

02:26:04.900 --> 02:26:08.100
because then we think about mania
and have a visual image of it.

02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:10.990
But, you know, at any
rate it is useful.

02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:14.870
And this was done out at UC
San Diego with John Kelsoe

02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:16.600
as the lead psychiatrist
and Fred Gage

02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:21.190
as the stem cell guy, if you will.

02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:23.940
OK. So, by the way, at the end

02:26:23.940 --> 02:26:26.940
of the day they're comparing very
small number of people cell here.

02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:29.080
OK. So, we need to replicate this.

02:26:29.080 --> 02:26:32.580 position:56%
And if confirmed, we need way to
test it in larger populations to see

02:26:32.580 --> 02:26:34.550
if we can turn it into
something that's robust,

02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:36.940
just like we're trying to do
with the ketamine response.

02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:38.600
We know there are people
that respond to it.

02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:40.340
How can we turn it into
something as robust?

02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:45.540
OK. So, at any rate, look, on the
one hand we still want the genes.

02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:48.130
Why? Because even thought
we have a lot of stories

02:26:48.130 --> 02:26:50.580
that make partial sense
of these conditions,

02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:53.060
we still need to have a parts list.

02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:55.080
And that's the-- Eric
Lander would use that term.

02:26:55.080 --> 02:26:56.520
I want the parts list.

02:26:56.520 --> 02:26:59.360 position:56%
And then, let's see how we-- it'll
still take awhile to construct them.

02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:00.660
Put them back.

02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:02.430
Put them together in some
forms that look rational.

02:27:02.430 --> 02:27:05.620
And to do that, we're going
to need 30,000 cases or more.

02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:09.780
OK. And looking at particular
treatment as Carlos is doing

02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:12.230
and they're molecular targets
and associate them with generic

02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:15.120
and other molecule variations,
certainly a good idea.

02:27:15.120 --> 02:27:16.560
And-- But if the genetics

02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:19.620
and the neuroscience doesn't tell
us what depression is, OK, we--

02:27:19.620 --> 02:27:21.230
ours is a working hypothesis.

02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:24.100
OK. If they don't tell us,
then we're going to have to try

02:27:24.100 --> 02:27:28.200
and redefine it ourselves to see
if then they could do it, right?

02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:31.890 position:56%
OK. So, that is really the
question, what is depression as much

02:27:31.890 --> 02:27:34.340
as how do you do the
genetics of this thing.

02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:37.600
So, Phil mentioned
prominently, melancholia,

02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:40.980
and I think that is an
important point because many

02:27:40.980 --> 02:27:46.730
of the older professors like Phil
who are very smart have said,

02:27:46.730 --> 02:27:49.980 position:56%
wait a second, with that checklist
you're including way too many people

02:27:49.980 --> 02:27:51.280
in this thing.

02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:52.660
OK. And is that the problem?

02:27:52.660 --> 02:27:57.000
OK. Now, one problem with
undoing that and is that we know

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.390
from past studies that
people that didn't--

02:27:59.390 --> 02:28:01.440
wouldn't qualify for
melancholia, they didn't look

02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:02.740
like they had melancholia.

02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:04.740
They look like had
pretty garden variety mild

02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:06.040
or moderate depressions.

02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:08.230
Some of them respond quite
well to antidepressant, too.

02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:09.910
And I don't want deprive
them of treatment.

02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:13.730
The problem is they look identical
to their brethren and out there

02:28:13.730 --> 02:28:15.390
and that part of the Venn diagram.

02:28:15.390 --> 02:28:18.880
OK. And some of them are
responders, some of them are not.

02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:21.320
And so probably what we
got is [inaudible] mixture

02:28:21.320 --> 02:28:22.620
of some sort out there.

02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:25.870
OK. So, that's-- So where
do you draw the circle?

02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:29.110
Now, by the way, the
folk who don't go back

02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:30.560
and read the old literature
they say, but Ray,

02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:32.960
if you do that yours going to
take you another 20 years just

02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:35.240
to get sample because
you're going to lose power

02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:36.860 position:56%
if you don't have a big sample size.

02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:39.360
Well, OK, next question.

02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:40.660
OK, right?

02:28:40.660 --> 02:28:42.380
So, well, how else
might we divide it?

02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:47.000
So, melancholia versus the major
depression that's not melancholy

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.370
would be one sensible way if
we could get enough samples.

02:28:50.370 --> 02:28:51.840
Major depression associated
with stroke.

02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:54.430
There's a very regular
relationship on depression

02:28:54.430 --> 02:28:57.330
that follows stroke
and brain lesions.

02:28:57.330 --> 02:28:59.000 position:56%
But there's probably a genetics just

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.840
like there's a genetics least
resistance to HIV infection, right?

02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:06.140
Major depression associated

02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:07.520
with bipolar disorder,
we've already mentioned.

02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:09.450
But also major depression
associated with Parkinson's.

02:29:09.450 --> 02:29:10.880
Lady had the brain stimulation.

02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:13.510
Fifty percent of patients with
Parkinson's get depression.

02:29:13.510 --> 02:29:16.240
And they get it early before
their motor symptoms are dramatic.

02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:19.060
And by the way, seminally,
Huntington's disease patients do

02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:20.400
and some of them get
bipolar disorder.

02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:22.640
And it usually comes
early in their illness.

02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:26.360
By the way, that part of the brain
is now a very hot topic for us

02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:28.060
as well, has been for
about 30 years.

02:29:28.060 --> 02:29:29.940
But 40 years ago, we
certainly didn't.

02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:32.970
In 1966, no one was thinking
that the vasoganglia were going

02:29:32.970 --> 02:29:35.790
to give anything to
psychiatry, but they're key.

02:29:35.790 --> 02:29:38.280
So-- And then, again,

02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:42.050
said my favorite category is major
depressive disorder associated

02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:43.350
with who knows what.

02:29:43.350 --> 02:29:45.190
OK. Right.

02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:48.750
So, now look, that--
but I was told by Phil

02:29:48.750 --> 02:29:51.480
that this thing was called
depression cannot be cured.

02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:53.210
It says right here
on the top of page.

02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:57.350
And [inaudible] that really
is vexed question, Phil.

02:29:57.350 --> 02:30:00.670
And, look, on the one hand, we
need better treatment for sure.

02:30:00.670 --> 02:30:01.970
There's just no doubt about that.

02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:04.930
OK. So that-- go ahead,
keep seeking that.

02:30:04.930 --> 02:30:10.600
But my oncology friend, they rarely
used the word "cure" anymore.

02:30:10.600 --> 02:30:14.800 position:56%
They say actually some of the more--

02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:17.920
[inaudible] ones tell me that a
cure is when die of something else,

02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:19.300 position:56%
you know, when you're not depressed.

02:30:19.300 --> 02:30:25.870
OK. And so in that by that
account I've cured a couple people.

02:30:25.870 --> 02:30:30.090
OK. So whether the cure
longstanding remission,

02:30:30.090 --> 02:30:31.860
I'll take longstanding
remission, too,

02:30:31.860 --> 02:30:33.160
although by the way, you can cure.

02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:34.460
Why wouldn't we?

02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:35.760
But it may be legit.

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:37.060
You know, we'll have to see.

02:30:37.060 --> 02:30:38.970
This-- And it may be that that's
not a realistic way to look

02:30:38.970 --> 02:30:41.170
at this disease if Phil was right.

02:30:41.170 --> 02:30:45.440
Because if it is-- why is-- why
have we not evolve out of it?

02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:49.160
Well, it's got to impair your
reproduction, number one.

02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:53.490
OK. And two, it cannot
involve things that are vital

02:30:53.490 --> 02:30:54.950
for your-- for the body to work.

02:30:54.950 --> 02:31:00.430
OK. So-- And with a hundred genes
likely, maybe a thousand genes

02:31:00.430 --> 02:31:02.660
and it's part of this,
hey, guess what?

02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:04.780
These things are probably
important as Phil said.

02:31:04.780 --> 02:31:08.220
So, sorry, we didn't turn
out perfect, you know.

02:31:08.220 --> 02:31:11.470
But-- And this may be, as
he says, the price we pay.

02:31:11.470 --> 02:31:16.500
Having said that, if we can get
good at knowing it when we see it,

02:31:16.500 --> 02:31:17.800
we can do what he's suggesting.

02:31:17.800 --> 02:31:21.310
And that is working with the
patient, OK, in all manner of ways.

02:31:21.310 --> 02:31:23.900
OK. To help them manage this.

02:31:23.900 --> 02:31:27.970
OK. And that's what I
do and I love doing it.

02:31:27.970 --> 02:31:29.290
And they used to talk about it.

02:31:29.290 --> 02:31:32.040
One of the things I didn't like
when many of our colleagues were

02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:33.620
out there doing drug
studies and saying,

02:31:33.620 --> 02:31:34.920
treat to remission,
treat to remission.

02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:38.230
I say, great just tell me how, I'll
do it you know, I do it sometimes,

02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:40.180
but it doesn't happen
all that often.

02:31:40.180 --> 02:31:43.130
And when I-- I like better
the recovery concept,

02:31:43.130 --> 02:31:45.220
because that means
recover your life.

02:31:45.220 --> 02:31:48.900
OK. So if I can get the person
functioning again, I say,

02:31:48.900 --> 02:31:51.160
be careful, you know,
everything I do is empirical.

02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:53.340
So the next thing we do,
let's take a little time,

02:31:53.340 --> 02:31:55.070
you're actually functioning
a little bit now,

02:31:55.070 --> 02:31:57.070
let's use that for a little bit
and then let's come back and think

02:31:57.070 --> 02:31:58.370
about treatment again later.

02:31:58.370 --> 02:32:00.800
So I do think that this
may be the nature--

02:32:00.800 --> 02:32:04.140
part of the nature of our
machine and our mechanism.

02:32:04.140 --> 02:32:07.260
It may not be curable
on the one hand.

02:32:07.260 --> 02:32:11.440
On the other hand, this
work as you can see I think

02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:15.990 position:56%
and with these two people in front
of you is for the committed but also

02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:20.030
for the well-supported and not
just financially but that, too, OK.

02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:24.090
And it's not a quick way to fame
and fortune as they can attest.

02:32:24.090 --> 02:32:26.890
Answers may come in small
steps though also like cancer.

02:32:26.890 --> 02:32:28.720
So before-- now I'm going to switch

02:32:28.720 --> 02:32:30.540
to that other talk just
to show a couple things.

02:32:30.540 --> 02:32:33.520
OK. And we'll-- yes.

02:32:33.520 --> 02:32:34.820
OK, thanks.

02:32:34.820 --> 02:32:37.770
And this is my National Network of
Depression talk and I'm just going

02:32:37.770 --> 02:32:42.220
to say, look, we do need these
large multicenter networks

02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:44.480
that are stable, that aren't
changing every five years

02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:45.780
as funding changes.

02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:47.100
OK. I believe.

02:32:47.100 --> 02:32:49.320
But now it's going to take awhile.

02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:52.440
Because we need very large samples
with the power to find genetic

02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:56.020
and brain imaging changes that
will illuminate causal pathways.

02:32:56.020 --> 02:32:59.690
We need to go beyond
expert opinions in setting

02:32:59.690 --> 02:33:00.990
up our so-called guidelines.

02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:04.920
Evidence-based medicine is really
expert-based medicine in our field.

02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:07.130
And we need to have a way of-- we--

02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:09.580
our plans is to have
about 20,000 people

02:33:09.580 --> 02:33:12.200
under care using the
same essential record

02:33:12.200 --> 02:33:14.330
or instruments and
to share the data.

02:33:14.330 --> 02:33:16.660
So that-- although that's
observational and therefore,

02:33:16.660 --> 02:33:19.510
hypothesis generating, it can be
a little bit hypothesis testing

02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:21.110
in the practical world to say, hey,

02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:22.810
you think it's that
way, let's go look.

02:33:22.810 --> 02:33:25.110
Let's take a quick look and
see how the people look.

02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:27.920
So there's lot of reasons
why we need this.

02:33:27.920 --> 02:33:31.000
And so we do have a network of--

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.300
National Network of
Depression Centers

02:33:32.300 --> 02:33:34.880
and there is an forming I
think a network of networks.

02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:38.530
So there's a Canadian group of
six centers and there's a group

02:33:38.530 --> 02:33:40.960
in Germany that looks like
they will come in as well.

02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:45.030 position:56%
And we have 25 centers under working
to collect patients in this manner.

02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:46.890
And I just thought I'd mentioned
that because that's going

02:33:46.890 --> 02:33:48.260
to keep me busy for awhile.

02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:50.570
So why don' I stop there
and answer questions.

02:33:50.570 --> 02:33:52.370
Thanks very much.

02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:56.280
[ Applause ]

02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:58.320
And I'm told we have
really short time

02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:02.050
and the other two guys should come
up here and join in the questions.

02:34:02.050 --> 02:34:03.350
Other questions?

02:34:03.350 --> 02:34:04.650
Yes sir?

02:34:04.650 --> 02:34:05.950
&gt;&gt; Well that's a terrific talk.

02:34:05.950 --> 02:34:08.080
I have a lot of questions.

02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:12.680
First of all, is there-- are there
cultural variations in depression?

02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:14.860
The reason I asked that is
I'm a visiting professor all

02:34:14.860 --> 02:34:17.210
over the world and in my
own scientific observation,

02:34:17.210 --> 02:34:19.250
there are huge cultural variations.

02:34:19.250 --> 02:34:22.960
The Norwegians are the most damned
depressed people in the world.

02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:25.590
And the Italians-- I've been a
visiting professor all over Italy,

02:34:25.590 --> 02:34:27.570
the Southern Italians
are the least depressed.

02:34:27.570 --> 02:34:28.870
And I wonder if this--

02:34:28.870 --> 02:34:30.170
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
I wish that were true.

02:34:30.170 --> 02:34:31.470
My name is DePaulo.

02:34:31.470 --> 02:34:32.770
I wish that were true.

02:34:32.770 --> 02:34:34.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah, OK.

02:34:34.070 --> 02:34:35.970
Is there any scientific
basis for cultural variation?

02:34:35.970 --> 02:34:37.270
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
A little bit.

02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:39.580
There is a milder form of
depression or even what used

02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:43.530
to be called bipolar II where there
is a distinct seasonal variation

02:34:43.530 --> 02:34:46.720
and which you will see maybe
different some seasonal variation.

02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:49.100
OK. But by in large, these things--

02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:53.510 position:56%
even Kraepelin way back in the 1890s
took a trip to Java at one point.

02:34:53.510 --> 02:34:55.790
So he could find out how it
looked in Java and he say,

02:34:55.790 --> 02:34:57.230
hey, it's basically the same.

02:34:57.230 --> 02:35:01.190
So the rates and the rates vary
but it maybe that translating

02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:04.160
that checklist into 12
languages doesn't get you there.

02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:07.010
So we don't have-- the evidence
is not robust [inaudible].

02:35:07.010 --> 02:35:08.310
OK.

02:35:08.310 --> 02:35:09.610
&gt;&gt; OK. Can I ask another one?

02:35:09.610 --> 02:35:10.910
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yeah, sure.

02:35:10.910 --> 02:35:12.270
&gt;&gt; That checklist I
think is very suspicious.

02:35:12.270 --> 02:35:16.210
The checklist is doubtful
because some--

02:35:16.210 --> 02:35:18.760
that was a good checklist
for old age.

02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:23.720
You have less energy, do you
think more about death, you know--

02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:26.450
I mean, what that proves
is you're old.

02:35:26.450 --> 02:35:27.750
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
Tell me about it.

02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:29.050
That's right.

02:35:29.050 --> 02:35:30.350
That's right

02:35:30.350 --> 02:35:31.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'd like to know more about that.

02:35:31.650 --> 02:35:32.950
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yeah.

02:35:32.950 --> 02:35:34.250
&gt;&gt; OK. But I don't know how
many questions I'm get to ask,

02:35:34.250 --> 02:35:36.670
but I'd like to ask one
thing about the medicines.

02:35:36.670 --> 02:35:38.060
The second speaker told us

02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:40.590
that ketamine were just
great only they're addictive.

02:35:40.590 --> 02:35:41.890
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yeah.

02:35:41.890 --> 02:35:43.190
&gt;&gt; Well, thanks a lot.

02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:44.490
I mean, I can assure a lot
of symptoms with cocaine

02:35:44.490 --> 02:35:47.180
but you got a side effect
that's very unfortunate.

02:35:47.180 --> 02:35:48.480
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yeah.

02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:49.780
Well, look, I mean, that's right.

02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:51.080
&gt;&gt; The other part of that question
is what ever happened to lithium?

02:35:51.080 --> 02:35:55.550
When I was a kid, an undergraduate,
everybody had depression

02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:56.970
and they all got cured by lithium.

02:35:56.970 --> 02:35:58.270
Whatever happened to that?

02:35:58.270 --> 02:35:59.570
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Well,
actually, it's interesting

02:35:59.570 --> 02:36:01.300
because though it-- as an
acute treatment for depression,

02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:03.460
it doesn't seem to be as
good as we thought back then.

02:36:03.460 --> 02:36:07.560
OK. But it does seem to be have
prophylactic value in unipolar,

02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:10.590
severe unipolar patients and in
bipolar patients, but not for all,

02:36:10.590 --> 02:36:12.700
as we could show even in
our some of our studies

02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:14.240
where we're looking at mechanism.

02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:17.090
So, it's dag un-good.

02:36:17.090 --> 02:36:18.630
And when-- And now
that we've learned

02:36:18.630 --> 02:36:22.040 position:56%
to use it better we have fewer
renal side effects in the long haul.

02:36:22.040 --> 02:36:24.180
It's a drug that's
underutilized in this country.

02:36:24.180 --> 02:36:26.470
But it's still treatment of choice
in Europe for bipolar disorder.

02:36:26.470 --> 02:36:27.770
Yeah, go ahead.

02:36:27.770 --> 02:36:29.070
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate:

02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:30.370
I could address the
second part about ketamine.

02:36:30.370 --> 02:36:31.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yeah.

02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:33.290
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate: So, you
know, again, I think I conveyed

02:36:33.290 --> 02:36:37.000
that we studied people
who are very ill.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.300
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
Yeah, absolutely.

02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:40.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate: And in fact
they have failed all the treatments

02:36:40.410 --> 02:36:45.960
for bipolar disorder for
depression and ECT and, you know,

02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:48.090
most were having suicide attempts.

02:36:48.090 --> 02:36:49.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
Yeah, you'd take anything

02:36:49.390 --> 02:36:50.690
if you were in that side.

02:36:50.690 --> 02:36:51.990
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate: I
think the bright side--

02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:53.290
But you do bring up a point.

02:36:53.290 --> 02:36:55.100
And so, it's an issue, a progress.

02:36:55.100 --> 02:36:57.010
We thought back then it was ethical

02:36:57.010 --> 02:36:59.780
to study a decade ago
and it does work.

02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:02.960
And so as researchers,
we don't give up.

02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:04.750
We just try to find
something better.

02:37:04.750 --> 02:37:08.320 position:56%
And I think the recent studies
suggest we can find something better

02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:11.340
that's not addictive
hopefully more studies--

02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:13.670
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: But this
is-- It is a great heuristic value.

02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:15.860
It's got us looking at a
different part of the mechanism.

02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:17.790
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate: The
issue would be, for example,

02:37:17.790 --> 02:37:19.790
the Wright brothers, you know,
who would have gotten up in plane.

02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:21.570
Nobody today would
probably go in that.

02:37:21.570 --> 02:37:23.410
But yet, we travel all the time

02:37:23.410 --> 02:37:24.880
because of progress
that has been made.

02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:26.860
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: So
that's true in RRB [phonetic].

02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:29.780
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate:
They had to put in RRB.

02:37:29.780 --> 02:37:31.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yes ma'am?

02:37:31.080 --> 02:37:32.380
And we go with her.

02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:34.080
Go ahead. Yeah.

02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:35.380
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

02:37:35.380 --> 02:37:38.400
I have a question for both of
you particularly for Dr. Zarate

02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:41.240
about how open this data are.

02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.250
I mean, given the amount of
investments over long periods

02:37:45.250 --> 02:37:47.820
of time, this is very
obvious case for open data.

02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:50.990
So can you tell us a bit more
about where this get deposited,

02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:54.650
how standard the protocols are,
how readily reusable they are,

02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:56.970
and how much reuse
they've actually gotten?

02:37:56.970 --> 02:37:59.980
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Well look,
this is an idea that goes way back

02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:01.420
and it's a very good idea.

02:38:01.420 --> 02:38:04.850
OK. And when I again work with
David Bobstein [assumed spelling],

02:38:04.850 --> 02:38:06.150
he said that's what he wanted.

02:38:06.150 --> 02:38:07.810
He wanted our data to
be out there on the web.

02:38:07.810 --> 02:38:11.520
Actually, the woman Mary-Claire
King who deserves so much credit

02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:13.770
for the breast cancer genes,
that's exactly what she did

02:38:13.770 --> 02:38:15.500
and that's why she
didn't clone the gene

02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:18.540
because she had a company working
alongside her, looking at her data

02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:21.370
on a daily basis every 24
hours and they clone the genes

02:38:21.370 --> 02:38:23.740
and then misuse the patent
which was later revoke.

02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:25.750
But that's what we should be doing.

02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:28.890
OK. In this era of quote
unquote team science,

02:38:28.890 --> 02:38:31.190
it's not just team science,
it's a crowd science.

02:38:31.190 --> 02:38:33.240
OK. We got to quit.

02:38:33.240 --> 02:38:35.960
We got to-- we help
people make progress.

02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:40.150
OK. And so I think there is
still some protectiveness.

02:38:40.150 --> 02:38:43.320
And-- But the other-- But
there's another point.

02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:46.440
Not all data sets are
equally readable.

02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:49.690
OK. And there's a lot of-- unless
you really are good at setting

02:38:49.690 --> 02:38:53.350
up your data set, your
database, you can get it back

02:38:53.350 --> 02:38:54.650
and it doesn't look like much.

02:38:54.650 --> 02:38:57.080
Now, so talk to me
about what you have--

02:38:57.080 --> 02:38:59.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate: Oh,
there at NIH and I mean,

02:38:59.080 --> 02:39:01.310
there are consorted
efforts that, you know,

02:39:01.310 --> 02:39:05.730
you won't get funded unless you put
your data in a public repository.

02:39:05.730 --> 02:39:07.700
And there's some rules
about one year

02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:09.520
or two years protection
for the main thing.

02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:11.910
But that being said, the IT

02:39:11.910 --> 02:39:15.770
and the infrastructure is
one database doesn't talk

02:39:15.770 --> 02:39:18.550
to the other database, the
quality of data obtained

02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:21.950
at many sites is probably
not as best as we would like.

02:39:21.950 --> 02:39:23.250
But there are those efforts.

02:39:23.250 --> 02:39:27.440
Then it's not only that, it's the
computing power once you have these

02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:29.980
humongous sites, how
do you analyze it?

02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:33.000
And so computation is really--

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:34.300
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
It should be done

02:39:34.300 --> 02:39:35.610
and now they're requiring
people to do it.

02:39:35.610 --> 02:39:36.910
But that doesn't mean
it's being done

02:39:36.910 --> 02:39:38.420
in a way that's terribly
illuminating.

02:39:38.420 --> 02:39:41.550
OK. I always think back
to Art Buchwald from--

02:39:41.550 --> 02:39:43.330
the late Art Buchwald
from Washington.

02:39:43.330 --> 02:39:46.480
And he-- whenever talking about
how to do the MX missiles for those

02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:47.780
of you old enough to remember that.

02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:50.460
He favored the idea that we would
put them on rails and round them

02:39:50.460 --> 02:39:52.090
around the country and he
said we should give the--

02:39:52.090 --> 02:39:53.390
we should a Russian a schedule.

02:39:53.390 --> 02:39:54.980
They'll never figure it out.

02:39:54.980 --> 02:39:58.050 position:56%
OK. That's the way you feel when
you look at some of these databases.

02:39:58.050 --> 02:39:59.350
OK.

02:39:59.350 --> 02:40:02.360
I want you to say that when I
did start this research in 1988,

02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:05.190
I started in '86, but we
didn't get funded till '88.

02:40:05.190 --> 02:40:06.780
What I said is what
can we guarantee?

02:40:06.780 --> 02:40:08.900
We can only guarantee that we do
really high quality assessments

02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:12.190
in patients, that we create an
excellent clinical database,

02:40:12.190 --> 02:40:13.800
and then we make good DNA.

02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:15.940
OK. I want you to know,
we did all three.

02:40:15.940 --> 02:40:18.870
And what I say is what I
discovered were three young people

02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:21.700
that were really terrific.

02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:23.000
OK. Yes ma'am?

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:24.300
Right behind you.

02:40:24.300 --> 02:40:26.070
There's lady right behind
you that her hand up, right.

02:40:26.070 --> 02:40:33.040
&gt;&gt; Have there been studies
that people look who are--

02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:41.100
have severe depression, they use
a treatment, they get much better,

02:40:41.100 --> 02:40:46.600 position:56%
does anybody-- has anybody
followed some of these people to see

02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:50.510 position:56%
like if it stopped their
medication, did they continue better

02:40:50.510 --> 02:40:53.160
or did they get worse and then have

02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:54.910
to have another treatment,
the same treatment.

02:40:54.910 --> 02:40:56.340
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
Good questions.

02:40:56.340 --> 02:40:57.950
Carlos you can start there.

02:40:57.950 --> 02:41:00.560
I mean-- well, I mean
the answer is yes

02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:03.130
and basically what we can
tell you is for the most part

02:41:03.130 --> 02:41:05.170
that what get you well
will keep you well.

02:41:05.170 --> 02:41:06.470
And if you go off of it,

02:41:06.470 --> 02:41:08.040
you're likely are nothing
for the most part.

02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:10.610
And recurrent depression that's
the thing they mostly found.

02:41:10.610 --> 02:41:11.910
Having said that--

02:41:11.910 --> 02:41:13.770
&gt;&gt; They're not really cured--

02:41:13.770 --> 02:41:15.080
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
No, absolutely right.

02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:16.380
They're not cured.

02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:17.680
I agree with you.

02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:18.980
That's remission at best.

02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:20.280
No, I completely agree with you.

02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:21.580
OK.

02:41:21.580 --> 02:41:22.880
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate: And we
now prescribe medications.

02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:25.170
Think about, you know, usually
you're given antidepressant

02:41:25.170 --> 02:41:28.560
and that's the acute phase
which could be 6 to 12 weeks.

02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:32.260
And then, if you're responding,
there's a continuation phase

02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:33.940
that goes six months
or a little bit longer.

02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:35.240
And then there's a
maintenance phase.

02:41:35.240 --> 02:41:38.260
And for the first episode of
depression, some have argued,

02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:41.110 position:56%
you could do psychotherapy first,
CBT, or you could do antidepressant.

02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:43.920
But I after, you know, 9 months or
12 months, maybe a little bit long

02:41:43.920 --> 02:41:48.240
if you have one episode
and you have family history

02:41:48.240 --> 02:41:50.470
that don't have significant
family history,

02:41:50.470 --> 02:41:52.450
you may be able to
consider coming off.

02:41:52.450 --> 02:41:56.510
But the problem with that is if
you have stronger family history,

02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:59.380
and the more episodes of
depression you have if you had one,

02:41:59.380 --> 02:42:01.330
there's a 25 % chance
of a second and second.

02:42:01.330 --> 02:42:03.670
If you have two, there's
a-- you know, it goes to 50.

02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:06.580
And for each subsequent, it goes
up to, you know, 75 even higher.

02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:09.160
And so if you had somebody
who's already had several bouts

02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:12.630
of depression plus family history,

02:42:12.630 --> 02:42:14.870
that the likelihood they will
need treatment for a long time.

02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:16.170
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: By the way.

02:42:16.170 --> 02:42:17.470
Let me add other thing
there and that is the--

02:42:17.470 --> 02:42:18.770
I thought you're going to
ask me a tougher question.

02:42:18.770 --> 02:42:20.940
That one was kind of a softball.

02:42:20.940 --> 02:42:23.280
And that is, the one that really
is frustrating is the patient

02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:25.120
that gets very well on a drug

02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:28.270
and continues the drug
and relapses, terrible.

02:42:28.270 --> 02:42:30.790
And that was at one point
called the Prozac poop out.

02:42:30.790 --> 02:42:32.090
It's not about Prozac.

02:42:32.090 --> 02:42:33.390
It didn't change.

02:42:33.390 --> 02:42:35.730
Huh? It does, especially in
certain kinds of patients.

02:42:35.730 --> 02:42:37.200
I think we'd-- probably
in the patients

02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:40.550
that have these chronic depressions
where they have a little bit--

02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:42.530
at least a little bit of
depression almost all the time.

02:42:42.530 --> 02:42:44.440
Those patients and
have that [inaudible].

02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:45.740
Other questions?

02:42:45.740 --> 02:42:47.670
We got a couple here.

02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:53.340
&gt;&gt; I don't have a scientific-- I do
not have a scientific background,

02:42:53.340 --> 02:42:59.130
so let me see if I can phrase
this question properly.

02:42:59.130 --> 02:43:07.420 position:56%
If you have-- supposed you showed in
your genome that you express enough

02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:11.480
of the genes that showed you
how the genetic predisposition

02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:15.740
for depression, but you
might not get depressed.

02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:17.040
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yeah.

02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:18.340
Absolutely.

02:43:18.340 --> 02:43:22.120
&gt;&gt; But suppose, have you done
studies on children specifically

02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:27.340
and I don't know how you would
do that when you're studying,

02:43:27.340 --> 02:43:30.740
you know, your focuses on genes.

02:43:30.740 --> 02:43:33.000
I come from a background

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:39.230
where I believe I know I developed
depression because of situations

02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:41.130 position:56%
that affected me when I was a child.

02:43:41.130 --> 02:43:42.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Sure.

02:43:42.430 --> 02:43:44.720
&gt;&gt; And I also think that there's
a predisposition to depression

02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:47.610
in my family and I have
a brother and sister

02:43:47.610 --> 02:43:51.650
who have not been as
affected as badly.

02:43:51.650 --> 02:43:54.220
And I'm the oldest
child in the family.

02:43:54.220 --> 02:43:58.540
But I think that there is
a tragic lack of attention

02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:05.630
to children especially who
are symptomatic and possibly

02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:10.110
in a variety of ways and if anybody
was paying any attention to them?

02:44:10.110 --> 02:44:11.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
Yeah, well, we have a great--

02:44:11.410 --> 02:44:12.710
&gt;&gt; -- would notice-- and they--

02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:14.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: --
and we do pay attention.

02:44:14.010 --> 02:44:15.310
We do pay attention.

02:44:15.310 --> 02:44:17.150
But I do want to tell you that in
terms of the genetic part of it,

02:44:17.150 --> 02:44:18.890
those studies are not
yet really being done.

02:44:18.890 --> 02:44:22.730
I mean, because there-- right now
we don't have a sufficient set

02:44:22.730 --> 02:44:26.910
of genetic markers that we can
say this person has a 50-50 chance

02:44:26.910 --> 02:44:28.210
of getting depression.

02:44:28.210 --> 02:44:29.850
OK. We don't-- We're
not that powerful yet.

02:44:29.850 --> 02:44:33.890 position:56%
OK. Having said that, people have
taken any particular gene that seems

02:44:33.890 --> 02:44:37.590 position:56%
to be related and they studied in
children who do not have depression.

02:44:37.590 --> 02:44:40.620
And it's very interesting
what they find

02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:44.080
because they often find some
change like in their cognition,

02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:45.690
their concentration
and things like that.

02:44:45.690 --> 02:44:50.140
But those studies are things
we absolutely want to do.

02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:53.620
OK. And-- But it-- you
know, we first got to come

02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:55.580
up with parts list I think.

02:44:55.580 --> 02:44:58.210
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate: Well,
I mean, you kind of respond

02:44:58.210 --> 02:45:01.130
but there is a more,
more-- because of--

02:45:01.130 --> 02:45:04.930 position:56%
as you can see in a polar depression
and bipolar, the findings are not

02:45:04.930 --> 02:45:07.790 position:56%
as robust as we would like if
you're going to put on a very little

02:45:07.790 --> 02:45:11.280
that now studies-- genetic studies,
you know, are moving that you need

02:45:11.280 --> 02:45:15.350
to consider the environment and
the family and all that as well.

02:45:15.350 --> 02:45:17.400
If you're not considering
those two thing--

02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:19.630
I mean, maybe it's more information

02:45:19.630 --> 02:45:21.120
that hopefully will
give us more insights.

02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:24.100
And so most of the studies that
I'm hearing at least, you know,

02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:26.690
the collaborators I work with
are really going that way.

02:45:26.690 --> 02:45:29.410
How do you do that
and it's very hard.

02:45:29.410 --> 02:45:31.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: If you
take the two identical twins

02:45:31.630 --> 02:45:35.160
who share 100% of their
genes and one

02:45:35.160 --> 02:45:38.650
of the identical twins
developed depression, only 50%

02:45:38.650 --> 02:45:41.660
or so of the other identical
twins will develop depression.

02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:42.960
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yeah.

02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:44.260
So-- And why is that?

02:45:44.260 --> 02:45:45.560
Good question.

02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:46.860
Don't know, don't know.

02:45:46.860 --> 02:45:48.160
OK.

02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:49.490
&gt;&gt; Well, I want to follow
up on the cultural question

02:45:49.490 --> 02:45:53.880
that he posts earlier on
in a different direction.

02:45:53.880 --> 02:46:02.690
I'm posting question from my own
background in which Pentecostalism,

02:46:02.690 --> 02:46:12.190
the bible, is taking as an answer
and Pentecostalism is on the rise.

02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:18.950
Part of this belief system,
it has no scientific--

02:46:18.950 --> 02:46:23.320
[inaudible] time we had to
talk about this science.

02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:28.920
Part of what is able to capture
is a capability to treat many

02:46:28.920 --> 02:46:31.010
of what you have discussed.

02:46:31.010 --> 02:46:36.480 position:56%
And they do make that claim, very
powerfully that they able to do so--

02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:37.780
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yeah.

02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:39.080
Some--

02:46:39.080 --> 02:46:40.470
&gt;&gt; I don't have any
way validating it.

02:46:40.470 --> 02:46:41.770
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Yeah.

02:46:41.770 --> 02:46:46.300
&gt;&gt; But it gives rise to a question.

02:46:46.300 --> 02:46:53.330
Is there a way in which alternative
non-medical suggestion can be

02:46:53.330 --> 02:46:58.870
formulated because I also come from
the culture where there's a lot

02:46:58.870 --> 02:47:01.870
of belief on witchcraft
and sorceries

02:47:01.870 --> 02:47:05.590
and they approach them
via meteorologist

02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:08.060
that are different from us.

02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:13.230
And we're beginning to say
let's start questioning them,

02:47:13.230 --> 02:47:16.060
let's now begin to understand them.

02:47:16.060 --> 02:47:21.740 position:56%
And, you know, there is this famous
Nigerian, Lambo, who became the head

02:47:21.740 --> 02:47:23.850
of [inaudible] organization.

02:47:23.850 --> 02:47:25.150
He's dead now.

02:47:25.150 --> 02:47:26.450
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: OK.

02:47:26.450 --> 02:47:27.750
Listen you've got a
very good question.

02:47:27.750 --> 02:47:29.050
(Inaudible) Phil take a shot at it.

02:47:29.050 --> 02:47:30.890
So how about religious
cures if you will.

02:47:30.890 --> 02:47:34.970 position:56%
How would you look at them for the
people lets' say, gee, in our church

02:47:34.970 --> 02:47:37.880
or in our way of believing
we can take care of this.

02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:39.180
What do you think?

02:47:39.180 --> 02:47:40.570
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Well, one
of the most important aspects

02:47:40.570 --> 02:47:43.480
of the psychotherapy
is the development

02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:45.000
of a therapeutic alliance.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:51.050
There is something that is
helpful and that can be useful

02:47:51.050 --> 02:47:55.500
when one person meets with
another they develop a meaningful

02:47:55.500 --> 02:47:57.960
relationship and they
begin to trust one another.

02:47:57.960 --> 02:48:00.160
Their placebo effects also.

02:48:00.160 --> 02:48:03.110
But I think that, you know,
there are many different forms

02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:04.480
of psychotherapy that work

02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:09.130
and I think the common element
generally is that alliance

02:48:09.130 --> 02:48:13.410
between the two-- the trust
between the two and the commitment

02:48:13.410 --> 02:48:14.710
to try and to understand.

02:48:14.710 --> 02:48:16.010
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
If I could off that.

02:48:16.010 --> 02:48:17.600
I mean, I mean see an
awful-- [inaudible] families,

02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:19.730
and I would see lots of
families who are not identified

02:48:19.730 --> 02:48:22.540
as having depression but who
did and who got well as soon

02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:26.390
as their sibling or their
parent or their child got well.

02:48:26.390 --> 02:48:27.750
OK. So-- And by the way.

02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:29.660
That's the thing now that we're
doing is brain imaging studies.

02:48:29.660 --> 02:48:31.880
We see that physiological
things just as well

02:48:31.880 --> 02:48:33.190
as pharmacological things.

02:48:33.190 --> 02:48:34.490
Change the brain.

02:48:34.490 --> 02:48:38.420
OK. So, that we-- you know, this
issue of psychology or even belief.

02:48:38.420 --> 02:48:41.330
And I think the psychiatry
was inappropriately unfriendly

02:48:41.330 --> 02:48:43.100
to religion on the one hand.

02:48:43.100 --> 02:48:46.990
On the other hand, I think
eventually I'm going to want

02:48:46.990 --> 02:48:48.570
to see some data to tell me

02:48:48.570 --> 02:48:50.030
that this is a good
thing to do for people.

02:48:50.030 --> 02:48:51.330
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate: Yeah.

02:48:51.330 --> 02:48:56.530 position:56%
And so-- And even Dr. Gold presented
slides where you had, for example,

02:48:56.530 --> 02:49:01.090
altruism, there could be issues of
social good faith-based treatments

02:49:01.090 --> 02:49:04.390
or at least the aspects,
self-rewarding,

02:49:04.390 --> 02:49:08.410
being part of a group, a
network of family that does go

02:49:08.410 --> 02:49:11.690
and that is actually affected
with depression and those things

02:49:11.690 --> 02:49:13.900 position:56%
as altogether might help depression.

02:49:13.900 --> 02:49:17.180
So, we don't think it's a
magic drug, a magic therapy

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:19.910
but it's really the totality
of the individual in the family

02:49:19.910 --> 02:49:21.870
and the community that's
going to be important in heal.

02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:23.170
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
This is strange disease.

02:49:23.170 --> 02:49:26.230
We're using the model, but it's
a strange one because it comes

02:49:26.230 --> 02:49:29.090
and goes even without us going
anything on the one hand.

02:49:29.090 --> 02:49:31.750
So-- And-- But the thing I would
tell you is when people-- you can--

02:49:31.750 --> 02:49:34.700
we can tell whether somebody didn't
want it, just didn't go on away.

02:49:34.700 --> 02:49:37.080
And on the one hand, the
kind of things you're talking

02:49:37.080 --> 02:49:40.050
about in some ways are-- I'd
like to say are even better

02:49:40.050 --> 02:49:42.500
than simply be treated
for your symptoms, right.

02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:45.010
It's about, you know, really
purpose and that sort of thing,

02:49:45.010 --> 02:49:46.510
an altruism and that sort of thing.

02:49:46.510 --> 02:49:49.590
So-- But it's very hard to access
that if you're terribly depressed.

02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:51.520
So I just don't want to
deprive somebody of something

02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:54.510
that I can demonstrate
that it works.

02:49:54.510 --> 02:49:57.320
[ Inaudible Remark ]

02:49:57.320 --> 02:49:58.620
That's right.

02:49:58.620 --> 02:49:59.920
That's right.

02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:01.220
That's very interesting.

02:50:01.220 --> 02:50:02.520
That's right.

02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:03.820
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate: So I
could know what is your language

02:50:03.820 --> 02:50:05.120
so I could know the example?

02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:06.420
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
And your language.

02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:07.720
What's--

02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:09.020
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carlos Zarate:
What's your language?

02:50:09.020 --> 02:50:10.320
[ Inaudible Remark ]

02:50:10.320 --> 02:50:11.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Actually it
was interesting because that was--

02:50:11.740 --> 02:50:14.780 position:56%
there was an interesting study done
from the Department of Mental Health

02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:18.520
at Hopkins on psychotherapy
and interpersonal psychotherapy

02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:21.400
in Uganda, in women
with milder depressions.

02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:24.740
OK. And Myrna Weissman, they
called Myrna who's at Columbia,

02:50:24.740 --> 02:50:28.180
wonderful woman, who developed
this interpersonal therapy

02:50:28.180 --> 02:50:29.480
and she is very rigorous.

02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:31.650
They asked her if she want to
be involved and she said, yeah,

02:50:31.650 --> 02:50:34.580
that sounds really interesting
but we've got to show

02:50:34.580 --> 02:50:36.210
that our nine basic contracts

02:50:36.210 --> 02:50:38.760
of interpersonal therapy
translate into that culture.

02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:41.460
And eight of them translated fine.

02:50:41.460 --> 02:50:45.000
The one that didn't
translate at all, loneliness,

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:46.540
because they're never alone.

02:50:46.540 --> 02:50:47.840
Right. Exactly.

02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:49.140
So it's very interesting.

02:50:49.140 --> 02:50:51.000
Those things are all relevant.

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:52.300
Yes sir? Yes ma'am?

02:50:52.300 --> 02:50:54.950
&gt;&gt; Hi. I just wanted to thank
you for putting so much of this

02:50:54.950 --> 02:51:02.050
into layman's language that's
understandable to generalists.

02:51:02.050 --> 02:51:05.630
I was interested when
someone mentioned

02:51:05.630 --> 02:51:12.290
that neuroplasticity increases
at the point of depression.

02:51:12.290 --> 02:51:14.130
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold:
Now there's a--

02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:18.720
Neuroplasticity increases in the
amygdala in depressed patients.

02:51:18.720 --> 02:51:22.190
That is the component
that is responsible

02:51:22.190 --> 02:51:25.610
for the conscious experience
of fear and anxiety.

02:51:25.610 --> 02:51:29.960
That actually develops
neuroplasticity increases in size

02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:32.770
and has proportionally
greater effect

02:51:32.770 --> 02:51:36.940
on person's behavior and thinking.

02:51:36.940 --> 02:51:38.360
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: I think
you're also saying is hippocampus

02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:39.660
that actually goes
down, isn't that right?

02:51:39.660 --> 02:51:43.830
And the hippocampus which that's
where more action [inaudible]

02:51:43.830 --> 02:51:45.130 position:56%
that seems to go down in depression.

02:51:45.130 --> 02:51:46.430
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold:
And the prefrontal cortex.

02:51:46.430 --> 02:51:48.240
That's down too.

02:51:48.240 --> 02:51:52.480
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask the last
question and then I'm going

02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:58.890
to invite everybody to
metaphorically attack our speakers

02:51:58.890 --> 02:52:00.950
at the reception back there.

02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:05.020
So, the last question which is
an up to being a last question,

02:52:05.020 --> 02:52:08.460
it was interesting to me that
in response to the question

02:52:08.460 --> 02:52:11.440
about witchcraft, you
went to psychotherapy

02:52:11.440 --> 02:52:14.720
which is exactly what
I was wondering about

02:52:14.720 --> 02:52:22.120
and that is the comfort you have
that psychotherapy can be part

02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:29.870
of the treatment but the
metaphor of this being a disease

02:52:29.870 --> 02:52:34.970
and the way people commonly
understand disease or accident,

02:52:34.970 --> 02:52:40.980
a broken leg or something which is
heavily biological one would not

02:52:40.980 --> 02:52:43.940
think that let's get a
psychotherapist in here

02:52:43.940 --> 02:52:47.930
to help them maybe deal with
the symptoms but not as part

02:52:47.930 --> 02:52:50.400
of the cure or the remission.

02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:53.510
And I'm still struggling
to understand something

02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:58.230
and that is the extent to which
this depression of various kinds

02:52:58.230 --> 02:53:01.650
that you all have described
can be considered or ought

02:53:01.650 --> 02:53:06.880
to be considered psychical if you
still want to include psychotherapy

02:53:06.880 --> 02:53:09.980
in not the cure but the remission.

02:53:09.980 --> 02:53:11.280
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo: Excellent.

02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:12.580
&gt;&gt; Dr. Philip W. Gold: Yeah.

02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:15.840
If the-- I think we don't know
really what systems entirely

02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:18.270
transduce the depressive syndrome.

02:53:18.270 --> 02:53:22.350
But if the stress system
is importantly involved,

02:53:22.350 --> 02:53:29.050
then psychological stress and
experience play a great role

02:53:29.050 --> 02:53:31.470
in how the brain is going
to be wired and the extent

02:53:31.470 --> 02:53:33.520 position:56%
to which the depression can develop.

02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:38.960
And so I think it's understandable
that a biological disorder

02:53:38.960 --> 02:53:42.590
that is responsive to
stress is responsive both

02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:44.320 position:56%
to medication and the psychotherapy.

02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:45.620
&gt;&gt; Dr. Raymond DePaulo:
Let me add in.

02:53:45.620 --> 02:53:47.620
Phil started off this way in
his talk about psychotherapy

02:53:47.620 --> 02:53:51.300
and I appreciate his-- reminding
me of my teacher Jerome Frank.

02:53:51.300 --> 02:53:52.600
When he studies psychotherapy,

02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:54.490
he was the fist great
researcher of psychotherapy.

02:53:54.490 --> 02:53:57.300
He studied the things that were
different between psychotherapies

02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:59.780
or the things that were common
between different psychotherapies

02:53:59.780 --> 02:54:01.260
and the alliance with
the patient seemed

02:54:01.260 --> 02:54:02.690
to be the most important thing.

02:54:02.690 --> 02:54:06.060
Now today, the trend is to
teach what you do in the room.

02:54:06.060 --> 02:54:10.690
Is this method IPT better
than CBT better than BBT.

02:54:10.690 --> 02:54:11.990
And I think those things do matter.

02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:13.620
You can show they do
have some difference.

02:54:13.620 --> 02:54:16.280
But I think the alliance
probably still carries a lot more,

02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:17.580
number one.

02:54:17.580 --> 02:54:19.770
And I only say that, you know,

02:54:19.770 --> 02:54:23.810
first off that the
psychotherapies for the person.

02:54:23.810 --> 02:54:25.870
It's not-- if you could show me

02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:29.010
that psychotherapy never cured
anyone would I stop doing it?

02:54:29.010 --> 02:54:32.630
Not me. If I don't address
the suffering of my patient,

02:54:32.630 --> 02:54:35.110
I have no right to be their doctor.

02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:39.430
OK. So, how do you do
it and-- is one thing.

02:54:39.430 --> 02:54:42.590
But if we don't listen and
then-- and talk to our patients,

02:54:42.590 --> 02:54:45.070
get to know them, let them
get to know us enough.

02:54:45.070 --> 02:54:47.780
I don't think we're doing our
job and that's one of my problems

02:54:47.780 --> 02:54:50.410
with taking the disease models
as if and redefining it.

02:54:50.410 --> 02:54:52.800
OK. All models are wrong.

02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:55.790
OK. Yeah. Thank you.
