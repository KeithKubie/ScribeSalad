You have a massive laceration

just blood just cascading

down my face onto my jacket
trickling onto my shoe,

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:16.049

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.036
- I am going to tell you a
story about the only fight

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:12.705
that I've ever been in in my
entire life.

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:15.308
And it's important to keep in
mind that prior to this,

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:19.112
the closest I had ever come was
a pillow fight

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:22.548
when I was eight year old
against my best friend.

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:23.983
And you'd like I would have won
that,

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:27.587
because he was the nosebleed
kid.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.055
You guys know these kids,
right?

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:30.423
They have blood gushing
out of their head

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.225
with no warning whatsoever.

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.926
Like, we'd be standing there
waiting for the school bus.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.295
He'd bend down to tie his shoe.

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:40.967
He's stand up looking like he
just went on a coke bender.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.070
It was so bad my mom wouldn't
even let him in the house,

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.072
which was weird growing up with
an indoor cat

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.241
and an outdoor friend, but
that's...

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.809
[laughter]

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.677
That's the way it had to be.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.079
So we're eight years old.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.914
We're jumping on his bed,
pillows in hand.

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.816
We whack each other at the
exact some moment.

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.418
His nose just erupts.

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.188
But I find out that I am
deathly allergic

00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:04.490
to goose down.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:06.292
So he's got blood all over the
comforter.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.928
I'm laid out on the bed with my
eyes swollen shut

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.429
gasping for air.

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:13.266
We're both screaming for help.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.269
[laughter]

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.837
My throat closes up.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.872
My dad has to rush me to the
emergency room.

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:22.441
I've never seen him more
embarrassed in his life,

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.177
by the way.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.945
Doctor comes in, he was like,
"What happened to him?"

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:27.547
"He was in a fight."
"What kind of fight?"

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.448
"I don't see why that's
important."

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:34.287
[laughter]

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.155
Definitely not a big
confidence-booster

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:38.324
when you find out that your
kryptonite is feathers,

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:41.694
you know, so...

00:02:41.727 --> 00:02:43.863
So cut to 20 years later,

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:48.201
I still have a shameful 0 and 1
record.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:50.903
I'm in the East Village of
Manhattan.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.872
It's about 10:00 on a Thursday
night.

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:55.908
I just bought some weed, and
I'm headed home to Brooklyn.

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:59.045
So I go down the stairs of the
Second Avenue F Train station.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:02.215
And as I swipe my card,
I hear a woman screaming.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.483
Now, if you live in a small
town,

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:05.851
that might be a cause for
concern,

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:08.421
but in a city of 8 million
people,

00:03:08.454 --> 00:03:10.189
some of them are gonna be
screaming.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.692
[laughter]

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:15.161
It's pretty much par for the
course.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:18.898
So I casually look over, and I
see a petite young blonde

00:03:18.931 --> 00:03:23.936
girl, early 20s, and holding
her from behind

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.672
is a guy about my build, maybe
mid-30s,

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.341
and it's getting a little
rough, but I'm like,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:31.944
"Eh, maybe--is he doing the
Heimlich maneuver?"

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:34.213
But you can't scream while
you're choking,

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.048
and also, he has one hand on
her breast.

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:39.218
The other hand is moving
between her legs.

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.387
His form is terrible.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.890
[laughter]

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:47.293
And I think maybe--maybe this
is a couple into

00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.562
some aggressive foreplay,
anything I can do

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:52.565
to justify not getting
involved, right?

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.100
And then he grabs her by the
blouse,

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:56.068
whips her against a wall,
hauls off,

00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:58.871
punches her in the face,
clobbers her.

00:03:58.904 --> 00:04:00.239
She is now sobbing.

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:02.708
He's trying to rip her pants
off.

00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:04.043
And I'm like, "You know what?

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:05.544
I don't think they're
together."

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:09.548
[laughter]

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.884
"I think this guy is a rapist.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:13.886
"Someone's got to stop this
guy.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.223
Not gonna be me, of course,
but somebody."

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.558
And now he grabs her by the
throat,

00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:21.560
slams her head against the
wall,

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:24.163
and no one is doing anything.

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:26.065
He hits her again.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:27.233
I'm like, "Shit.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:28.668
I've got to be that guy."

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.303
So I yell out the most
threatening thing

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:33.639
I can think of,
which unfortunately is,

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:35.408
"Hey, buddy, that's a lady."

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.678
[laughter]

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:44.650
Imagine if that's all it took,
if he was like, "Oh, my God.

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:45.751
"It is a lady.

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:47.320
This is..."

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:48.921
[laughter]

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:50.189
"That's the last time I'll
leave the house

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:51.424
without my glasses."

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.958
[laughter]

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:55.161
So as you can imagine, it has
no effect,

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:57.596
and he hauls off to hit her
again,

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:58.764
and I just fuckin' Hulk out.

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.966
I go, "Come on, let's go!"

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.601
Which is a pretty big jump
from,

00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:05.271
"Hey, buddy, that's a
lady," right?

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:07.606
Could have gone with, "Pick on
someone your own size"

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.676
or, "I'm telling."

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:13.179
[laughter]

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:16.282
But it gets his attention,
and as he turns to look at me,

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:18.351
she pries his hand off her
throat,

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:20.619
bolts through the turnstile,
flies up the stairs,

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:21.654
runs out of the station.

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:23.189
She's gonna be okay.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:27.026
But then I turn back to him,
and he is pissed.

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:28.828
I don't know if you guys have
ever cock-blocked

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:30.796
a rapist before...

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:34.033
[laughter]

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:40.306
But they do not take too kindly
to it.

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.309
So he's just staring me down
with these steely blue eyes.

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:46.312
And I've got to tell you, under
normal circumstances,

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:49.081
beautiful eyes, but...

00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:51.717
Right now, they're just cold
and terrifying.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.053
And I'm taking full inventory
of his physical appearance.

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:56.222
I'm like, "All right, 5'10",
160."

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.190
I want to be able to give a
detailed description

00:05:58.223 --> 00:06:01.660
to the police when I wake from
my medically induced coma.

00:06:01.693 --> 00:06:05.231
[laughter]

00:06:05.264 --> 00:06:07.166
So he takes his first step
toward me

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.070
and very calmly goes, "What you
gonna do, motherfucker?"

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:13.339
And part of me is tempted to
try to talk my way

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.074
out of this, you know,
and be like, "Hey, man,

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:16.942
"I didn't mean to interfere.

00:06:16.975 --> 00:06:18.177
If you hurry, I'm sure you can
catch up with her."

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.047
[laughter]

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:25.217
I'm tempted, but I don't do
that.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.219
I'm like, "All right, come
fuckin'--this is your chance

00:06:27.252 --> 00:06:30.356
to take this guy out," so I
clinch my fist,

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.291
and I start yelling, "Back the
fuck up, man.

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:34.026
Back the fuck up."

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:37.029
And I can tell you, that does
not have much impact

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:39.565
when you yourself are fearfully
backing up.

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:44.203
[laughter]

00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:45.738
So I hit the opposing wall.

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:46.772
He's got me backed into a
corner.

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:48.474
I got nowhere to go.

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:51.410
So I have no choice but to try
to take this guy out.

00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:55.214
So I take a deep breath,
and I ready myself,

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:57.383
and I step in with a
demolishing blow.

00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:59.385
I'm just gonna lay this guy
out.

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:02.655
And I may have if I wasn't
still 8 feet away from him.

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.457
[laughter]

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.426
So there's this horrible moment
where I just watch my fist

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:08.727
whiz past his face.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.597
I'm like, "Nooo."

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.732
He steps in, clobbers me.

00:07:13.765 --> 00:07:15.234
My knees buckle, but I don't
go down.

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:17.002
I'm like, "All right,
fisticuffs

00:07:17.035 --> 00:07:19.071
"is not my strong suit.

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:22.174
"I'm gonna come back, kick this
guy in the balls,

00:07:22.207 --> 00:07:24.910
like I just completed a women's
self-defense class."

00:07:24.943 --> 00:07:27.480
[laughter]

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.849
So I step in, I swing,

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:31.484
he scoots back at the last
second,

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.686
I miss his balls, but I get
him in the stomach,

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:36.422
and here's what I know about my
fighting style so far:

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:38.491
Way too polite, can't land a
punch,

00:07:38.524 --> 00:07:40.259
and when I kick someone, I make
this sound.

00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:41.427
I go....

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.628
[whimpers]

00:07:42.661 --> 00:07:46.265
[laughter]

00:07:46.298 --> 00:07:50.002
Not my proudest moment, but I
make contact.

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:52.304
And he stumbles back, and he
turns,

00:07:52.337 --> 00:07:53.939
and he runs out of the station,

00:07:53.972 --> 00:07:55.608
so now I'm feeling like hot
shit.

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.444
I'm like, "I've got a
powerhouse, Bruce Lee kick.

00:07:58.477 --> 00:08:00.980
"I didn't back down.
I took a punch.

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:03.449
He ran off.
I think I finally won a fight."

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:04.984
Right?
And more importantly,

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.819
I saved that woman.

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:09.021
I think I'm the first guy with
a moustache to save a woman

00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:11.824
from train tracks

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:14.894
rather than tie her to them.

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:16.462
So now I'm feeling invincible.

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:18.030
I'm about to get on the train
and go home.

00:08:18.063 --> 00:08:19.698
And this older woman stops me.

00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:21.300
She goes, "Oh, my God.

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:24.136
You have a massive laceration
on your face."

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.372
And I looked down, and there's
just blood just cascading

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:30.576
down my face onto my jacket
trickling onto my shoe,

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:32.144
and I go, "Is it bad?"

00:08:32.177 --> 00:08:33.879
She goes, "It appears to be
quite severe."

00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:39.718
[laughter]

00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:42.154
And my adrenaline's pumping,
so I don't even feel any pain.

00:08:42.187 --> 00:08:43.822
I just feel warmth, and I kind
of, like,

00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:46.358
replay everything in my head.

00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:48.661
And I think, "Well, that guy
was kind of holding his hand

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.429
"in a funny way.

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:53.766
"He didn't really punch me so
much as, like, swing at me.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.668
"There's blood everywhere.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:57.002
"I did not get punched.

00:08:57.035 --> 00:08:58.370
"I did not win a fight.

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:00.773
I just got stabbed in the
face."

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.575
[laughter]

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:05.511
Now, I don't know about you
guys, but when I get stabbed

00:09:05.544 --> 00:09:10.082
by a stranger with a foreign
object,

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:12.418
first thing that comes to mind,
"Oh, my God.

00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:13.686
Now I have AIDS."

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:16.422
[laughter]

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.357
I know that's not how it works.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.526
You've got to share a glass of
water, but right now...

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:22.628
[laughter]

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:25.464
Paranoia was taking hold of me,
so I'm like, "Oh, my God,

00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:27.533
"some spiteful psycho running
around the city

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:30.736
"with an infected box cutter
just filleted my face,

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:33.973
and now I just have AIDS
coursing through my veins."

00:09:34.006 --> 00:09:35.641
I think, "You know what?

00:09:35.674 --> 00:09:37.076
Maybe it won't take hold if
I'm bleeding it all out,"

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:39.278
so I actually lean over.

00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:41.714
Like, "Go.
Rid yourself.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.049
Get out of me."

00:09:44.082 --> 00:09:45.918
And the same woman, she goes,
"What are doing?"

00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:48.253
She reaches into her purse,
grabs a wad of napkins,

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:50.055
slaps them on my face, 'cause,
you know,

00:09:50.088 --> 00:09:54.059
every woman over 30 has a
surplus of purse napkins.

00:09:54.092 --> 00:09:57.096
And she leave me up in the
street, calls 911,

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.764
dozen cops on the scene within
minutes.

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:00.399
They all want to see the cut.

00:10:00.432 --> 00:10:03.135
So one after another I remove
the napkins.

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:05.604
Each time, another pint of
blood spurts out.

00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:07.172
And they all have the same
reaction.

00:10:07.205 --> 00:10:08.841
They just go, "Ooh, put it
back,

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:10.075
put it back, put it
back."

00:10:10.108 --> 00:10:13.012
[laughter]

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:16.115
So another cop rolls up, and he
goes,

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:17.583
"Hey, do you mind if I see it?"

00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:19.284
His partner goes, "You see
this, man.

00:10:19.317 --> 00:10:21.820
Just picture another one right
next to it."

00:10:21.853 --> 00:10:25.424
So all these cops are swarming
around, and I remember,

00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:28.994
"I've got that 1/4 ounce of
weed in my backpack."

00:10:29.027 --> 00:10:30.763
Now, this is New York.

00:10:30.796 --> 00:10:33.098
This is not the weed-topia your
burnouts are used to.

00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:37.770
[laughter]

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:39.672
It's not like I'm gonna show
the guy my medical card.

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:41.807
And he's like, "Oh, cool.
I have one too, all right."

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.442
[laughter]

00:10:43.475 --> 00:10:45.444
So justifiably, I'm freaking
out.

00:10:45.477 --> 00:10:48.113
And I feel this big mitt on my
shoulder.

00:10:48.146 --> 00:10:49.548
And I'm like, "Oh, my God.
He can smell it.

00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:51.450
I'm fucked.
I'm going to jail."

00:10:51.483 --> 00:10:54.286
He spins me around, and this
detective goes, "Hey,

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:57.489
how's it feel to be a goddamn
hero?"

00:10:57.522 --> 00:10:59.191
And he reaches into his back
pocket,

00:10:59.224 --> 00:11:00.659
hands me his business card,
and he goes,

00:11:00.692 --> 00:11:02.227
"You ever need anything,
you ever in a jam,

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.296
you call me; I got your back."

00:11:04.329 --> 00:11:05.731
And I was like, "I may take you
up on that

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:07.166
a little sooner than you think,
sir."

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:11.904
[laughter]

00:11:11.937 --> 00:11:13.505
So ambulance finally shows up.

00:11:13.538 --> 00:11:15.974
I'm in the hospital.
I'm getting stitched up.

00:11:16.007 --> 00:11:17.543
And I listen to a lot of rap
music.

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:19.712
I hear a lot of reference to a
buck fifty.

00:11:19.745 --> 00:11:22.648
And a buck fifty is a facial
laceration that requires

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:27.019
150 stitches, and I don't know
if you can see the scar

00:11:27.052 --> 00:11:29.221
right here--right there.
You see it?

00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:32.157
You see it?
[laughter]

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.394
A mere 23 stitches,

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:37.930
which has to make you wonder
what kind of fucking

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:40.099
facial laceration

00:11:40.132 --> 00:11:43.869
requires 150 st...

00:11:43.902 --> 00:11:45.604
I think that's decapitation.

00:11:45.637 --> 00:11:48.373
[laughter]

00:11:48.406 --> 00:11:50.008
No need to be alarmed, sir.

00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:51.076
We'll simply sew your head back
on.

00:11:51.109 --> 00:11:54.179
You'll be good to go.

00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:56.615
So ten days later, I get my
stitches out.

00:11:56.648 --> 00:11:58.617
And I seem to be healing up
nicely.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.519
And that night, I'm brushing my
teeth,

00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:04.223
and I notice this clear liquid
dripping out my scar.

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:05.724
And, "Oh, my God.

00:12:05.757 --> 00:12:08.861
It was just residual goop.
No big deal."

00:12:08.894 --> 00:12:10.596
And it keeps up for a few days.

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:12.264
I go back to the doctor, and it
turns out when this guy

00:12:12.297 --> 00:12:15.701
cut me, he hit my salivary
gland.

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:18.904
So I am now drooling out of
the side of my face.

00:12:18.937 --> 00:12:22.708
[laughter]

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:25.611
Not a little dribble, buckets
of drool every time I see food.

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:28.714
Like, you put a plate of wings
in front of me,

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:31.817
I'm just a slobbering Saint
Bernard.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:34.286
Which is ironic, because I'm a
dog walker at the time,

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:36.221
so I'm just roaming the streets
of New York

00:12:36.254 --> 00:12:37.923
with a pack of dogs in tow.

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:40.058
They're looking at me like,
"Oh, he's one of us now."

00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:41.760
[laughter]

00:12:41.793 --> 00:12:43.595
It was so bad I could push on
the gland and shoot it

00:12:43.628 --> 00:12:47.399
across the room,
which too bad

00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:49.334
I didn't have that at the time
of the attack, right?

00:12:49.367 --> 00:12:51.770
I'd be like, "Back the fuck up,
man.

00:12:51.803 --> 00:12:54.072
Don't make me do it."

00:12:54.105 --> 00:12:55.741
So now I'm just feeling
terrible.

00:12:55.774 --> 00:12:57.242
This is just a misery.

00:12:57.275 --> 00:12:58.510
Like, I should just run off and
join

00:12:58.543 --> 00:13:00.279
the Coney Island freak show.

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:02.281
I'll be the boy with the Super
Soaker face.

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:04.416
[laughter]

00:13:04.449 --> 00:13:08.453
So two weeks goes by,
and it finally stops,

00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:10.756
drooling stops, I go back to
the doctor.

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.191
He's like, "All right, I think
you're finally

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:13.792
"out of the woods.

00:13:13.825 --> 00:13:15.627
"All you've got is that
nifty-looking scar.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.863
"Halloween's around the corner.
Let me guess.

00:13:17.896 --> 00:13:20.265
You're gonna go as the Joker."

00:13:20.298 --> 00:13:21.834
And I was like, "Well, the
Joker has a scar

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:23.769
"on both sides of his face, so
unless I go out

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:26.271
and stop a left-handed
rapist..."

00:13:26.304 --> 00:13:28.440
[laughter]

00:13:28.473 --> 00:13:29.942
"I don't know, man."

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:31.476
But it all has a happy ending.

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:33.145
I am fine, obviously.

00:13:33.178 --> 00:13:34.680
It turns out he did not give me
AIDS.

00:13:34.713 --> 00:13:35.881
Had it all along.

00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:39.151
[laughter]

00:13:41.486 --> 00:13:46.725
Girl got away, and they
actually caught the guy.

00:13:46.758 --> 00:13:48.126
They caught the guy.

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:50.562
[cheers and applause]

00:13:50.595 --> 00:13:52.531
Three days after the whole
thing happened,

00:13:52.564 --> 00:13:54.499
they found him running right
outside the same station.

00:13:54.532 --> 00:13:56.235
Remember I thought he was my
age?

00:13:56.268 --> 00:14:00.472
55-year-old drunk homeless man.

00:14:00.505 --> 00:14:05.410
So 20 years old than me,
looks, beautiful baby blues.

00:14:05.443 --> 00:14:08.313
I got my ass kicked by the
world's sexiest wino.

00:14:08.346 --> 00:14:10.215
[laughter]

00:14:10.248 --> 00:14:11.850
So he's currently in prison.

00:14:11.883 --> 00:14:14.887
He got sentenced to 15 years of
having a home.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.222
[laughter]

00:14:17.255 --> 00:14:20.525
And people ask me if I'm
worried about him

00:14:20.558 --> 00:14:22.494
coming after me when he gets
out.

00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:25.497
And it's like, "Well, he's
gonna be 70 years old.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.599
So unless he washes this in
prison

00:14:27.632 --> 00:14:30.035
and comes after me with a
pillow...

00:14:30.068 --> 00:14:32.938
[laughter]

00:14:32.971 --> 00:14:36.942
Pretty sure that's a fight I
can win, so wish me luck.

00:14:36.975 --> 00:14:38.043
Thank you guys so much.

00:14:38.076 --> 00:14:40.946
[cheers and applause]

00:14:40.979 --> 00:14:44.617
