00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this unit you learned about bar charts and histograms.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
They both use vertical bars, and they both aggregate data.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The big difference was that the bar chart is defined over 2D data.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The one dimension applies to the x axis and the other to the y axis

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
whereas histograms only apply to 1D data

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
where the y axis becomes the count of that data.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In the next unit we'll encounter another plot.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Without giving it away, it is some how related to this birthday pi.

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So stay tuned.
