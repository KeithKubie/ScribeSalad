00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:19.912
I've been there for ten years.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.381
Originally, I'm from Denver,
Colorado.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:23.549
- Yay.
- I grew up in Aurora.

00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:24.951

[laughter]

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.791
But for five years, I lived
in Tucson, Arizona,

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:36.496
which, uh--there's a reason
there's one applause to that.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:39.432
That's a real niche group.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.267
There are good people
in Tucson,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.138
but I found most of them to be
angry, sunburnt white people.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.007
Just walking around like,
"All these Mexicans..."

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.611

"Yeah, it used to be Mexico."

[laughter]

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.639
but I also lived with a drug
dealer,

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:23.476
which I can't recommend enough
if you do drugs.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.144
[laughter]

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.380
If you do drugs, live with a
drug dealer.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.949
It's like living at Costco.

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:33.619
It's just free samples every
day.

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.488
And then Costco gets robbed,
and you're like,

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.657
You know what? I don't think I
should live at Costco anymore."

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.325
Yeah, that was a bad idea.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:42.328
I need to really get my life
together at this point.

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:43.996
But when I moved to Tucson,

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.332
my first and best friend
that I made there

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.568
was a guy named Amir,

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:50.903
who was an Israeli kid
from Long Island.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.805
- Whoo!
- And--yeah.

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:54.040
I don't know if that's for
Israeli or Long Island,

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:55.875
but we'll keep it moving
forward.

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.877
Those are two--yeah.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.913
But Amir was the first real
person I met from Long Island,

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:04.350
and he was very Long Island.

00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:05.751
He was very like,
"Yeah, bro."

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:07.720
Like, everything--

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:10.156
That just existed
as a sentence filler.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.425
Like, "Yeah, bro."

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:13.859
He would do these things

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:15.194
that certain people
on Long Island do

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:17.363
that they're
question statements.

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:21.867
So he says a statement but
it's framed like a question.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.436
So he'd come in
the living room and be like,

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:28.541
"Yo, these Nikes
are ill, right?"

00:03:28.574 --> 00:03:30.710
Yes.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:34.046
I don't know if that's
the desired response.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.882
Amir was very good
at selling weed.

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:38.951
He was very good at it.

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:41.954
It was a natural habit that
he just picked up and ran with.

00:03:41.987 --> 00:03:44.690
Freshman year, it started
at, you know, 20 bags

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:46.292
and then eighths.

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:49.061
And then sophomore year,
it was like quarters

00:03:49.094 --> 00:03:49.895
and half ounces.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:51.530
Then I moved in with him,

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:54.133
and it went to, like, ounces
to quarter pounds.

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.901
You know,
then our lease ran out,

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.069
but the furniture
was getting good,

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:58.771
so I, you know, re-leased.

00:03:58.804 --> 00:04:01.707
I was like, "Yeah, let's
keep going with this."

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.210
He started to getting, like,
pounds, and, then, you know,

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:06.946
he got a fish tank.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:11.651
Hey, drug dealers, stop with
the fish tanks.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.119
It's hackneyed now.

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:14.387
It's also stupid.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.921
You're gonna have a flood.

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:17.556
Care about your other
possessions, please.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.091
- I'm sorry.

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:21.227
I'm really hyped up about this,
as you can tell.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.229
But I didn't have
to sell drugs.

00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:25.931
I just--I just smoked his weed
and looked at his fish tank.

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:29.502
So it was a pretty good
fuckin' deal.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:30.770
One day I'm going
to do laundry.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.438
I'm a broke college student.

00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:35.608
I have six loads of laundry
in six plastic bags,

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.777
like I'm fuckin' moving out of
a girlfriend's house

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.912
who has a drug problem.

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:41.580
It's like, "I'm serious, Donna.

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:43.616
I am gone now."

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:47.153
But I fill up my car, and I
go--I go to the bank,

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.989
and I turn $10 into $10 in
quarters.

00:04:50.022 --> 00:04:53.693
At the time,
I'm wearing cargo shorts,

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:55.528
a liquor T-shirt

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:59.965
and a swimsuit as underwear,

00:04:59.998 --> 00:05:01.600
'cause it was laundry day.

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:04.470
I'm not--I'm not that giant
of a piece of shit

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:06.806
where I'm just like, "I can
take a shower with it on.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.041
It washes it.
It's pretty much--you know."

00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:10.810
[laughter and applause]

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:14.480
"It just takes care
of itself."

00:05:14.513 --> 00:05:18.150
So I go and I change $10
into $5 in quarters,

00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:19.985
which I put on my right leg,

00:05:20.018 --> 00:05:22.488
and $5 in quarters
that I put on my left leg.

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:25.558
So when I walk around, it
makes a noise like "shh, shh."

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:29.295
I sound like the shittiest
sheriff in the west.

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:30.696
It's like, "Oh, hello--"

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:32.331
Like, it's just awful.
It was awful.

00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:34.667
So I have my pockets
of change.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.802
I get to my car,
and Amir calls me,

00:05:36.835 --> 00:05:39.705
and he's like,
"Yo, we're getting robbed?"

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:43.309
And I'm like, "I don't--"

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:45.311
Is that a question
or a statement?

00:05:45.344 --> 00:05:47.513
You gotta tell me right now,
'cause this is very dangerous.

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:49.348
But he's like,
"Yeah, I was gonna do a deal,

00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:51.317
"and these guys came by,
and, you know,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.985
"I think they're trying
to rob me.

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:54.086
So, you know,
I called off the deal."

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:55.988
And I'm like, "All right."

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:57.189
He's like, "Will you drive
around the neighborhood

00:05:57.222 --> 00:05:58.424
and see if they're there
or not?"

00:05:58.457 --> 00:06:00.025
"Sure, whatever."

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:02.061
I'm driving a 1996 Dodge
Stratus.

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:04.997
It's a real hunk of shit.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.000
So I probably just look like
feds to them, but I...

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.769
I do a lap,
I don't see anybody.

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:12.171
So I pull into our carport
that's under our apartment,

00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:14.273
and standing there
when I get out of the car,

00:06:14.306 --> 00:06:19.345
the first guy's, like,
this 6'4" piece of white trash.

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:21.947
Like--you gotta understand
something about me.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.784
When I was a little kid,
my dad moved to this town

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:27.753
in Northern California
that grows, like,

00:06:27.786 --> 00:06:32.024
the biggest pieces
of white trash.

00:06:32.057 --> 00:06:34.960
So at 33,
I like to fancy myself

00:06:34.993 --> 00:06:39.932
a little bit of
a white trash sommelier.

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:43.536
And this guy was mwah!

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:48.574
Just--just a top shelf
piece of shit.

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:52.378
He was covered in tattoos
that I can only describe

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:56.282
as Mountain Dew tattoos.

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:58.717
The same way an adult
would, like,

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.252
drink a whole can
of Mountain Dew

00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:02.822
and be like,
"Put fireballs on my elbows!"

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:04.924
And you're like, "That--I don't
know.

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:08.227
That doesn't sound right, but
sure."

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.798
And standing with him is this
5'4" South Side Tucson

00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:16.168
cholo blood-in, blood-out like,
"What's up, white boy?"

00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:18.304
Like that, like, "Oh, hi."

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.773
[laughter]

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:22.241
"Hi.

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:24.810
No habla."

00:07:24.843 --> 00:07:26.245
They're standing there, and I
get out,

00:07:26.278 --> 00:07:27.813
and the little cholo's like,

00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:29.448
"Hey, man, Tommy Green live
here?"

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:32.952
I'm like, "That's a terrible
fake name, and no."

00:07:32.985 --> 00:07:34.820
[laughter]

00:07:34.853 --> 00:07:36.455
If you're gonna rob a drug
dealer,

00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:38.290
change up the fuckin'--
you know what I mean?

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:39.625
Like, if he was robbing a coke
dealer, he's like,

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:41.460
"Hey, Mark Blow here?"

00:07:41.493 --> 00:07:45.531
Like, clearly a synonym of what
you're trying to get from...

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:47.099
But I'm like, "No, no one's
here,"

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:48.267
so he--they leave.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.802
They--both of them walk off.

00:07:49.835 --> 00:07:51.270
I go upstairs, and Amir's
there,

00:07:51.303 --> 00:07:52.771
and he's like, "Yo, did you see
anybody?"

00:07:52.804 --> 00:07:54.106
And I tell him; I'm like,
"Yeah,

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:55.474
he's a big piece of white
trash,

00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:57.643
little fuckin' blood-in,
blood-out."

00:07:57.676 --> 00:07:59.278
And he's like, "Yeah."

00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.146
He's like, "Yeah, y'all, those
are the guys."

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:02.481
And I'm like, "Oh, shit, well,
they're gone. They left."

00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:04.617
We look out.
We don't see them.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.485
So, you know, we do what drug
dealers and their roommates do,

00:08:06.518 --> 00:08:08.821
and we smoke weed and play
PlayStation for two hours.

00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:12.391
I'm about to smoke a cigarette,
and I grab the barbecue lighter

00:08:12.424 --> 00:08:14.894
that I use to smoke
cigarettes,

00:08:14.927 --> 00:08:17.730
'cause I'm a little bit of
garbage myself...

00:08:17.763 --> 00:08:21.000
[laughter]

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:26.505
And...Amir--Amir gets a call,
and he's like,

00:08:26.538 --> 00:08:27.973
"Yo, the deal's back on.

00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:29.475
"They want to do the deal
for five pounds,

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.410
"but they're gonna do it--
what I'm gonna do

00:08:31.443 --> 00:08:33.812
is I'm gonna walk to the street
and then get in a car."

00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:35.414
And I'm like, "Okay."

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:36.682
And he's like, "Yo, will you
walk me to the car?"

00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:38.717
I'm very high, and...

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.019
[laughter]

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:43.022
On weed and victories of
"Madden."

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:45.257
[laughter]

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.493
And if Amir watches this, he
knows I'm telling the truth.

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:50.362
I ran that shit.

00:08:50.395 --> 00:08:52.231
But he's like, "Yo, will you
walk me to the car?

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:53.699
You're gonna smoke a
cigarette."

00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:55.334
And I'm like,
"Eh, all right."

00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:56.602
And then as I go
to the door he goes,

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:59.371
"Yo, get the gun."

00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:01.507
Now if you've lived in Arizona,

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.578
you know how insanely easy it
is to get a handgun.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.213
It's like buying socks.

00:09:08.246 --> 00:09:09.548
You just walk in
and you're like, "Gun."

00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:11.283
And they're like,
"Here's your gun."

00:09:11.316 --> 00:09:13.786
And you're like,
"This is pretty dangerous."

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.188
But I was with Amir,
and we went to a gun show,

00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:18.891
and I'm not joking
the first thing he said

00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:20.726
to the first gun dealer
he met was,

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:22.261
"Yo, what's your
cheapest gun?"

00:09:22.294 --> 00:09:26.599
And you're like,
that's not what I want to hear

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:29.034
as the person
that lives next to you

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:31.737
and knows you're buying this
for self-defense.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.239
What he did is he did buy
the cheapest gun possible.

00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:38.243
It had a metal slide
but a plastic handle.

00:09:38.276 --> 00:09:40.980
He bought a plastic gun,
and by the way,

00:09:41.013 --> 00:09:42.114
we took it to the range.

00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:44.650
It never shot straight.

00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:47.119
The bullet always bent like
some trick shot

00:09:47.152 --> 00:09:48.153
in an action movie.

00:09:48.186 --> 00:09:52.324
We were like, "Ahh."

00:09:52.357 --> 00:09:53.826
So Amir's like, "Yo, I'll get
the gun."

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.160
And I tell him, I'm like,

00:09:55.193 --> 00:09:56.795
"I'm not fuckin'
using that thing."

00:09:56.828 --> 00:09:58.631
And he goes--and then with
this, like, aggressive

00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:01.600
Long Island energy he's like,
"Yo, you dick."

00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:04.737
Like, he was mad at me--
he was mad at me

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.972
for questioning why
I didn't want to bring a gun

00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:08.941
to a drug deal,
and he's like,

00:10:08.974 --> 00:10:10.442
"Yo, you dumbass,
what'll happen is

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:13.245
"if they got a knife
and you show 'em the gun,

00:10:13.278 --> 00:10:14.947
then they're gonna be scared
and they're gonna leave."

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.817
And for some reason I believed
that rock-paper-scissors

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.687
fuckin' shit, like--

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.290
I was like, oh, yeah,
that sounds correct.

00:10:25.323 --> 00:10:28.827
So I put the gun
in my cargo shorts.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:32.131
I grabbed a Camel Light and the
barbecue lighter.

00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:34.700
Amir has an athletic bag full
of 5 pounds.

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:36.168
He walks out in front of me.

00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:38.637
Now, I have $10 in quarters on
me.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.874
You can hear me coming from a
mile away.

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:44.977
When I walk, I sound like a
knight in shitty chain mail.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.980
It's like, "Shh, shh, shh."

00:10:48.013 --> 00:10:50.649
[laughter]

00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:52.484
So we start walking
down the stairs.

00:10:52.517 --> 00:10:54.186
Right when we get
to the bottom of the stairs,

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:57.222
fuckin' Mountain Dew tattoos
comes around,

00:10:57.255 --> 00:10:59.491
gun drawn, gets to Amir.

00:10:59.524 --> 00:11:02.995
fuckin' the tiny vato
comes right up the stairs,

00:11:03.028 --> 00:11:04.396
gun on my chest.

00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:06.131
Like, perfectly
right on my chest.

00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:08.167
Don't get weird.
I know it's weird right now,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.501
but I'm not fuckin' dead.

00:11:09.534 --> 00:11:14.406
I'm here.
I'm telling the story.

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:16.241
All right? You can
unclench your buttholes.

00:11:16.274 --> 00:11:21.547
This isn't--
This isn't ghost comedy.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.217
Roy didn't come up here
in that loud-ass jacket like,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.986
"Do you wanna see
the other side?"

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:30.656
[laughter and applause]

00:11:30.689 --> 00:11:36.662
[inaudible]

00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:39.865
So I got a .45 pointed right
in the middle of my chest.

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:41.700
And I'm a child of the '80s.

00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:43.702
I grew up with Schwarzenegger
movies and Stallone movies.

00:11:43.735 --> 00:11:46.572
And always in those
action movies when a bad guy

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.540
pulls out a gun on the hero,
they always say some cool shit.

00:11:48.573 --> 00:11:51.043
Like, "You better use that."

00:11:51.076 --> 00:11:53.345
Uh, turns out I don't.

00:11:53.378 --> 00:11:55.280
I get very polite
if you put a gun on me.

00:11:55.313 --> 00:11:56.715
I'm like, "Hi, how are you?"

00:11:56.748 --> 00:11:58.951
I get, like,
customer service voice.

00:11:58.984 --> 00:12:01.687
"Hi! Has everything
been okay?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.923
Would you mind filling out
a brief survey?"

00:12:04.956 --> 00:12:07.392
[laughter]

00:12:07.425 --> 00:12:09.027
And as I do that
and I lift my hands up,

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.263
I've already blown the rules
apparently of a robbery,

00:12:11.296 --> 00:12:13.432
'cause this guy's furious
that my hands are up.

00:12:13.465 --> 00:12:15.067
He's like, "Put your fuckin'
hand down. Put your fuck--"

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.903
And I'm like, "All right,
shit, I'm sorry."

00:12:17.936 --> 00:12:19.571
And he grabs--
when I did that,

00:12:19.604 --> 00:12:21.140
I lifted my shirt high enough

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:22.908
that he saw the handle
of the gun.

00:12:22.941 --> 00:12:26.645
So he takes the gun
off of my waistband

00:12:26.678 --> 00:12:28.313
and he's like,
"Go back inside."

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:31.583
And it's like, "Ahhh."

00:12:31.616 --> 00:12:34.419
And I'm standing on this second
floor of this apartment

00:12:34.452 --> 00:12:37.122
looking out over my stairwell
like, "Can I fly?"

00:12:37.155 --> 00:12:39.758
[laughter]

00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:41.426
I didn't really know my dad
that well.

00:12:41.459 --> 00:12:44.830
He could be part flying
squirrel.

00:12:44.863 --> 00:12:46.732
That would have been great if I
took off and just drifted away.

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:50.769
He's like, "Fuckin' white boys
are flying now."

00:12:50.802 --> 00:12:53.272
You'd glide away.

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:54.439
But he's like "Turn around.
Go back inside."

00:12:54.472 --> 00:12:56.074
I'm like, "Fuck, all right."

00:12:56.107 --> 00:12:58.477
And I turn around,
and as I do, he takes my gun--

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.179
the gun that he took off me--

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.780
and fuckin' hits me
in the back of the head.

00:13:01.813 --> 00:13:04.683
Now, I'm very lucky to have
a minor role

00:13:04.716 --> 00:13:06.819
on the Showtime show
"Billions."

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:10.689
But the best piece of acting
I've ever done in my life

00:13:10.722 --> 00:13:14.126
is getting hit in the head
by a 5'3" dude

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:16.595
holding a plastic gun

00:13:16.628 --> 00:13:19.264
and acting like
that shit hurt.

00:13:19.297 --> 00:13:25.037
He hit me, I was like,
"Ahhh-ahh-ahhh!

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:30.375
Oh, you're so strong!"

00:13:30.408 --> 00:13:32.978
"You swing it
like a Norwegian god

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:36.181
swings a hammer."

00:13:36.214 --> 00:13:37.716
So I go to the ground,

00:13:37.749 --> 00:13:39.184
and immediately right
when I go to the ground,

00:13:39.217 --> 00:13:41.153
you know,
he puts me--he zip-ties.

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:42.554
He pulls out zip ties.

00:13:42.587 --> 00:13:44.056
He zip-ties my arms
behind my back.

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.557
He duct-tapes
my legs together,

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:47.292
and then he pulls out
an Army duffle bag

00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:49.661
and just starts
ransacking our apartment.

00:13:49.694 --> 00:13:54.666
If I could Yelp a robbery...

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:56.168
[laughter]

00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:57.502
Five stars.

00:13:57.535 --> 00:14:00.539
Uh, guy brought
his own material.

00:14:00.572 --> 00:14:03.175
He was prompt.
He was direct.

00:14:03.208 --> 00:14:07.346
He had clearly
done this before.

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:12.050
It was the mark of a true
professional.

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:13.919
He starts robbing
and he goes around our house,

00:14:13.952 --> 00:14:15.721
he grabs everything, and
then he starts taking his .45

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.756
and coming over to my head
and he starts going,

00:14:17.789 --> 00:14:19.358
"Where's the money,
white boy?"

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.859
- [laughs]

00:14:20.892 --> 00:14:22.861
[laughter]

00:14:22.894 --> 00:14:26.698
- That is the creepiest laugh
to have

00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:29.201
at that point...

00:14:29.234 --> 00:14:32.838
That sinister-ass laugh from
behind me

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:34.706
First off, from telling the
story,

00:14:34.739 --> 00:14:37.342
you know I don't trust anyone
behind me, like a...

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:38.777
like an old mafia boss.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.712
I don't like anyone sitting
behind me.

00:14:40.745 --> 00:14:44.349
Then to hear him going,
"Ha-ha-ha-ha.

00:14:44.382 --> 00:14:45.784
"Of course you were scared.

00:14:45.817 --> 00:14:49.721
You filled your life fleeing
from you."

00:14:49.754 --> 00:14:52.958
[laughter]

00:14:52.991 --> 00:14:54.860
He takes the .45, and he keeps
going up to me,

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:56.728
and he keeps, like, pushing it
on my temple going,

00:14:56.761 --> 00:14:58.597
"Where's
the money, white boy?"

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.232
"Where's the money, white boy?"

00:15:00.265 --> 00:15:01.767
Now, I'm fine being called
white boy.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.602
I've been called white boy my
whole life.

00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:06.538
The only time it stings is when
I know for a fact

00:15:06.571 --> 00:15:09.107
I'm a foot taller than you.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:10.742
He's like, "Where's the money,
white boy?"

00:15:10.775 --> 00:15:12.744
I'm like, "I could so dunk on
you."

00:15:12.777 --> 00:15:16.248
[laughter]

00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:18.650
I'll just "Gahhh!

00:15:18.683 --> 00:15:19.651
Ohh!

00:15:19.684 --> 00:15:22.754
[laughs]

00:15:22.787 --> 00:15:24.323
So and he keeps going, "Where's
the money, white boy?"

00:15:24.356 --> 00:15:26.391
And I go, "I don't know!
I don't know."

00:15:26.424 --> 00:15:27.993
And I notice I start
getting this, like--

00:15:28.026 --> 00:15:31.763
my tone goes from scared
to, like, bitchy.

00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:33.799
Like, "Where's the money,
white--"

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:36.735
"I don't know!"

00:15:36.768 --> 00:15:38.603
Like I'm an angry lady
at a restaurant.

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:43.241
Like, "I ordered that
Diet Coke ten minutes ago."

00:15:43.274 --> 00:15:45.744
I think that's my one critique
of black comedians

00:15:45.777 --> 00:15:47.179
who do impressions
of white people

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:49.281
is they always make us
so corny

00:15:49.314 --> 00:15:50.782
and over-enunciate.

00:15:50.815 --> 00:15:54.453
They really miss
the cuntiness in your voice

00:15:54.486 --> 00:15:57.622
when we feel like
we've been fucked over.

00:15:57.655 --> 00:15:59.491
Like, "Can I speak
to your mana--

00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:01.093
I need to speak
to someone."

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:03.795
That's like--whoo!

00:16:03.828 --> 00:16:07.132
That is angry pink
right there.

00:16:07.165 --> 00:16:09.868
I'm yelling at this guy like
we've been dating for 15 years.

00:16:09.901 --> 00:16:11.636
He's like, "Where's the money,
white boy?"

00:16:11.669 --> 00:16:13.338
I'm like, "I don't know,
but we're supposed to be

00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:15.807
at my sister's
in a half hour."

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.011
[laughter]

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.518
So he takes my keys,
and he takes my wallet.

00:16:26.551 --> 00:16:29.354
And the wallet that I had at
that time

00:16:29.387 --> 00:16:31.156
a girlfriend had bought me.

00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:32.858
"Pulp Fiction" is one of my
favorite movies of all time.

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:35.694
And--yeah, my girlfriend bought
me

00:16:35.727 --> 00:16:38.563
the "Bad Motherfucker" wallet.

00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:40.499
And then I ran into a bad
motherfucker.

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:41.900
[laughter]

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:44.669
And that is how you define
irony,

00:16:44.702 --> 00:16:47.539
is when someone takes a joke
wallet off you

00:16:47.572 --> 00:16:49.341
that's supposed to be
interpreted as badass.

00:16:49.374 --> 00:16:51.877
This guy was like, "Oh, this
guy sucks at being a badass."

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.812
[laughter]

00:16:53.845 --> 00:16:55.514
And then he takes my keys,

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:57.182
and he's like,
"Don't fuckin' move."

00:16:57.215 --> 00:16:59.751
And he goes downstairs,
and I hear him start my car.

00:16:59.784 --> 00:17:02.654
And if you drive
a piece of shit,

00:17:02.687 --> 00:17:06.992
you always kinda
want it to get taken.

00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:09.061
Like, he--
I heard him start that car,

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:11.663
and I was like, "Yes."

00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:13.865
Fuckin' Toyota Tacoma,
two-seater.

00:17:13.898 --> 00:17:16.535
I'm already thinking about
the truck I'm gonna buy.

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:18.270
It's perfect for the desert.

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:20.005
It's fuckin' affordable.

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:22.407
And I looked at the Kelley Blue
Book, right in my range.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.709
[laughter]

00:17:24.742 --> 00:17:26.044
He comes back upstairs,
he goes,

00:17:26.077 --> 00:17:27.412
"You fuckin' move again,
white boy,

00:17:27.445 --> 00:17:28.914
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you."

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:31.249
I'm like, "All right,
I'm sitting here."

00:17:31.282 --> 00:17:35.587
[laughter]

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.055
He goes downstairs.

00:17:37.088 --> 00:17:39.091
I hear him turn the car
into reverse,

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:42.260
and I hear him pull away
and immediately think,

00:17:42.293 --> 00:17:46.131
did you rob me
or did I rob you?

00:17:46.164 --> 00:17:48.900
And then I realize I'm
wearing swimsuit as underpants,

00:17:48.933 --> 00:17:50.635
and he just took all
my laundry and I was like,

00:17:50.668 --> 00:17:53.038
I think you just robbed me.

00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:57.742
I'm gonna have to wear these
for the foreseeable future.

00:17:57.775 --> 00:17:59.911
I caught--I count
to about 30, 35,

00:17:59.944 --> 00:18:01.780
and then I just--
pure adrenaline--

00:18:01.813 --> 00:18:04.483
break the plastic restraints,
hop over to the door,

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:07.085
lock it, and light up that
Camel Light.

00:18:07.118 --> 00:18:09.087
Yeah, 'cause there's not a
better cigarette

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.256
than after you've had a gun
pointed at you,

00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:14.159
where you're like, "Ohh, that's
flavor country."

00:18:14.192 --> 00:18:16.761
[laughter]

00:18:16.794 --> 00:18:18.763
As I light up that cigarette,
I see my cell phone.

00:18:18.796 --> 00:18:20.599
It's a flip phone, 'cause it's
2004,

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:22.434
and it's dancing;
it's dancing.

00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:24.603
It's like...
[imitates phone buzzing]

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:26.505
And I don't know the number,
and I pick up,

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:29.674
and all I hear is, "Yo, are you
dead?"

00:18:29.707 --> 00:18:32.511
I'm like, "Yeah, Amir, there's
good

00:18:32.544 --> 00:18:35.147
cell phone reception in
heaven."

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.948
He's like, "Yo, that guy came
around the corner.

00:18:36.981 --> 00:18:38.683
"I just got rid of the bag,
and I jumped

00:18:38.716 --> 00:18:40.252
and ran around the corner;
where are you?"

00:18:40.285 --> 00:18:42.187
I'm like, "In our apartment,"
I explain, like,

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.156
the guy took our car; we're
gonna have to call the cops.

00:18:44.189 --> 00:18:46.024
'Cause he's got my car, and
I've got to report this car

00:18:46.057 --> 00:18:47.592
stolen if I'm gonna get that
two-seater.

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.361
[laughter]

00:18:49.394 --> 00:18:52.030
We come back, we clear the
drugs out of the apartment.

00:18:52.063 --> 00:18:53.465
I call the cops.

00:18:53.498 --> 00:18:55.133
They take down a report.
All this shit.

00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:57.002
Two weeks later, I'm at a bar
in Tucson, Arizona,

00:18:57.035 --> 00:18:59.037
and I get a call on my cell
phone.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.106
They're like "Mr. Soder, it's
the Tucson Police Department.

00:19:01.139 --> 00:19:04.276
We have found your 1996 Dodge
Stratus."

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.977
[laughter]

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.947
I don't think my response was
supposed to be "fuck."

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.615
[laughter]

00:19:10.648 --> 00:19:13.618
"All right."

00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:15.353
He waits a second, he goes,
"Mr. Soder,

00:19:15.386 --> 00:19:16.888
also, here in the police
report,

00:19:16.921 --> 00:19:18.657
"it says--it says your wallet
was stolen,

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.559
Can you describe it for me?"

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:22.394
[laughter]

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:25.230
I go, "Yeah, it's the one that
say 'Bad Motherfucker' on it."

00:19:25.263 --> 00:19:27.132
And the cop without missing a
bit just goes,

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:29.034
"Well, clearly you've met a
badder motherfucker."

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:33.138
I'm like, "Oh, what are you a
cop or an open mic'er?"

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:35.173
"Who the hell makes that kind
of an inappropriate joke

00:19:35.206 --> 00:19:36.508
"to a robbery victim?

00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:38.043
But all right, I'll take it."

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:39.878
And that's the thing, man,
like, you know,

00:19:39.911 --> 00:19:42.013
I've told this story
several times to my friends,

00:19:42.046 --> 00:19:43.682
and there's always this part
where I have to explain

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:46.851
that comedians,
we use our sense of humor

00:19:46.884 --> 00:19:48.253
as, like,
a self-defense mechanism.

00:19:48.286 --> 00:19:49.721
When fucked-up shit
happens to us,

00:19:49.754 --> 00:19:51.089
we try to make
ourselves laugh,

00:19:51.122 --> 00:19:52.824
and that just kinda
makes it better.

00:19:52.857 --> 00:19:54.659
I made myself laugh
during the robbery.

00:19:54.692 --> 00:19:56.528
And all my friends are like,
"Yeah, you should get checked.

00:19:56.561 --> 00:19:58.997
That's fucked up."

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.099
But what happened
was during the robbery,

00:20:01.132 --> 00:20:03.001
when he had
the .45 on my head

00:20:03.034 --> 00:20:04.736
and he kept going,
"Where's the money, white boy?

00:20:04.769 --> 00:20:06.271
Where's the money, white boy?"

00:20:06.304 --> 00:20:08.206
I was like,
"I don't fuckin' know."

00:20:08.239 --> 00:20:10.175
And finally he goes, "Where's
your money, white boy?"

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:12.043
And I go, "I don't have any.
I'm broke as fuck."

00:20:12.076 --> 00:20:14.779
[laughter]

00:20:14.812 --> 00:20:17.549
'Cause I was.

00:20:17.582 --> 00:20:19.584
He hears that and he goes,

00:20:19.617 --> 00:20:21.386
"I find more than
a dollar on you,

00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:23.188
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you."

00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:27.058
To which my response was,
"Does change count?"

00:20:27.091 --> 00:20:28.393
[laughter]

00:20:28.426 --> 00:20:31.796
You have never seen
an angrier criminal

00:20:31.829 --> 00:20:36.901
than someone wading around
pockets full of change

00:20:36.934 --> 00:20:39.904
searching for a lost dollar.

00:20:39.937 --> 00:20:41.573
The anger on his face,

00:20:41.606 --> 00:20:44.743
like I was just some
disappointing white piñata,

00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:47.078
was like,
"This guy fuckin' sucks!"

00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:48.446
All right,
you guys are a lot of fun.

00:20:48.479 --> 00:20:49.581
Thank you very much.

00:20:49.614 --> 00:20:53.118
