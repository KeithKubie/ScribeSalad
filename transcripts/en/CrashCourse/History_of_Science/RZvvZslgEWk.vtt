00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:11.230
After World War Two, the applications of basic
discoveries in biology took off—and became

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.230
big business.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.620
Today, we’ll look at the rise of Big Pharma
and GMO foods.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.830
We’ll also discuss how life-science technologies
fundamentally changed reproduction: it’s

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.060
time to invent In Vitro Fertilization and clone a sheep!

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:34.300
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.480
When we left medicine and the brain sciences,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.399
one had antibiotics and the other had talk
therapy—which were major developments.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:45.120
But many disorders still lacked effective
treatments.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.460
That changed during the Cold War.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.079
Brain science took off, and several researchers
found, starting with animal models, that treating

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.430
brains with different chemicals could affect
mood and behavior.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.019
One of the first blockbuster brain drugs was
a compound called chlorpromazine, better known

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.019
by the brand name Thorazine.

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:06.360
Approved for psychiatric use by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration in 1954, Thorazine

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090
is an antipsychotic.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.180
It reduced the need for electroconvulsive
treatment.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.590
More patients returned to their families.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.140
And it’s still used today.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.680
Another early blockbuster was meprobamate, the first of the

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.140
“minor tranquilizers”—nowadays, called
anti-anxiety medications.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.610
Different companies marketed versions of meprobamate,
the biggest of which was Miltown.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.670
Miltown became the bestselling drug in the
U.S.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.220
Some historians estimate that five percent
of all Americans were on Miltown by the late

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.220
1950s.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.900
It became normal to take tranquilizers.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.670
There was even a Miltown Martini—the Miltini!

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.210
Kids at home (and irresponsible adults): do
not put tranquilizers in alcohol!

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.880
Tranquilizers were the first scientifically
created, advertising-promoted drugs for the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.090
“worried well”—people who mostly functioned
in society, such as problem children and those

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.579
neurotics in talk therapy.

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.789
Then in the early 1960s, drug company Roche developed diazepam, the first

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.019
anti-anxiety drug of the benzodiazepine family.

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.830
“Bennies,” which you may know from the
brand name Valium, worked faster and longer

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.850
than Miltown.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.290
Like Miltown, Valium affected culture.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.350
These pills became commonplace.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.000
You might have heard them called “mother’s
little helpers.”

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.980
This nickname tells the story of the U.S.
at the time: most women worked at home, many of them suffering

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.160
from the “problem with no name”—which we now might call Depression and Anxiety,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.920
owed in part to a lack
of options, respect, and rights.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.660
The new anti-anxiety pills worked to calm
worried brains—but they didn’t change

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.390
a patriarchal culture.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.360
More openly debated at the time was the first
drug to treat mood disorders such as bipolar

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.549
disorder, lithium.

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.970
Starting around 1950, some psychiatrists called
for the naturally occurring element lithium

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.600
to be used prophylactically as a mood stabilizer—that
is, to prevent a mood disorder.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.730
Lithium can cause serious side effects, however,
that make patients feel sluggish and out of

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.530
it—“stable” but not exactly great, depending
on the dose.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.810
So the FDA only approved lithium for prophylactic
use in 1974.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.680
Drugs for major depressive disorder were also
controversial.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.480
In the 1960s, psychiatrist Joseph Schildkraut
put forward the chemical imbalance theory:

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.100
basically, since antidepressants seem to work
by elevating levels of norepinephrine and

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.560
serotonin, depression may be caused by a lack
of these critical neurotransmitters.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.280
This theory is widely talked about, but it’s
never been proven.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.310
Where are you, scientific method?

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.130
Still, in 1987, the antidepressant fluoxetine—marketed
as Prozac—was sold as the first selective

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.150
serotonin reuptake inhibitor, based on the
imbalance theory.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.549
But pills were not the only ways of making
money from research on bodies.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.600
Another was the ability of medical researchers
to turn certain samples of human tissues into

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.930
immortalized cell lines using tissue engineering.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.350
These cells don’t die out, but keep growing
indefinitely.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.460
Experimenting on living humans can be dangerous
and complicated.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.990
Trying out new drugs on a dish full of human
cells is cheaper and safer.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.370
But the cells came from a specific human,
and the new practice of immortalizing cell

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.139
lines raised thorny questions about ownership.

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.140
Help us out, ThoughtBubble.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.770
The very first human cell line to be immortalized
has been experimented upon on every continent

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.800
and in outer space, helping thousands of researchers
develop new therapies.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.890
And it came from someone who didn’t give
consent and received no reward.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.440
Henrietta Lacks was an African-American housewife
in Baltimore who showed up at Johns Hopkins

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.540
in 1951 complaining of abdominal pain.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.400
She was diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.890
As he’d done with hundreds of incurable
cancer patients before, cell biologist George

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.970
Gey took a biopsy, or tissue sample,
and tried to keep it alive, giving it the

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.690
kind of nutrients it would get from the body,
but in a machine he’d designed called a

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.740
roller drum.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.230
Lacks’ tumor cells could keep growing, unlimited
by the size of a dish.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.540
His idea was that, since cancer cells divide
aggressively and don’t rely on a plan from

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.620
the body, they might be easier to keep alive
forever outside of one.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.390
Gey had tried and failed many, many times
before, so he was surprised when Lacks’

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.030
cells seemed to happily divide and divide,
never dying out.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.900
His persistence paid off!

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.939
Gey freely shared the cells with other researchers,
and the cell line—HeLa—became

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:34.170
the most important cell line in biomedical
research and remains so today.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.640
By 1954, this strain of cells was being used
by Jonas Salk to develop a polio vaccine!

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.550
And HeLa would later be used for cloning human
cells and developing in vitro fertilization.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.550
Buuut…

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.320
Henrietta Lacks—the human, with a family
and friends and dreams and bills—was long

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.330
dead.

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.860
She had never consented to having her cells
used for research.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.430
Her family was not aware of HeLa’s existence
until 1975.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.360
And they didn’t receive any compensation.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.680
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.280
As historian Hannah Landecker explains, HeLa
is a particularly loaded technology.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.410
To Gey and many scientists, it was clearly
a gift to science.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.620
To the Lacks family, the cell line clearly
represented the historical and continuing

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.730
oppression of black women: black body parts
used by white people to make knowledge and,

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.710
in the process, make money…

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.430
Eerily reminiscent of slavery.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.639
At least HeLa doesn't cost anything.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.270
This is not the case with all cell lines.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.680
In 1976, John Moore underwent treatment for
hairy cell leukemia at the UCLA Medical Center

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.950
under the supervision of Doctor David Golde.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.360
He developed tissue from Moore’s cancer
into a cell line, Mo, that was later commercialized

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.840
for millions of dollars.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.090
In 1990, the California Supreme Court ruled
that Moore had no right to any share of the

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.260
profits realized from the commercialization
of anything developed from his “discarded”

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:56.260
tissue.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.740
The lucrative cell line is owned by the regents
of the University of California—not the

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.620
man from whose body the cells were taken.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.300
New technologies also raised new questions
in agriculture.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.150
You’ve probably heard of GMOs, or genetically
modified organisms.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:18.120
A GMO has had its genome, or DNA blueprint,
edited to include genes from another organism.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.780
Genetically transforming microbes took off
starting in 1973.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:26.650
The first genetic engineering techniques didn’t
work with complex organisms, but new techniques

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:27.650
soon followed.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.960
In 1977, a biologist named Mary-Dell Chilton

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.620
used an altered form of a common bacterium
called Agrobacterium tumafaciens to insert

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.960
genetic material from a foreign species into
a plant.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.580
Agrobacterium works by forming a plant tumor,
called a gall, on the roots of a plant.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.730
Chilton’s breakthrough was followed by similar
work in Belgium.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.080
But she became—and remains—the “Queen
of Agrobacterium.”

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:56.560
In the 1980s, chemical companies used her
work to develop GMO crops.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.250
In 1983, John Sanford and Edward Wolf invented
a mechanical means of genetically transforming

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.970
plants at Cornell—the gene gun.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.000
This was also used to make GMOs.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.940
The first approved GMO was a pest-resistant
tobacco in China, in 1992.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:18.190
The same year, the U.S. approved the first
GMO to eat—a bruising-resistant tomato,

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.220
the “Flavr-Savr,” marketed under the farmy-sounding
name “MacGregor’s.”

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.420
These tomatoes contained a gene that turned
off the enzyme that breaks down pectin.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.350
This kept them from going soft on long truck-rides
from Mexico.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:37.980
In the 1990s, a company developed the super-fast-growing
AquaAdvantage salmon—the first GM animal

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.130
for food.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.510
Canada approved it, and the FDA ruled the
salmon safe in 2015.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:48.520
But the next year, they postponed AquaAdvantage’s
release “until final labeling guidelines

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.070
for informing consumers of such content are
published.”

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.760
And they’ve postponed every year since.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:59.110
But the big money GMOs, which at first faced
little pushback from consumers, are grains

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.650
In 1995, Bt corn was registered with the EPA.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.740
Farmers have used Bt, a pesticide derived
from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.740
, since 1920.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.690
On its own, the pesticide is considered organic!

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.020
Around the same time, Monsanto introduced

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.150
“Roundup Ready” soybeans, resistant to
their top pesticide, glyphosate.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.160
The soybeans were followed by corn in 1998.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:28.010
Each chemical company set up a vertical system,
selling GM seeds and related herbicides.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.110
And making tons of money as farmers buy both.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:36.770
GMO grains are common throughout the United
States, China, Argentina, and India, but largely

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.200
resisted in Europe.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.230
The market for GMOs today is estimated at
over three hundred billion dollars, all from

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:49.190
only four crops—soy, canola, cotton, and
corn—modified with only two properties—herbicide

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.070
tolerance, insecticidal action, or both.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.960
None of these makes foods more nutritious
or better tasting.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.250
These properties are all about yields for
grains that are fed to animals or used as

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.250
ingredients.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.980
So much of the recent controversy about GMOs
isn’t really about the technology of changing

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.690
plant genomes, but the why behind these changes.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.120
Other advances in genetics technologies were

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.810
more readily accepted: assisted reproductive
technology.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:21.880
In 1978, in England, Louise Brown became the
first baby born using in vitro fertilization

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.880
or IVF.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.860
“In vitro” means “ in glass”—babies
conceived in dishes instead of wombs.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:34.750
Basically, IVF and similar techniques involve
isolating gametes, or sex cells, and moving

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:36.360
them around in labs.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.700
Egg donation became possible soon after, in
the 1980s.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.140
Today, IVF, the donation of gametes, and other
forms of assisted reproductive technology

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.390
are widely accepted.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:52.180
But these technologies are often expensive,
so not everyone has equal access to them.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.850
Meanwhile, in agriculture, other cell biologists
pushed new reproductive technologies.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:02.050
Dolly the sheep was born in 1996, the first
animal created using the technique somatic

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.850
cell nuclear transfer or SCNT—widely described
as “cloning.”

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:12.410
Dolly was created by embryologist Ian Wilmut
and others at the Roslin Institute of the

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.200
University of Edinburgh—and named after
Dolly Parton!

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.580
SCNT is surprisingly simple: somatic cells
are body cells, like from skin.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.240
The nucleus of a somatic cell contains a DNA
blueprint.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:29.110
But it’s not normally enough to make a new
organism—that requires gametes.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:34.589
But with SCNT, the egg’s nucleus is sucked
out by a micropipette, and the nucleus from

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:36.910
a somatic cell is inserted.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.760
This causes the egg to start dividing—to
make a baby—and means the genetic material

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.000
is from that somatic cell.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.320
The baby is a “clone” of the somatic donor!

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:52.650
With new reproductive technologies, it’s
technically possible to clone a baby human,

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.760
but that’s banned in most countries.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:00.070
Also, cloning wouldn’t result in an exact
copy of the single “parent,” just a child

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:01.720
with a similar genome.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.310
Experience would turn certain genes on and
off: this is called epigenetics.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:12.180
And environmental stimuli matter more than
genes in many cases: breathing in polluted

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.580
air, for example, is bad no matter how good
the genes related to your lungs are.

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.960
Next time—we’ll introduce the life sciences
equivalent of the atomic bomb: it’s time

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:27.490
for the Human Genome Project, forensic genetics,
and a new “personalized” era in biotechnology.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.430
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:35.180
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.180
Thought Cafe.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.560
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.470
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.209
channels like Scishow, Eons, and Sexplanations.

00:12:44.209 --> 00:12:48.950
And, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.550
the series at Patreon; a crowdfunding platform
that allows you to support the content you

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.550
love.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:56.670
Thank you to all of our patrons for making
Crash Course possible with their continued

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:57.800
support.
