We're all gonna die,
we're all gonna [bleep] die.

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:08.408
- You know, Zarga wouldn't
marry me either.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:11.244
She said I was too creepy.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:14.580
Well, I showed her.

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:17.183
<i> I bought some
 black market parts</i>

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:21.487
<i> so my goggles would suck
 the love out of other couples.</i>

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.058
<i> Then I pumped their love
 into her,</i>

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.760
<i> so she had no choice
 but to love me.</i>

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:31.330
<i> Soon, I had my sweetheart
 back in my loving arms.</i>

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:34.734
<i> And I cuddled her
 and snuggled her all night</i>

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.636
<i> like a sweet little bird.</i>

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.704
My sweet little bird.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:42.208
- Whoa, okay, that is by far
the creepiest thing

00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.243
I've ever heard in my life.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:47.213
But I guess I don't really
have any other options, do I?

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.515
- I can't think of any.
