00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:02.020
(elegant piano music)

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.160
- [Narrator] The product of
millions of years of evolution,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.950
the human body is capable
of many remarkable things,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.480
but none of which may
be quite so incredible

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.493
as the development of life in utero.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.790
(calm music)

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.420
Over three million babies are born

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.533
each year in the United States alone.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.540
Worldwide, the highest
fertility rate is found

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.090
in Niger, where the
average woman gives birth

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.603
to approximately 6.49
children in her lifetime.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.120
Singapore sits on the
opposite end of the spectrum

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.020
at just 0.83, less than
one birth per woman.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.730
While the number of births, customs,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.450
and traditions vary
from culture to culture,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.703
the developmental process
is essentially universal.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.160
Derived from the Latin word praegnantem,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.040
meaning before birth,
pregnancy is the period

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.473
in which the fetus
develops inside the womb.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.750
Typically lasting around 40 weeks,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.340
human pregnancies are divided

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.153
into three trimesters
of three months each.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:10.270
(calm music)

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.870
Pregnancy begins in the uterus,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.063
where a sperm fertilizes an egg.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.750
If the sperm carries an X chromosome,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.400
the baby will become female,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.170
while a Y chromosome will result

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.930
in the baby becoming male.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.370
The fertilized egg, or zygote,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.570
divides repeatedly as it travels

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.150
through the fallopian tube,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.190
implanting itself on the uterine wall

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.740
to form both the embryo

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.410
and a specialized organ
known as the placenta.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.230
Found only in eutherian,
or placental, mammals,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.010
the placenta will manage waste
and provide key nutrients,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.763
oxygen, and hormones
via the umbilical cord.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.880
The brain, which will continue

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.920
to grow and develop
throughout the pregnancy,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.083
makes up nearly half of the
embryo in these early stages.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.070
As the eyes, nose, ears, and mouth,

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.330
along with all major organs continue

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.970
to develop in month three,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.340
the baby will begin to look more

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.453
and more human with each passing day.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.050
The second trimester lasts
from weeks 13 through 27.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.490
The fetus will more than double

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.000
in size during this time, and soon,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.143
its movements may be felt by the mother.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.890
Hearing first develops around week 18,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.900
but the fetus will not respond to sounds

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.173
outside of the womb until
approximately week 25.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.680
Starting at week 28 and
lasting up until delivery,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.270
the third trimester is a
time for final touches,

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.797
such as eyelashes and taste buds.

00:02:35.797 --> 00:02:37.110
(light music)

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.190
With most major development complete,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.623
the fetus will gain nearly
half a pound a week.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.560
To make room for this rapid growth,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.160
the mother's internal
organs adjust significantly

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.800
throughout the pregnancy.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.420
Dropping lower into the pelvis,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.220
a fetus typically turns heads-down

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.920
in preparation for birth.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.120
Most bones will have
hardened by this time,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.220
though the skull will
remain relatively soft

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.330
to ease the delivery process.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.200
Labor is divided into stages,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.200
beginning with the dilation of the cervix

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.630
and resulting in the delivery

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.453
of both the baby and the placenta.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.890
Despite thousands of years
of human pregnancies,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.490
scientific understanding
has only recently begun

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.310
to catch up, leading to
an increase in success

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.990
and safety for both mother and child.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.420
As our understanding of
pregnancy continues to develop,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.250
so do technology and
reproductive medicine,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.413
with much more in store for
the future of pregnancy.
