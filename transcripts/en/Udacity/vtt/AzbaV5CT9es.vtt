00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.940
For this live coding session, I want to make it interactive.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.200
And I'll actually be working from Chrome's debugger and JavaScript console,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.810
once the AJAX request has finished, and my data has been loaded.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.870
To do this, I can put a debugger statement inside the draw a callback function.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.130
To make sure that the AJAX request has completed,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.930
and that my data has been passed to the function.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.540
You can set up any JavaScript debugger,

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.890
by the keyword debugger, and end the line with a semicolon.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.490
When Chrome loads the page,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:42.790
it'll first call our d3.tsv function to load world_cup.tsv.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.420
Once the AJAX request has returned, it

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.900
will pass the data file in a JavaScript object to our draw a callback function.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.800
And once our callback function is called, code will execute until it

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.710
hits the debugger statement, in which execution would stop, and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.820
it will put us into the Chrome debugger at this exact line.
