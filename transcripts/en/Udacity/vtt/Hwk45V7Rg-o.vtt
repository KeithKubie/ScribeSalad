00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.380
Let's look at how to track
what users do in your app.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.050
First, you need to identify
what's important to know

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.340
about what your users are doing.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.859
Do you care if they set preferences?

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.540
Maybe you want to know if they
reach a certain level in your game.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.920
Perhaps you want to know if they ordered
takeout, or if they clicked an ad.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.110
So here's a code to send
an event hit to Analytics.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.300
You create the tracker.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.380
Should know how to do that by now.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.550
Then you use an event builder
to build an event hit.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.010
You set the category,
the action, and the label.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.430
And these three things, the category,
the action, and the label,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.090
are going to show up in
the Analytics Dashboard.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.200
And you put this code wherever
you want to record the event.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.850
So I'd like to know which of
the dinner options are unpopular,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.370
which ones people don't
want to see again.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.000
So I'm going to add the code to track
the event in the method that's called

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.500
when the user presses this button.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.610
In this case,
it's the removeMeal method.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.370
So this is the removeMeal method
in the ShowDinnerActivity.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.940
This is the method that gets
clicked when users press the button

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.710
to say they don't like a meal.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.870
So this method creates an intent to
start the RemoveMealActivity and

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.140
here's where I've added the code
to send a hit to Analytics.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.970
I get the tracker, I build the event.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.050
I've set the category to Dinner actions,
set the action to,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.330
Dislike dinner choice, and here,
I am passing in the selected dinner, so

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.990
that I can keep track of actually which
dinner it is that users don't like.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.790
So to see the report for
the events in the Analytics Dashboard,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.720
you go to Behavior,
Events, and Overview.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.490
While you're waiting for

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.650
the data to show up in the Analytics
Dashboard, you can check the log in

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.930
Android Studio to make sure that
the hits did in fact get sent.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.420
And in the Analytics Dashboard,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.622
in the Events Overview, make sure that
the date range includes today's date.

00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:09.530
So I actually had to wait about a half
an hour for these events to show up.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.120
But here they are.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.490
You see the event categories
have only got one category.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.480
You see the actions and
then again I've only got one action.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.240
And you see the labels.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.190
You can drill down into the events,
drill down into the actions.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.550
So here, I can see that the tofu and
coriander salad was the most

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.800
disliked with three dislikes and
you can see other data about the event.
