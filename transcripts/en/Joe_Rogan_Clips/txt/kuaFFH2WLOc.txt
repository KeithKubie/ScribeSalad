Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. I was so impressed with the your performance from that past UFC that I had to had to talk to you. I was like, that was what I've seen guys make. Like you are always a very dangerous striker from obviously from the [inaudible] hockey fight. Every got everybody got to see that. But to see how fluid you were against a beast like Eric Andrews, I mean Eric Andrews a scary cat. Yeah, he's, he's coming from blood. Right. And you were so fast, man. It was crazy to watch. It was really interesting. Thank you. What if you had to give yourself a percentage leap that you've gone up over the last year, what do you think it would be compared to like who you were before that?

Speaker 1:          00:43          Not The hive leap. I mean, not that I like, that performance for me was like, I feel good about it, but that was only four months. So I'm like, I know that there's so much more for me to gain. That's what I'm like, yeah, I gotta go back. So the leap, not, not too much because I know there's still a lot more to go a lot more. Yeah. Wow. So you've decided, so for people who don't understand what we're talking about, you went to Thailand, he spent four months down in Thailand and um, you were fighting like a Thai boxer. It was crazy. Like Martell, grotty, who works in the production truck and he's the guy who picks out the instant replays. He and I talked back and forth sometimes while the fights going on and mark mark market with his heavy Boston accent, like dude classic, he's classic Chi stance and he would just sell a light on that front leg inside leg kick was so ferocious.

Speaker 1:          01:33          It was fun to watch men. So it's just usually wherever I go. Um, I've always been good at just like kind of absorbing the culture. I'm a guy, like I can go into a room full of people and I can just kind of pick up what the energy is like. And that's another reason why I wanted to go to Thailand. So just the way that they train and the discipline, the power. But the relaxation, like everything I was learning, just like then there's so much more to Moitai. So I would just, even the days that I didn't train, I just sit around and just watch these guys because moy ties with more than just punching, kicking elbows, minters balance. You know what I mean? There's, there's repetition. Like how many kicks are you throwing? You know, the guys at the stadiums, they're like their Kik, Kik, Kik, Kik.

Speaker 1:          02:22          So I was able to learn a lot, man. And they're still a lot to go. It's beautiful to see someone on that pursuit. And I think it's, um, it's much like Roger Mayweather said about boxing. Like most people don't know shit about boxing. The lady said that, it's like, if anybody say that he's going to say that because there are levels and layers and there's, there's paths to go down. And it's interesting when you see someone like committed with a very, like a very specific style, like your, like your adoption of that Moyie Thai style. So if it's so effective as a striking style, it's really interesting when you think of all the different ways to attack with striking that one way became very particularly successful. You know what, before I even started training MMA as a whole, um, my first mixed martial, my first martial arts class with Moitai class, I knew that I wanted to train Moitai or to learn when we tie.

Speaker 1:          03:20          Um, and so since I've started, I always thought like, yeah, I wanna go there. You know, just, maybe it's cool, but, um, [inaudible] has always been my thing, but I had never really learned it like the actual way, you know, like from, from the root of, uh, of where it comes from. I always just kind of like passed down or like Brazilian style, Moy, Tai, you know, like shoot the box type stuff. So, um, that's completely different from stadium we tie and most people don't know shit about stadium Moitai. Like unless you go to, unless you go to Bangkok, let's characterize it for people. You do say that that core was style, just way more aggressive, different, a different way they utilize techniques. Yeah, it's light on the front leg. So sometimes they are like more shogun would be light on his front leg a little bit.

Speaker 1:          04:08          One thing that they were doing a lot that it's pretty similar. It's just like they go at it, shoot the box, they'll go at it, you just go until the other guy stops. Pretty much. Um, but from the shoot the box, I was like very combo based, like punches and kicks are like one, two like you have to memorize these crazy combos. Codero is he like, I think he's one of the guys that just like passed it down a lot in San Diego, Lima that guys like that. But they have this system and it's very like combination based, um, memory slipping Punchkick all this stuff. But the ties are just like, it's just straight kick, you know, like punch view. You fall down on that front foot, elbow, knee. It's just, it's broken down completely differently. Um, it's just a whole, whole different style. Yeah, it is like, so the, the shoot the box stuff has punches, kicks, knees, elbows, combination, same tools that you're gonna use him Moitai button. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:03          has got a whole different game plan, you know, clinching, like I've never trained as much clinching in America as I have in Thailand in just four months and I've been fighting our training now for like nine years. So just in four months I've gotten more clinch time in Thailand that I have, you know, in my whole career. And that's because it's a whole different game. You got to master the clinch and t in Noida you have to for effective like real true. Moitai are you getting a lot of wrestling over there? Yeah, so that's one thing too. I heard, um, I heard shop talking about it. Um, tiger has amazing, like it's an amazing gym, 40 to 60 guys on the mat from everywhere. Chechnya. Wow. You know, in everywhere, in everywhere. Man. Those guys, they come there maybe for a week, maybe two weeks, um, maybe for a month.

Speaker 1:          05:54          But you're getting constant, um, good training, grappling, everything, MMA, boxing, crossfit, everything you need is in one place. It's a, blew my mind being there, honestly. That's fascinating. And your, are you the coaches that you were working with before? Are you still working with them and Thailand? Are you just gonna I know you had talked about actually moving to Thailand. Yeah. Yeah. The plan is to move there like as soon as possible. Really? Yeah. So I was like hitting you up like y'all want to get on your show. I want to talk a little bit. Um, but yeah, I want to, um, the plan is to move to Thailand like with the next couple of weeks for at least a year. And I want to go there just because I can just train. The lifestyle is completely different. I can walk to the gym, hop on a motorbike. It's just, it's so simple.

Speaker 1:          06:41          Um, but to answer the question about my coaches, um, I always have my brother in my corner. He's just kind of like moral support. We started this together. Um, I had a conditioning coach slash friends slash mental type of like support, um, Lorenzo Paprika. And then my head coaches have switched probably two or three times in the last couple of fights I had Kenny Johnson from black house, um, John Wood from syndicate. And now I have George Hickman from Tiger Moy. Tai. Yeah. And so this change that you decided to make a, did it come after the Johnnie Walker fight? Yeah. So the Johnnie Walker fly, like that camp was tough man. Like I was doing so much to try to improve in my wrestling and grappling because that was always like a big hole that my game. Um, so I spent so much time wrestling over at Black House with Kevin Casey and this guy that I fought Blake troop.

Speaker 1:          07:38          They're huge and these guys are great grapplers so in cases of powerhouse, yeah, he'll put you into the ground and he feels like cement block on top of you. So it's old school Hixon Jujitsu. Exactly. How pressure man. So, um, yeah, I would, I was just grinding myself into the mat every day for that camp, expecting like, okay, I'm comfortable in the feed. If it goes to the ground, I'm ready. And um, I, I think I just completely lost sight of like my striking my Moitai in that fight, his size, everything. I just kind of froze up, man. I was just like, ah, I didn't know what to do, how to get there. So let's all part of the education, right. I mean this is what this, this career of fighting that you're, you're on this path is what it's all about. Yeah. And fighting for me is like big self-awareness too.

Speaker 1:          08:21          You know? I think it's always important though, when a guy has a setback to see how he responds. Some people get discouraged, some people get encouraged, some people just decide like they're going to be much more committed. And that's what you did. You just mean making that move to do your camp in Thailand and seeing how it paid off. I mean, Eric Anders is a very tough customer and you essentially shut him out. Yeah. It was very, very impressive man. That was the, that was the plan though, because I knew he was telling me he's talking to them before. I sparred with him before that everything in like he's, I've watched all of his fights. The guy's hard to put away and making a case for the fight being stopped. Yeah. We were making a case. I mean, DC was saying like the, we can stop this fight.

Speaker 1:          08:59          I was saying it, I was like, you are fucking his legs up. I feel like this is about it. During the fight, I wasn't lying. I'm sure you weren't, but that guy is so damn tough. He kept coming, man. I mean, he, he never stopped trying to win that fight. Yeah. There's no quit in him. No. I mean, even in the, in the Santos fight, remember? Yeah. It was just they were due or die. Yeah. And then he tweets, he is like, I haven't been that tired since like my wedding night or something like that. He's always got good good tweets after the fight. Shout out to air handlers.

Speaker 2:          09:26          Okay.
