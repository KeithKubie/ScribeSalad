will be the best outcome and we can hope
 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.360
will be the best outcome and we can hope
that happens soon but right now there

likelihood that that's going to change

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360
likelihood that that's going to change
 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.670
likelihood that that's going to change
and that means people who have lost

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680
and that means people who have lost
 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.620
and that means people who have lost

a long way to go before its resolution
we have advocated that in larger number

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440
we have advocated that in larger number
 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.860
