PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Good morning.

00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:03.010
Ah, that's good.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.660
Since 2011, the first day of
GDC has been Google Developer

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.889
Conference.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:13.660
Can I see a show of hands
who's here for the first time?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.250
Wow.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.120
Welcome.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.120
And for all the rest of you,
thank you for coming back.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.240
It's been a tradition
that we truly enjoy.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.820
Fun fact-- Play is only
six years old this month.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.840
All right.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.280
So what's exciting is
that the market for gaming

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.140
is showing tremendous momentum.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.680
In the last year, the
number of Android users

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.910
who have downloaded a
game doubled compared

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.650
to the previous 12 months.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.160
And 40% of these
installs are coming

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.180
from emerging markets like
Brazil, India, Indonesia,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.330
Mexico.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.220
At Google, we're taking
this very seriously

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.800
and working on a ton
of different things

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.800
to help you reach
a global audience.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.880
Today, we will talk about
a few of those things.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.000
At Play, we are
singularly focused

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.250
on becoming the
premier destination

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.980
for discovery and distribution
of your apps and games.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.550
Last week, we
announced a Maps API

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.010
that allows you to bring your
game into the real world.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.280
Super exciting, isn't it?

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.270
I can see nods.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.760
That's good.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.690
Today, we'll also announce
that our Google Cloud Platform

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.760
can work across all platforms--

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.420
PC, console, and mobile.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.520
We'll also have sessions
on sharing with you

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.440
the early momentum you're
seeing in ARCore as well as tips

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.950
to get you started.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.480
Additionally, I want
to share an initiative

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.880
we kicked off last fall that is
personally of interest to me.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.740
This is about women in gaming.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.100
After hundreds of millions of
people who play mobile games,

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.310
49% are women.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.380
But our research
showed that women

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.670
are less likely to identify
themselves as gamers,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.730
less likely to engage
in gaming communities,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.530
and less likely
to work in gaming.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.190
Look around.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.350
So we kicked off an initiative
called Change the Game,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.600
where we want to empower and
celebrate women both as players

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.330
as well as creators.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.130
In one of the
sessions today, we'll

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.230
share insights we found
from our research.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.925
So please take time to attend.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.410
Now, before I hand off
to the other speakers,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.650
a few things about today.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.610
Today's about you.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.650
We have a whole lot
of sessions, which

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.160
is focused on sharing all
the new tools and techniques

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.060
that we have been working on.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.330
I want to highlight
three main ones.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.490
Immediately after
the keynote, we

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.780
will have a session on the
new platforms and innovations.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.280
After lunch, we
have two sessions.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.050
One which is focused on really
thinking about how you can make

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.450
your launch successful
and the strategies

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.250
that we can share with you,
and then followed by a session

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.740
on how to think about
post-launch growth

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.240
for your games.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.190
So I hope you'll stick around.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.100
You know, this day is about you.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.890
If you have questions beyond
today please come to our booth

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.740
Wednesday to Friday, where
we'll have more sessions

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.250
and we'll have people who
will be there to answer

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.990
any questions you might have.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.110
With that, I hand
you over to Mark Vela

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.250
to talk about game discovery
on the Google Play Store.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.800
Thank you.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.222
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:05.222 --> 00:06:06.097
MARK VELA: Thank you.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.580
Thanks so much, Purnima.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.595
Good morning, everyone.

00:06:11.595 --> 00:06:12.470
My name is Mark Vela.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.840
I'm the head of games
merchandising for the Americas

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.130
on Google Play.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:17.630
And today, I'm
thrilled to walk you

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.213
through some of the
improvements we're

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:21.980
making to drive games
discovery on Google Play

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.610
as well as the Play Games app.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.020
Play serves as a discovery
engine for over 2

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.030
billion Android devices.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.680
And that spans across
smartphones, tablets,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.020
or even your watch, TV, or car.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.520
And Play is also
expanding beyond Android.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.630
The catalog is now being
delivered to laptops

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.670
powered by Chrome OS.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.830
And across all
these form factors,

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.080
Play's mission is to
bring devices to life.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.560
And I firmly believe it's the
incredible catalog of games

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.840
that you all bring to the
platform that delivers

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.570
the most magical experiences.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.320
I'm going to touch on
some key areas we're

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.320
focusing our efforts
to enhance discovery.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.170
Personalization is really the
fundamental building block

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.910
that's made even more
powerful by having

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.060
great content to recommend
and more surfaces to show

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.370
those recommendations.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.110
On top of that,
we're also seeking

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.650
to create new experiences via
deeper curation, new sections,

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.730
and new content types.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.870
Now, a lot of the magic
of Play's recommendations

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.484
happen behind the scenes.

00:07:25.484 --> 00:07:26.900
So I want to pull
back the curtain

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.649
and tell you all some
of the changes we've

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:32.330
made to match the right
content to the right user.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.300
Late last year, we expanded
our content taxonomy

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.570
to classify games into
thousands of different topics.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.070
And that feeds our
personalization

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.860
in a couple of ways.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.020
First, that taxonomy is used
for our recently launched search

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.070
refinements.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.050
You see this
illustrated on the left.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.540
Users can now refine
and filter search terms

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.640
to distill down to more
specific content types.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.670
So in this example,
the user initially

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.710
came in searching
for racing games.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.020
They were presented with a
number of different filters

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.950
underneath racing games to
distill it down more to match

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.250
what they were looking for.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.770
They chose motorcycle,
and you can

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.370
see how the content
adjusted to meet that need.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.070
Second, this expanded
content taxonomy

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.230
also powers the recommendations
on our homepages.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.990
So we've transitioned
our Recommended

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.130
For You collections.

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:23.880
They were previously based
on the 17 games categories

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.410
on the store.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.000
We now can serve over
200 different genre

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.049
and subgenre-based
collections to our users.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.890
So the example that
you see on the right--

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.770
rather than having a broad
collection of sports games,

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:40.020
we can now dynamically
maintain dozens

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.510
of different, more
specific sports collections

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.460
to meet the users' needs.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.230
What does this mean
for all of you?

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.710
Ultimately, these
personalized improvements

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.270
give your games
more opportunities

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:57.020
to surface in more tailored,
relevant collections.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.482
Now we know how important
games are to our users,

00:08:59.482 --> 00:09:01.190
and I want to share
several changes we've

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.690
made to provide a more engaging
browse experience that's

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.320
specifically tailored to gamers.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.360
We'll start with navigation.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.580
As we all know, games are
very different from apps.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.920
And we've now elevated
games to its own destination

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.480
to reflect this.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.140
This becomes a foundation for
creating more experiences that

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.330
are unique to games,
such as more immersive

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.460
or recommendations
with video trailers

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.460
and actual screen
shots of gameplay.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.770
We also want to give
users more control of how

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.600
they explore the catalog.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.030
One example is a
separate premium section

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.460
that we recently launched
a few months ago.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.500
This highlights really
the best paid games

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.660
that we have on Play.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.540
Another great feature that we're
showing on the premium page--

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.660
hopefully most of you have seen
our games on sale collection.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.260
This features a new
capability we have

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.790
with strikethrough pricing.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.920
So really conveys
the great value

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.580
that users are getting
with the regular price,

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.330
slash through it, and
then the sale price.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.850
We've really seen
awesome conversion uplift

00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.790
with this new feature.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.270
Now, within our
recommendations, we also

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.700
want to help users
decide what to install

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.630
by more clearly highlighting
the best of the catalog.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.889
We've always had editorial
curation at Play,

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:15.680
but it's sometimes a
little hard for a user

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.860
to differentiate the
personalized recommendations

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:22.820
from the editorial
curated selections

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.290
and understand why
they should care

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.230
about this game, what really
makes these games unique.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.630
So one of the major
focuses for this year

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.700
is creating these new
editorial experiences.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.220
Hopefully many of you
have seen these richer,

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.380
kind of long-form
content articles

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.530
that explain to users what
we love about the games.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.370
These editor's choice articles
are now live in 17 countries.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.610
And in addition to a dedicated
section, the editor's choice

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.150
section you can access
from the home page.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.350
We've also created an
evergreen placement

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.420
on both the home page
and the game's home.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.480
We continue to add new
articles as we publish them.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.542
We really strive to celebrate
diverse games on Google Play,

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:05.750
and we really think a lot
of the game play innovation

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.630
that comes with the platform
comes from our indies.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.600
So we've put a ton of effort
into amping up our indie games

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.640
featuring via two key areas.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.700
First, our Indie
Corner destination

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.520
continues to be improved with
more visually exciting ways

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.800
to browse the catalog
and help users discover

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.600
their favorite new indie game.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.050
And second, we've expanded
our indie games festival

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.530
from its initial roots in San
Francisco a few years ago.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.700
We're now running contests in
London, South Korea, Japan.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.140
And most recently, we had our
first ever Latin American Indie

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.990
Games Festival in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, last month.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:47.000
We had over 200 nominations
from developers in 17 countries

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.650
and just had
incredible engagements.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.900
So lots of momentum
behind our indie games

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.060
program, and we're
looking to do more here.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.630
Discovering new
games is particularly

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.210
important to gamers, and
we're approaching this need

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.010
in a couple of different ways.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.080
Similar to the premium
page I just showed,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.920
we've also recently rolled out a
section dedicated to new games.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.650
Here we seek to really
showcase the latest

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:16.050
high-quality releases on Play.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.600
I also want to talk about our
pre-registration program, which

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.780
continues to just drive
incredible results.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.910
We started our
pre-registration program

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.060
about 2 and 1/2 years ago.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.630
And during that
time, we've driven

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:32.190
nearly 200 million registrations
for over 300 participating

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:33.390
games.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.930
We're working hard to expose
registration in multiple places

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.620
to build on that momentum
and drive even more results.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.960
So another thing I
want to highlight

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.820
is a new feature we're testing
out right now with "Westworld"

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.950
called milestone rewards.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.800
This just kicked off last week
after we worked with a partner

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.320
to announce this,
and what you see

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.020
here is a tiered set
of rewards that users

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.440
can earn as the
community reaches

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.940
these different
registration thresholds.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.220
So we've already hit the 250,000
pre-registration threshold.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.730
That unlocks this character
Lawrence for everyone

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.670
who's pre-registered, and
there are three more tiers

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:20.490
that users can hit as we get to
500,000, 750,000 and a million.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.840
So really excited
about this feature.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.740
We think it's just going
to drive a lot of momentum

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.706
to get an entire
community to drive

00:13:28.706 --> 00:13:29.955
towards getting these rewards.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.280
Now, the store can also do
more than just help users

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.834
find new games to install.

00:13:36.834 --> 00:13:38.250
Should also be a
destination where

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.620
users can find out what's
happening in the games

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.640
they already have.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.170
We know how it's hard
to sustain engagement.

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:45.720
We want to help out here.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.910
So we've started highlighting
major in-game events

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.890
and LiveOps through
store featuring.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.380
You can see an example
of the FIFA banner

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:54.870
we did for a squad
building challenge.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.030
And we've also rolled
out what we're calling

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.770
LiveOps cards on Games home.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.410
Hopefully many of you
have experienced this.

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.290
These LiveOps cards
highlight exciting events

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:07.230
happening right now
in those titles,

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:12.060
whether it's a limited-time
event, discounts, some form

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.550
of new content, a number
of different things

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.240
that we hope will compel users
to come back into the games.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.430
Lots of exciting
improvements here,

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.230
and I can't wait to
expand this even further.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.640
Because we're
Google, we continue

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.380
to experiment with
innovative ways

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.390
to drive more exciting
engagement with users.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.776
So I want to actually share with
you a pilot we just kicked off.

00:14:33.776 --> 00:14:35.150
Vast majority of
you are probably

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.610
not seeing this because it's
a very small experiment.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:39.860
But we are beginning
to run experiments

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.760
that present a different
set of information,

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.030
depending on a user's
state within the game.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.820
So on the left, you see
what a user who has not yet

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.620
installed the game may see--

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.010
ratings, number of
downloads, some screenshots,

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:53.510
description of the
game, things that

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.737
will hopefully get them to
try it out for the first time.

00:14:56.737 --> 00:14:58.820
On the other hand, if a
user already has the game,

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.680
we should show them
different information.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.020
And that's what you
see here on the right.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.000
Some of the LiveOps
cards information I

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
just showed you, in-game events
that are happening right now,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
new content, and
also if there has

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.490
been an APK update, some new
features, new modes, et cetera.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.260
So we're excited about this.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.820
We hope to see some
positive results

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.277
so that we could roll it out.

00:15:20.277 --> 00:15:22.860
I also want to highlight some
of the amazing improvements that

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.530
have been made to
the Play Games app.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.630
This past November,
we fully redesigned

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:30.090
the app to let users
easily launch the games

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.320
they have installed.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.330
And just this past
month, we added a number

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.820
of game reengagement features.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.700
So in addition to tracking their
achievements and leaderboards,

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.070
users can now see
LiveOps-related news

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.020
and YouTube videos.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.590
Also, the new arcade prominently
features an innovative new tag

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:48.120
browsing experience
to help users

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.520
find their next favorite game.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.500
These updates have driven
significant increases

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.550
in engagement.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:59.720
We're excited to bring even more
to the Play Games app in 2018.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.000
So that wraps up our overview
of the key improvements

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.541
we're making on the
Google Play Store

00:16:03.541 --> 00:16:06.912
to drive games discovery as
well as the Play Games app.

00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:08.120
Thanks so much for your time.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.070
And now I'll hand
it off to Jonathan,

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.570
who's going to tell you about
a really exciting feature that

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.512
goes one step beyond discovery.

00:16:15.512 --> 00:16:17.982
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:22.428 --> 00:16:25.300
JONATHAN KARMEL: Hey, everyone.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.470
Sorry about that.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:27.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.760
So Mark talked
about how we as Play

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.000
try to get the right
user to the right game.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.040
And we do that through
personalization,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.472
editorial content, and
a new games destination.

00:16:39.472 --> 00:16:40.930
So if we've done
our job right, you

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:44.470
land on a store
listing page like this.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.090
And you have one last step.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.290
You have to click Install.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.700
And then you have to wait.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.745
And as APK size gets larger,
you have to wait longer.

00:16:54.745 --> 00:16:57.120
And then if you haven't done
something else at this point

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.661
and gone out and
done something else,

00:16:58.661 --> 00:17:01.350
you have to come
back and hit Open.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:05.369
At I/O last year, we
talked about instant apps--

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.160
bringing instant to all apps.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.490
And we now are bringing the
same technology to Games.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:14.250
We call it Google Play Instant.

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:14.970
Roll the video.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.458
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:16.458 --> 00:17:19.434
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.290
- Ha-ha!

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:01.594
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:01.594 --> 00:18:04.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:10.100
JONATHAN KARMEL: So welcome to
Google Play Instant, where apps

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.739
and now games can
be played instantly.

00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:14.780
And when you see that
brand, Google Play Instant,

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.730
you know exactly what
type of experience

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.290
you're about to jump into.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.647
And on the Play Store, it
looks like a Try Now button.

00:18:21.647 --> 00:18:22.980
And you see it here on the left.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.300
And when you click it, you
jump in a native experience.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:30.320
This is the same code as you
have in your installed game.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.500
And the user has an option
to install while they're

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.420
in that instant experience.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.670
And developers have been
trying a few different things.

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.310
Some do a whole level--

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.710
first level of their game.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.860
Some do the training
level and due two battles

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.450
like "Clash Royale" does.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.850
And some do just
smaller experiences.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.890
The choice is up to
you as a developer.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.800
Now, we've been running
live experiments

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.940
since December with "Clash"
and for a few other partners.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.370
Some have launched
this morning, and some

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:03.330
have launched a few weeks ago.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.360
So this live testing,
we have some early data

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.007
that we wanted to
share with you.

00:19:07.007 --> 00:19:08.840
And so what we're seeing
from the Play Store

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:12.770
is 4% to 19% increase
in new players.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.100
Those are new installations
that are incremental to what

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.870
was happening previously.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.780
So let me try to walk you
through how that's actually

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.977
happening.

00:19:22.977 --> 00:19:24.810
So let's go to the old
world, where you just

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:25.800
have an Install button.

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:26.370
What happens?

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.670
Let's say this whole audience
goes to the store listing page.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.730
Now, let's say this
part of the audience,

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.170
you all are going
to hit Install.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.330
Now, this part of the
audience, you guys

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.800
have a fear of commitment.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.764
You're not ready to put
that 98 megs on your phone,

00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:43.180
or maybe you just
don't understand

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:45.430
what it is because
it's an app icon

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.790
or the video didn't explain
exactly what the experience is.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:53.590
So this part of the room,
you are going to abandon.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.250
Now we have a new option.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.272
And what do we see?

00:19:56.272 --> 00:19:58.730
This part of the room, if you
were going to install before,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.340
you're continuing to install.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.440
There is a big bold
install button,

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.880
and that's what you came to do.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.965
And you're going to
continue to do that.

00:20:05.965 --> 00:20:08.090
We haven't seen even a
change in click-through rate

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:09.710
for install buttons.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.246
This side of the room,
the fear of commitment.

00:20:12.246 --> 00:20:13.370
You guys have a new option.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:16.690
You have a dating option,
a first date button.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.600
And that allows you
to try out the game

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.270
and then see if
you want to commit.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:27.120
So what we're seeing
is a 25% increase

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.950
in clicks on this page.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.260
Again, all of you are
continuing to install.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.030
And now we're
getting an increase

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.600
in clicks on the page because
of our fear of commitment

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.490
group over here.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.250
And have we changed
your commitment fears?

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.400
Absolutely.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.250
30% of you that land in
the Instant experience

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:49.020
are now installing,
which is awesome.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.450
We were really happy
with these results.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:56.990
But at I/O last year, you never
heard me talk about Play Store.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.660
We actually didn't even have
a Try Now button for apps

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:01.310
until October.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:04.400
The real opportunity has always
been outside the Play Store.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.060
So we're really excited about
the 4% to 19% early data.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.220
But the real
opportunity we believe

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.340
is outside the Play Store, so
let's walk you through that.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.260
First is ads.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.630
The old world--
you click on an ad.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.980
You land in a Play Store listing
page with an option to install.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.830
The new world--
you click on an ad.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.470
You land in an instant
experience with an option

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.790
to install.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:31.590
In both experiences, you
have an option to install,

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.950
you're just now getting
to play and evaluate

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:38.830
the game as you determine
if you want to install.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:40.960
Mark talked about the update
to the Play Games app.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.280
So you have this
great pre-roll video.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.831
And it's like a really
immersive experience.

00:21:45.831 --> 00:21:46.330
Guess what.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.650
You scroll up, and you see an
Instant game play collection

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:53.020
that you get to launch instant
experiences right from the Play

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.710
Games app.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.530
So it's a great
discovery engine.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.920
The third one I'm most excited
about, which is social invite.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.630
So Ben Frenkel is
about to come up here.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.750
He's going to do a deep dive
into Google Play Instant.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.310
But he loves games.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.080
He loves playing "Clash Royale."

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.610
And before I played, he would
email me and text me constantly

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:15.260
to join his clan.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:16.730
I had no idea what this meant.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.020
It was quite annoying.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.690
And so I would
sometimes click the URL.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:22.460
I would go to the
website for Supercell,

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.001
which would tell me to go to
the Play store, which would then

00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:26.090
tell me to install.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.710
And by the time I got
there, I forgot why I'd even

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.710
clicked here originally.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.210
I lost context.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.880
But now I click
that URL, and I'm

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.830
playing the Instant experience.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:39.080
And I'm like, oh, that's
what it means to join a clan.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:39.579
I get it.

00:22:39.579 --> 00:22:41.420
I install, and I
immediately join the clan

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.080
because the context continues
with that experience.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.830
And Supercell is actually seeing
a shift in their installs,

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:51.530
more coming from social
invite, because the value

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.310
proposition of the user
is that much higher.

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:58.270
And finally, the Play Store,
which I've already touched on.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:00.100
But I just wanted to
highlight this again,

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.910
because now if you go to the
Home tab of the Play Store,

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.740
you will see the Instant
game play collection.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:09.580
You can actually play all
our instant apps today.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.190
So you should go out and
try it in your break, when

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.446
you actually have Wi-Fi.

00:23:13.446 --> 00:23:15.820
And you can see all the live
partners that we have today.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.529
So shifting to the
developer side,

00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:23.320
I just want to talk a
little bit about what

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.600
we've been up to since
I/O. The first thing

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.840
is we made sure we were
backward compatible to Android

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.300
L on a billion devices.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.002
At I/O, we were about 150
million devices or so.

00:23:35.002 --> 00:23:36.460
So that's been a
big effort to make

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.660
sure you can reach all
your users on Instant.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.726
The second thing was
full native support

00:23:41.726 --> 00:23:43.350
to make sure that
Instant experience is

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.820
identical to the installed game.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.180
Now, our effort today is
to try to get instant apps

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.430
into every developer's
hands, make sure

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.196
that anyone can
develop an instant app.

00:23:54.196 --> 00:23:55.820
So that's kind of
been an early program

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.010
that we kicked off
end of last year.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.160
Step one was to make sure
this is technically viable.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.300
We weren't even sure
if it was possible.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.790
So we had a closed beta.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:06.410
We brought in game developers.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.670
And it's very much possible.

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:10.550
They proved it to us, and we
were really surprised how many

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:13.790
developers were able to develop
an instant app in a relatively

00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:14.760
short period of time.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.460
So check, it's
technically feasible.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:20.030
You can go from your 100-meg
app to 4 megs or 8 megs.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.600
Second, does this actually
cause business uplift

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.100
for our developers?

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.752
And the early data
is a strong check.

00:24:27.752 --> 00:24:29.210
We see it in the
Play Store, and we

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.169
think the opportunity's
outside the Play Store.

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:33.459
So that's why we're announcing
today, because we really

00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:35.720
think that this is a huge
opportunity for our game

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.650
developers.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.620
The next step is to make sure
that any developer can develop

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.110
an instant app, and that's
going to take a little more work

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.840
from us.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.840
And also, we're going to
talk about partnerships

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.110
we have with Unity and IDE
support in our next talk

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.890
with Ben.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.589
And he'll dive
into what it takes

00:24:50.589 --> 00:24:52.130
for us to get to
general availability

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.800
in the next few months.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.320
With that, I want to
thank all our partners.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.980
Please give them
around of applause.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.270
We really couldn't be here
talking about Google Play

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:10.440
Instant today without them.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.690
They've been a huge help
in getting the technology

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.890
to where it is today.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:19.980
And with that, we're going to
shift to the agenda of the day.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.000
Back to the agenda.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.875
Don't worry, we're coming
back to Google Play

00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:23.822
Instant in a second.

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:25.530
So we're going to kick
off the Innovation

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.680
in New Platforms and the
sessions for that theme

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.520
right now.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.250
With that, I'm going to
invite Ben Frenkel, who's

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.700
leading the game effort
for Google Play Instant.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.540
And he's going to do a deep
dive into Google Play Instant.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.476
Thank you.

00:25:38.476 --> 00:25:41.452
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:43.377 --> 00:25:45.460
BEN FRENKEL: Thanks, Jon,
for inviting me up here.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.270
I'm excited.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:47.846
But you know what?

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:49.470
I wonder if we could
look at that slide

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.250
again with all the
partners for a second?

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.166
JONATHAN KARMEL: Sure.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:58.790
BEN FRENKEL: I think
there's a name missing here.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.570
JONATHAN KARMEL:
Who would that be?

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:02.080
BEN FRENKEL: Limbic
is not on here.

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.913
JONATHAN KARMEL: Oh.

00:26:02.913 --> 00:26:05.390
Well, this is our partners
that have launched.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.440
Limbic, I believe, started
developing a week ago.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.449
And they're trying to
do an AR game, which

00:26:10.449 --> 00:26:12.740
I don't think is going to be
possible for instant apps.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.470
It just can't get to that size.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.327
So thank you, Limbic,
for all your effort.

00:26:16.327 --> 00:26:18.160
But we're not ready to
put them on the side.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.860
BEN FRENKEL: Well, it's actually
up on the store already.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.180
So--

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.704
JONATHAN KARMEL: Well,
then prove that it works.

00:26:24.704 --> 00:26:25.870
BEN FRENKEL: I will do that.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:26.878
All right.

00:26:26.878 --> 00:26:28.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.750
Now all the pressure's on me.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:34.163
So can we switch to la demo?

00:26:36.881 --> 00:26:38.510
Demo, go.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.212
All right.

00:26:39.212 --> 00:26:39.920
Can you see this?

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.010
All right, good.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:41.990
Phew.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.370
Demos are always stressful.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.420
OK.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:49.960
So this is "Zombie
Gunship Revenant"

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.540
from game developer Limbic.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.922
And it's an AR game.

00:26:54.922 --> 00:26:56.380
So the first step
here is I'm going

00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:01.330
to open up this infrared camera
and take a look at the audience

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.000
here.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.790
I'm not seeing a
lot of faces, but it

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.040
does make it look
like I'm already

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:09.100
surrounded by zombies a bit.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:12.790
So I've dropped
my base down here.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:14.920
Imagine I just got
here in the morning.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.500
I'm manning my
gunship helicopter.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.230
And of course, when
my shift starts,

00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:22.930
large numbers of
zombies start attacking.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:26.290
And thankfully, though, I
can control my helicopter

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.330
through movement in
augmented reality.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.320
So I can zoom in to get
up close and personal

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.400
with these zombies.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.740
And I have a bunch of
awesome weapons, too.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.380
So I've got this sniper
rifle, which allows me

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.020
to pick them off one at a time.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:43.750
And I've got these
two Gatling guns,

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.410
which allows me to mow
down large groups at once.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:51.130
But my favorite by far
is the Hellfire missile.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.350
This thing blows stuff up.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:57.250
And let me find a large group
of angry, brain-eating zombies

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:58.150
here to demonstrate.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.610
Oh.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.430
That's super gratifying.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:06.730
And also, by the way, a
great way to de-stress

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.830
after a hard day at the office.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:13.310
And so I'm doing a terrible job
defending this case, I admit.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.440
I'm not very good at this.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.880
I aspire to be better.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.190
It's not there yet.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:20.054
But there's a lot going on here.

00:28:20.054 --> 00:28:21.220
There's a lot going on here.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:24.850
This game was built
entirely in native code.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:28.390
It's built on ARCore, which
you'll be hearing about a lot

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:28.890
today.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.530
And it loads up instantly.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:38.350
And yep, I've just lost my base.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.300
Typical.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.766
All right.

00:28:41.766 --> 00:28:44.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.980
And what was
particularly impressive

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:56.400
for me at least was that Limbic
built their Google Play Instant

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:02.980
version of "Zombie
Gunship" in just one week.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:06.010
At least, I was impressed.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:10.620
And hopefully that's
given you a taste,

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.980
a taste of what's possible
with Google Play Instant.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:20.550
So Jon gave you a great
overview of Google Play Instant.

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.870
And what I want to do now is
first take a step back and give

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.890
you a sense of our overall
vision for Google Play Instant

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.040
and then dive a little deeper
into what our early access

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:37.440
partners are doing and how
they're succeeding and building

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.160
instant apps.

00:29:42.192 --> 00:29:43.650
And there are three
things I really

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:46.520
want you to take away
from my talk today.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.500
So the first is
Google Play Instant

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.860
will transform game discovery.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.580
Two, that top developers
are already on board

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:57.870
and succeeding.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:03.490
And three, game devs large and
small can build instant apps.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.080
And it wasn't that long
ago that I was talking to--

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:16.870
actually, I forgot the
most important part,

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.890
an audience participation
moment that I had planned.

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.490
And let me just give
you some context here.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.180
So year after year,
we hear that discovery

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.760
persists as one of the biggest
challenges for game developers.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.110
And so I want to
see a show of hands.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.190
How many of you in
the audience feel

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:42.460
that discovery is still one
of your biggest problems

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.772
as the game developer?

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.350
OK, that's most of you.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:54.200
And this is a really
meaty problem to solve.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.390
And so it was one of the
reasons the opportunity to have

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:01.450
a big impact on this area
that inspired me to join

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:03.454
this team in the first place.

00:31:03.454 --> 00:31:04.870
And it wasn't that
long ago that I

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.750
was talking to Jon, who I'd
been bothering with "Clash

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.540
Royale" invites for months.

00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:14.140
And he started to
lay out the story

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.360
for bringing Instant
Apps to Games.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.160
And as he was doing
that, it really

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.660
clicked for me, that by
bringing instant apps to games,

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.550
we have the opportunity to
transform game discovery.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.520
And we know that
this is possible

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.560
because, in fact, we've
seen this movie before.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.060
Whenever media becomes
instant, consumption goes up.

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.390
Speed is a huge
competitive advantage.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.120
We've seen this with music
streaming and movies.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:49.350
And before that, Google proved
the transformative impact

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.200
of speed with instant search.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.050
Music is a particularly
good case study

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:58.560
on the transformative
power of instant.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.260
There's a bunch of
studies on the subject,

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.990
and they all pretty
much say the same thing.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:08.130
When music became instant,
users played more songs,

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.180
users heard more
unique genres, they

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.360
listened to more unique
artists, and ultimately they

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.470
found better matches
for their unique tastes.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:24.020
It transformed how
people discovered music.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.320
And we believe that instant
can do the same thing for you

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.490
all of you in the audience,
the game developer.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:35.280
Imagine users trying more
games, exploring more genres,

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.000
and ultimately finding more
games they love to play.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.760
That could have a transformative
impact on your business.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.700
And that promise,
that promise is

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.000
why we want to do the
same thing for Games.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.470
We want to turn playing into
the primary way people discover

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:57.850
and evaluate games.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:02.740
No longer will users solely
learn and evaluate games

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:08.170
on the basis of icons or
text or even screenshots.

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:12.700
When games are instant, it'll
just be easier to play them.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.530
And now I'd like to
show you a glimpse

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.650
at the future of game discovery
through the Play Games app.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:26.082
All right.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:34.800
So imagine that I
have about 10 minutes

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.795
to spend right now,
which I do not.

00:33:36.795 --> 00:33:38.730
But imagine for a second.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:41.770
If I had 10 minutes to spend and
I wanted to play a puzzle game

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.010
and my goal is to
head to the store--

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:47.190
or in this case, the Play Games
app-- and find a cool puzzle

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:52.590
game, play it, and enjoy it.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:53.440
That's the goal.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.420
The goal is to play the game.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.390
So we kind of know how
this would go today.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.370
So you go to a store.

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:02.970
You would go to the home page.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:06.420
You would compare
icons and titles.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.610
And maybe you'd go
through to the store

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.960
listings of a few of them.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.310
And at the end of that, you
might install one or two games.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:17.400
But instead, now we
fast-forward to the future,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.480
where you land on a collection
like this, of puzzle games.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:25.949
And you can see that there
are a number of them there.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:30.239
And instead of going
to the Play Store, when

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.420
we click one of these links,
it will launch directly

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.239
into the Instant experience.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.409
So this is "Bubble
Witch 3 Saga" from King.

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.320
It loads instantly.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.949
And in about 30
seconds here, I'm

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:48.949
going to be able to
complete this entire map.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:53.270
I have to save these glorious
owls, which are being shielded

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.610
by these powerful bubbles.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.100
And I'm able to get a sense
for what this game is like.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:03.360
I'm able to compare to games
that I've played before.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.030
And if I can aim properly,
I will finish this map.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.870
Think about that-- right into
the game play experience.

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:17.310
And what's particularly
powerful about this

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.770
is that I can do this again.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.440
So I'm loading up another game.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.830
This is "Panda
Pop" from Jam City.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.000
It's built with Unity.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.690
And again, jump right into
the gameplay experience.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.760
And now I have a
good reference point.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.340
So I'm looking for an
awesome puzzle game.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:39.150
I kind of know that I want
to play something like this,

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:42.870
but this is definitely a
really great way for me

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:46.410
to understand what I
like about the game,

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:50.862
understand whether or not it's
worth ultimately installing it.

00:35:50.862 --> 00:35:53.070
And it takes about another
30 seconds to finish this.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:56.700
So for the purposes
of brevity, I

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.890
won't go all the way through it.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.330
But the point is is that
if I had 10 minutes,

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:07.680
I could have played
10 games or more.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.890
And because it's instant,
because it's using Google Play

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.220
Instant technology, I don't
have to then go back and remove

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.460
10 games after the fact.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.270
It's a great way to explore.

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:22.320
And if we can do this,
if we can do that,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.830
and we can enable that
kind of experience,

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:30.060
we'll have fundamentally changed
how people discover games.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:33.960
You're playing the game rather
than just reading about it.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.100
Let's go back to the slides.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.540
And we've been working with
an amazing set of partners

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.460
in the lead up to today.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:47.520
These partners and their games
cover the complete spectrum.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.880
So we know that whether
you're a giant publisher

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.570
or an indie studio; whether
your games are huge,

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:57.770
hundreds of megabytes, or
small; Google Play instant

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:01.120
will work for you.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.390
And when you build
an instant app,

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.339
it will be accessible
from almost anywhere.

00:37:06.339 --> 00:37:08.880
And now I'm going to talk to
you about the discovery services

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.070
that Play and
Google can provide.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.590
You can look at them
as a bundle of services

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:18.090
that are unlocked by
building an instant app.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.190
So there's Try
Now on the store--

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:24.940
it's very popular-- which Jon
walked you through earlier.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:27.520
And Jon already showed
you what a big brand

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.250
like Supercell with "Clash
Royale" can accomplish.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.340
And based on
Supercell's experience,

00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.040
they're excited about making
their games accessible

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.800
and introducing them
to a wider audience

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.040
through Google Play Instant.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.990
So we know the impact is there
for the biggest publishers.

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:53.240
For less established
brands, the impact

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.680
can be even more profound.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.690
"Mighty Battles"
from Hothead Games

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:04.210
has seen a 2x uplift on
click-throughs on their store

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:08.480
listing, attracting a whole
set of new users to their game.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.270
So just to carry
Jon's analogy forward,

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.550
imagine if this half of the
audience was installing.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.310
And before, this
half of the audience,

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.260
the ones with
commitment problems,

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.790
were doing nothing, abandoning.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.000
In the world of "Mighty
Battles" with Try

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.210
Now, this half of the
room, still installing.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.530
So that's good.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:33.860
This half of the room,
everybody is clicking Try Now.

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:35.800
Everybody is clicking Try Now.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.380
That is transformative to them.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.500
And our preliminary data
shows that the inside app

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.670
drove a 19% uplift in user
acquisitions for them.

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:49.670
It exceeded their expectations.

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:52.130
And here is what their director
of marketing, Oliver Birch,

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:52.630
said.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.920
So Hothead Games is
excited about the results

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.680
and are looking
to expand instant

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.140
to the rest of their
portfolio of games.

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.180
In fact, they've
already started working

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.170
on their next instant
app for "Hero Hunters."

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.000
And to be clear,
everything I just said

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.370
is about the Try
Now button alone.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:15.650
But there's more.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:20.520
Soon, coming to the store will
be instant-enable banners.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.490
So when users click
the banner, they

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:25.640
will be directly launched
into the instant experience.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.760
Picture something like this
being the first experience

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.130
a user has with your game--

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.950
being able to become
instantly immersed

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.740
in the heart of battle.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:40.280
We'll also have an
evergreen-curated collection

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:44.060
of the best instant experiences,
providing another way

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.830
to get your games discovered.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:51.100
Our partners also see ads
as a great application

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:52.450
of the instant format.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.850
In fact, most of
our largest partners

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.060
are particularly
excited about this one.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.560
And that's why I'm happy to say
that we're already exploring

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.520
ways to bring instant apps
to AdWords and Universal App

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.070
Campaigns, or UAC for short.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:07.630
And in the coming
months, once you've

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.970
created an instant
experience for your game,

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:13.480
UAC can start
automatically driving users

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.144
to it from its ads.

00:40:15.144 --> 00:40:17.560
Belinda from our ad team will
actually be up here a little

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.930
bit later to talk to you more
about innovations in the ads

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.050
team.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.660
And then there is Google Search.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:27.276
You might have heard of it.

00:40:27.276 --> 00:40:28.650
And in the near
future, you'll be

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:32.090
able to search for a game
like "Words With Friends 2"

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.600
and launch the instant
experience directly

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.360
from the search results.

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.610
And as you've already
seen, the Play Games app

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.930
provides a sneak
peek at the future

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:48.090
where playing becomes the
way users discover, evaluate,

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.800
and compare games.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.180
So that covers all the
Play and Google discovery

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:59.260
services you unlock just
by building an instant app.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.760
But the store and Google
properties are just the start.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.490
I think Bernard Kim, Zynga's
president of studios,

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:09.180
captures this perfectly
here with this quote.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.240
The opportunity goes
well beyond the store

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.700
to the multitude
of new entry points

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.380
Google Play Instant
makes possible.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.760
And when you put cool technology
in the hands of a partner

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.100
like Zynga's, great
things happen.

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.950
New, exciting ideas are formed.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.240
Ideas like social invites,
sharing, and cross-promotion

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.610
are huge opportunities
that Zynga identified.

00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:36.390
So what I'm about to show
you are Zynga's explorations

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:39.180
of what's possible with
Google Play Instant.

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.950
So can we roll the video?

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:47.900
So ideas like social invites.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.570
So a friend sends you an invite
in "Words With Friends 2."

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.030
You click the invite.

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:53.719
And you're taken
right into the game,

00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:55.510
where you can complete
a turn before you're

00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.400
prompted to install.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.270
Here's a great example of
social sharing from "Farmville."

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.660
So imagine one of your friends
shares their farm with you.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:08.500
They're proud of it.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.180
They've been working
on it for a while.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.450
And when you accept the
invitation over chat,

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:16.210
you jump directly
into the game and can

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:19.930
start engaging with your
friend's farm right away.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:21.700
Not the Play Store listing.

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.690
Not a web page.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.210
You jump right into
the experience.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:32.050
And cross-promotion is
another great use for instant.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.660
So imagine you just completed
a battle in "Dawn of Titans"

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.850
and you clicked through
the cross-promotion link

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:38.070
to "CSR 2."

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:41.617
And we're instantly transported
into a race like this.

00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:46.630
It's visceral.

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.190
You get to experience the game.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.160
And you don't have
to wait, because it's

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.390
instant, of course.

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.650
And that's the promise
of instant apps.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:00.430
So let me stop
there for a second.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:03.010
That was a lot to absorb.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.460
So to recap, we just covered,
one, Play services including

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:11.950
Try Now, banners, collections,
and the Play Games app; two,

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:15.370
beyond Play, we talked
about the power of ads

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:19.570
in Google Search; and three, we
covered new game entry points

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:23.980
like social invites,
sharing, and cross-promotion,

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:28.770
each benefiting from
Google Play Instant.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:32.280
Now if I've done
my job right, you

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.390
should all be excited about
the opportunity of Google Play

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.280
Instant.

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:42.590
So the logical next
question is, so how

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.890
do I build an instant app?

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.196
I'm glad you asked.

00:43:49.196 --> 00:43:50.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:53.720
The short answer is you'll be
able to build your instant app

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:58.670
the same way you build games
today and with the same tools.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:03.500
And there are three
things that we've changed.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.430
So first, we raised the size
limit to 10 megabytes just

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:08.750
for games.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.670
We've enabled the
progressive download

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:15.320
of executable code and assets
with a split install API.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.990
And very importantly,
we've added full support

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:22.070
for native code and are
integrating with game engines.

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:25.230
And there are two key reasons
why we made these changes.

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:27.920
First, games are just bigger.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.580
On average, games are over
twice the size of apps.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.830
And we've increased the
size limit to 10 megabytes

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:37.370
because the
expectations of players

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:40.550
are different for
apps and games.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:43.760
And progressive download
gets users into games faster

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.980
because you don't have to
download the whole thing

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.550
at once anymore.

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:52.930
And second, most games today are
either built with a game engine

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:58.610
like Unity or Cocos
or native code.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.610
So what we've done is
enable game developers

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:03.820
to use the tools they're
already comfortable with

00:45:03.820 --> 00:45:07.170
to build instant apps.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.960
And this is vitally important,
as this quote from Playtika

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.970
illustrates above,
because it means

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:16.410
that you can use the same
codebase as your full game

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:19.250
to build your instant app.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:23.170
You can build from
your same codebase.

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:26.590
That's incredibly powerful.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:30.450
And to make that possible
for Unity developers,

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:32.860
to be honest, probably most
of you in the audience,

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:35.980
we have to work closely with the
world's most widely used game

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.300
engine, Unity.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:41.004
More than 60% of mobile games
on Play are made with Unity,

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:42.670
and we're excited to
announce that we're

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:46.700
partnering with Unity to
support Google Play Instant.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.820
And through this
close collaboration,

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:50.350
millions of Unity
developers will

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:53.290
be able to optimize their
current and future games

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:56.340
for Google Play Instant.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.220
We're also excited to
announce that Cocos

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:03.930
is adding instant support
to their IDE Cocos creator.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:07.080
But they're going beyond just
adding support in the IDE.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.550
They're getting
tools to simplify

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:13.650
the process of trimming down
the game into instant form.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:15.180
And we have a treat
for you today.

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:17.940
Cocos has provided a sneak
preview of their integration

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.250
with instant apps,
and it's awesome.

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.630
Can we roll this video?

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:24.460
All right.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.060
So imagine you built a
game in Cocos Creator,

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.880
and you're ready to build
your instant experience.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.730
You click Android
Instant as the platform,

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.590
and you enter in
a recording mode.

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:37.780
And what's happening
here is that, as you're

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:40.690
playing the game,
all the assets that

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:42.700
are being used in this
portion of the game

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:47.650
are tagged and time-stamped, the
portions of code that are used.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.020
And once this recording
experience is over

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.510
and you finish killing
all these zombies,

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:55.330
you then can go into
the refactor stage.

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:58.210
And the refactor stage will look
a little bit familiar to you

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:02.230
probably if you're familiar
with nonlinear editing suites.

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:05.890
So what's happened is there's
been a screen capture created

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:08.480
while you've been recording
what assets are used.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.060
So you can understand
exactly where

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.880
you are when you're
trying to understand

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.770
where this asset was used.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:17.470
And all of the assets
are clustered together.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.780
You can drill down
into each one of them,

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:21.930
and you can swap out
assets and hide them.

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:26.680
And that red bar
there determines

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.410
where the APK cutoff will be.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:33.610
So you move it to the left, all
the numbers of files go down

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.100
as well as the megabytes.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.480
And conversely, as you
move it to the right,

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.040
you're getting a bigger game.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.850
But this allows you
with pinpoint accuracy

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:45.100
to figure out what
portions of your game

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:49.000
make a great fit for
instant and greatly reduces

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.685
the skill involved that would
otherwise require refactoring.

00:47:54.685 --> 00:47:57.700
And so now you're just going
back into the regular flow--

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:02.110
build, compile, play-- which
we'll wrap up here in a second.

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:06.400
Yes.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:11.480
And fast-forward here, and
you can see the output.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:16.800
So this is just an early preview
of what they are building.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.910
And there are lots of
details still to work out.

00:48:20.910 --> 00:48:27.070
But we think this represents
a great path to easy, painless

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:28.407
instant app development.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:36.160
So to recap, I want
you to walk away

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.170
keeping these three
things in mind.

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:41.790
One, Google Play Instant will
transform game discovery.

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:46.110
Two, top developers are on
board and already succeeding.

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:54.020
And three, game devs large and
small can build instant apps

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.666
And this is just the
beginning of our journey.

00:48:56.666 --> 00:48:58.040
We're going to
continue to invest

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.430
in faster startup times,
better tools, and new discovery

00:49:01.430 --> 00:49:03.530
services.

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:07.130
But before I go, I wanted to
show you one more awesome demo,

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:08.180
just one last one.

00:49:14.872 --> 00:49:16.800
Let's see.

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.990
So this demo, in fact--

00:49:22.122 --> 00:49:24.070
I wasn't sure at the
beginning of the day

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:25.611
if we were going to
be able to do it.

00:49:25.611 --> 00:49:28.240
So I should have an
email with a link to it.

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.748
Just give me a sec here.

00:49:30.748 --> 00:49:33.550
OK.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:35.110
OK, we're ready to go.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.440
So what you're about to
see here is a demonstration

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.410
of what's possible with
Google Play Instant.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.690
This is a tech demo
that Zynga just

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.600
pulled together with "CSR 2."

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.750
So let's say that a friend just
got an awesome car like this

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:53.330
Lamborghini and wants to brag
about it, because who wouldn't?

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.290
It's a pretty awesome car.

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:58.410
They could send you a link,
just like Jake did to me.

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:01.470
And you'd be able to jump
right into this experience.

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:03.040
And it's already
a stunning model.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.850
You can open up the doors
and interact with it.

00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:08.760
But there is more.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.530
This, in fact, has
an AR mode where

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:16.260
I can place this amazing
car right here on the stage.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:20.940
I can shrink it down here,
spin it around some more,

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.470
open up the doors.

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:25.480
I can actually go and take
a seat in my dream car.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.690
Let's see if I can do that.

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:30.760
And I can look at these
most insane details.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:35.120
I don't know why they're all
there, but it's cool in AR

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.640
to be able to do this, right?

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.120
So let's take a step back.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.730
That was "CSR 2."

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:52.600
It was a game that in full
form is over a gigabyte.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:54.580
It's built on Unity.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.800
It's built on ARCore.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:02.110
So if "CSR 2" can work
for Google Play Instant,

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:03.220
any game can.

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:07.810
So that's the message I want
to leave you all with, unless I

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.220
can see the rest of my slides.

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:09.916
But--

00:51:09.916 --> 00:51:11.284
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:11.284 --> 00:51:14.020
[APPLAUSE

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:19.920
And-- oh, there we go.

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.891
Ask and you will
receive apparently.

00:51:22.891 --> 00:51:24.890
All right, so be on the
lookout out for the rest

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:27.080
of these posters around GDC.

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.710
And if you have
an Android device,

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:29.960
you can open Google Assistant.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.040
Click the camera.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:35.690
Hold it up to a QR code to play
the instant version of "Words

00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:37.020
With Friends."

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.240
So what's next?

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.730
Well, if you haven't
already, first

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.230
go check out the
Google Play Instant

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:44.150
collection on the Play Store.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:46.460
And then we're not quite
ready to open up the Games

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.680
beta to everyone just yet.

00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.962
Today, you can go check out the
case studies and documentation

00:51:51.962 --> 00:51:54.670
at g.co/instantapps.

00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:56.420
Click on the Stories
link for case studies

00:51:56.420 --> 00:51:59.540
that explain how our partners
optimize their games for Google

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.920
Play Instant.

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:06.110
And last, you can sign up at
g.co/play/instantbeta to get

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:07.400
updates on our progress.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.490
And we'll email you
with the latest news.

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:14.390
And with that, again, one last
time, thank you for your time.

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:17.740
