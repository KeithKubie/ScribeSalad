SECOND EPISODE, MAN, I MEAN THAT
WAS A LOT OF FUN LAST NIGHT.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:21.954 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:24.323 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN I COULD BARELY GET TO
SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:25.725 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WAS SO PUMPED.

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:29.062 line:91%
I CAME INTO THE OFFICE TODAY TO
GET MY THINGS AND EVERYONE WAS

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:33.566 line:91%
HERE AND I WAS LIKE, WAIT, ARE
WE DOING THIS AGAIN?  I GUESS

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.234 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THAT IS WHAT NIGHTLY MEANS.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.702 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DIDN'T KNOW.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:38.938 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE GET TO DO IT AGAIN.  THIS IS
SO MUCH FUN.

00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.106 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:44.677 line:91%
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT COSBY
AND THE HURRICANE OF HORRORS

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.480 size:81% position:41% line:85%
STILL SWIRLING AROUND HIM.

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:52.318 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW MOST, MOST RECENTLY NOTED
GIRL, LENA DUNHAM, TOOK HIM DOWN

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:55.421 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN SHE COMPARED BEING OBSESSED
WITH THE COSBY SITUATION TO

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:58.391 align:start position:0% line:91%
BEING OBSESSED WITH THE
HOLOCAUST.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:01.594 line:91%
NOW, NOW, HOLD ON, HOLD ON, TO
LENA'S CREDIT SHE DID APOLOGIZE

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:02.795 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT AWAY.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.631 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, IT WASN'T
BEFORE A SURVIVING MEMBER OF THE

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:10.069 line:91%
HITLER FAMILY, GRANDSON CHIP
HITLER RELEASED THIS STATEMENT.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:15.141 line:91%
ALL OF THE HITLERS JOIN ME IN
CONDEMNING LENA DUNHAM FOR

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:21.948 align:start position:0% line:91%
COMPARING OUR GRANDFATHER'S
ACTIONS TO THOSE OF BILL COSBY.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:26.853 size:84% position:42% line:91%
HOWEVER, WE ALL APPLAUD THE
BRAVERY OF THE ASS (BLEEP)

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.489 align:start position:0% line:85%
EPISODE OF GIRLS.

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:32.692 line:85%
&gt;&gt; CHIP HITLER'S GOT A POINT.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.428 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT CRITICISM ISN'T STOPPING
COSBY.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:37.930 align:start position:0% line:91%
COSBY HAS BEEN PERFORMING
THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA AS PART

00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:40.099 line:85%
OF HIS FAR FROM FINISHED TOUR.

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:42.335 align:start position:0% line:91%
QUICK NOTE TO BILL COSBY'S PRESS
TEAM.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:46.506 line:91%
IF YOUR CLIENT IS BEING ACCUSED
OF BRUTAL ASSAULTS ON A WEEKLY

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.776 align:start position:0% line:91%
BASIS, MAYBE DON'T SAY HE'S FAR
FROM FINISHED.

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:53.112 align:start position:0% line:85%
JUST A LITTLE TIP.

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:54.747 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOW --
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.848 size:88% position:44% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WATCH THE LANGUAGE THERE.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:02:02.321 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT?  NOW, COSBY'S
TONE-DEAF COMEDY JAM ATTRACTED

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:05.958 align:start position:0% line:91%
PEOPLE BOTH FOR AND AGAINST THE
COZ.

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:08.661 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NO MORE JOKES!  NO MORE
JOKES.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:12.265 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE PROBABLY HAS $20 BILLION
AND THEY ARE PROBABLY AFTER

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.466 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT, I AM SURE.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.602 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S FUNNY HOW ALL THESE
PEOPLE COME OUT ALL THESE YEARS

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:21.340 align:start position:0% line:91%
LATER AND THERE'S NO WITNESSES,
NOT EVEN A POLAROID.

00:02:21.373 --> 00:02:24.610 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO THIS GUY ONLY
BELIEVES THINGS IF THEY WERE

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:29.382 line:91%
SHOT ON A POLAROID?  OH, GREAT
DEPRESSION?  I DON'T THINK SO.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:33.686 line:91%
WHERE'S THE POLAROID?  AND HIS
KID'S LIKE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN I

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.857 align:start position:0% line:91%
SMELL LIKE WEED, DAD?  WHERE'S
THE INSTAGRAM.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.292 line:85%
LIKE THE WORST QUESTION EVER.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.461 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BETTER QUESTION IS WHY
AREN'T PEOPLE LISTENING

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:45.665 line:91%
TO THESE WOMEN?  BECAUSE MOST OF
THIS ALLEGEDLY HAPPENED SO LONG

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:51.070 align:start position:0% line:91%
AGO?  IS IT BECAUSE SOME OF THEM
WENT TO COSBY'S HOTEL ROOM

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:52.905 line:91%
ALONE? IS IT BECAUSE THERE ARE
NO POLAROIDS?  IS IT BECAUSE

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:55.808 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE IS SO FAMOUS OR JUST
BECAUSE THEY

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.910 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE WOMEN?  BECAUSE I WOULD SAY
ENOUGH HAVE COME FORWARD.

00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:05.685 line:91%
I MEAN THE CURRENT TALLY STANDS
-- THE CURRENT TALLY STANDS AT

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.253 align:start position:0% line:85%
35 WOMEN.

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.154 align:start position:0% line:85%
REALLY, FOLKS.

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:11.023 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW MANY MORE DO WE NEED?  35
ALLEGATIONS.

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:12.325 line:85%
LET'S UNDERSTAND THIS NUMBER.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:15.928 line:91%
OKAY?  THAT'S LIKE IF BILL COSBY
DRUGGED AND RAPED EVERY SINGLE

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:20.533 align:start position:0% line:91%
U.S. PRESIDENT FROM GEORGE
WASHINGTON TO JOHN F. KENNEDY.

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:25.238 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; DUDE.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:33.512 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT GROVER CLEVELAND WAS ASKING
FOR IT, YOUR HONOR.

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:34.379 align:start position:0% line:85%
BAH.

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:35.547 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW HE WAS
DRESSED.

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:44.657 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITH THE TWIRLY MUSTACHE AND THE
18 NINETIES BAH, BAH, BAH.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.597 line:91%
I JUST REALIZED GROVER CLEVELAND
ACTUALLY HAD TWO NONCONSECUTIVE

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.405 align:start position:0% line:91%
TERMS SO BILL COSBY WOULD HAVE
HAD TO DO IT TWICE.

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:03.643 line:91%
&gt;&gt; NOW TO BE FAIR, NOW TO BE
FAIR, THE NUMBER IS CHANGING SO

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.878 align:start position:0% line:91%
QUICKLY THAT THERE ARE
CONFLICTING REPORTS ON WHETHER

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:10.650 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE TOTAL REALLY IS 34 OR 35,
BUT IF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 34

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:16.922 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AND 35 WOMEN MATTERS TO YOU
PLEASE (BLEEP) OFF FOREVER.

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:17.990 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; REALLY.

00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:22.461 align:start position:0% line:91%
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
&gt;&gt; Larry: AND, LOOK, GUYS, I

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:25.965 align:start position:0% line:91%
KNOW EVERYONE IS PILING ON
COSBY, INCLUDING ME BUT I WILL

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:31.404 align:start position:0% line:91%
TELL YOU WHAT, JUST THINK IF
COSBY DIDN'T DO IT.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:31.771 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.706 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE ARE DONE.

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:37.476 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S ALL WE NEEDED. 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
LOOK, WHAT I AM SAYING IS
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER COSBY WAS

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.883 line:91%
INNOCENT OR GUILTY IT SEEMS LIKE
IT IS IN POOR TASTE FOR HIM TO

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:46.952 line:91%
CONTINUE HIS COMEDY TOUR, THE
WORST PLACE TO ADDRESS THESE

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:50.156 line:91%
ALLEGATIONS IS FROM A STAGE LOOK
AT WHAT HAPPENED RECENTLY IN A

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.259 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHOW IN CANADA.

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:54.760 align:start position:0% line:85%
STOP IT, STOP IT.

00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:56.462 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S RIGHT.

HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW COSBY
COULD HANDLE THE SITUATION

BETTER IS PROFESSIONAL COMEDIAN
AND NIGHTLY SHOW CONTRIBUTOR

00:05:22.988 --> 00:05:26.292 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; Larry: NO PROBLEM.

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.163 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO MIKE IS COSBY OUT OF LINE
HERE?

00:05:31.196 --> 00:05:32.298 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY, LARRY.

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.868 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT IS NOT HOW YOU HANDLE A
HECKLER AT ALL.

THAT IS THE PART OF THE STORY
THAT IS RUBBING YOU THE WRONG

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.708 align:start position:0% line:85%
WAY?

00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:45.711 align:start position:0% line:91%

&gt;&gt; LARRY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HE WAS BEING HECKLED IN CANADA

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:03.662 line:91%

WELL IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL FOCUS
ON THIS, SO WHAT SHOULD HE HAVE

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:16.742 align:start position:0% line:85%
DONE.

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:19.078 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT IS REALLY SIMPLE, LARRY,
SOMEONE DISRUPTS YOU SHOW YOU

00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:21.947 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE TO REFOCUS THEM AND YOU
WANT THE AUDIENCE TO THINK ABOUT

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.751 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOUR JOKES, NOT YOUR CRIMES, GO
AHEAD, HECKLE ME, CALL ME A

THAT IS THE SECOND NIGHT OF
SHOW.

00:06:32.624 --> 00:06:33.759 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.728 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU'RE A RAPIST.

EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THIS WORKS.

&gt;&gt; SORRY.

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:55.114 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS
WHEN YOU ARE HANDLING A HECK HER

00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:59.084 line:91%
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT TACTICS
YOU CAN TRY, ONE OF MY FAVORITES

00:06:59.117 --> 00:07:01.053 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS ACT LIKE HE SAID SOMETHING
ELSE.

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:03.456 align:start position:0% line:85%
