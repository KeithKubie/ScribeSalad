LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.170
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.039
worked on every single day.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.940
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.250
what it would be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.830
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.240
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.420
and why they do it.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.340
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:24.990
Welcome to "Coffee
With a Googler."

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.220
I'm Laurence
Moroney, and I'm here

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.620
today in New York
City, where I'm

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.320
meeting with Ray Tsang
from the cloud team.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.920
Now Ray, you've been working
on this awesome project called

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.400
Cloud Spin, which is effectively
using a bunch of Android phones

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.460
and building bullet
time from the matrix.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.870
Could you tell us all about it?

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.760
RAY TSANG: Sure, yeah,
so a team of four

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.200
us, we built these bullet
time demo called Cloud Spin.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.670
It was actually
designed in built

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.426
for our event series called
the Google Cloud Platform Next.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:52.800
And we actually
toured the world.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.580
We went to a bunch
of different cities,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.560
and we took this
experience to there

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.680
so that people can
actually experience

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.610
what Google Cloud can do.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.180
So built this demo that used
many of the Google Cloud

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.770
technology that will take a
photo from 19 different Android

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.850
phones, and at exactly
the same moment of you

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.661
jumping in midair.

00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:16.160
And then we can
stitch them together

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.280
in the Google Cloud
Platform and to form

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.992
this 180-degrees spinning photo.

00:01:19.992 --> 00:01:22.200
LAURENCE MORONEY: So it's
like an animated GIF of all

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.430
these pictures put together?

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.846
RAY TSANG: Yeah,
so eventually, we

00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:27.750
produce this animated GIF
that gets posted on Twitter,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.695
or it gets sent through
email to the audience.

00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:31.070
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Cool, so now we

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.970
actually went to where you
built the prototype of this,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.136
and we filmed a video of it.

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.870
So why don't we
run that video now.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.270
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.500
-Hi, I'm Brett McGowen, and
I'm a developer advocate

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.160
for the Google Cloud Platform.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.230
One of our goals
of this project was

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.820
to use all off-the-shelf
hardware and open source

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.530
software so that anyone
could create their own cloud

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.380
spin set up.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.900
The hardware in this room
consists of 18 camera tripods.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.400
On top of these camera tripods,
we have special adapters

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.160
to hold our Nexus 6 cameras.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.990
We position all of
the cameras eight feet

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.073
from the center point,
where the user is standing.

00:02:02.073 --> 00:02:04.110
This lets the user jump
up as high as they can

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.550
and still remain on screen.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.270
Once we've got all the
cameras set up and plugged in,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.300
we need to align them.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.450
We do this by taking
a marker pole,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.010
marking it two places with
tape, and setting it where

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.170
the user is going to stand.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.840
Then on the back
of the camera we've

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.370
got cross hairs that we can
use to align to the two points

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.530
on the marker pole.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.530
This lets us align the view
in multiple dimensions.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.520
Once the cameras are all
aligned, we need a volunteer.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.070
Hi, would you like to sign
up for a Cloud Spin video?

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.028
-Sure, sounds good-- so
name, I put my email address

00:02:35.028 --> 00:02:37.092
and on my Twitter.

00:02:37.092 --> 00:02:39.050
Oh, cool, so you can post
it to Twitter for me.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.770
-Exactly.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.230
-And I'll be good, I agree
to the terms of service,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.220
and sign up.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.890
-Perfect.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.820
Using Firebase, the sign-up
app will send his registration

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.240
information to our control app.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.380
Out control app uses
Firebase to show

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.440
the status of every phone that's
connected to the Cloud Spin

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.940
system.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.290
We'll also use our control app
to push out different settings

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.290
to the phone, such as
exposure or shutter speed,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.520
so that as we get into
different lighting conditions,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.630
we can control those
settings in one place

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.900
and have all the cameras
automatically update.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.900
Now that we're ready,
we'll hit Start Countdown.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.390
So this will send a time
stamp to all the phones

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.250
so that they know the exact
moment, eight seconds from now,

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.760
when to be recording video.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.120
The control app has a
button called Take Photo.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.220
When we press this,
a beep is sent out

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.370
through the audio jack
of the control tablet

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.200
and is split 18 ways to go into
the headset jack of each phone.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.180
This will mark the frame at
the exact same moment of time

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.170
across all the cameras.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.220
Once each camera is finished
recording its video,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.130
it'll upload it to
Google Cloud Storage.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.640
So we can process in the
cloud, extract all the frames,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.100
stitch it together, and
create our final animation.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.770
All right, step into the center,
and I'll get out of the way.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.600
One, two, three, go.

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:55.060
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.147
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow, that's
a lot of equipment in that.

00:03:58.147 --> 00:03:59.730
It seems like a lot
of fun to do that.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:00.800
RAY TSANG: It was
definitely fun.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.110
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So how long did it

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.359
take you to put that together?

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.800
RAY TSANG: So we actually
only had about three weeks

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.801
for all the development.

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:06.716
LAURENCE MORONEY: Wow.

00:04:06.716 --> 00:04:08.480
RAY TSANG: Yeah, it
was a very short time.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.080
LAURENCE MORONEY:
With all the stuff

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.220
that you were doing
in your prototyping,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.270
there must have been a whole
lot of things went wrong, right?

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.920
RAY TSANG: Yeah, so, I mean,
having three weeks itself,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.709
it's pretty difficult
to deal with.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.130
We also had Google I/O in
between, and not to mention,

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.160
but a couple of my teammates
actually were on vacation

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.100
for like a week, so.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.160
LAURENCE MORONEY: They left
you to do all the work?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.470
RAY TSANG: Well, not
all the work, yeah.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.370
And like when we
built the prototype,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.470
we had to use many of
off-the-shelf components,

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.880
and we thought we would
build this thing as scrappy

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.736
as we can, so that rather than
using a tripod that you saw

00:04:38.736 --> 00:04:41.260
in the video, we started
off with other ideas,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.174
like we wanted to
use selfie sticks.

00:04:43.174 --> 00:04:44.590
So, I mean, you
can imagine people

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.756
holding up selfie sticks,
and forming like a circle.

00:04:46.756 --> 00:04:49.190
LAURENCE MORONEY: So 19
Googlers all holding one up?

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.280
RAY TSANG: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.221
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Expensive project.

00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:54.470
RAY TSANG: More expensive
than the tripods, of course.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.350
But by then, of
course, we wouldn't

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.500
have people holding it.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.270
We wanted to sit the
selfie stick on the ground.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.070
And as you can imagine,
the selfie stick,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.850
it's just one pole
and doesn't really

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.800
have three legs to hold like a
half-pound Nexus 6 phone, so it

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.120
was very, very wobbly.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.560
And you probably saw in the
video when you were there,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.550
we have all these
cables lying around.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.403
And it was really,
really easy to kind

00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:18.930
of trip over one of these
cables and then just pull

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.330
one of the phones down.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.246
And so we always have to
go and kind of trip over,

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:24.870
when we have to go
and fetch the phone.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.950
LAURENCE MORONEY: One
of the remarkable things

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.105
about the picture is like
it's pretty accurate where

00:05:28.105 --> 00:05:29.313
the pictures were taken from.

00:05:29.313 --> 00:05:31.230
So must have had to
measure it quite well

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.050
around a semicircle
with the same radius

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.350
to each camera's lens.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.184
How did you do that?

00:05:36.184 --> 00:05:38.599
RAY TSANG: So there are a
couple things that we have done.

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:40.250
So first of all, we
have to figure out

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.030
how far away the camera needs
to be from the center point

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.140
so that we can actually
capture the person jumping.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.980
Because if you're
too close, the head

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.485
will be cut off in the video.

00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:52.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: You don't
want that, only in the video,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.410
though, right.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.868
RAY TSANG: Only in
the video, yeah,

00:05:54.868 --> 00:05:57.980
but then we had to measure
how far the camera needs to be

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.800
far away from the center point.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.510
And initially, we
actually couldn't

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.980
find a measuring tape
in the Google office

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.610
at all to do the measurement.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.870
And for some reason, Brett
actually found caution tapes

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:10.570
around my desk.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.611
Now, I don't know why I
have those police caution

00:06:12.611 --> 00:06:14.937
tapes around my desk,
but so he found it,

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:16.520
and then we measured
it with cautions.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.232
And I think he said that we
need to be eight cautions away.

00:06:20.232 --> 00:06:21.940
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
eight cautions away,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.950
that's the management, OK.

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:24.330
BRETT MCGOWEN: Yeah,
but eventually we

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.720
found like real measuring tapes,
and then we measured it out.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.770
LAURENCE MORONEY: So was
eight cautions accurate?

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.190
RAY TSANG: It was
about eight feet.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Now, one
of the things I noticed,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.555
and what Brett was talking
about in the video,

00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:35.013
is you didn't
actually take photos.

00:06:35.013 --> 00:06:36.296
You took videos.

00:06:36.296 --> 00:06:37.670
I know like a
video obviously has

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.544
a number frames, like,
24, 30 frames a second

00:06:39.544 --> 00:06:40.319
or whatever it is.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:42.610
So you have to pick out the
right frame from the video.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.830
And he said you had
an audio cue for that,

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.760
so will you tell us
a little about that?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:51.270
RAY TSANG: Sure, so first
of all, taking the photo

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.580
from each of the phones is
going to be very difficult

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.620
if we want to take the
photo all at exactly

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.210
the same time because
there is this random delay

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.550
in the hardware.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.256
So when you want to take
the photo from the phone,

00:07:02.256 --> 00:07:03.630
you just don't
know how much time

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.824
is going to wait before the
photo's actually being taken.

00:07:06.824 --> 00:07:08.240
And if we have
these random delays

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.630
from all of the 19 phones, then
we will be taking photos of you

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.610
jumping in midair, or
where you landed already.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.080
LAURENCE MORONEY: They
won't be synchronized.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.330
RAY TSANG: Yeah, exactly.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.540
So rather than doing that,
we recorded the video.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.680
And to synchronize all of them
together, we used audio cue.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.980
So I as the videos are rlling,
and when you're in the midair,

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.560
we generate a tone,
an audio tone,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.230
that gets fed into
all of the devices.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.110
And, oh, by the way, we
actually thought about doing--

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.360
LAURENCE MORONEY: It's the
Flying Spaghetti monster.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.740
RAY TSANG: Or
whatever, yeah-- so it

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.560
was very difficult to actually
feed audio signal from, say,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.040
the tablet that's generating
the tone into the 19 devices.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.500
So now an audio
engineer actually

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.550
drew a schema, how
to actually build

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.960
a device that can help us
split the audio signal.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.990
And another difficult
thing to do this

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.290
is that when you plug in the
audio line, the audio cable,

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.300
the device has to be able to
recognize that this is a mic.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.560
So to do that, we
built this device where

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.230
the audio kind of
comes in one way,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.064
and then we split it
into 19 different ways.

00:08:12.064 --> 00:08:13.146
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, fun.

00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:15.480
RAY TSANG: Yeah, and we
got like these resistors

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.210
and whatever that kind of
generates the right resistance

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.210
so that the mic is being
picked up by the phone.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.084
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
resistance isn't futile?

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:25.010
RAY TSANG: Yeah,
but unfortunately,

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.070
it is futile because this device
unfortunately didn't work.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.832
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh.

00:08:29.832 --> 00:08:32.770
RAY TSANG: Yeah, so rather doing
that, we actually just went

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.440
out and bought off-the-shelf
components that can help

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.064
us split the singnal.

00:08:37.064 --> 00:08:38.480
LAURENCE MORONEY:
OK, sounds good.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.146
Now, one of the things
I noticed as well

00:08:40.146 --> 00:08:41.741
is that like all
these phones, they

00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:43.990
have to be synchronized in
when they start this video.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.620
So they had to be
remote controlled,

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.470
and I hear you had a
really fun, innovative way

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.050
of using Firebase to do that.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.060
BRETT MCGOWEN: Right,
so rather than, say,

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.680
building our own server
and sending our own network

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.330
signal to all of the
devices-- remember,

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.920
we only had about three weeks.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.790
And you do something
custom to send the single

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.470
to all these devices, it's
going to take us a lot of time.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.550
So rather than doing
that, we used Firebase.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.800
And the way that we have used it
is to send out from the tablet

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.340
when you press the button
to start the countdown,

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.170
we actually write
the timestamp of when

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.210
the video should be starting
to recording into Firebase.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.190
And then Firebase then
can synchronize the data

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.560
to all of the 19
different devices.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.050
So every single device,
every single Android phone

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:33.030
at this moment, they receive
a signal from Firebase

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.710
with the timestamp of when the
video should start rolling,

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.330
and all the devices then
will start recording

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.319
the video at about
the same time.

00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:43.110
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool,
really fun project,

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.526
you've done a lot
of work on this,

00:09:44.526 --> 00:09:46.884
and if developers want
to take advantage of this

00:09:46.884 --> 00:09:49.300
or do some this itself, are
there any resources out there?

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.633
Have you blogged, or do you
have source code or anything

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.150
like that?

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.400
RAY TSANG: Yeah, so we
actually have a three-part blog

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.920
series that's actually posted on
the Google Cloud Platform blog.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.900
And we are planning to
open source the code,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.200
so you should be
able to take the code

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.280
and put it onto the
Android devices,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.190
or get some phones from
friends and put them together,

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.590
and you can use selfie
sticks if you want to,

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.735
and you can form a little half
circle or a quarter circle,

00:10:14.735 --> 00:10:16.510
and can also do this yourself

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
that Firebase technique

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.710
that you used is
really interesting.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.461
I'd love to learn, and
I'm sure developers

00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:22.251
would love to learn
how that was done, too.

00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:23.950
So keep an eye on the
Google Cloud blog,

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.380
and when the source code's
available, you'll post it?

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:26.730
RAY TSANG: Yeah.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.970
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool,
well, thanks, Ray,

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.220
that was a whole lot of fun.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.810
And I had a great fun going
and building that spin.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.785
And so everybody, thanks
for watching this episode

00:10:34.785 --> 00:10:35.910
of "Coffee with a Googler."

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.743
If you've any questions
for me, or if you've

00:10:37.743 --> 00:10:39.920
any questions for Ray, if
you want to know anything

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.586
about this project,
just please leave us

00:10:41.586 --> 00:10:43.580
a question in the
comments below,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.060
and we'll be happy
to answer them.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.850
Thank you.
