AS WE GO TO OUR NEXT GAME
"EXPECTO PA-TROLL-'EM."

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:08.842
LAST WEEK, WE PLAYED THE HASHTAG
#NEWHARRYPOTTERBOOKS, AND A

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:11.712
WHOLE BUNCH OF TWEEN WIZARD
AFICIONADOS SOMEHOW BELIEVED

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:16.517
THAT IT WAS AN ACTUAL
ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW BOOK IN

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.818
THE SERIES.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.052
AND PEOPLE WERE NOT HAPPY ABOUT
THAT LIKE @GINTARE_13 WHO SAID,

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:25.592
"LIKE WHOEVER MADE THIS IS NOT
FUNNY AND I HATE YOU.

00:00:25.626 --> 00:00:30.597
#NEWHARRYPOTTERBOOKS." SORRY
ABOUT THAT

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:32.466
WE WERE JUST HAVING FUN WITH
STUFF.

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.670
WE HAD NO INTENTION OF CAUSING
UNREST IN THE SORCERER'S REALM.

I MYSELF AM A CARD-CARRYING
RAVENCLAW.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.409
WE DIDN'T KNOW A LITTLE HASHTAG
FROM OUR SHOW WOULD CAUSE THE

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:44.044
ENTIRE INTERNET TO FREAK THE
(BLEEP) OUT.

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.013
SO SINCERELY, FROM THE BOTTOM OF
OUR HEARTS, WE WANNA SAY,

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:56.089
"HA, TROLLED YOU STUPID
HUFFLEPUFFS, HA HA HA."

00:00:56.123 --> 00:01:01.094
WITH THAT IN MIND, COMEDIANS, I
WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME UP WITH

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:05.265
AS MANY INCENDIARY HASHTAGS AS
YOU CAN THAT WOULD CAUSE TWITTER

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.568
TO FLIP THE ( BLEEP ) OUT IF
THEY DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A JOKE.
