00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
 

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.420
Previously, we learned the
concept of independent

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.890
experiments.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.119
In this exercise, we'll see how
the seemingly simple idea

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.080
of independence can help us
understand the behavior of

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.240
quite complex systems.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.720
In particular, we'll combined
the concept of independence

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.430
with the idea of divide and
conquer, where we break a

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.630
larger system into smaller
components, and then using

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.310
independent properties to
glue them back together.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.740
Now, let's take a look
at the problem.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.950
We are given a network of
connected components, and each

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.299
component can be good with

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.680
probability P or bad otherwise.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.370
All components are independent
from each other.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.620
We say the system is operational
if there exists a

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.620
path connecting point A here
to point B that go through

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.690
only the good components.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.450
And we'd like to understand,
what is the probability that

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.490
system is operational?

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.794
Which we'll denote
by P of A to B.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:04.150
Although the problem might seem
a little complicated at

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.920
the beginning, it turns
out only two

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.420
structures really matter.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.800
So let's look at each of them.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.320
In the first structure, which we
call the serial structure,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.640
we have a collection of k
components, each one having

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.290
probability P being good,
connected one next to each

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.230
other in a serial line.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.770
Now, in this structure, in order
for there to be a good

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.500
path from A to B, every
single one of the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.380
components must be working.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.380
So the probability of having
a good path from A to B is

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.640
simply P times P, so on and so,
repeated k times, which is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.940
P raised to the k power.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.320
Know that the reason we can
write the probability this

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.530
way, in terms of this product,
is because of the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.210
independence property.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.720
 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.510
Now, the second useful

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.750
structure is parallel structure.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.265
Here again, we have k components
one, two, through

00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:08.419
k, but this time they're
connected in parallel to each

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.780
other, namely they start from
one point here and ends at

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.900
another point here,
and this holds for

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.420
every single component.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.250
Now, for the parallel structure
to work, namely for

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.370
there to exist a good path from
A to B, it's easy to see

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.330
that as long as one of these
components works the whole

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.760
thing will work.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.640
So the probability of A to B
is the probability that at

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.260
least one of these
components works.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.260
Or in the other word, the
probability of the complement

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.125
of the event where all
components fail.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:44.740
Now, if each component has
probability P to be good, then

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.920
the probability that all key
components fail is 1 minus P

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.740
raised to the kth power.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.000
Again, having this expression
means that we have used the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.620
property of independence, and
that is probability of having

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.990
a good parallel structure.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.760
Now, there's one more
observation that will be

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.800
useful for us.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.360
Just like how we define two
components to be independent,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.920
we can also find two collections
of components to

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.430
be independent from
each other.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.820
For example, in this diagram,
if we call the components

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.580
between points C and E as
collection two, and the

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.580
components between E and
B as collection three.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.760
Now, if we assume that each
component in both

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.570
collections--

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.210
they're completely independent
from each other, then it's not

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.600
hard to see that collection
two and three behave

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.780
independently.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.250
And this will be very helpful
in getting us the breakdown

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.710
from complex networks
to simpler elements.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.630
Now, let's go back to the
original problem of

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.990
calculating the probability of
having a good path from point

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.560
big A to point big B
in this diagram.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.920
Based on that argument of
independent collections, we

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.070
can first divide the whole
network into three

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.870
collections, as you see here,
from A to C, C to E and E to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.330
B. Now, because they're
independent and in a serial

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.180
structure, as seen by the
definition of a serial

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.140
structure here, we see that the
probability of A to B can

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:24.580
be written as a probability of
A to C multiplied by C to E,

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.230
and finally, E to B.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.880
Now, the probability of A to
C is simply P because the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.510
collection contains
only one element.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.090
And similarly, the probability
of E to B is not that hard

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.070
knowing the parallel
structure here.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.010
We see that collection three
has two components in

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:53.500
parallel, so this probability
will be given by 1 minus 1

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.945
minus P squared.

00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:59.480
 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.930
And it remains to calculate just
the probability of having

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.650
a good path from point C to
point E. To get a value for P

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:16.710
C to E, we notice again, that
this area can be treated as

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:24.260
two components, C1 to E and C2
to E connected in parallel.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.570
And using the parallel law we
get this probability is 1

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:36.790
minus 1 minus P C1 to E
multiplied by the 1 minus P C2

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:43.010
to E. Know that I'm using two
different characters, C1 and

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.760
C2, to denote the same node,
which is C. This is simply for

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.610
making it easier to analyze
two branches where they

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.930
actually do note
the same node.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:02.600
Now P C1 to E is another serial
connection of these

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.660
three elements here with
another component.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.580
So the first three elements are
connected in parallel, and

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.580
we know the probability of that
being successful is 1

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.430
minus P3, and the
last one is P.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:29.570
And finally, P C2 to E. It's
just a single element

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.400
component with probability of
successful being P. At this

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.720
point, there is no longer any
unknown variables, and we have

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.180
indeed obtained exact values
for all the quantities that

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.740
we're interested in.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.960
So starting from this equation,
we can plug in the

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:51.290
values for P C2 to E, P C1 to E
back here, and then further

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.520
plug in P C to E back here.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.880
That will give us the final
solution, which is given by

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.370
the following somewhat
complicated formula.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.240
So in summary, in this problem,
we learned how to use

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.820
the independence property among
different components to

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:11.850
break down the entire fairly
complex network into simple

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.570
modular components, and use the
law of serial and parallel

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.580
connections to put the
probabilities back together in

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.640
common with the overall success
probability of finding

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.700
a path from A to B.
