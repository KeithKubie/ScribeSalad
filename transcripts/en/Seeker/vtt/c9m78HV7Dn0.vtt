00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.150
Some 480 million miles away from Earth is
Jupiter’s moon, Europa, and it’s one of

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.360
the few places in our solar system scientists
think could host alien life.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.450
Scientists believe Europa is volcanically
active and the Hubble Space Telescope recently

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.670
observed ejections of material from the moon’s
ice covered surface.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.150
These observations provided more evidence
that there could be an ocean lying beneath

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.440
Europa’s icy exterior.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.050
If the moon holds a combination of volcanic
heat and water, then there could be extraterrestrial

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.000
life on Europa.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.710
In fact, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory
just announced they’ll be sending a probe

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.079
to Europa in the late 2020s — called the
Europa Clipper.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.969
But what if we could get a glimpse of what
we might find when we crack Europa’s frozen

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.039
crust without having to fly all the way to
Jupiter?

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.890
This is the bottom of the ocean.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.219
The water is icy cold, it’s dark and eerily
quiet.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.820
That is until you hit a deep sea volcanic
ridge.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.460
This extreme Earth location could hold clues
to life on other planets.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.990
These black chimneys are releasing iron sulfide,
and the white chimneys are full of barium,

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.450
calcium, and silicon.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.650
They’re known as hydrothermal vents and
they’re just like hot springs on the seafloor.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.110
The streams of hydrothermal fluid can reach
more than 400 degrees celsius and are full

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.329
of minerals thanks to a unique interaction
between the Earth’s crust and the ocean

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.689
seawater.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.330
They attract all sorts of organisms hoping
to enjoy the warmth, and feed off the ample

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.330
minerals.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.390
The vents are home to a curious range of species
collectively dubbed “extremophiles,” which

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.830
are organisms that can thrive in extreme environments,
where most life wouldn’t have a chance.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.380
There are red-tipped tube worms, shrimp with
what look like eyes on the backs of their

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.330
heads, and other strange looking creatures
living on, and around, the vents.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.340
These organisms survive thanks to the unique
chemical processes called chemosynthesis,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.989
wherein bacteria absorb toxic chemicals streaming
from the vents and turn it into a food source.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.050
This symbiotic process proved that life could
exist in extreme conditions without sunlight

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.450
or oxygen.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.180
While most scientists believe any life that
might be on Europa would probably be in the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.920
form of microorganisms and not crustaceans
or fish — learning how these tiny creatures

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.370
survive in the cold, high-pressure, and hostile
environment right here on our planet, could

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.239
teach us a lot about where to look when we
get to Europa.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.319
So, if you’re wondering how do those creatures
survive on the ocean floor and why they look

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.060
so strange, Julian has the details here.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.569
Knowing that there could be signs of life
on Jupiter's moons, should we prioritize a

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.519
mission to Europa over Mars?
