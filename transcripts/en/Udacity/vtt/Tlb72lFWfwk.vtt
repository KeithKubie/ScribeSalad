00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.220
Okay I'm really excited because we just got our 23 me results back and

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.110
Joanna's actually going to walk us through the

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.360
results. Joanna what do we do first?

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.810
&gt;&gt; Well let's go and log in, and then we

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.600
get to choose to look at health results first or ancestry

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.810
results and I typically like to look at someone's ancestry

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.660
results first because that really gives us context for the rest.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.840
&gt;&gt; Okay let's go do that. Okay, Joanna I just pulled up the page.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.530
&gt;&gt; Right. Okay, so the first thing we do, Matt, is, is sign

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.780
in here, if you want to click up here.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.910
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.042
&gt;&gt;

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:30.590
&gt;&gt; Al right, let me put in my login information.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.030
&gt;&gt; Yep, great.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.160
And there are a bunch of options for where to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.852
start here but, I suggest we start with ancestry overview. And.

00:00:40.852 --> 00:00:41.586
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:45.710
&gt;&gt; I suggest we, the, that most a broad overview

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.900
of your ancestry is in this feature called ancestry composition

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.430
and we can already tell from this that eh, about

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.670
a quarter of your ancestry traces back to Britain and Ireland.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.530
&gt;&gt; Oh great so we'll click right here then.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.090
&gt;&gt; Yep, yep. And this

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.040
is what we call a ring chart, this is Matt Cook's ring chart and let's

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.850
get a little more detail by clicking the Plus sign there. And if you click it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.820
one more time, that's when we get down to the level of the, of Britain

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.420
and Ireland, that the one quarter British and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.060
Irish is indicated by that blue ring there.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.040
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.420
&gt;&gt; and so overall your ancestry

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.030
traces to Northern Europe just like me.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.190
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.654
&gt;&gt; And, if you look, that's where most of your ancestry traces to close

00:01:36.654 --> 00:01:42.250
to 98% traces to northern Europe and nothing, I don't see

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.320
anything tracing to southern Europe. But one curious thing, if you click

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.620
right here on Sub-Saharan Africa, there's, that just, just less than a percent

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.580
of your ancestry traces back to, to Africa, and that, what I want to do

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.160
is look at where on your genome that segment that traces back to Africa is.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.360
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.180
&gt;&gt; So, we're now looking at, this is the ring

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.370
chart view, let's go and change from the map view.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.760
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.970
&gt;&gt; To the chromosome view.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.150
&gt;&gt; Chromosome view?

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.720
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.430
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.100
&gt;&gt; And so we see that if we looked

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.500
at chromosome, so each of these pairs of bars is

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.390
a pair of chromosomes and, and we've heard

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.340
throughout the course about pairs of chromosomes coming from

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.350
mother and father. So that's what we're looking at

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.710
here we start with the longest chromosome, number one.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.650
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.940
&gt;&gt; Number two is next and we go all the way

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.630
down to chromosome 22, and then the X chromosome here, is here.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.820
&gt;&gt; And I only have one.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.320
&gt;&gt; You only have one which is indicative of

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.660
you being male, which I think you already knew that.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.600
&gt;&gt; I already knew that.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.100
That's good.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.040
&gt;&gt; But its always nice when your DNA

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.248
results are consistent with something you already know.

00:02:47.248 --> 00:02:47.376
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:49.040
&gt;&gt; That is kind of a check. It's something

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.250
we actually check, we ask all the customers to

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.755
tell us if they're male or female, and then we look at their DNA to see if it

00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:54.940
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.280
That just helps us know that these are really all your data.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.310
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.800
&gt;&gt; And what I, I was curious about was this red strip here so what we can

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.290
see most of those bars, the chromosomes are a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.770
shade of blue and that indicates ancestry from Europe.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.310
&gt;&gt; hum

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.430
&gt;&gt; Or, or Britain or Ireland. Now but there's

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.988
there's some other colors here and the red refers to

00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:24.250
Sub-Saharan African ancestry which of the chromosomes seems to

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.910
have at least a segment tracing back to Africa?
