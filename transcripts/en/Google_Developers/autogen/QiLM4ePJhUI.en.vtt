all right so why don't we actually take

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450
all right so why don't we actually take
 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.180
all right so why don't we actually take
a look at the actual add-on and then

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190
a look at the actual add-on and then
 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.350
a look at the actual add-on and then
we'll kind of dig into some of the
