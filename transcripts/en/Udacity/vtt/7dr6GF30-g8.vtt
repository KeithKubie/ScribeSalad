00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.920
Okay. It's actually time for us to finally start

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.050
trying to turn our ABO gene into an ABO

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.790
protein. And the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.630
go from DNA to RNA, which is the first

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.300
step of the central dogma via the process of

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.230
transcription. So if you look here. We have our

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.370
double stranded DNA, our double helix, and it's wound

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.470
up. We're going to follow along the gene right here,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.190
and as you can see as it moves across, on

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.930
the, on the bottom region here we have the chemistry, the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.660
chemical structure, and on the top region we have the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.230
letters that actually make up the same DNA structure. Obviously, the

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.090
chemistry on the bottom is something that's a little more

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.060
difficult to read, and that's why we have the letters which

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.770
are right there on the top model. To help us better

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.820
see what's going on here in the double helix, we're actually

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.050
going to unwind it the way a cell normally would.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.400
When a cell finds something interesting in DNA that it

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.600
wants to read more or know more about, it often

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.420
unwinds the DNA a bit so it has better access.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.300
Now the cell is going to use proteins to detect where

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.480
transcription should begin. And we're going to learn more about how

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.630
that happens in the next lesson. But for now all

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.840
you should know is that this sequence region is called

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.410
a promoter. A region of DNA that's read or detected by proteins that signals the

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.560
start of transcription. And once the proteins are bound to the DNA And not only

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.630
begins to unwind but it begins to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.780
separate into single strands to give greater access

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.400
and initiate transcription. Our double helix has

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.780
been unwound and separated into single strands here.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.670
And for transcription to occur, it will rely on

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.690
a very basic property of DNA. So I want

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.420
you to see if you can tell me, what

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.380
property of DNA do you think is most essential

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.270
to make an RNA copy? Do you think it's,

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.200
that DNA is able to associate with histones? That

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.950
it can have a helical structure, the fact that

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.900
it base pairs, or the fact that it's inherited from

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.080
your parents. Go ahead and pick whcih answer you think is best.
