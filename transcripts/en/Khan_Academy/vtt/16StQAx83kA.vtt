00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.440
Let's do some more problems
involving Newton's laws.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.770
OK, so this problem that I am
picking from-- I think it's

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.210
from Oregon University.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.890
It's zebu.uoregan.edu.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.260
I want to give them credit
for their problem.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.585
Let's see, let me draw-- this
is going to be the ground.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.080
And then the problem says
that I have a train--

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.020
so this is a train.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.730
Try my best to draw a train.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.460
Something like that.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.810
And there's smoke coming out.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.540
And it says that the
train of mass 6.84.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.910
So let's say the mass of the
train is 6.84 times 10 to the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.310
sixth kilograms. That's the
mass of this train.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.650
Is moving at a speed of 80
kilometers per hour.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.360
So it's velocity, we could say
it's initial velocity because

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.270
I think it's going to ask me
what happens to its velocity.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.630
So its initial velocity
is equal to 80

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.395
kilometers per hour.

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:13.860
So it's going this way at
80 kilometers per hour.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.380
The brakes, which produce a net
backward force of-- so the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.900
brakes are going to pull
backwards-- a net backward

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.640
force of-- so force is equal
to 1.93 times 10

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.200
to the sixth Newtons.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.490
That's 1.93 times 10 to
the sixth Newtons.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.760
I know it looks a little
bit messy.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.520
The brakes are going to be
applied for 25 seconds.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.460
I'll say force sub b or the
force of the brakes is 1.93

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.110
times 10 to the sixth Newtons.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.760
And then, they will be applied
for 25 seconds.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.330
So the first question to
ask is, what is the new

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.100
speed of the train?

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.025
So what is the speed of the
train after the brakes are

00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:00.820
applied for 25 seconds?

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.440
Well, all we have to figure out
is how fast is the train

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.900
decelerating?

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.060
Or what rate of deceleration
does this

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.090
backward force create?

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.340
So we just go back
to our basics.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.640
Let me switch colors because
this red's getting a little

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.800
monotonous.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.480
Force is equal to mass
times acceleration.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.530
Probably the easiest formula
ever to memorize.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.300
And what's the backward force?

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:34.960
The backward force is 1.93
times 10 to the sixth.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.370
And that equals mass
times acceleration.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.130
What's the mass?

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.380
Mass is right here.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.570
That's a decimal.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:51.200
6.84 times 10 to the sixth
times the acceleration.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.520
And acceleration is what we're
trying to figure out.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.400
And remember, if the force is
pulling back, then of course,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.090
the acceleration is also
going to be backwards.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.960
Or it's going to essentially,
slow down the train.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.830
I know this is very messy, but
let's just divide-- well, we

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.840
could divide both sides by 10 to
the sixth just to get that

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.260
out of the way.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.550
That simplifies things
a little bit.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.540
And then we're left with
the acceleration.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.810
I'm just flipping both sides
of this equation.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:20.890
Acceleration is equal to 1.93
divided by 6.84. soon.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.110
And this is going to be given in
meters per second squared.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.660
And I just want to make sure
I got my units right.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.390
Because this number here, the
mass was in kilograms. And

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.820
then the force was
given in units.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.660
So the acceleration will be in
meters per second squared.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.640
And let's get the handy
calculator here because this

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.330
looks-- I don't want to waste
your time reviewing how to

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.350
divide decimals.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.340
Although, that might
not be a bad

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.960
review; most people forget.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.980
1.93 divided by 6.-- whoops.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.270
I think I messed up.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.830
Let me see.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:04:02.850
1.93 divided by 6.84 is 0.282.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.040
So its acceleration equals-- is
equal to 0.28-- let's just

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.560
say 282 meters per
second squared.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.070
And so how fast is the
train going to be

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.800
going after 25 seconds?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.329
So what's the change
in velocity?

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.630
Well the change in velocity
is equal to

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.050
acceleration times time.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.240
And if we take its velocity as
a positive number, then its

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.760
acceleration will be a negative
number, right?

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.920
Because it's going to be going
in the opposite direction.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.400
Could have done it the
other way around.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.950
So the change in velocity is
going to be equal to this

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.080
minus 0.282 meters per
second squared.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.510
I won't write the units
here because I'm

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.750
running out of space.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.200
Minus 0.282 meters per second
squared times 25 seconds.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.950
Let's get the calculator
back here.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.700
Where'd it go?

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.140
There it is.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.430
OK.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.510
So now we want to multiply that
number we just figured

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.970
out times 25.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:09.020
Equals 7.05.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.560
So the change in velocity
is equal to minus

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:21.560
7.05 meters per second.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.020
OK, so let's see what's
going on.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.920
The initial speed of the train
is 80 kilometers per hour.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.000
But we have the change
in velocity given

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.590
in meters per second.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.900
So we can either change this
change in velocity to

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.740
kilometers per hour, or we could
go the other way around

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.220
and do the- or change the
kilometers per hour into

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.200
meters per second.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.810
I don't know, let's change the
meters per second into

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.360
kilometers per hour.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.790
So there are how many meters--
so it'll be minus 7.05.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.920
And how many meters are
there in a kilometer?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.010
Well there are a thousand
meters in a kilometer.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.450
So it's going to be going that
number divided by a thousand

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.960
kilometers.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.890
And if this is a little
confusing, I'm skipping a

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.720
couple of steps.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.500
You might want to review the
video on unit conversion.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.910
And then, this is meters per
second, but we want to get

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.150
kilometers per hour.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.260
How may seconds are
there in an hour?

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.390
There are 3,600.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.120
right?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.220
So it'll go 3,600 times as
far in an hour as it

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.740
does it in a second.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.800
Times 3,600.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.930
So we can get rid of two 0's
here and two 0's here.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:41.120
So it's essentially going
to be 7.05 you times 36.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.540
I just got rid of the 0's.

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.640
I'll write the 0's there, just
so you don't get confused.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.640
Divided by a thousand.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.770
1, 2, 3.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:55.830
Equals 25.39 kilometers
per hour.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.690
So I'll just round.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.730
25 kilometers per hour.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:07.870
So the change in velocity is
minus 25 kilometers per hour.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.330
What's the change velocity?

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.430
If it was starting off at 80
kilometers and then the change

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.090
in velocity is minus 25, what's
its new velocity?

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.120
Well it's going to be 80 minus
25, the initial velocity minus

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.740
the change in velocity.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.270
Or plus the change in velocity
depending on how you view that

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.290
negative number.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.660
So 80 minus 25.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:32.920
So we could say the final
velocity is going to be 80

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:40.040
minus 25 is 55 kilometers
per hour.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.940
Now the second part of this
question is, how far has the

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.280
train traveled in this time?

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.960
So essentially, how long-- how
far does the train go as it

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.660
brakes from 80 kilometers
per hour to 55

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.170
kilometers per hour?

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.300
Well, all we have to figure out
is the average velocity

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.750
and then multiply that
times the time.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.690
So what's the average
velocity here?

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.720
Well actually, let me just clear
this because I think

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.736
it's getting-- you don't need
a drawing of a train.

00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:11.900
Let's see if I remember my-- so
the initial velocity was 80

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.110
kilometers per hour.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.950
Final velocity is 55 kilometers
per hour.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:25.120
So the average velocity is going
to be 80 plus 55 over 2,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.710
which is, what?

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.590
67 and 1/2, something
like that.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:35.730
67 and 1/2 kilometers
per hour.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:37.549
And then if we want to figure
out the total distance it

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:41.870
travels, distance is equal to
average velocity times time.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:42.929
The average velocity?

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.700
Well, we have the time
in seconds, right?

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.280
So we have 25 seconds here.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.810
But this is given in kilometers
per hour.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.770
So we want to convert this into,
maybe meters per second.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:58.310
So what we do is take
the 67.5, it's going

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.870
to go times a thousand.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.040
that's.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.540
How many meters it's
going to go.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.535
And then in a second it's going
to go 1/3,600 of that.

00:09:04.535 --> 00:09:07.530
So let's see what
that gives us.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:17.305
67.5 times 1,000 divided
by 3,600.

00:09:17.305 --> 00:09:23.380
18.75.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.340
That's the meters per second.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.180
That's the average velocity
in meters per second.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:31.800
And we go for 25 seconds, so
what does that give us?

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:38.625
Times 25 equals 468 meters.

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:42.790
468.75 meters.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.370
That's how far it traveled
just to brake from 80

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:49.750
kilometers per hour to 55
kilometers per hour.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.670
And it took 25 seconds.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:53.320
Hopefully I haven't confused
you too much.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.570
