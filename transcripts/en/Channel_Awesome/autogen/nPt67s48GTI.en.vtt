the either our generation of the
 

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.690
the either our generation of the
generation before us like kind of

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:02.700
generation before us like kind of
 

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.390
generation before us like kind of
screwed the next generation as all other

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400
