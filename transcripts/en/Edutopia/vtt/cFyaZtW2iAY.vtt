00:00:01.222 --> 00:00:04.527
(awning cloth flapping)

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:07.277
(cars whooshing)

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.840
- Seven years ago, the destiny
of an Eminence student,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.380
it was pretty bleak.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.680
We were only having
about 20% of our students

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.890
persist to a post-secondary degree,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.610
so that left the other 80%

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.170
honestly in one of our factories in town.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.270
Our school was run down,
enrollment was declining,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.820
our test scores had dropped.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.900
We needed to do something drastic

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.030
in order to transform the school,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.570
which really ended up
transforming the town.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.870
At Eminence schools, we were
doing 21st century learning

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.560
in a 19th century building.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.050
It was really paramount
that we create a facility

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.610
that matched our philosophy.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.220
I am a 4th generation
alumni of Eminence schools.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.430
I know probably better than anybody

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.810
how little money there is to go around.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.870
I wasn't an outsider coming in,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.500
passing attacks on people
that I didn't understand.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.300
It was no small thing to ask the town

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.280
to give up a little bit more

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.480
to pull of this vision for these kids.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.360
The Edhub only exists because
the Eminence community

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.140
invested in the future of every kid

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.680
that will ever walk through it.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.150
They were willing to invest in us

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.010
to pull off something unbelievable.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.920
- They see what's
happening with their kids,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.580
they see the excitement and the skillset

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.682
they're beginning to come home with.

00:01:33.682 --> 00:01:34.880
(revving)

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.713
- [Kids] Whoa.

00:01:35.713 --> 00:01:37.230
- [Buddy] The EDhub stands for

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.260
the Experimental Davinci
Hybrid Ultra Biblotheca,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.330
so it's kind of a fancy
newfangled library.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.630
- This is unlike anything I've ever seen.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.230
I mean students don't
just check out books,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.793
they check out tools,
they use laser cutters

00:01:50.793 --> 00:01:53.370
to create the thing they actually drew

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.220
in their notebook one day.
- It looks awesome.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.880
- It's amazing to watch kids just flourish

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.267
in an environment where
there aren't any barriers.

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:03.570
(revving)

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.040
- The Edhub was designed to be
the new heart of the school.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.590
We literally took the
traditional hallway space,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.030
the same amount of square footage,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.850
and just made it a circular building,

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.880
so that all the rooms flow
around the center of that space,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.230
the Core, where all students,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.939
kindergarten through 12th
grade, could use and utilize.

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.640
- Okay, one more drop-off,
simultaneous, go.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.970
- [Buddy] This building has
about 30,000 square feet.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.590
It has eight maker labs.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.810
They range from robotics, to bio lab,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.910
to a design thinking lab.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.632
It has a TV stuido lab.

00:02:37.632 --> 00:02:38.800
- [Teacher] Quiet on the set.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.740
In five, four, three.
- And then it has

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.766
a traditional power tool lab.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:44.492
- [Teacher] Let's
double-check that measurement.

00:02:44.492 --> 00:02:46.742
(saw revs)

00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:50.330
- I mean the space itself is so open.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.290
Everything from just having windows,

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.440
the ability to see in all
areas at the same time,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.900
it gives that sense of community.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.240
- [Buddy] We wanted to be 100% functional.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.875
Lots of the walls are moveable
magnet and writable surfaces.

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:08.140
- So we have 18 and 30,
it's, we're at about to.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.280
- You know, the building's awesome,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.530
but it's the learning that's happening

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.800
inside the EDhub that
makes it really special.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.850
- Now let's see.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.850
- [Student] Okay, there we go, we got it.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.070
- It's transforming learning

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.810
because of the collaboration
skills that they learn.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.690
They're building, creating,
designing, constructing.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.890
All the skills that you
would use in the workplace.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.500
- We want them to feel
like they're working

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.786
in Silicon Valley, or
at a startup company.

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:31.860
- [Students] Hi, hello.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.930
- [Buddy] A lot of the
ideas that we've developed

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.860
were from the business sector
that schools had never used.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.150
- I can remember the first time

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.428
we utilized the giant screen,

00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:44.260
and it was just amazing to watch them

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.830
kind of take ownership
of such a large space.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.160
They felt like experts.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.150
In the EDhub, we see kids walk out

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.540
knowing there are a lot more possibilities

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.703
than they maybe knew about before.

00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:56.792
- [Student] Wow.

00:03:56.792 --> 00:03:58.027
Whoa.
- What do you see now?

00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:00.180
- [Student] Penguin, ooh. (laughs)

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.110
- There's something powerful
about setting a goal so big

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.316
that there's no way you could pull it off.

00:04:06.316 --> 00:04:07.480
(whooping)

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.380
That's what our town did in
the building of the EDhub.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.250
To watch a group of people come together

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.670
and rally towards the impossible.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.630
And our kids have been a
part of this change, as well.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.630
And so it'll be exciting to see
what their futures look like

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.370
as a result of what they've
watched happen here.
