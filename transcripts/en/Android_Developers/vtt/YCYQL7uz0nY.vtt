Hello, I'm Kim Do-hyeong from BUFF STUDIO.

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:13.219
I am the CEO and planning director of our
company.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.470
Last year, I founded BUFF STUDIO by myself.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.330
I dreamed of becoming a game developer since
I was a fourth grader in elementary school.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:39.559
I enjoy my life as a game developer, and want
to remain a game developer as I grow older.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:48.429
As a fledgling startup, we still have many
problems, especially finance, manpower and

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:49.429
time.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:57.249
We launched a game with the title "BUFF KNIGHT,"
and received good responses from our users.

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:04.540
Now we are a team of four, and are currently
engaged in developing the game's sequel, "BUFF

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.540
KNIGHT II".

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.810
"BUFF KNIGHT" is a package-type game with
metro-style graphics and endings.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.170
In this game, you collect hidden artifacts
and rescue a princess from a dragon.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.570
It was selected as Google Play's "Game of
the Week" and included in their "30 Best Games

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.570
of 2014"list

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.899
because this game has attracted many users,
especially abroad.

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.501
The number of downloads jumped about ten-fold
after it was selected.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:28.590
This encouraged us to undertake the development
of its sequel.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.909
Our ability to respond rapidly is one of our
strengths.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.610
For example, when users post reviews,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.640
we reply to their comments, and this instant
interaction makes us more competitive.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.409
Another strength is that we can respond to
such feedback promptly by modifying and updating

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.409
the game.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.430
Our cumulative sales revenue at the moment
is about 150 million won.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.109
We are currently developing mobile games,
but we are also interested in developing PC

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.969
or console games.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.179
Ultimately, our goal is to become a global
player in the industry.
