00:00:00.562 --> 00:00:01.395
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.395 --> 00:00:02.228
Hello, Rosie.

00:00:02.228 --> 00:00:03.061
- [Voiceover] Hello, David.

00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:04.021
- [Voiceover] We're gonna
talk about dependent

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:05.498
and independent clauses.

00:00:05.498 --> 00:00:09.251
Full disclosure, this
is a relatively advanced

00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:12.717
part of grammar, but it is
important to understand,

00:00:12.717 --> 00:00:15.614
because mastering dependent
and independent clauses

00:00:15.614 --> 00:00:17.267
and being able to say

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:21.059
why a clause is dependent or independent

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.449
will help you become a better writer,

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.809
will help you become a stronger writer,

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:30.260
and give your sentences
vim and vigor and strength.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.761
So with all that out of the way.

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:34.224
Let's start with independent clauses,

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:37.305
because an independent clause
is basically a sentence.

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:40.817
We established previously
that all a clause is

00:00:40.817 --> 00:00:44.984
is just a collection of phrases
with a subject and a verb.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:50.087
So, for example, the sentence,
I ate the pineapple, period,

00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:52.061
is an independent clause.

00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:55.629
So, it's a couple of phrases,
we've got this noun phrase I,

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.757
we've got this verb
phrase ate the pineapple,

00:00:57.757 --> 00:01:01.161
and together that becomes a subject

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.748
and verb or a predicate.

00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:06.341
So, Rosie, what is a dependent clause?

00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:08.839
- [Voiceover] So dependent
clause is different

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.328
from an independent clause in that

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:14.280
it can't stand on its own as a sentence.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.816
So it includes a subject and a verb,

00:01:16.816 --> 00:01:19.763
but it can't be its own sentence.

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:23.430
And sometimes it might
look like a sentence,

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.410
it could start with something

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.577
like a subordinating conjunction,
like the word because,

00:01:31.688 --> 00:01:34.403
for example, because it was delicious.

00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:36.774
- [Voiceover] Okay.

00:01:36.774 --> 00:01:38.253
And let's be clear here, you know,

00:01:38.253 --> 00:01:42.119
obviously, this is an
utterance that people say.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.864
You know, if you ask me
why did you eat the pizza,

00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:46.959
I would respond by saying,
because it was delicious.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.401
Why do we climb the mountain?

00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:51.240
Because it is there, you know.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.800
I'm not saying that this is not,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.441
not an utterance that is made

00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:57.941
by native speaking English speakers.

00:01:57.941 --> 00:01:58.989
It is, of course it is.

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:01.574
But you have to be aware
that it is a dependent clause

00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:03.463
and therefore a sentence fragment.

00:02:03.463 --> 00:02:06.380
And part of natural informal speech

00:02:07.308 --> 00:02:09.846
is that we do use a lot
of sentence fragments.

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:13.195
And sentence fragments are not as common

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:14.919
in formal writing.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:17.836
You may sometimes use them for effect,

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:20.262
but I want you to remember
that these videos are

00:02:20.262 --> 00:02:23.360
about standard American English,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.704
and a kind of formal version
of standard American English.

00:02:27.704 --> 00:02:29.619
And so, we're trying to
teach you to distinguish

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:33.036
between independent and dependent clauses

00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:36.686
so that you can use them skillfully

00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:40.065
in the full knowledge and
mastery of your choices.

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:42.255
You gotta learn your scales
before you can improvise.

00:02:42.255 --> 00:02:43.088
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:02:43.088 --> 00:02:43.921
- [Voiceover] Dig?

00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:44.754
- [Voiceover] Dig.

00:02:44.754 --> 00:02:47.996
- [Voiceover] So because it
was delicious, not a sentence.

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:49.966
This is a dependent
clause, because it begins

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:54.225
with this subordinating
conjunction because.

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:58.410
You could also work in
something like although,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.577
or while, and any of these would
make it a dependent clause.

00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:06.967
Now, if it was just on
its own, it was delicious,

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.367
yeah, of course, that is a sentence.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:12.739
The part that makes it dependent is

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.540
this subordinating conjunction.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.714
You put that onto the front of it

00:03:16.714 --> 00:03:18.823
and all of a sudden it
needs an independent clause

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:21.047
to lean up against.

00:03:21.047 --> 00:03:23.020
I know this is confusing,
so let's take a look

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.311
at a couple more examples

00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:28.637
of independent and dependent clauses.

00:03:28.637 --> 00:03:32.204
So, the following are
independent clauses, Rosie.

00:03:32.204 --> 00:03:34.546
- [Voiceover] The bear roared.

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:37.213
Maureen pointed out the monster.

00:03:38.085 --> 00:03:40.627
That's not our pet rabbit.

00:03:40.627 --> 00:03:45.409
- [Voiceover] And let's
do some dependent clauses,

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.517
and then you can see

00:03:47.517 --> 00:03:51.135
that we'll be able to
combine them into sentences.

00:03:51.135 --> 00:03:54.051
- [Voiceover] While the salmon flopped.

00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:56.051
That she saw last night.

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.736
Unless I'm mistaken.

00:04:02.003 --> 00:04:03.562
- [Voiceover] So you can see
that these are all clauses,

00:04:03.562 --> 00:04:05.065
right, we've established that, you know,

00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:07.209
each one has a subject and a verb.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.972
The bear roared, the salmon flopped.

00:04:08.972 --> 00:04:11.845
But all of these have some kind of,

00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:14.678
everything in orange has something

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.186
that's either a subordinating conjunction

00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:24.473
like while or unless, or a
relative pronoun like that.

00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:25.670
So while the salmon flopped.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.998
You can see in this context

00:04:26.998 --> 00:04:29.370
the bear roared while the salmon flopped,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.687
you can kind of understand
why this is called

00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:36.354
the dependent clause,
because by the context

00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:39.620
of this sentence, while
the salmon flopped,

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.687
something else was going on, right.

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:44.411
This is kind of like
background information.

00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:47.017
And it's in fact not necessary

00:04:47.017 --> 00:04:51.222
for comprehending the first
sentence or the first clause,

00:04:51.222 --> 00:04:55.024
the independent clause, the bear roared.

00:04:55.024 --> 00:04:58.388
And if we did combine
these, you would realize

00:04:58.388 --> 00:05:02.823
that the salmon flopped is
just background information.

00:05:02.823 --> 00:05:03.656
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:05:03.656 --> 00:05:04.489
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:07.046
But we need to know what else is going on

00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:09.398
for there to be a while.

00:05:09.398 --> 00:05:10.502
- [Voiceover] So the bear roared

00:05:10.502 --> 00:05:14.840
is a perfectly sensical
sentence on its own.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.673
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:17.947
- [Voiceover] And while the
salmon flopped is providing us

00:05:17.947 --> 00:05:20.108
with this extra information.

00:05:20.108 --> 00:05:22.993
The bear is roaring
while the salmon flopped.

00:05:22.993 --> 00:05:24.874
But if we were just to see the sentence

00:05:24.874 --> 00:05:27.190
while the salmon flopped on its own,

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.607
like say, we didn't have the bear roared,

00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:33.399
it would make less sense.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.865
- [Voiceover] Right, because
the presence of this word while

00:05:36.865 --> 00:05:39.443
indicates that something
else is also going on,

00:05:39.443 --> 00:05:41.210
that's what makes it dependent.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.667
So we need to have the bear roared.

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:47.168
Likewise, Maureen pointed out the monster,

00:05:47.168 --> 00:05:48.970
that sentence works fine on its own.

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.887
That she saw last night,
sure there's a subject

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:56.603
and there's a verb, she and saw, right,

00:05:56.603 --> 00:05:59.247
she saw something, she saw that,

00:05:59.247 --> 00:06:02.382
but this relative pronoun needs
to refer back to something,

00:06:02.382 --> 00:06:06.466
and that makes it
dependent on the monster.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.974
So this last one's a little tricky, right,

00:06:08.974 --> 00:06:10.329
because you might be looking and saying,

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:12.807
well, unless I'm mistaken,
where's the verb?

00:06:12.807 --> 00:06:14.818
Well, the verb is kind of hiding in here.

00:06:14.818 --> 00:06:17.401
So unless I am mistaken, right.

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:22.652
So, the presence of this
subordinating conjunction unless

00:06:22.652 --> 00:06:24.751
makes this into a dependent clause.

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:27.669
So unless means it's kind of hinging

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.711
on some other information.

00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:32.255
So the other information is
that's not our pet rabbit,

00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:33.874
unless I'm mistaken.

00:06:33.874 --> 00:06:35.031
I feel that there should be a comma here,

00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:36.303
so I'm gonna put one in.

00:06:36.303 --> 00:06:39.264
That's not our pet rabbit,
unless I'm mistaken.

00:06:39.264 --> 00:06:41.134
I hope this has cleared some stuff up.

00:06:41.134 --> 00:06:45.088
So an independent clause
is a subject and a verb

00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:47.251
and it can be a sentence.

00:06:47.251 --> 00:06:50.834
A dependent clause is
a subject and a verb,

00:06:51.691 --> 00:06:54.691
but also a subordinating conjunction

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:58.815
and it cannot be a sentence.

00:07:00.365 --> 00:07:02.632
You can learn anything, David out.

00:07:02.632 --> 00:07:03.737
- [Voiceover] Rosie out.
