Every election,
eventually, you know,

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:05.105
the totally bonkers attack ads
start rolling out,

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.707
like this one
Ted Cruz's campaign

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.476
unleashed on Donald Trump.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.179
Look!
I got the Trump action figure!

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.947
No way! It's huge!

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:17.718
-What does he do?
-He pretends to be a Republican.

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:19.219
(kids laugh)

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.221
-(laughter, applause)
-Whoa.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:24.024
Huh? Sick burn.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.126
Sick burn, bro.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.928
There's no better
vote of confidence

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.998
than using eight-year-old boys
to relay your political message.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.534
Believe it or not,
this is a high-budget attack ad

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:35.736
funded by a major
presidential campaign.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.571
Uh, when you get
to the local levels,

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.239
candidates have
a lot less ad money

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:40.707
and apparently a lot less shame.

00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:42.709
So I'm gonna show you
a bizarre local attack ad

00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:44.711
that we found online,
and for 250 points,

00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.047
I want you to answer a question
about it. First up...

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.916
Kay Daly takes aim
against her opponent,

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.818
who she calls a RINO--
a Republican in Name Only.

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:53.353
Let's watch.

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:55.789
And, you know, as a Republican,
you can be a RINO...

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.224
RINO... RINO...

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.393
I'm Kay Daly,
and this is my message.

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:00.827
I'm huntin' RINOs.

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:02.262
Care to join me?

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:03.597
(gunshot)

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.033
Okay.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.536
Wow, that...

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.339
took a... took a sharp turn.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:15.542
What else does
Kay Daly hunt? Tim.

00:01:15.576 --> 00:01:18.011
Bargains at Old Navy.

00:01:18.045 --> 00:01:19.847
HALE:
That's true.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.849
Points.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.851
Yes, she does.

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.619
Next up, an attack ad
against former

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.055
Texas state senator Danny Goeb.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.324
("Let it Go" tune plays)
♪ I'll try to lie ♪

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:33.594
♪ Why should they know?

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:36.930
♪ Danny Goeb, Danny Goeb

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:39.900
♪ I can't lie to you anymore ♪

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:46.440
I was wrong. I didn't think
I could hate that song more.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.175
Uh, what's another
one of the candidates'

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.245
Goeb-to karaoke songs?
Tim.

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:53.213
"Stay" by Lisa Goeb.

00:01:54.515 --> 00:01:56.450
Points.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.854
Uh, Reid.

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.856
"Wake Me Up
Before You Goeb Goeb".

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.791
-Yes, points.
-HALE: That's good.

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:12.099
-Now-now I kind of
want to hear that. -I know.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:13.567
Uh, Tony.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.303
Train's "50 Ways
to Say Goeb-bye."

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.840
Yes, uh, yes, points.
Points.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:25.279
This attack on John Boehner
that has the balls

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.848
to parody a Viagra commercial.

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.816
You make a great team.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.919
It's been that way
since the day you left.

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:33.620
But your electile dysfunction?

00:02:33.654 --> 00:02:35.522
It could be a question
of blood flow.

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:38.458
Sometimes when a politician
has been in DC too long

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:40.661
it goes to his head.

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.663
Oh, wow.

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:45.365
I, uh...

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.767
I got to be honest--

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.735
I got to give 'em points
for "electile dysfunction".

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.137
Now, that's not bad.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.039
That's something that someone
would say on this show.

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:54.241
I can't (bleep) on it.
What's another disease

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:56.944
voters can get?
What's another disease... Tim.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:58.612
Congressional AIDS.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.514
Wow.

00:03:00.547 --> 00:03:02.749
-Points.
-I regret it.

00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:03.984
-Yeah.
-I...

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.219
-Points, Tim Simons.
-I don't know.

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:07.187
I regretted it...
I regretted it immediately.

00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:08.589
HALE:
That's all right.

00:03:08.622 --> 00:03:09.957
Reid.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.158
Rand palsy.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:11.258
-Yes, points.
-Oh.
