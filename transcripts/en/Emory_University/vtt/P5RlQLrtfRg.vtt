00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.720
"It's a huge crisis, I think probably one
of the biggest humanitarian crises that

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.920
there's been in the last 10 years.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.620
It's definitely shocking to see the conditions
that people are living in.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.880
The camp is located on the Syrian-Jordanian border

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.120
and it is miles and miles long.
It's the largest refugee camp in the world.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.320
The conditions are really poor.
They live mostly in tin sheds.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.060
There's no grass. There's no water. 
It's basically in the middle of a desert.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.300
"What drives me to be involved with refugee health
is I myself am a refugee.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.140
This has kind of been an interest and a passion of mine,
of having that opportunity to give back.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.700
I guess I was really fortunate and 
that Dr. Behshad already had a relationship established

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.720
and he asked me to come
participate with him.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.800
Hundreds of patients will show up in the morning and
line up and you know your time is limited

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.820
and your resources are limited.
You may be the only doctor that that refugee may see,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.580
and so that's the only opportunity
they have, and so you really 
need to be on top of your stuff.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.840
A high percentage of the refugees are.. 
I think it's close to 40 percent of the camp,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.900
is actually children are under the age of 18.
Some of these children have been born in the camp.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.200
and so some of them have never been anywhere else,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.760
which means that they haven't had
access to a pediatric ophthalmologist

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.500
or a really specific eye care specialist.
And and so when I see them,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.560
sometimes it's the first time
they've ever had an eye exam.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.620
So far, we've already screened 10 percent
of all of the children in Zaatari refugee camp,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.320
which is a pretty large amount when
the overall population is 90,000.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.140
One of the most impactful thing that
patients tell me when I see them there

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.520
is they see someone from another country who cares who came all across the world

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.720
to provide some sort of service.
And I really think this population really feels forgotten.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.640
One of the major surgeries that we do there
is cataract surgery.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.240
Their immediate responses is "Thank you you, not only 
for helping me to be able to see,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.940
but now I can support my family."

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.820
We always include medical students 
from Jordan as part of our process

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.640
and we have also brought out ophthalmologists
who are currently working in the war zone in Syria

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.050
to provide them with further training --
really trying to magnify the impact that

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.490
we're having in this area of the world.
But it couldn't be done without the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.780
partnerships and associations with other
organizations, in particular the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.620
Syrian American Medical Society and 
also local Jordanian ophthalmologists as well.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.680
We're traveling halfway around the world. 
I know there are people here that we can help,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.940
and so I did a little bit of research online
and I ended up finding an article

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:56.620
about the Mayor of Clarkston and how he has 
been extremely proactive in accepting refugees.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.600
"The Clarkston Community Health Center was 
set up by a few community members

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.500
who really wanted to provide care to 
their community, which includes refugees

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.100
but also many of the local people
who don't have insurance.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.640
Soroosh and I did a visit there one
weekend and found out that they really

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.620
did have a need for some other equipment 
and more frequent eye exams.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.780
I approached them about setting up a consistent 
eye clinic and they were very open

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.340
to the idea and very supportive, and then
brought it back to Emory, who then

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.560
helped provide some equipment
to get the clinic started.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.720
I have learned how to carry everything that I need 
to do an eye exam for a kid in a small backpack.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.100
Now I know that I can pretty much go anywhere,
like go to the Clarkston clinic,

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.430
and just bring a few things with me and
be able to do a full exam for a kid.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.120
This also has given an opportunity for
our own residents and medical students to

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.040
get involved in their community and volunteer.
We kind of talk about refugees

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.420
as being a burden, and my experience has been 
that this group is not a burden,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.940
these are actually gems.  
For me, it gives me hope for the future.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:22.400
As long as the refugees are there,
we're going to continue to do what 
we can to provide them with eye care.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.280
They've been through so much,
but they are incredibly strong people,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:36.400
and they have this optimism that
I don't I don't know how it exists... 
but it's incredible."
