00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
Why is gender even a thing?

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.520
We’ve talked about what gender is, and how
it affects people’s lives.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.720
But we’ve skipped over a fundamental part
of the whole issue of gender:

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.640
Why does it matter to us so much?

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.720
Gender isn’t the same in all cultures.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.640
Mainstream Western ideas have focused on the
idea of gender as a binary, with masculinity and
femininity serving as mutual opposites.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.580
But other cultures have three genders, or
see gender as fluid, or describe gender as a
spectrum rather than a set of distinct types.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:38.540
For example, many Native American and First
Nation peoples recognize a third gender that
incorporates both the masculine and feminine, and
it plays a specific, sacred role within their culture.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.300
While different tribes all have different
terms for this gender within their own languages,
nowadays many use the umbrella term Two Spirit.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.620
But there are no known societies that have
no concept of gender.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.740
So, why is that?

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.740
Why do we, no matter what society we live
in, ascribe so much meaning to gender?

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:05.600
[Theme Music]

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.400
To talk about why we have gender in the first
place, we need to go back to the three theories
that sociology is built on:

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.420
structural functional theory, symbolic
interaction theory, and social conflict theory.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.680
All three of these theories have different
perspectives on why gender exists.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.859
Let’s start with structural functionalism.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.200
Remember, the structural functional approach
understands human behavior as part of systems that
help keep society organized and functioning.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.620
From this perspective, gender is a means
of organizing society into distinct roles that
complement each other.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.580
Some anthropologists have argued that
hunter-gatherer societies originated the idea that
men are providers and women take care of the home.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.800
Men were physically stronger and didn’t
have the demands of childbearing,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.640
which made it easier for them to take on more
aggressive, autonomous roles, like hunting or warfare.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.980
And these roles became institutionalized.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:55.740
Even once physical strength was no longer
important for many jobs, it was taken for granted
that men would be the breadwinners and women
would care for the children.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.620
But there are holes in this theory –

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.260
namely that the early anthropologists who
studied this dynamic overemphasized the role
of things like big game hunting.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.560
More recent anthropological work suggests
that gathering, fishing, and small game hunting

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.280
– all of which were also performed by women
– played a much larger role in providing food
in these societies.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.520
But the idea that we have two genders to play
complementary roles has stuck around, partially
through the work of sociologist Talcott Parsons.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.440
He argued that boys and girls are socialized to take
on traits that are complementary to each other, to make
it easier to maintain stable, productive family units.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.900
Boys are taught what Parsons calls instrumental
qualities, such as confidence and competitiveness,
that prepare them for the labor force.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.820
Meanwhile, girls are taught expressive qualities,
such as empathy and sensitivity, which prepare
them to care for their families.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.620
Parsons’ theory was that a successful family
needs people to have complementary skill sets, and
gender gives us a way of pairing off these skills.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:55.000
And society, in turn, encourages gender
conformity by making people feel that they have to fit
these molds if they want to be romantically desirable,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.020
and by also teaching people to reject those
who go against these gender norms.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.060
Though this theory was influential in the
mid twentieth century, it’s fallen out of
favor for a few reasons.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.520
First, Parsons was basing his theory on a
division of labor that was specific to middle-class
white America in the 1940s and 50s.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.720
It assumes a heteronormative and Western perspective
on what a family is.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.860
But not all families are nuclear units with
one man, one woman, and a gaggle of children.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:24.720
When you expand the definition of family to
include same-sex couples, single parents,
multi-generational families, or childless adults,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.140
it’s less obvious that you should assume
that a man works outside the home and
a woman works inside the home.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.040
Second, the idea of complementary genders rests
on there being two distinct and opposite genders.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.800
Again – a Western perspective.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.510
The idea of gender as a binary isn’t universal,
and it ignores all those whose identities don’t
conform to a two-gender system.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.160
Third, Parsons’ theory ignores the personal
and social costs of maintaining rigid gender roles.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.780
Critics argue that the idea that men need
to be the ones working outside the home to
maintain family stability is arbitrary,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.380
and it reinforces gender dynamics that give
men power over women.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.840
Now, another perspective on gender is the
symbolic-interaction approach.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.240
While structural functionalists are concerned
with how gender helps all of society work well,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.440
symbolic-interactionists are more focused
in how gender is part of day to day life.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.740
From this perspective, gender is something
that a person does, rather than something that’s
either innate or imposed by institutions.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.560
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to talk about
different ways that people ‘do gender.’

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.560
Clothes, hairstyles, and makeup all telegraph
gender to the people around you.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.060
Take these two people.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.760
You probably have a gut reaction about the gender
of these people, even though the only thing that‘s
different about them is what they’re wearing.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.400
But what if the person in the suit had long
hair or was wearing makeup?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.540
These might flip a switch in our brain to start
seeing the person as a woman in a business suit.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.980
But having short hair and no makeup while wearing
a dress doesn’t necessarily flip the same switch.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.300
This pattern is an example of gender roles,
or how a society defines how women and
men should think and behave.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.960
A man wearing a skirt is seen as more of a
rejection of traditional gender roles than a
woman wearing pants is.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.620
Body language and how people interact with
each other are also part of how people do gender.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.660
Women are socialized to be deferential in
conversation, meaning that they’re more likely to
make eye contact to show that they’re listening,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.420
or to smile as a way of encouraging
their speaking partner.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:18.300
Crossing your legs is called ‘ladylike’ whereas if
you sit on the subway with your legs spread out,
you might get glared at for ‘manspreading.’

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.480
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:29.380
These exercises in ‘doing gender’ are good examples of how our society’s definitions of masculinity and femininity are inextricably linked to each gender’s power in society.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.440
Masculine traits are associated with power
– taking up more space, directing the conversation
– and are often valued more than feminine traits.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.620
In other words, everyday social interaction
reflects and helps reinforce gender stratification.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.760
But a limitation of the symbolic interaction
approach is that it focuses on the micro,
rather than the macro.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.540
Because of its focus on situational experiences,
it misses the broader patterns of gender inequality.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.900
For that, we need social conflict theory.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.520
You might remember gender conflict theory
from our episode about Harriet Martineau.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:06.880
But in case you’ve forgotten, gender conflict theory
argues that gender is a structural system that distributes
power and privilege to some and disadvantage to others.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.660
Specifically, that structural system is the patriarchy,
a form of social organization in which men have
more power and dominate other genders.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.620
We can see examples of this structure in
institutional practices that disadvantage women,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.040
like restricting higher education to men or
refusing to allow women to vote.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.660
But we also see this in less official ways.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:30.240
Think about the traits that our society values
– rationality is often praised as a desirable
way of thinking, especially in leaders,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.500
while irrationality means letting emotion affect
decisions and is seen as a weakness.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:42.340
Women are stereotyped as more emotional and
men as more rational, which makes people falsely see
men as more natural fits for leadership positions.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:49.520
The way that patriarchy privileges certain
people over others also isn’t as simple as saying that
all men are at the top of the power distribution.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.660
This is why there’s more attention paid
in sociology to intersectionality,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.400
or the analysis of the interplay of race, class,
gender, sexual orientation and other identities,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.180
which often results in multiple dimensions
of disadvantage.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:08.140
While all women are disadvantaged by gender,
it’s also true that some women experience more
disadvantage than others.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:16.140
And the converse is true for men – all men benefit
from living in a society that privileges masculinity,
but some men benefit more than others.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.620
To see this in action, let’s go back to
the stats on the gender wage gap we talked
about in the last episode.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.480
White women make 80 cents for every dollar
a white man makes.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.000
Black women make 65 cents for every dollar
a white man makes.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.170
If we divide those two numbers, we get the
wage gap between white women and black women:

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.740
a black woman makes 81 cents for every dollar
that a white woman makes.

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.240
But what about black men?

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.600
Well, they make 73 cents for every dollar that
white men make.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.440
So black women do worse economically than
black men, who do worse than white women,
who do worse than white men.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:52.460
Just looking at gender or just looking at
race misses the way that disadvantages can
stack on top of one another.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:59.960
Our understanding of social conflict theory also would
not be complete without discussing a movement closely
entwined with gender conflict theory: feminism.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.480
Feminism is the support of social equality for
all genders, in opposition to patriarchy and sexism.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.460
Broadly speaking, feminism advocates the
elimination of gender stratification,

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:15.940
expanding the choices that women, men and other
genders are allowed to make, ending gender-based
violence, and promoting sexual freedom.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.380
There are many forms that feminism can take,
but let’s highlight three major schools of thought
within feminist theory.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:25.220
The first is liberal feminism – and no,
I don’t mean liberal in the political sense.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.780
I mean liberal in the classical sense, rooted in the
ideals of freedom of choice and equal opportunity.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:35.820
Liberal feminists seek to expand the rights
and opportunities of women by removing cultural
and legal barriers to women’s equality,

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.900
like implementing policies that prevent discrimination
in the workforce or improve reproductive freedom.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.140
This contrasts with socialist feminism,

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:49.940
which views capitalism as the foundation of
the patriarchy and advocates for full economic
equality in the socialist tradition.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.720
Socialist feminists tend to believe that the
liberal feminist reforms don’t go far enough

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.100
since they maintain most of the existing institutions
of power.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.140
The third feminist school of thought is
known as radical feminism,

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.220
which believes that to reach gender equality,
society must actually eliminate gender as we know it.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:12.360
Radical feminism has clashed heavily with
other subsets of feminism, particularly on
transgender individuals’ rights.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.600
Many radical feminists refuse to acknowledge
the gender identities of trans women

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.740
and have accused the transgender movement
of perpetuating patriarchal gender norms.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:26.960
And these three ways of thinking about
feminism are only a few of the many views on
how to best advocate for gender equality.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.540
Kinda like how there are many theories within
sociology about how we should think about gender.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.920
Today, we learned about three of those schools
of thought on gender theory.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.200
Structural functionalism sees gender as a
way of organizing society

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.080
and emphasizes the ways that men and women
can act as complements to each other.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.340
Symbolic interactionism looks at gender on
the micro level, exploring how gender guides
day to day life.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:54.800
And gender conflict theory, intersectional theory,
and the theories of feminism focus on the ways
that gender distributes power within society.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:01.460
