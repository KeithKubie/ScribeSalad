what we'll be looking at today things to

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180
what we'll be looking at today things to
 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.940
what we'll be looking at today things to
keep in mind it's supported say on a

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950
keep in mind it's supported say on a
 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.810

nexus 5 it's supported since lollipop

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820
nexus 5 it's supported since lollipop
 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.120
nexus 5 it's supported since lollipop
but some phones won't support it due to

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130
but some phones won't support it due to
 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.920
but some phones won't support it due to
limited hardware on these phones so

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930
limited hardware on these phones so
 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.060
limited hardware on these phones so
you're going to need to programmatically

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070
you're going to need to programmatically
 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.340
you're going to need to programmatically
check if you get into production kind of

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350
check if you get into production kind of
 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.290
check if you get into production kind of
scenario and yeah so let's look at core

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300
scenario and yeah so let's look at core
 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.390
scenario and yeah so let's look at core
opengl context concepts we're going to

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400
opengl context concepts we're going to
 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.950
opengl context concepts we're going to
be playing around with today so we're

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960
be playing around with today so we're
 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.450
be playing around with today so we're
going to go for a minimum effective dose

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460
going to go for a minimum effective dose
 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.030
going to go for a minimum effective dose
right i'm going to try to gloss over a

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040
right i'm going to try to gloss over a
 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.430
right i'm going to try to gloss over a
lot of stuff because we only have so

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440
lot of stuff because we only have so
 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.970
lot of stuff because we only have so
much time and yeah time is precious

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980
much time and yeah time is precious
 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.310
much time and yeah time is precious
right right so we're going to look at

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320
right right so we're going to look at
 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.950
right right so we're going to look at
geometry math and core 3d cons

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960
geometry math and core 3d cons
 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.360
geometry math and core 3d cons
steps and my idea is that not a lot of

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370
steps and my idea is that not a lot of
 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.950
steps and my idea is that not a lot of
people here in the audience have a lot

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960
people here in the audience have a lot
 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.570
people here in the audience have a lot
of previous experience with OpenGL so

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580
of previous experience with OpenGL so
 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.980
of previous experience with OpenGL so
I'm actually going to ask this right now

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990
I'm actually going to ask this right now
 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.350
I'm actually going to ask this right now
who here is actually wrote an app using

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360
who here is actually wrote an app using
 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.200
who here is actually wrote an app using
OpenGL ES two or three right so a few

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210
OpenGL ES two or three right so a few
 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.330
OpenGL ES two or three right so a few
people good like share notes with the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340
people good like share notes with the
 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.909
people good like share notes with the
others if they're you look confused so

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919
others if they're you look confused so
 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.640
others if they're you look confused so
core concepts we're going to be talking

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650
core concepts we're going to be talking
 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.140
core concepts we're going to be talking
about 3d space so you're probably

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150
about 3d space so you're probably
 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.089
about 3d space so you're probably
familiar with the idea of Euclidean

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099
familiar with the idea of Euclidean
 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.689
familiar with the idea of Euclidean

choosing a graph where the axes are sort

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770
choosing a graph where the axes are sort
 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.400
choosing a graph where the axes are sort
of wrong for OpenGL so just to clarify

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410
of wrong for OpenGL so just to clarify
 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.570
of wrong for OpenGL so just to clarify
something on OpenGL this is X this is y

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580
something on OpenGL this is X this is y
 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.700
something on OpenGL this is X this is y
and z is depth right so right then we're

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710
and z is depth right so right then we're
 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.040
and z is depth right so right then we're
going to be talking about the vertex a

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050
going to be talking about the vertex a
 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.860
going to be talking about the vertex a
lot or something called vertices for the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870
lot or something called vertices for the
 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.689
lot or something called vertices for the
thing to note though which might be a

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699
thing to note though which might be a
 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.879
thing to note though which might be a
bit confusing is that we're going to be

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889
bit confusing is that we're going to be
 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.399
bit confusing is that we're going to be
talking of the vertex of course as

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409
talking of the vertex of course as
 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.100
talking of the vertex of course as
points and say an object right as part

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110
points and say an object right as part
 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.870
points and say an object right as part
of like a triangle that composes the

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880
of like a triangle that composes the
 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.399
of like a triangle that composes the
faces of the object that we're going to

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409
faces of the object that we're going to
 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:31.930
faces of the object that we're going to
render but we're also going to be

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940
render but we're also going to be
 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.730
render but we're also going to be
talking about attributes hooked to that

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740
talking about attributes hooked to that
 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.800
talking about attributes hooked to that
vertex so it's not like the pure math

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810
vertex so it's not like the pure math
 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.960
vertex so it's not like the pure math
vertex that we're used to talk about it

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970
vertex that we're used to talk about it
 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.939
vertex that we're used to talk about it
will have other concepts associated to

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949
will have other concepts associated to
 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.399
will have other concepts associated to
it like normals color things like that

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409
it like normals color things like that
 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.070
it like normals color things like that
so vertices assemble into primitives

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080
so vertices assemble into primitives
 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.560
so vertices assemble into primitives
this is like you're really the old

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570
this is like you're really the old
 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.689
this is like you're really the old
school graph from like the red book

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699
school graph from like the red book
 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.240
school graph from like the red book
OpenGL red book from the 90s or even

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250
OpenGL red book from the 90s or even
 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.520
OpenGL red book from the 90s or even
earlier probably the one we're going to

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:57.530
earlier probably the one we're going to
 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.959
earlier probably the one we're going to
be playing with a lot is triangles to

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:01.969
be playing with a lot is triangles to
 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:03.430
be playing with a lot is triangles to
make a distinction between triangles and

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440
make a distinction between triangles and
 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.080
make a distinction between triangles and
triangle strips or fans or all these

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090
triangle strips or fans or all these
 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.149
triangle strips or fans or all these
other things you might be wondering why

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159
other things you might be wondering why
 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.420
other things you might be wondering why
this is this even in the spec and just a

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430
this is this even in the spec and just a
 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.520
this is this even in the spec and just a
quick like we're going to be talking

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530
quick like we're going to be talking
 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.260
quick like we're going to be talking
about performance a little bit one of

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270
about performance a little bit one of
 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.779
about performance a little bit one of
the things with OpenGL is that the more

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789
the things with OpenGL is that the more
 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.610
the things with OpenGL is that the more
data you have to shove into the pipeline

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620
data you have to shove into the pipeline
 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.279
data you have to shove into the pipeline
the slower it gets so you might notice

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289
the slower it gets so you might notice
 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:23.290
the slower it gets so you might notice
here that a triangle strip for example

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300
here that a triangle strip for example
 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.580
here that a triangle strip for example
uses up less vertices than plain old

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590
uses up less vertices than plain old
 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.930
uses up less vertices than plain old
series of triangles right because they

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940
series of triangles right because they
 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.430
series of triangles right because they
share vertices so let's talk about

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440
share vertices so let's talk about
 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.770
share vertices so let's talk about
models so these are wireframe models

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780
models so these are wireframe models
 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.960
models so these are wireframe models
as probably a lot of you know models are

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970
as probably a lot of you know models are
 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.610
as probably a lot of you know models are
actually usually well in this case we're

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620
actually usually well in this case we're
 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.690
actually usually well in this case we're
going to be talking about triangles as

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:41.700
going to be talking about triangles as
 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.190
going to be talking about triangles as
our primitive so all these models will

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.200
our primitive so all these models will
 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.300
our primitive so all these models will
be composed of vertices that form

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310
be composed of vertices that form
 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.490
be composed of vertices that form
triangles that form the model right the

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500
triangles that form the model right the
 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.930
triangles that form the model right the
important point I want to make with this

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940
important point I want to make with this
 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.640
important point I want to make with this
slide is that when you create a model

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650
slide is that when you create a model
 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.500
slide is that when you create a model
say we are going to talk about a cube

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510
say we are going to talk about a cube
 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.680
say we are going to talk about a cube
the the coordinates of the vertices are

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690
the the coordinates of the vertices are
 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.690
the the coordinates of the vertices are
going to be around the 000 origin right

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700
going to be around the 000 origin right
 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.250
going to be around the 000 origin right
so everything is always going to be

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260
so everything is always going to be
 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.140
so everything is always going to be
relative to the origin more for

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150
relative to the origin more for
 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.720
relative to the origin more for
management reasons as will see a bit

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:08.730
management reasons as will see a bit
 

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:12.800
management reasons as will see a bit
later so another concept you have to

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810
later so another concept you have to
 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.940
later so another concept you have to
sort of get your head around these

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:13.950
sort of get your head around these
 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.430
sort of get your head around these
transforms so we're talking about

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440
transforms so we're talking about
 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.890
transforms so we're talking about
translations moving an object in a

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900
translations moving an object in a
 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.250
translations moving an object in a
different point in space rotations

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260
different point in space rotations
 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.830
different point in space rotations
twisting an object and scaling is also

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840
twisting an object and scaling is also
 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.620
twisting an object and scaling is also
one making things bigger or smaller what

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:27.630
one making things bigger or smaller what
 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.969
one making things bigger or smaller what
you might want to note from this slide

around too much with that the good news

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:07.229
around too much with that the good news
 

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:09.920
around too much with that the good news
is that this is all taken care of mostly

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:09.930
is that this is all taken care of mostly
 

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.960

by the SDKs and the API so you don't

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:11.970
by the SDKs and the API so you don't
 

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.279
by the SDKs and the API so you don't
need to worry too much about it you do

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:13.289
need to worry too much about it you do
 

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:15.320
need to worry too much about it you do
need to understand that all the

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:15.330
need to understand that all the
 

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.240
need to understand that all the
operations I've talked about usually end

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.250
operations I've talked about usually end
 

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.610

up in one big matrix and you multiply

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.620
up in one big matrix and you multiply
 

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.980
up in one big matrix and you multiply
your vertex by that matrix and the

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:21.990
your vertex by that matrix and the
 

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.200
your vertex by that matrix and the
vertex will be placed into its its

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.210
vertex will be placed into its its
 

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.860

we'll come back to that all right

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:30.210
we'll come back to that all right
 

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.050
we'll come back to that all right
another big concepts so projections and

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060
another big concepts so projections and
 

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.290
another big concepts so projections and
cameras right so when we're going to

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:36.300
cameras right so when we're going to
 

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.120
cameras right so when we're going to
configure our OpenGL pipeline we're

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.130
configure our OpenGL pipeline we're
 

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:39.409
configure our OpenGL pipeline we're
going to have to set up rules of

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:39.419
going to have to set up rules of
 

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.000
going to have to set up rules of
projection right so if you look at the

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.010
projection right so if you look at the
 

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.219
projection right so if you look at the
first figure the idea is we're telling

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:43.229
first figure the idea is we're telling
 

00:08:43.229 --> 00:08:46.220
first figure the idea is we're telling
GL how to project things so it involves

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.230
GL how to project things so it involves
 

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.780
GL how to project things so it involves
telling it what are the bounds of our

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:47.790
telling it what are the bounds of our
 

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:49.790
telling it what are the bounds of our
view the top the bottom left and right

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800
view the top the bottom left and right
 

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.530
view the top the bottom left and right
and also involves giving it some

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:52.540
and also involves giving it some
 

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.300
and also involves giving it some
configuration so it kind of knows what

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:54.310
configuration so it kind of knows what
 

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.850
configuration so it kind of knows what
is far and what is closed so when it

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:56.860
is far and what is closed so when it
 

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.950
is far and what is closed so when it
comes time to project the vertices we

00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:58.960
comes time to project the vertices we
 

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.380
comes time to project the vertices we
have in 3d space onto our 2d screen or

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:01.390
have in 3d space onto our 2d screen or
 

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.020
have in 3d space onto our 2d screen or
to the rendering area it'll know how to

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.030
to the rendering area it'll know how to
 

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.570
to the rendering area it'll know how to
sort of proportion these things right so

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:06.580
sort of proportion these things right so
 

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.190
sort of proportion these things right so
this is through configuring like that

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.200
this is through configuring like that
 

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.510
this is through configuring like that
again don't get too worried about it

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:09.520
again don't get too worried about it
 

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.280
again don't get too worried about it
you'll see that line of code you

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.290
you'll see that line of code you
 

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.630
you'll see that line of code you
probably won't even notice it it's a one

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640
probably won't even notice it it's a one
 

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.850
probably won't even notice it it's a one
liner but it's a fairly simple thing but

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:14.860
liner but it's a fairly simple thing but
 

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.500
liner but it's a fairly simple thing but
you need to be aware of all this theory

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:16.510
you need to be aware of all this theory
 

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.420
you need to be aware of all this theory
sort of fix things when they start going

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:18.430
sort of fix things when they start going
 

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.660
sort of fix things when they start going
wrong the other diagram is just here to

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:21.670
wrong the other diagram is just here to
 

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.580
wrong the other diagram is just here to
illustrate that we also need to place

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:23.590
illustrate that we also need to place
 

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.680
illustrate that we also need to place
our models but we also need to put the

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:25.690
our models but we also need to put the
 

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.600
our models but we also need to put the
camera in there right so we have the

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:27.610
camera in there right so we have the
 

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.470
camera in there right so we have the
concept of objects in space projected

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480
concept of objects in space projected
 

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.180
concept of objects in space projected
onto a screen but we also have the

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.190
onto a screen but we also have the
 

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.620
onto a screen but we also have the
concept of this camera that's moving

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:34.630
concept of this camera that's moving
 

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.500
concept of this camera that's moving
about and looking at things so that's

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:37.510
about and looking at things so that's
 

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.670
about and looking at things so that's
also an important thing to remember

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:38.680
also an important thing to remember
 

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.430
also an important thing to remember
because that's going to be another OPP

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:41.440
because that's going to be another OPP
 

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.990
because that's going to be another OPP
mathematical operation and we're going

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000
mathematical operation and we're going

to sort of shovel a bit under the carpet

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:44.950
to sort of shovel a bit under the carpet
 

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.080
to sort of shovel a bit under the carpet
but that's going to be there and that

but that's going to be there and that
 

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.960
but that's going to be there and that
you'll want to be aware of all right so

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:48.970
you'll want to be aware of all right so
 

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.750
you'll want to be aware of all right so
lighting lighting is super exciting so

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:49.690
something called diffused lighting will
 

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.570
something called diffused lighting will
be playing with which is the light that

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:51.580
be playing with which is the light that
 

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.610
be playing with which is the light that
reaches your eye after a source of

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:53.620
reaches your eye after a source of
 

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.620
reaches your eye after a source of
lights sort of the Rays bounce off the

lights sort of the Rays bounce off the
 

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.590
lights sort of the Rays bounce off the
surface and reach your eye right so here

00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600
surface and reach your eye right so here
 

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.360
surface and reach your eye right so here
the the amount of light reaching your

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:00.370
the the amount of light reaching your
 

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.730
the the amount of light reaching your
eye will be sort of directly

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:02.740
eye will be sort of directly
 

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.070

that's what this whole Lambert cosine

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:10.270
that's what this whole Lambert cosine
 

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.060
that's what this whole Lambert cosine
law is it going to be about which we're

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:12.070
law is it going to be about which we're
 

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.160
law is it going to be about which we're
going to see in a few frames but again

very easy to calculate all that stuff

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880
very easy to calculate all that stuff
 

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.579
very easy to calculate all that stuff
with OpenGL it's just right now I'm

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:17.589
with OpenGL it's just right now I'm
 

00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:19.110
with OpenGL it's just right now I'm
giving you contact so when you see that

right another important concepts related

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:25.750
right another important concepts related
 

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.139
right another important concepts related
to the lighting is normals so a normal

00:11:28.139 --> 00:11:28.149
to the lighting is normals so a normal
 

00:11:28.149 --> 00:11:30.810
to the lighting is normals so a normal
is a perpendicular vector pointing

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:30.820
is a perpendicular vector pointing
 

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.329
is a perpendicular vector pointing
straight out of a face or the facet of

00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:33.339
straight out of a face or the facet of
 

00:11:33.339 --> 00:11:36.269
straight out of a face or the facet of
shape right but in our case we're going

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279
shape right but in our case we're going
 

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:38.310
shape right but in our case we're going
to have normals associated to verte de

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320
to have normals associated to verte de
 

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:41.699
to have normals associated to verte de
verte asees all right and that's

00:11:41.699 --> 00:11:41.709
verte asees all right and that's
 

00:11:41.709 --> 00:11:43.320
verte asees all right and that's
slightly different because if you look

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:43.330
slightly different because if you look
 

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.530
slightly different because if you look
at the last diagram here we're seeing

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540
at the last diagram here we're seeing
 

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.410
at the last diagram here we're seeing
normals coming out of a bent shape so

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:49.420
normals coming out of a bent shape so
 

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.820
normals coming out of a bent shape so
what happens is that you can sort of

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:50.830
what happens is that you can sort of
 

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.949
what happens is that you can sort of
make approximations with normals where

00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959
make approximations with normals where
 

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:54.600
make approximations with normals where
even if you are actually playing with a

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:54.610
even if you are actually playing with a
 

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.610
even if you are actually playing with a
triangle that triangle is part of a

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:56.620
triangle that triangle is part of a
 

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.470
triangle that triangle is part of a
sphere right you could make it so that

00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480
sphere right you could make it so that
 

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.940
sphere right you could make it so that
the normals are sort of pointing out

00:11:59.940 --> 00:11:59.950
the normals are sort of pointing out
 

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.860
the normals are sort of pointing out
from the center of the sphere so that

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:01.870
from the center of the sphere so that
 

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.199
from the center of the sphere so that
helps the lighting model like this thing

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:04.209
helps the lighting model like this thing
 

00:12:04.209 --> 00:12:06.240
helps the lighting model like this thing
as if it was a sphere and help you get a

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.250
as if it was a sphere and help you get a
 

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.829
as if it was a sphere and help you get a
better simulation of these shapes

00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839
better simulation of these shapes
 

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:11.370
better simulation of these shapes
everything so the other thing I want to

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:11.380
everything so the other thing I want to
 

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.769
everything so the other thing I want to
quickly say is that normals so you might

00:12:13.769 --> 00:12:13.779
quickly say is that normals so you might
 

00:12:13.779 --> 00:12:15.180
quickly say is that normals so you might
all know this already but it's worth

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:15.190
all know this already but it's worth
 

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.490
all know this already but it's worth
mentioning and almost are called normals

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:17.500
mentioning and almost are called normals
 

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.260
mentioning and almost are called normals
because they are normalized vectors

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:19.270
because they are normalized vectors
 

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.600
because they are normalized vectors
meaning that they have one unit length

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:21.610
meaning that they have one unit length
 

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.430
meaning that they have one unit length
we might remember that from one of the

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440
we might remember that from one of the
 

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.690
we might remember that from one of the
your old on my case old math courses so

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:26.700
your old on my case old math courses so
 

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.650
your old on my case old math courses so
just to make it a little reference

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:28.660
just to make it a little reference
 

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.530
just to make it a little reference
alright so we've talked about vertices

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:31.540
alright so we've talked about vertices
 

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.449
alright so we've talked about vertices
and how in OpenGL they're actually a

00:12:33.449 --> 00:12:33.459
and how in OpenGL they're actually a
 

00:12:33.459 --> 00:12:35.370
and how in OpenGL they're actually a
combination of things so in this case I

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.380
combination of things so in this case I
 

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.710
combination of things so in this case I
just wanted to show quickly that you

and look at at it at a very high level

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.100
and look at at it at a very high level
 

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.250

you're going to be calculating on them
 

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.410
you're going to be calculating on them
and you're going to be sort of basically

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:22.420
and you're going to be sort of basically
 

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.720

projecting them onto the screen which

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:24.730
projecting them onto the screen which
 

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.120
projecting them onto the screen which
will allow them that the green part so

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:27.130
will allow them that the green part so
 

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.160
will allow them that the green part so
the yellow parts are programmable stages

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.170
the yellow parts are programmable stages

its what's going to happen it's going to
 

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.750
its what's going to happen it's going to
take the vertex data and it's going to

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:39.760
take the vertex data and it's going to
 

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.420

on to the fragment stage the other
programmable stage fragments are

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:53.620
programmable stage fragments are
 

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.410
programmable stage fragments are
basically programs that are there to

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:34.780
are being computed on which are sort of
 

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.480
are being computed on which are sort of
projected onto a screen and once that

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:36.490
projected onto a screen and once that
 

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.549
projected onto a screen and once that
that's sort of a relationship between

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559
that's sort of a relationship between
 

00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:40.440
that's sort of a relationship between
the model and space and the actual

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:40.450
the model and space and the actual
 

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.260
the model and space and the actual
screen is done then each of these pixels

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:43.270
screen is done then each of these pixels
 

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.950
screen is done then each of these pixels
the

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960
the
 

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.289
the
system knows which shape they belong to

00:17:46.289 --> 00:17:46.299
system knows which shape they belong to
 

00:17:46.299 --> 00:17:48.539
system knows which shape they belong to
so it now knows what computations to

00:17:48.539 --> 00:17:48.549
so it now knows what computations to
 

00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:50.250
so it now knows what computations to
accomplish and what parameters to pass

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:50.260
accomplish and what parameters to pass
 

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.799
accomplish and what parameters to pass

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:57.099
you so setting up the GL pipeline the
 

00:20:57.099 --> 00:20:58.799
you so setting up the GL pipeline the
first step that we quickly glossed over

00:20:58.799 --> 00:20:58.809
first step that we quickly glossed over
 

00:20:58.809 --> 00:21:01.769
first step that we quickly glossed over
in the renderer so on surface created is

00:21:01.769 --> 00:21:01.779
in the renderer so on surface created is
 

00:21:01.779 --> 00:21:05.609
in the renderer so on surface created is
being called with an e GL config I'll

00:21:05.609 --> 00:21:05.619
being called with an e GL config I'll
 

00:21:05.619 --> 00:21:07.680
being called with an e GL config I'll
say it right up front this might be

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:07.690
say it right up front this might be
 

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:08.969
say it right up front this might be
called more than once during the

00:21:08.969 --> 00:21:08.979
called more than once during the
 

00:21:08.979 --> 00:21:10.229
called more than once during the
lifetime of your program if you get

00:21:10.229 --> 00:21:10.239
lifetime of your program if you get
 

00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:11.700
lifetime of your program if you get
called in etc right so you have to be

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:11.710
called in etc right so you have to be
 

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:12.829
called in etc right so you have to be
ready to sort of think about

00:21:12.829 --> 00:21:12.839
ready to sort of think about
 

00:21:12.839 --> 00:21:15.419
ready to sort of think about
reinitializing everything that being

00:21:15.419 --> 00:21:15.429
reinitializing everything that being
 

00:21:15.429 --> 00:21:18.029
reinitializing everything that being
said the steps here most of the

00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039
said the steps here most of the
 

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:19.829
said the steps here most of the
complexity of the steps is abstracted in

00:21:19.829 --> 00:21:19.839
complexity of the steps is abstracted in
 

00:21:19.839 --> 00:21:22.619
complexity of the steps is abstracted in
the class i called geometry which you

00:21:22.619 --> 00:21:22.629
the class i called geometry which you
 

00:21:22.629 --> 00:21:24.839
the class i called geometry which you
can see in my actual sample code that's

00:21:24.839 --> 00:21:24.849
can see in my actual sample code that's
 

00:21:24.849 --> 00:21:26.489
can see in my actual sample code that's
available on my github with a link at

00:21:26.489 --> 00:21:26.499
available on my github with a link at
 

00:21:26.499 --> 00:21:28.709
available on my github with a link at
the end of the talk i just wanted to you

00:21:28.709 --> 00:21:28.719
the end of the talk i just wanted to you
 

00:21:28.719 --> 00:21:30.029
the end of the talk i just wanted to you
know give you the basic so you get

00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039
know give you the basic so you get
 

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:34.379
know give you the basic so you get
started so in it buffers yeah so that's

00:21:34.379 --> 00:21:34.389
started so in it buffers yeah so that's
 

00:21:34.389 --> 00:21:38.009
started so in it buffers yeah so that's
step one then step two is going to be in

00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:38.019
step one then step two is going to be in
 

00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:40.469
step one then step two is going to be in
a GL program so those yellow steps in

00:21:40.469 --> 00:21:40.479
a GL program so those yellow steps in
 

00:21:40.479 --> 00:21:41.639
a GL program so those yellow steps in
the pipeline we're going to configure

00:21:41.639 --> 00:21:41.649
the pipeline we're going to configure
 

00:21:41.649 --> 00:21:43.399
the pipeline we're going to configure
those after setting up the buffers and

00:21:43.399 --> 00:21:43.409
those after setting up the buffers and
 

00:21:43.409 --> 00:21:46.499
those after setting up the buffers and
then after we've set up the programs

00:21:46.499 --> 00:21:46.509
then after we've set up the programs
 

00:21:46.509 --> 00:21:48.119
then after we've set up the programs
we're going to initialize handles so

00:21:48.119 --> 00:21:48.129
we're going to initialize handles so
 

00:21:48.129 --> 00:21:50.039
we're going to initialize handles so
let's look each of those steps and break

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:50.049
let's look each of those steps and break
 

00:21:50.049 --> 00:21:52.440
let's look each of those steps and break
them down what they actually do right

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:52.450
them down what they actually do right
 

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.649
them down what they actually do right
step one initializing buffers this is

00:21:55.649 --> 00:21:55.659
step one initializing buffers this is
 

00:21:55.659 --> 00:21:57.659
step one initializing buffers this is
basically initializing a chunk of memory

00:21:57.659 --> 00:21:57.669
basically initializing a chunk of memory
 

00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:59.909
basically initializing a chunk of memory
so that we can shove floats in there

00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919
so that we can shove floats in there
 

00:21:59.919 --> 00:22:02.430
so that we can shove floats in there
that will be our vertices and our

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440
that will be our vertices and our
 

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.999
that will be our vertices and our
vertice attribute vertex attributes all

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:05.009
vertice attribute vertex attributes all
 

00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:07.440
vertice attribute vertex attributes all
bundled in there so that we can then

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:07.450
bundled in there so that we can then
 

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.000
bundled in there so that we can then
pass it to the pipeline

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.010
pass it to the pipeline
 

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.680
pass it to the pipeline
so as you can see it's fairly

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:10.690
so as you can see it's fairly
 

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.780
so as you can see it's fairly
straightforward code not much to say

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:12.790
straightforward code not much to say
 

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.610
straightforward code not much to say
here except you're sort of almost in

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:14.620
here except you're sort of almost in
 

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.250
here except you're sort of almost in
cland but that's so gonna have to get

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:17.260
cland but that's so gonna have to get
 

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.290
cland but that's so gonna have to get
used to it OpenGL of it it's not that

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:19.300
used to it OpenGL of it it's not that
 

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.980
used to it OpenGL of it it's not that
complicated right so step 2.1

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:21.990
complicated right so step 2.1
 

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.600
complicated right so step 2.1
initializing the jail program I even

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:24.610
initializing the jail program I even
 

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:25.890
initializing the jail program I even
bothered putting this here just to

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:25.900
bothered putting this here just to
 

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.570
bothered putting this here just to
remind you that we're talking about the

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:27.580
remind you that we're talking about the
 

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.070
remind you that we're talking about the
yellow stages programmable stage of the

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:29.080
yellow stages programmable stage of the
 

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.740
yellow stages programmable stage of the
pipeline and that to mention that vertex

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:31.750
pipeline and that to mention that vertex
 

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.450
pipeline and that to mention that vertex
shader code and fragment shader code are

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:33.460
shader code and fragment shader code are
 

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.100
shader code and fragment shader code are
actually big string blobs they're

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:35.110
actually big string blobs they're
 

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.740
actually big string blobs they're
actually this source code that's what

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:37.750
actually this source code that's what
 

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:42.630
actually this source code that's what
we're passing in there and so yeah we

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640
we're passing in there and so yeah we
 

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.640
we're passing in there and so yeah we
won't dig into the load shader method

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:44.650
won't dig into the load shader method
 

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.590
won't dig into the load shader method
that you said the top because it's

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600
that you said the top because it's
 

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.110
that you said the top because it's
pretty much the same process as what's

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120
pretty much the same process as what's
 

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.790
pretty much the same process as what's
happening below here so the first thing

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:50.800
happening below here so the first thing
 

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.970
happening below here so the first thing
you do is you call a GL so notice

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:53.980
you do is you call a GL so notice
 

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.650
you do is you call a GL so notice
they're all like static method calls

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:55.660
they're all like static method calls
 

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.970
they're all like static method calls
like every time you interact with the

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:56.980
like every time you interact with the
 

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.650
like every time you interact with the
pipeline it's that kind of call in this

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:58.660
pipeline it's that kind of call in this
 

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.010
pipeline it's that kind of call in this
case we're using GL es 30 you might have

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:02.020
case we're using GL es 30 you might have
 

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.740
case we're using GL es 30 you might have
been using 20 before or whatever so the

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:04.750
been using 20 before or whatever so the
 

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.870
been using 20 before or whatever so the
number changes depending on features

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880
number changes depending on features
 

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.630
number changes depending on features
that you're using so we're creating a

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:09.640
that you're using so we're creating a
 

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.040
that you're using so we're creating a
program we're getting a handle to a

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.050
program we're getting a handle to a
 

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.420
program we're getting a handle to a
program so we're basically telling the

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:12.430
program so we're basically telling the
 

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:14.100
program so we're basically telling the
pipeline create a program object for me

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:14.110
pipeline create a program object for me
 

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.170
pipeline create a program object for me
and it's giving us back the pointer

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:16.180
and it's giving us back the pointer
 

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.890
and it's giving us back the pointer
pretty much then we can take we've used

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:19.900
pretty much then we can take we've used
 

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.270
pretty much then we can take we've used
the same kind of process to create

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:21.280
the same kind of process to create
 

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.700
the same kind of process to create
handles to vertex shader and fragment

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:23.710
handles to vertex shader and fragment
 

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.010
handles to vertex shader and fragment
shader up top right so at that point we

00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:26.020
shader up top right so at that point we
 

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.810
shader up top right so at that point we
take those two handles that have been

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:27.820
take those two handles that have been
 

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.730
take those two handles that have been
initializing the pipeline and we pass

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:29.740
initializing the pipeline and we pass
 

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.460
initializing the pipeline and we pass
those two shaders into the program to

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:32.470
those two shaders into the program to
 

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.420
those two shaders into the program to
finish with a link call so the fun part

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:36.430
finish with a link call so the fun part
 

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.590
finish with a link call so the fun part
and we'll see that later is that when

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600
and we'll see that later is that when
 

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.030
and we'll see that later is that when
you do this you're going to actually get

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:39.040
you do this you're going to actually get
 

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.610
you do this you're going to actually get
feedback from OpenGL as to whether or

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:41.620
feedback from OpenGL as to whether or
 

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.020
feedback from OpenGL as to whether or
not you have compile errors and they're

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.030
not you have compile errors and they're
 

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.970
not you have compile errors and they're
going to be a bit verbose so that's

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:44.980
going to be a bit verbose so that's
 

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.060
going to be a bit verbose so that's
going to be interesting in a few slides

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:47.070
going to be interesting in a few slides
 

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:51.240
going to be interesting in a few slides
alright so step 3 so I've talked about

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:51.250
alright so step 3 so I've talked about
 

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.520
alright so step 3 so I've talked about
the handles right so in this this is how

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:53.530
the handles right so in this this is how
 

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:57.300
the handles right so in this this is how
you get them literally give the string

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:57.310
you get them literally give the string
 

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.660
you get them literally give the string
that's going to be then they will see in

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:00.670
that's going to be then they will see in
 

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.640
that's going to be then they will see in
the shader that's the actual variable

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:02.650
the shader that's the actual variable
 

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.130
the shader that's the actual variable
name so it's through a string might seem

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:05.140
name so it's through a string might seem
 

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:08.310
name so it's through a string might seem
a bit clumsy other way but yeah all

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320
a bit clumsy other way but yeah all
 

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.110
a bit clumsy other way but yeah all
right so this is our first shader the

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.120
right so this is our first shader the
 

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.270
right so this is our first shader the
vertex shader it's not well it's a

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:12.280
vertex shader it's not well it's a
 

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.780
vertex shader it's not well it's a
fairly simple semi pass through vertex

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:15.790
fairly simple semi pass through vertex
 

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.760
fairly simple semi pass through vertex
shader so this means that we're not

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:17.770
shader so this means that we're not
 

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.169
shader so this means that we're not
doing much here except a

00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179
doing much here except a
 

00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:23.729
doing much here except a
assigning transforming our current

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:23.739

00:24:23.739 --> 00:24:25.799
assigning transforming our current
vertex into its final position as I

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:25.809
vertex into its final position as I
 

00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:27.810
vertex into its final position as I
talked about earlier right so we apply

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:27.820
talked about earlier right so we apply
 

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.999
talked about earlier right so we apply
Model View and projection

00:24:29.999 --> 00:24:30.009
Model View and projection
 

00:24:30.009 --> 00:24:32.279
Model View and projection
transformations that are stored in this

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:32.289
transformations that are stored in this
 

00:24:32.289 --> 00:24:34.529
transformations that are stored in this
matrix 0 1 matrix can be a bundle of

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:34.539
matrix 0 1 matrix can be a bundle of
 

00:24:34.539 --> 00:24:36.359
matrix 0 1 matrix can be a bundle of
transformation that you can apply it in

00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:36.369
transformation that you can apply it in
 

00:24:36.369 --> 00:24:37.680
transformation that you can apply it in
one shot and that's what we're doing

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:37.690
one shot and that's what we're doing
 

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.779
one shot and that's what we're doing
here right so that lets us know where

00:24:39.779 --> 00:24:39.789
here right so that lets us know where
 

00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:41.430
here right so that lets us know where
that vertex is going to end up on screen

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440
that vertex is going to end up on screen
 

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.680
that vertex is going to end up on screen
for the fragment shader is going to come

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:43.690
for the fragment shader is going to come
 

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.810
for the fragment shader is going to come
along afterwards to get its list of

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:45.820
along afterwards to get its list of
 

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:52.349
along afterwards to get its list of
pixels right so yeah while we're here

00:24:52.349 --> 00:24:52.359
pixels right so yeah while we're here
 

00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:54.029
pixels right so yeah while we're here
these are so yeah we have to mention

00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039
these are so yeah we have to mention
 

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:55.710
these are so yeah we have to mention
these are the inputs that we just used

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720
these are the inputs that we just used
 

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.359
these are the inputs that we just used
in our Java code so I'm just want to

00:24:57.359 --> 00:24:57.369
in our Java code so I'm just want to
 

00:24:57.369 --> 00:24:58.649
in our Java code so I'm just want to
point those out right so you make a

00:24:58.649 --> 00:24:58.659
point those out right so you make a
 

00:24:58.659 --> 00:25:00.960
point those out right so you make a
direct mental link between the two and

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:00.970
direct mental link between the two and
 

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.930
direct mental link between the two and
the outputs are kind of important and

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:03.940
the outputs are kind of important and
 

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.219
the outputs are kind of important and
this syntax is actually slightly

00:25:05.219 --> 00:25:05.229
this syntax is actually slightly
 

00:25:05.229 --> 00:25:06.869
this syntax is actually slightly
different than es tu for people who've

00:25:06.869 --> 00:25:06.879
different than es tu for people who've
 

00:25:06.879 --> 00:25:08.940
different than es tu for people who've
done es-tu before like in and out i

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:08.950
done es-tu before like in and out i
 

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:12.210
done es-tu before like in and out i
don't believe we're in GL es tu so it's

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:12.220
don't believe we're in GL es tu so it's
 

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.589
don't believe we're in GL es tu so it's
good to know these things because you

00:25:13.589 --> 00:25:13.599
good to know these things because you
 

00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:15.779
good to know these things because you
might your old things might break if you

00:25:15.779 --> 00:25:15.789
might your old things might break if you
 

00:25:15.789 --> 00:25:18.389
might your old things might break if you
start doing 3.1 poetry alright and the

00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399
start doing 3.1 poetry alright and the
 

00:25:18.399 --> 00:25:20.009
start doing 3.1 poetry alright and the
output basically are things that are

00:25:20.009 --> 00:25:20.019
output basically are things that are
 

00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:22.589
output basically are things that are
going to be passed on varying variable

00:25:22.589 --> 00:25:22.599
going to be passed on varying variable
 

00:25:22.599 --> 00:25:24.210
going to be passed on varying variable
buryings that are going to be passed on

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:24.220
buryings that are going to be passed on
 

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.169
buryings that are going to be passed on
to the fragment shader so varying as

00:25:28.169 --> 00:25:28.179
to the fragment shader so varying as
 

00:25:28.179 --> 00:25:29.849
to the fragment shader so varying as
well I won't get into that concept right

00:25:29.849 --> 00:25:29.859
well I won't get into that concept right
 

00:25:29.859 --> 00:25:31.200
well I won't get into that concept right
now but we can talk about it later if

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:31.210
now but we can talk about it later if
 

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.969
now but we can talk about it later if
you're interested maybe after the talk

00:25:32.969 --> 00:25:32.979
you're interested maybe after the talk
 

00:25:32.979 --> 00:25:35.460
you're interested maybe after the talk
all right so last big point here is that

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:35.470
all right so last big point here is that
 

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:37.289
all right so last big point here is that
we're going to set our color or V color

00:25:37.289 --> 00:25:37.299
we're going to set our color or V color
 

00:25:37.299 --> 00:25:38.190
we're going to set our color or V color
that's going to be passed to the

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200
that's going to be passed to the
 

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.430
that's going to be passed to the
fragment shader right 2 1 1111 which

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440
fragment shader right 2 1 1111 which
 

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.810
fragment shader right 2 1 1111 which
means like white pixel or a rather white

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:45.820
means like white pixel or a rather white
 

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.899
means like white pixel or a rather white
vertex attribute I should say and then

00:25:48.899 --> 00:25:48.909
vertex attribute I should say and then
 

00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:51.359
vertex attribute I should say and then
next up in the pipeline as illustrated

00:25:51.359 --> 00:25:51.369
next up in the pipeline as illustrated
 

00:25:51.369 --> 00:25:54.060
next up in the pipeline as illustrated
here we have our fragment shader with

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:54.070
here we have our fragment shader with
 

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.159
here we have our fragment shader with
the color being passed into it and we

00:25:56.159 --> 00:25:56.169
the color being passed into it and we
 

00:25:56.169 --> 00:25:58.769
the color being passed into it and we
see that all it's doing is taking the

00:25:58.769 --> 00:25:58.779
see that all it's doing is taking the
 

00:25:58.779 --> 00:26:00.570
see that all it's doing is taking the
color that was given to it by the vertex

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:00.580
color that was given to it by the vertex
 

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.190
color that was given to it by the vertex
shader and just saying ok that's the

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200
shader and just saying ok that's the
 

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.810
shader and just saying ok that's the
color of my pixel that's it not doing

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:03.820
color of my pixel that's it not doing
 

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.669
color of my pixel that's it not doing
anything that's another pass through

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679
anything that's another pass through
 

00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:09.210
anything that's another pass through
shader all right so what does this give

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:09.220
shader all right so what does this give
 

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.960
shader all right so what does this give
us so once the code once the steps in

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:12.970
us so once the code once the steps in
 

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.169
us so once the code once the steps in
the pipeline have executed right

00:26:15.169 --> 00:26:15.179
the pipeline have executed right
 

00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:18.119
the pipeline have executed right
following a call to draw i'm calling it

00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:18.129
following a call to draw i'm calling it
 

00:26:18.129 --> 00:26:20.369
following a call to draw i'm calling it
simple draw here because it's more of an

00:26:20.369 --> 00:26:20.379
simple draw here because it's more of an
 

00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:23.099
simple draw here because it's more of an
example so i just wanted to show you how

00:26:23.099 --> 00:26:23.109
example so i just wanted to show you how
 

00:26:23.109 --> 00:26:25.349
example so i just wanted to show you how
that works so first step right we're

00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:25.359
that works so first step right we're
 

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:27.810
that works so first step right we're
going to use the program so if you

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:27.820
going to use the program so if you
 

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.249
going to use the program so if you
remember when we initialize that's where

00:26:29.249 --> 00:26:29.259
remember when we initialize that's where
 

00:26:29.259 --> 00:26:31.079
remember when we initialize that's where
we basically tell up in jail ok those

00:26:31.079 --> 00:26:31.089
we basically tell up in jail ok those
 

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:33.149
we basically tell up in jail ok those
traders I've configured time to use them

00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159
traders I've configured time to use them
 

00:26:33.159 --> 00:26:34.590
traders I've configured time to use them
now

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:34.600
now
 

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:38.100
now
and we pass data to those shaders so we

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:38.110
and we pass data to those shaders so we
 

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:39.659
and we pass data to those shaders so we
already have our handles right we have

00:26:39.659 --> 00:26:39.669
already have our handles right we have
 

00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:40.950
already have our handles right we have
our variables into which we're pushing

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960
our variables into which we're pushing
 

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.810
our variables into which we're pushing
the data so we're bridging the gap

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:42.820
the data so we're bridging the gap
 

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.720
the data so we're bridging the gap
between the two again alright so we pass

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:45.730
between the two again alright so we pass
 

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.560
between the two again alright so we pass
our projection matrix or transform

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:49.570
our projection matrix or transform
 

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.600
our projection matrix or transform
matrix sorry and then we also pass

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:51.610
matrix sorry and then we also pass
 

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.970
matrix sorry and then we also pass
vertices and normals in a big bunch

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:53.980
vertices and normals in a big bunch
 

00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.210
vertices and normals in a big bunch
right and then the last call here draw

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:57.220
right and then the last call here draw
 

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.880
right and then the last call here draw
arrays so we're just basically drawing a

00:26:59.880 --> 00:26:59.890
arrays so we're just basically drawing a
 

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.860
arrays so we're just basically drawing a
number of and then we're giving it the

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:01.870
number of and then we're giving it the
 

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.840
number of and then we're giving it the
number of vertexes in their vertices in

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:03.850
number of vertexes in their vertices in
 

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.850
number of vertexes in their vertices in
there and you might notice that the

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:05.860
there and you might notice that the
 

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:07.649
there and you might notice that the
first parameter of GL triangles is us

00:27:07.649 --> 00:27:07.659
first parameter of GL triangles is us
 

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:09.600
first parameter of GL triangles is us
telling OpenGL so I'm passing all these

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:09.610
telling OpenGL so I'm passing all these
 

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.270
telling OpenGL so I'm passing all these
vertices and they're triangles it could

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:12.280
vertices and they're triangles it could
 

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.649
vertices and they're triangles it could
have been triangle strip if our

00:27:13.649 --> 00:27:13.659
have been triangle strip if our
 

00:27:13.659 --> 00:27:15.090
have been triangle strip if our
information was configured differently

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:15.100
information was configured differently
 

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.919
information was configured differently
they're not we were trying to keep

00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:16.929
they're not we were trying to keep
 

00:27:16.929 --> 00:27:19.169
they're not we were trying to keep
things simple well I didn't mention this

00:27:19.169 --> 00:27:19.179
things simple well I didn't mention this
 

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:20.610
things simple well I didn't mention this
but obviously at the bottom here you see

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:20.620
but obviously at the bottom here you see
 

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.169
but obviously at the bottom here you see
the result of this it's a white square

00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:22.179
the result of this it's a white square
 

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:23.730
the result of this it's a white square
white cube actually what we were facing

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:23.740
white cube actually what we were facing
 

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.020
white cube actually what we were facing
in our demo program all right oops yeah

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:28.030
in our demo program all right oops yeah
 

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:29.970
in our demo program all right oops yeah
one of those sorry all right basic

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:29.980
one of those sorry all right basic
 

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.580
one of those sorry all right basic
lighting so we're trying to fly through

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:32.590
lighting so we're trying to fly through
 

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.370
lighting so we're trying to fly through
a lot of this stuff so can come and ask

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:35.380
a lot of this stuff so can come and ask
 

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.750
a lot of this stuff so can come and ask
me questions after if you're kind of

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760
me questions after if you're kind of
 

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.520
me questions after if you're kind of
like you might a bit faster or what the

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:38.530
like you might a bit faster or what the
 

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.039
like you might a bit faster or what the
hell was that so basic light model if we

00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:41.049
hell was that so basic light model if we
 

00:27:41.049 --> 00:27:42.810
hell was that so basic light model if we
use the shader as we've configured them

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:42.820
use the shader as we've configured them
 

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:44.010
use the shader as we've configured them
right now this is what we're going to

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:44.020
right now this is what we're going to
 

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.630
right now this is what we're going to
get when we're going to rotate our cube

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640
get when we're going to rotate our cube
 

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:50.070
get when we're going to rotate our cube
in space not exactly great what we want

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080
in space not exactly great what we want
 

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.610
in space not exactly great what we want
is this on the right so we need to have

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:53.620
is this on the right so we need to have
 

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.070
is this on the right so we need to have
a minimum of lighting in there to our

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080
a minimum of lighting in there to our
 

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.810
a minimum of lighting in there to our
scene for I seem to do any kind of sense

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:57.820
scene for I seem to do any kind of sense
 

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.549
scene for I seem to do any kind of sense
and we're not going to go beyond minimum

00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559
and we're not going to go beyond minimum
 

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:01.140
and we're not going to go beyond minimum
because there's ways of that rabbit hole

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.150
because there's ways of that rabbit hole
 

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.120
because there's ways of that rabbit hole
is pretty deep and pretty awesome but

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.130
is pretty deep and pretty awesome but
 

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.060
is pretty deep and pretty awesome but
you know we want to get somewhere today

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:05.070
you know we want to get somewhere today
 

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.850
you know we want to get somewhere today
so how do we get to this we need a light

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:08.860
so how do we get to this we need a light
 

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.390
so how do we get to this we need a light
source we're hard coating it in the

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:12.400
source we're hard coating it in the
 

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.270
source we're hard coating it in the
shader here but and then you can see

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:15.280
shader here but and then you can see
 

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.100
shader here but and then you can see
that at the very top right so the you

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.110
that at the very top right so the you
 

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:19.649
that at the very top right so the you
like pause right there but you can also

00:28:19.649 --> 00:28:19.659
like pause right there but you can also
 

00:28:19.659 --> 00:28:23.250
like pause right there but you can also
know how we apply the you MV matrix here

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:23.260
know how we apply the you MV matrix here
 

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.919
know how we apply the you MV matrix here
not MVP so there's an important little

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:25.929
not MVP so there's an important little
 

00:28:25.929 --> 00:28:27.360
not MVP so there's an important little
distinction here that you'll see in the

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:27.370
distinction here that you'll see in the
 

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:29.789
distinction here that you'll see in the
example code it's because you want to

00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799
example code it's because you want to
 

00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:32.700
example code it's because you want to
put that light in 3d space not projected

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:32.710
put that light in 3d space not projected
 

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.500
put that light in 3d space not projected
on screen right because you're still

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:34.510
on screen right because you're still
 

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.270
on screen right because you're still
sort of working in the theoretical model

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:36.280
sort of working in the theoretical model
 

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:38.159
sort of working in the theoretical model
you want to put all the points in space

00:28:38.159 --> 00:28:38.169
you want to put all the points in space
 

00:28:38.169 --> 00:28:39.659
you want to put all the points in space
at the right place right so you're

00:28:39.659 --> 00:28:39.669
at the right place right so you're
 

00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:40.740
at the right place right so you're
taking that light you're putting it here

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:40.750
taking that light you're putting it here
 

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.320
taking that light you're putting it here
and you want it to be sort of moved

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:43.330
and you want it to be sort of moved
 

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.899
and you want it to be sort of moved
relative to the camera etc but you don't

00:28:45.899 --> 00:28:45.909
relative to the camera etc but you don't
 

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:47.159
relative to the camera etc but you don't
want it project it on screen because

00:28:47.159 --> 00:28:47.169
want it project it on screen because
 

00:28:47.169 --> 00:28:47.769
want it project it on screen because
you're still at the

00:28:47.769 --> 00:28:47.779
you're still at the
 

00:28:47.779 --> 00:28:49.119
you're still at the
that were you can calculating

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:49.129
that were you can calculating
 

00:28:49.129 --> 00:28:51.549
that were you can calculating
theoretical stuff right you're not yet

00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559
theoretical stuff right you're not yet
 

00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:52.959
theoretical stuff right you're not yet
in screen space so that's why the

00:28:52.959 --> 00:28:52.969
in screen space so that's why the
 

00:28:52.969 --> 00:28:56.200
in screen space so that's why the
projection part is not there alright so

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:56.210
projection part is not there alright so
 

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:58.239
projection part is not there alright so
our point light source point light

00:28:58.239 --> 00:28:58.249
our point light source point light
 

00:28:58.249 --> 00:29:00.549
our point light source point light
source one point emits raised in all

00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559
source one point emits raised in all
 

00:29:00.559 --> 00:29:03.969
source one point emits raised in all
directions right all right transforming

00:29:03.969 --> 00:29:03.979
directions right all right transforming
 

00:29:03.979 --> 00:29:06.609
directions right all right transforming
the vertex into ice space so we're

00:29:06.609 --> 00:29:06.619
the vertex into ice space so we're
 

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:09.609
the vertex into ice space so we're
applying the same model view transform

00:29:09.609 --> 00:29:09.619
applying the same model view transform
 

00:29:09.619 --> 00:29:12.070
applying the same model view transform
to our vertex and our normal because all

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080
to our vertex and our normal because all
 

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.200
to our vertex and our normal because all
these three things along sigh mean with

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.210
these three things along sigh mean with
 

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.479
these three things along sigh mean with
the light source right are going to be

00:29:16.479 --> 00:29:16.489
the light source right are going to be
 

00:29:16.489 --> 00:29:18.580
the light source right are going to be
used in in the calculations to find out

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:18.590
used in in the calculations to find out
 

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.999
used in in the calculations to find out
what color we should be giving our

00:29:20.999 --> 00:29:21.009
what color we should be giving our
 

00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:26.049
what color we should be giving our
vertex right then the way to find that

00:29:26.049 --> 00:29:26.059
vertex right then the way to find that
 

00:29:26.059 --> 00:29:29.409
vertex right then the way to find that
out we get a light direction vector from

00:29:29.409 --> 00:29:29.419
out we get a light direction vector from
 

00:29:29.419 --> 00:29:32.289
out we get a light direction vector from
the light source right to the vertex so

00:29:32.289 --> 00:29:32.299
the light source right to the vertex so
 

00:29:32.299 --> 00:29:34.629
the light source right to the vertex so
we find out what that vertex is that

00:29:34.629 --> 00:29:34.639
we find out what that vertex is that
 

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:40.209
we find out what that vertex is that
sorry that vector is then we calculate

00:29:40.209 --> 00:29:40.219
sorry that vector is then we calculate
 

00:29:40.219 --> 00:29:42.789
sorry that vector is then we calculate
the famous Lambert factor so that's

00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799
the famous Lambert factor so that's
 

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:44.979
the famous Lambert factor so that's
actually very very simple right we just

00:29:44.979 --> 00:29:44.989
actually very very simple right we just
 

00:29:44.989 --> 00:29:46.690
actually very very simple right we just
want the angle between the normal and

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:46.700
want the angle between the normal and
 

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.909
want the angle between the normal and
the light vectors and having that angle

00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919
the light vectors and having that angle
 

00:29:48.919 --> 00:29:50.560
the light vectors and having that angle
allows us to determine what kind of

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:50.570
allows us to determine what kind of
 

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.579
allows us to determine what kind of
shade we're going to give to that

00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:51.589
shade we're going to give to that
 

00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:55.180
shade we're going to give to that
surface the point one at the bottom

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:55.190
surface the point one at the bottom
 

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.909
surface the point one at the bottom
actually you might wonder so the actual

00:29:57.909 --> 00:29:57.919
actually you might wonder so the actual
 

00:29:57.919 --> 00:29:59.709
actually you might wonder so the actual
finding out of the angles the dot

00:29:59.709 --> 00:29:59.719
finding out of the angles the dot
 

00:29:59.719 --> 00:30:01.389
finding out of the angles the dot
product we see there so that dot method

00:30:01.389 --> 00:30:01.399
product we see there so that dot method
 

00:30:01.399 --> 00:30:03.639
product we see there so that dot method
being called with Model View normal and

00:30:03.639 --> 00:30:03.649
being called with Model View normal and
 

00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:05.469
being called with Model View normal and
light vector that's the one that

00:30:05.469 --> 00:30:05.479
light vector that's the one that
 

00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:08.379
light vector that's the one that
calculates the angle and the max part

00:30:08.379 --> 00:30:08.389
calculates the angle and the max part
 

00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:10.869
calculates the angle and the max part
with the second parameter being zero

00:30:10.869 --> 00:30:10.879
with the second parameter being zero
 

00:30:10.879 --> 00:30:12.669
with the second parameter being zero
point one that's the minimum amount of

00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679
point one that's the minimum amount of
 

00:30:12.679 --> 00:30:14.229
point one that's the minimum amount of
light that's going to be on the surface

00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:14.239
light that's going to be on the surface
 

00:30:14.239 --> 00:30:16.839
light that's going to be on the surface
but I talked about ambient light this is

00:30:16.839 --> 00:30:16.849
but I talked about ambient light this is
 

00:30:16.849 --> 00:30:18.909
but I talked about ambient light this is
ambient light and the dot product is the

00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919
ambient light and the dot product is the
 

00:30:18.919 --> 00:30:21.129
ambient light and the dot product is the
Lambert factor it which is diffusion

00:30:21.129 --> 00:30:21.139
Lambert factor it which is diffusion
 

00:30:21.139 --> 00:30:24.399
Lambert factor it which is diffusion
light all right and then we multiply

00:30:24.399 --> 00:30:24.409
light all right and then we multiply
 

00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:26.649
light all right and then we multiply
that with the color of the object right

00:30:26.649 --> 00:30:26.659
that with the color of the object right
 

00:30:26.659 --> 00:30:28.269
that with the color of the object right
so far our object is white we multiply

00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279
so far our object is white we multiply
 

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:29.680
so far our object is white we multiply
it by white it's going to give us a

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:29.690
it by white it's going to give us a
 

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.039
it by white it's going to give us a
varying factor and we're done all right

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:33.049
varying factor and we're done all right
 

00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:35.289
varying factor and we're done all right
so that running that gave us the the

00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:35.299
so that running that gave us the the
 

00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:38.440
so that running that gave us the the
screenshot we saw earlier so let's

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:38.450
screenshot we saw earlier so let's
 

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.479
screenshot we saw earlier so let's
enable the cardboard SDK now enough flat

00:30:40.479 --> 00:30:40.489
enable the cardboard SDK now enough flat
 

00:30:40.489 --> 00:30:44.049
enable the cardboard SDK now enough flat
3d we're done all right so a very simple

00:30:44.049 --> 00:30:44.059
3d we're done all right so a very simple
 

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:46.209
3d we're done all right so a very simple
first thing this is your layout you just

00:30:46.209 --> 00:30:46.219
first thing this is your layout you just
 

00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:48.039
first thing this is your layout you just
want to full on cardboard view that

00:30:48.039 --> 00:30:48.049
want to full on cardboard view that
 

00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:51.249
want to full on cardboard view that
fills out your whole view space then

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:51.259
fills out your whole view space then
 

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:53.709
fills out your whole view space then
your main activity in this case VR talk

00:30:53.709 --> 00:30:53.719
your main activity in this case VR talk
 

00:30:53.719 --> 00:30:57.460
your main activity in this case VR talk
activity so these three lines

00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:57.470
activity so these three lines
 

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.259
activity so these three lines
highlighted here or what you need to

00:30:59.259 --> 00:30:59.269
highlighted here or what you need to
 

00:30:59.269 --> 00:31:00.649
highlighted here or what you need to
actually configure your view

00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659
actually configure your view
 

00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:03.289
actually configure your view
so you set vr mode enabled to whatever

00:31:03.289 --> 00:31:03.299
so you set vr mode enabled to whatever
 

00:31:03.299 --> 00:31:05.509
so you set vr mode enabled to whatever
in this case I set it to false just to

00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519
in this case I set it to false just to
 

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:07.369
in this case I set it to false just to
show you you know what happens when you

00:31:07.369 --> 00:31:07.379
show you you know what happens when you
 

00:31:07.379 --> 00:31:08.659
show you you know what happens when you
don't have you are enabled you're just

00:31:08.659 --> 00:31:08.669
don't have you are enabled you're just
 

00:31:08.669 --> 00:31:10.159
don't have you are enabled you're just
seeing a plain magic window type thing

00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:10.169
seeing a plain magic window type thing
 

00:31:10.169 --> 00:31:13.940
seeing a plain magic window type thing
and turning it on just gives us

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:13.950
and turning it on just gives us
 

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.279
and turning it on just gives us
stereoview so at this point what's

00:31:16.279 --> 00:31:16.289
stereoview so at this point what's
 

00:31:16.289 --> 00:31:18.529
stereoview so at this point what's
happening is we're calling the draw

00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539
happening is we're calling the draw
 

00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:21.200
happening is we're calling the draw
methods twice for half the screen with

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:21.210
methods twice for half the screen with
 

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.719
methods twice for half the screen with
different camera perspectives right

00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:23.729
different camera perspectives right
 

00:31:23.729 --> 00:31:27.529
different camera perspectives right
those two eyes and this is the result at

00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539
those two eyes and this is the result at
 

00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:28.700
those two eyes and this is the result at
this point we can just slip this in a

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:28.710
this point we can just slip this in a
 

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.169
this point we can just slip this in a
cardboard unit and we're good we're

00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:30.179
cardboard unit and we're good we're
 

00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:33.529
cardboard unit and we're good we're
apster s copy stereoscopy wait I'll get

00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539
apster s copy stereoscopy wait I'll get
 

00:31:33.539 --> 00:31:37.070
apster s copy stereoscopy wait I'll get
it one day right so what does this look

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080
it one day right so what does this look
 

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.869
it one day right so what does this look
like there's two parts now instead of

00:31:38.869 --> 00:31:38.879
like there's two parts now instead of
 

00:31:38.879 --> 00:31:40.820
like there's two parts now instead of
just having one draw command we have to

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:40.830
just having one draw command we have to
 

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.419
just having one draw command we have to
kind of draw command on new frame well

00:31:44.419 --> 00:31:44.429
kind of draw command on new frame well
 

00:31:44.429 --> 00:31:46.159
kind of draw command on new frame well
not at all it Waka man i should say but

00:31:46.159 --> 00:31:46.169
not at all it Waka man i should say but
 

00:31:46.169 --> 00:31:47.960
not at all it Waka man i should say but
it's being called at every every frame

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:47.970
it's being called at every every frame
 

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.659
it's being called at every every frame
and the idea here is that anything that

00:31:50.659 --> 00:31:50.669
and the idea here is that anything that
 

00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:52.430
and the idea here is that anything that
you wouldn't want to set up twice for

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440
you wouldn't want to set up twice for
 

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.899
you wouldn't want to set up twice for
both eyes because it's the same for both

00:31:53.899 --> 00:31:53.909
both eyes because it's the same for both
 

00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:56.029
both eyes because it's the same for both
eyes you do that job here so in this

00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039
eyes you do that job here so in this
 

00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:59.330
eyes you do that job here so in this
case if you remember we talked about the

00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340
case if you remember we talked about the
 

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:01.639
case if you remember we talked about the
projection cone earlier right so this is

00:32:01.639 --> 00:32:01.649
projection cone earlier right so this is
 

00:32:01.649 --> 00:32:04.099
projection cone earlier right so this is
where we set it so we do set look at em

00:32:04.099 --> 00:32:04.109
where we set it so we do set look at em
 

00:32:04.109 --> 00:32:08.690
where we set it so we do set look at em
and we pass all the parameters so now

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700
and we pass all the parameters so now
 

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.249
and we pass all the parameters so now
wait no that's not it it's a camera

00:32:10.249 --> 00:32:10.259
wait no that's not it it's a camera
 

00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:13.519
wait no that's not it it's a camera
position I'm sorry I confuse things okay

00:32:13.519 --> 00:32:13.529
position I'm sorry I confuse things okay
 

00:32:13.529 --> 00:32:15.019
position I'm sorry I confuse things okay
anyway so at this point what we're

00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:15.029
anyway so at this point what we're
 

00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:18.589
anyway so at this point what we're
saying is basically yeah actually yeah

00:32:18.589 --> 00:32:18.599
saying is basically yeah actually yeah
 

00:32:18.599 --> 00:32:21.219
saying is basically yeah actually yeah
we're setting up our camera based on

00:32:21.219 --> 00:32:21.229
we're setting up our camera based on
 

00:32:21.229 --> 00:32:23.659
we're setting up our camera based on
well it is the projection cone of sorts

00:32:23.659 --> 00:32:23.669
well it is the projection cone of sorts
 

00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:24.919
well it is the projection cone of sorts
but anyway you'll see in a second all

00:32:24.919 --> 00:32:24.929
but anyway you'll see in a second all
 

00:32:24.929 --> 00:32:28.009
but anyway you'll see in a second all
right oh yeah and the before I miss that

00:32:28.009 --> 00:32:28.019
right oh yeah and the before I miss that
 

00:32:28.019 --> 00:32:29.899
right oh yeah and the before I miss that
the set light position here would be a

00:32:29.899 --> 00:32:29.909
the set light position here would be a
 

00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:31.430
the set light position here would be a
place where you could set and moving

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440
place where you could set and moving
 

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.379
place where you could set and moving
light source but we don't actually have

00:32:33.379 --> 00:32:33.389
light source but we don't actually have
 

00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:35.089
light source but we don't actually have
that in our current scene but if we

00:32:35.089 --> 00:32:35.099
that in our current scene but if we
 

00:32:35.099 --> 00:32:37.129
that in our current scene but if we
wanted our model to dynamically update

00:32:37.129 --> 00:32:37.139
wanted our model to dynamically update
 

00:32:37.139 --> 00:32:38.839
wanted our model to dynamically update
we could do those operations here

00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:38.849
we could do those operations here
 

00:32:38.849 --> 00:32:40.430
we could do those operations here
because you don't want to run them once

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440
because you don't want to run them once
 

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.549
because you don't want to run them once
for each I obviously all right so the

00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559
for each I obviously all right so the
 

00:32:43.559 --> 00:32:45.289
for each I obviously all right so the
actual Andhra I command where things get

00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299
actual Andhra I command where things get
 

00:32:45.299 --> 00:32:47.930
actual Andhra I command where things get
a bit more interesting so first thing

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:47.940
a bit more interesting so first thing
 

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.549
a bit more interesting so first thing
that's good to do is just to clear the

00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559
that's good to do is just to clear the
 

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:52.190
that's good to do is just to clear the
buffers so just basically clear the

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:52.200
buffers so just basically clear the
 

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.659
buffers so just basically clear the
screen so that you don't see the results

00:32:53.659 --> 00:32:53.669
screen so that you don't see the results
 

00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:55.009
screen so that you don't see the results
of the previous operation the previous

00:32:55.009 --> 00:32:55.019
of the previous operation the previous
 

00:32:55.019 --> 00:32:56.779
of the previous operation the previous
frame being rendered having been

00:32:56.779 --> 00:32:56.789
frame being rendered having been
 

00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:58.940
frame being rendered having been
rendered and this is where we set up our

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:58.950
rendered and this is where we set up our
 

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:02.180
rendered and this is where we set up our
view quemar frustum so we find out what

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:02.190
view quemar frustum so we find out what
 

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.899
view quemar frustum so we find out what
the ratio is for each I just so that our

00:33:04.899 --> 00:33:04.909
the ratio is for each I just so that our
 

00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:06.649
the ratio is for each I just so that our
perspective we won't get a squished

00:33:06.649 --> 00:33:06.659
perspective we won't get a squished
 

00:33:06.659 --> 00:33:09.799
perspective we won't get a squished
image right we do that one call here and

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:09.809
image right we do that one call here and
 

00:33:09.809 --> 00:33:11.149
image right we do that one call here and
that's what's going to set up our whole

00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159
that's what's going to set up our whole
 

00:33:11.159 --> 00:33:11.720
that's what's going to set up our whole
cone

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:11.730
cone
 

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:16.010
cone
view that it's fairly simple we define

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:16.020
view that it's fairly simple we define
 

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.610
view that it's fairly simple we define
right left right bottom top near and far

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:18.620
right left right bottom top near and far
 

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.490
right left right bottom top near and far
and then yeah oh yeah I'm just keeping

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500
and then yeah oh yeah I'm just keeping
 

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.980
and then yeah oh yeah I'm just keeping
the nice little things I put highlight

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:24.990
the nice little things I put highlight
 

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:29.950
the nice little things I put highlight
everything alright and yeah okay so

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960
everything alright and yeah okay so
 

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.700
everything alright and yeah okay so
calculating the view transform matrix

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:31.710
calculating the view transform matrix
 

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.040
calculating the view transform matrix
this is the part where we take the

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:34.050
this is the part where we take the
 

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.520
this is the part where we take the
camera position and the I basically and

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:37.530
camera position and the I basically and
 

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.530
camera position and the I basically and
turn it into a view matrix so that's why

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:39.540
turn it into a view matrix so that's why
 

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.900
turn it into a view matrix so that's why
we need both right so this is the part

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:41.910
we need both right so this is the part
 

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:44.000
we need both right so this is the part
where you basically the viewers camera

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:44.010
where you basically the viewers camera
 

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:46.610
where you basically the viewers camera
think of the V matrix as the camera

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:46.620
think of the V matrix as the camera
 

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.760
think of the V matrix as the camera
matrix of sorts so at that point we have

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:49.770
matrix of sorts so at that point we have
 

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.470
matrix of sorts so at that point we have
our projection matrix wherever camera

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480
our projection matrix wherever camera
 

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:54.470
our projection matrix wherever camera
matrix we know the the height and width

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480
matrix we know the the height and width
 

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.580
matrix we know the the height and width
of our viewport so geometry for reasons

00:33:58.580 --> 00:33:58.590
of our viewport so geometry for reasons
 

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:00.620
of our viewport so geometry for reasons
of it own uses that don't pay too much

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:00.630
of it own uses that don't pay too much
 

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.120
of it own uses that don't pay too much
attention to it the important parts are

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:02.130
attention to it the important parts are
 

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:03.950
attention to it the important parts are
the updating of information coming from

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960
the updating of information coming from
 

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.230
the updating of information coming from
the renderer you know so that your you

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240
the renderer you know so that your you
 

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.090
the renderer you know so that your you
can draw stuff based on the dynamically

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:08.100
can draw stuff based on the dynamically
 

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.890
can draw stuff based on the dynamically
changing position of the head of the

00:34:09.890 --> 00:34:09.900
changing position of the head of the
 

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.010
changing position of the head of the
user right and then the drakaa man at

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020
user right and then the drakaa man at
 

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.600
user right and then the drakaa man at
the bottom so we'll get back to what

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:14.610
the bottom so we'll get back to what
 

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.010
the bottom so we'll get back to what
actually happens in the draw command and

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020
actually happens in the draw command and
 

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:20.570
actually happens in the draw command and
earlier okay so this is the part where

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:20.580
earlier okay so this is the part where
 

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.490
earlier okay so this is the part where
things get a little bit more exciting so

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.500
things get a little bit more exciting so
 

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.380
things get a little bit more exciting so
what's the point of all of this right at

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:24.390
what's the point of all of this right at
 

00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:25.790
what's the point of all of this right at
which point am I starting to experiment

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800
which point am I starting to experiment
 

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.220
which point am I starting to experiment
and having fun gives to be honest the

00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:28.230
and having fun gives to be honest the
 

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:29.930
and having fun gives to be honest the
part I'm talking about all of this it's

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:29.940
part I'm talking about all of this it's
 

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.030
part I'm talking about all of this it's
kind of boring bit like you want to see

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040
kind of boring bit like you want to see
 

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.590
kind of boring bit like you want to see
things animate on screen you want to

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:33.600
things animate on screen you want to
 

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.600
things animate on screen you want to
sort of create a world right you want to

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:35.610
sort of create a world right you want to
 

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:38.690
sort of create a world right you want to
be like creative and fast and active and

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:38.700
be like creative and fast and active and
 

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.280
be like creative and fast and active and
you want to do stuff you just don't want

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:40.290
you want to do stuff you just don't want
 

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.990
you want to do stuff you just don't want
to poke around so the problem that we

00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000
to poke around so the problem that we
 

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.790
to poke around so the problem that we
have is that well okay I'll talk about

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800
have is that well okay I'll talk about
 

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.650
have is that well okay I'll talk about
life coding so we want to set up an

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:45.660
life coding so we want to set up an
 

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:47.270
life coding so we want to set up an

today I'm sorry within Wi-Fi and

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.290
today I'm sorry within Wi-Fi and
 

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:53.390
today I'm sorry within Wi-Fi and
everything and you'll see I need the

00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:53.400
everything and you'll see I need the
 

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.580
everything and you'll see I need the
Wi-Fi for my little demo that would not

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:55.590
Wi-Fi for my little demo that would not
 

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.580

have been a great idea life coding is

00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:58.590
have been a great idea life coding is
 

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:02.330

when you have a code build run cycle

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:02.340
when you have a code build run cycle
 

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.890
when you have a code build run cycle
that is so fast it's basically

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900
that is so fast it's basically
 

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.990
that is so fast it's basically
instantaneous so that you get instance

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000
instantaneous so that you get instance
 

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.670
instantaneous so that you get instance
response as you type out your program

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680
response as you type out your program
 

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.180
response as you type out your program
you see what's happening so this is a

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:11.190
you see what's happening so this is a
 

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:14.000
you see what's happening so this is a
basically it's fragment shader editor

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.010
basically it's fragment shader editor
 

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:17.540
basically it's fragment shader editor
online so we're basically live editing

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:17.550
online so we're basically live editing
 

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:20.030
online so we're basically live editing
the shader you see as I comment out

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:20.040
the shader you see as I comment out
 

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.360
the shader you see as I comment out
stuff like we can see it in action so

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:23.370
stuff like we can see it in action so
 

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.070
stuff like we can see it in action so
here we're just basically varying the

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.080
here we're just basically varying the
 

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:25.520
here we're just basically varying the

very very quickly we can experiment and

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900
very very quickly we can experiment and
 

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.450
very very quickly we can experiment and
find out how all of this works and get a

00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460
find out how all of this works and get a
 

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.030
find out how all of this works and get a
very good feeling for oh so that's what

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040
very good feeling for oh so that's what
 

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.220
very good feeling for oh so that's what
a shader fragment shader does right and

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:40.230
a shader fragment shader does right and
 

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.740
a shader fragment shader does right and
you can come up with ideas and so that

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:42.750
you can come up with ideas and so that
 

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.780
you can come up with ideas and so that
instant feedback loop is super important

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:44.790
instant feedback loop is super important
 

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.640
instant feedback loop is super important
and on Android everybody's painfully

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:46.650
and on Android everybody's painfully
 

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:48.170

the initialization stage you can just do

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:54.270
the initialization stage you can just do
 

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.090
the initialization stage you can just do
it between frames you can just create a

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:56.100
it between frames you can just create a
 

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.040
it between frames you can just create a
new shader and compile it and run it it

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:58.050
new shader and compile it and run it it
 

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.380

also means well we're going to get the
 

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.700
also means well we're going to get the
shaders at this point right because

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:01.710

shaders near they run a few times for

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:07.830
shaders near they run a few times for
 

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.070
shaders near they run a few times for
each vertices and then the pixel shader

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:10.080
each vertices and then the pixel shader
 

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.450
each vertices and then the pixel shader
or the fragment shader is running a ton

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460
or the fragment shader is running a ton
 

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.490
or the fragment shader is running a ton
of times right what can we do with this

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:13.500
of times right what can we do with this
 

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.070
of times right what can we do with this
so the geometry I've been talking about

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:16.080
so the geometry I've been talking about
 

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:20.300
so the geometry I've been talking about
is iterative geometry so with opengl es

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:20.310
is iterative geometry so with opengl es
 

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.030
is iterative geometry so with opengl es

putting for loops in there and creating

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160
putting for loops in there and creating
 

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.940
putting for loops in there and creating
cubes and creating your own spaces

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:11.950
cubes and creating your own spaces
 

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:14.620
cubes and creating your own spaces
that's a part we won't get to today but

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:14.630
that's a part we won't get to today but
 

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.600
that's a part we won't get to today but
you can see the possibilities and you

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:16.610
you can see the possibilities and you
 

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:21.610
you can see the possibilities and you
can start experimenting very quickly so

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:21.620
can start experimenting very quickly so
 

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.560
can start experimenting very quickly so
then the other thing that we can start

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:23.570
then the other thing that we can start
 

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.780
then the other thing that we can start
doing is deformation so I'm just

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:25.790
doing is deformation so I'm just
 

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:27.970
doing is deformation so I'm just
mentioning this to sort of let you know

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:27.980
mentioning this to sort of let you know
 

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:30.040
mentioning this to sort of let you know
what's possible with the shaders in

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:30.050
what's possible with the shaders in
 

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.960
what's possible with the shaders in
which ways you can use and abuse the

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:31.970
which ways you can use and abuse the
 

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.820
which ways you can use and abuse the
pipeline so in this case what we're

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:33.830
pipeline so in this case what we're
 

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:35.980
pipeline so in this case what we're
doing is that it's an example the link

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:35.990
doing is that it's an example the link
 

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.120
doing is that it's an example the link
is at the bottom again I'm going to

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:37.130
is at the bottom again I'm going to
 

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.340
is at the bottom again I'm going to
share the slides later but this is an

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:39.350
share the slides later but this is an
 

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.930
share the slides later but this is an
experiment where you take a sphere you

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:40.940
experiment where you take a sphere you
 

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.470
experiment where you take a sphere you
apply noise and to the distance of

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480
apply noise and to the distance of
 

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.420
apply noise and to the distance of
vertex to the center of the sphere and

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:46.430
vertex to the center of the sphere and
 

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.120
vertex to the center of the sphere and
you get a deformation like this you can

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.130
you get a deformation like this you can
 

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:50.770
you get a deformation like this you can
come up with really really nice effects

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:50.780
come up with really really nice effects
 

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.930
come up with really really nice effects
this way like that demo ends up being

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:52.940
this way like that demo ends up being
 

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.550
this way like that demo ends up being
like an actual exploding ball of fire

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560
like an actual exploding ball of fire
 

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.320
like an actual exploding ball of fire
with like really nice effects and

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:56.330
with like really nice effects and
 

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:57.850
with like really nice effects and
there's about 20 lines of shader code in

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:57.860
there's about 20 lines of shader code in
 

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.100
there's about 20 lines of shader code in
there and this kind of stuff is for

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:00.110
there and this kind of stuff is for
 

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.050
there and this kind of stuff is for
WebGL but it's easily applicable to all

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:02.060

I've shown you today on Android right

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:05.060
I've shown you today on Android right
 

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:08.050
I've shown you today on Android right
quickly the fragment shaders so extra

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:08.060
quickly the fragment shaders so extra
 

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.280
quickly the fragment shaders so extra
mapping you probably know what that is

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:09.290
mapping you probably know what that is
 

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.870
mapping you probably know what that is
you have a texture you're mapping it

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880
you have a texture you're mapping it
 

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.490
you have a texture you're mapping it
onto a shape right so you have to sort

00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:12.500
onto a shape right so you have to sort
 

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.410
onto a shape right so you have to sort
of think oh who's doing the job of that

00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:14.420
of think oh who's doing the job of that
 

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.150
of think oh who's doing the job of that
it's the fragment shader fragment

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160
it's the fragment shader fragment
 

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.620
it's the fragment shader fragment
shaders getting all that texture data

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:17.630
shaders getting all that texture data
 

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:19.540
shaders getting all that texture data
and since it's responsible for painting

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:19.550
and since it's responsible for painting
 

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:20.770

the pixels it's the one that's going to

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:20.780
the pixels it's the one that's going to
 

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.540
the pixels it's the one that's going to
be looking up those pixels right in some

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:22.550
be looking up those pixels right in some
 

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.130
be looking up those pixels right in some
cases and taking them straight from the

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:24.140
cases and taking them straight from the
 

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.380
cases and taking them straight from the
bitmap and dropping them into the right

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:26.390
bitmap and dropping them into the right
 

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.110
bitmap and dropping them into the right
projected space on those triangles so

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:29.120
projected space on those triangles so
 

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.630
projected space on those triangles so
where does that become interesting so

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:31.640
where does that become interesting so
 

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.820
where does that become interesting so
you can abuse the fragment shader to do

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:33.830
you can abuse the fragment shader to do
 

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.250
you can abuse the fragment shader to do
kind of interesting things so here I'm

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:36.260
kind of interesting things so here I'm
 

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:39.250
kind of interesting things so here I'm
going to show hopefully quickly how to

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:39.260
going to show hopefully quickly how to
 

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.700
going to show hopefully quickly how to
abuse it to start rendering geometric

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:42.710
abuse it to start rendering geometric
 

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:44.830
abuse it to start rendering geometric

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720
doing oh yeah and the quick note i
 

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.940
doing oh yeah and the quick note i
wanted to show here is that while I'm

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:48.950
wanted to show here is that while I'm
 

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:50.890
wanted to show here is that while I'm
editing this so this is

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:50.900
editing this so this is
 

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.250
editing this so this is

the chrome pain so this allows you to

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:12.470
the chrome pain so this allows you to
 

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:13.930
the chrome pain so this allows you to
play around with fragment shader and

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:13.940
play around with fragment shader and
 

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:17.589
play around with fragment shader and
then in this case the times the FPS is

00:40:17.589 --> 00:40:17.599
then in this case the times the FPS is
 

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:19.329
then in this case the times the FPS is
read the signal that there's a compile

00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:19.339
read the signal that there's a compile

read the signal that there's a compile
error can look at your logs you see

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:21.740
error can look at your logs you see
 

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.559
error can look at your logs you see
which line what exactly you did wrong

00:40:23.559 --> 00:40:23.569
which line what exactly you did wrong
 

00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:25.210
which line what exactly you did wrong
you start editing and you fix it really

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:25.220
you start editing and you fix it really
 

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.950
you start editing and you fix it really
quickly so that allows you to start

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960
quickly so that allows you to start
 

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.630
quickly so that allows you to start
experimenting with shaders in a way that

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640
experimenting with shaders in a way that
 

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.430
experimenting with shaders in a way that
you probably would have never done if

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440
you probably would have never done if
 

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.079
you probably would have never done if
you were just rebuilding the APK every

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:32.089
you were just rebuilding the APK every
 

00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:36.700
you were just rebuilding the APK every
every 10 minutes hopefully we should see

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:36.710
every 10 minutes hopefully we should see
 

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:38.859
every 10 minutes hopefully we should see
the results of this so I'm going to yeah

00:40:38.859 --> 00:40:38.869
the results of this so I'm going to yeah
 

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:40.809
the results of this so I'm going to yeah
just I'll just let it run until it's

00:40:40.809 --> 00:40:40.819
just I'll just let it run until it's
 

00:40:40.819 --> 00:40:42.549
just I'll just let it run until it's
done so now all of a sudden we just have

00:40:42.549 --> 00:40:42.559
done so now all of a sudden we just have
 

00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:44.230
done so now all of a sudden we just have
like this flat polka dot pattern

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240
like this flat polka dot pattern
 

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.299
like this flat polka dot pattern
appearing here so what what's going on

00:40:46.299 --> 00:40:46.309
appearing here so what what's going on
 

00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:48.910
appearing here so what what's going on
so it's really more of a thought

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920
so it's really more of a thought
 

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.319
so it's really more of a thought
experiment but I just wanted to

00:40:50.319 --> 00:40:50.329
experiment but I just wanted to
 

00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:51.750
experiment but I just wanted to
introduce the audience the idea that

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760
introduce the audience the idea that
 

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.710
introduce the audience the idea that
there's something called distance

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:53.720
there's something called distance
 

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.450
there's something called distance
functions that allow you to sort of play

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:55.460
functions that allow you to sort of play
 

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:58.630
functions that allow you to sort of play
around with flat space so in this case

00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640
around with flat space so in this case
 

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.640
around with flat space so in this case
we're actually ignoring anything 3d

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:00.650
we're actually ignoring anything 3d
 

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:02.620
we're actually ignoring anything 3d
we're just rendering these circles based

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:02.630
we're just rendering these circles based
 

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:04.690
we're just rendering these circles based
on where we are in the in the rendering

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:04.700

we're on screen it is so this allows you

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:09.410
we're on screen it is so this allows you
 

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.870
we're on screen it is so this allows you
to do stuff that's kind of fairly

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880
to do stuff that's kind of fairly
 

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.690
to do stuff that's kind of fairly
interesting and this is an example of

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:13.700
interesting and this is an example of
 

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.029
interesting and this is an example of
such valve has a really nice research

00:41:16.029 --> 00:41:16.039
such valve has a really nice research
 

00:41:16.039 --> 00:41:18.279
such valve has a really nice research
paper where they explain how to use the

00:41:18.279 --> 00:41:18.289
paper where they explain how to use the
 

00:41:18.289 --> 00:41:20.589
paper where they explain how to use the
texture system instead of actually

00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599
texture system instead of actually
 

00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:22.210

applying and sticking a texture onto a
triangle what they do is they take a

00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:24.589
triangle what they do is they take a
 

00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:28.059
triangle what they do is they take a
high res texture here like 4k by 4k they

00:41:28.059 --> 00:41:28.069
high res texture here like 4k by 4k they
 

00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:30.519
high res texture here like 4k by 4k they
extract out of it a distance field patch

00:41:30.519 --> 00:41:30.529
extract out of it a distance field patch
 

00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:32.980
extract out of it a distance field patch
which is another texture really but they

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:32.990
which is another texture really but they
 

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:34.390
which is another texture really but they
pass this to your fragment shader and

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400
pass this to your fragment shader and
 

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.190
pass this to your fragment shader and
this is only basically telling the

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200
this is only basically telling the
 

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.200
this is only basically telling the
shader okay if you're at this point

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:38.210
shader okay if you're at this point
 

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.180
shader okay if you're at this point
you're this far away from inside or

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:40.190
you're this far away from inside or
 

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:42.819
you're this far away from inside or
outside the letter right and using that

00:41:42.819 --> 00:41:42.829
outside the letter right and using that
 

00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:44.799
outside the letter right and using that
they basically managed to implement

00:41:44.799 --> 00:41:44.809
they basically managed to implement
 

00:41:44.809 --> 00:41:46.329
they basically managed to implement
something that looks like vector

00:41:46.329 --> 00:41:46.339
something that looks like vector
 

00:41:46.339 --> 00:41:49.720
something that looks like vector

should say so this is just to introduce

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:54.650
should say so this is just to introduce
 

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:56.829
should say so this is just to introduce
you to the idea that you can once you

00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839
you to the idea that you can once you
 

00:41:56.839 --> 00:41:58.450
you to the idea that you can once you
start programming your own pipeline you

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:58.460
start programming your own pipeline you
 

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.370
start programming your own pipeline you
can do very fancy things and there's a

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:00.380
can do very fancy things and there's a
 

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.809
can do very fancy things and there's a
lot of people have done a lot of fancy

00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:01.819
lot of people have done a lot of fancy
 

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:03.640
lot of people have done a lot of fancy
things and research papers like these

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:03.650
things and research papers like these
 

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:04.229
things and research papers like these
you can

00:42:04.229 --> 00:42:04.239
you can
 

00:42:04.239 --> 00:42:05.879
you can
look up on the internet and they are

00:42:05.879 --> 00:42:05.889
look up on the internet and they are
 

00:42:05.889 --> 00:42:08.099
look up on the internet and they are
very very self-explanatory like you can

00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:08.109
very very self-explanatory like you can
 

00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:10.769
very very self-explanatory like you can
apply all this to your programs in

00:42:10.769 --> 00:42:10.779
apply all this to your programs in
 

00:42:10.779 --> 00:42:13.829
apply all this to your programs in
virtual space this is a quick

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839

explanation of the full screen fragment

00:42:16.529 --> 00:42:16.539
explanation of the full screen fragment
 

00:42:16.539 --> 00:42:19.739
explanation of the full screen fragment
rendering trick this is I'm going to not

00:42:19.739 --> 00:42:19.749
rendering trick this is I'm going to not
 

00:42:19.749 --> 00:42:21.779
rendering trick this is I'm going to not
explain it to too much but the idea here

00:42:21.779 --> 00:42:21.789
explain it to too much but the idea here
 

00:42:21.789 --> 00:42:23.819
explain it to too much but the idea here
is that if you want to draw in flat

00:42:23.819 --> 00:42:23.829
is that if you want to draw in flat
 

00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:25.729
is that if you want to draw in flat
space and only use the fragment shader

00:42:25.729 --> 00:42:25.739
space and only use the fragment shader
 

00:42:25.739 --> 00:42:28.499
space and only use the fragment shader
you just need to put up a full surface

00:42:28.499 --> 00:42:28.509
you just need to put up a full surface
 

00:42:28.509 --> 00:42:31.379
you just need to put up a full surface
on screen like you put up two triangles

00:42:31.379 --> 00:42:31.389
on screen like you put up two triangles
 

00:42:31.389 --> 00:42:32.999
on screen like you put up two triangles
that fill up the whole view screen and

00:42:32.999 --> 00:42:33.009
that fill up the whole view screen and
 

00:42:33.009 --> 00:42:34.799
that fill up the whole view screen and
you can start playing around with the

00:42:34.799 --> 00:42:34.809
you can start playing around with the
 

00:42:34.809 --> 00:42:36.149
you can start playing around with the
fragment shader you might be saying well

00:42:36.149 --> 00:42:36.159
fragment shader you might be saying well
 

00:42:36.159 --> 00:42:38.939
fragment shader you might be saying well
what does that do like what what can I

00:42:38.939 --> 00:42:38.949
what does that do like what what can I
 

00:42:38.949 --> 00:42:40.199
what does that do like what what can I
do that's kind of interesting with that

00:42:40.199 --> 00:42:40.209
do that's kind of interesting with that
 

00:42:40.209 --> 00:42:43.019
do that's kind of interesting with that
and here I'm going to encourage you to

00:42:43.019 --> 00:42:43.029
and here I'm going to encourage you to
 

00:42:43.029 --> 00:42:46.589
and here I'm going to encourage you to
go and look at shader toy shiratori is a

00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:46.599
go and look at shader toy shiratori is a
 

00:42:46.599 --> 00:42:48.899
go and look at shader toy shiratori is a
fragment editing website basically with

the WebGL WebGL AP AP is they abuse

00:42:57.299 --> 00:42:57.309
the WebGL WebGL AP AP is they abuse
 

00:42:57.309 --> 00:42:59.759
the WebGL WebGL AP AP is they abuse
fragment shaders in an awesome way and

these things are animated and you can
 

00:43:09.369 --> 00:43:11.999
these things are animated and you can
just learn from the best and reuse that

00:43:11.999 --> 00:43:12.009
just learn from the best and reuse that
 

00:43:12.009 --> 00:43:14.519
just learn from the best and reuse that
stuff in your own examples like you can

00:43:14.519 --> 00:43:14.529
stuff in your own examples like you can
 

00:43:14.529 --> 00:43:16.469
stuff in your own examples like you can
see that there's actual worlds being

the hell can you do geometry if you're

00:43:19.739 --> 00:43:19.749
the hell can you do geometry if you're
 

00:43:19.749 --> 00:43:21.449
the hell can you do geometry if you're
just drawing pixels like how does that

00:43:21.449 --> 00:43:21.459
just drawing pixels like how does that
 

00:43:21.459 --> 00:43:23.099
just drawing pixels like how does that
work like they're not even putting

00:43:23.099 --> 00:43:23.109
work like they're not even putting
 

00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:24.569
work like they're not even putting
geometry in these examples it's like a

two triangles were looking at so well
you're going to have to explore that

00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:29.979
you're going to have to explore that
 

00:43:29.979 --> 00:43:31.799
you're going to have to explore that
explore something called ray marching or

00:43:31.799 --> 00:43:31.809
explore something called ray marching or

come see me after i'll give you the
 

00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:34.499
come see me after i'll give you the
links to the papers because we're short

links to the papers because we're short
 

00:43:34.509 --> 00:43:35.609
links to the papers because we're short
on time and we won't talk about that

00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:35.619
on time and we won't talk about that
 

00:43:35.619 --> 00:43:38.089
on time and we won't talk about that
actually over time oh my god am I good

00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099
actually over time oh my god am I good
 

00:43:38.099 --> 00:43:41.249

well kick me out if I'm rambling alright

00:43:41.249 --> 00:43:41.259
well kick me out if I'm rambling alright
 

00:43:41.259 --> 00:43:42.959
well kick me out if I'm rambling alright
so one of the things I want to point out

00:43:42.959 --> 00:43:42.969
so one of the things I want to point out
 

00:43:42.969 --> 00:43:44.399
so one of the things I want to point out
too is they do a search for something

00:43:44.399 --> 00:43:44.409
too is they do a search for something
 

00:43:44.409 --> 00:43:48.479
too is they do a search for something
called to TC in shader toy this is just

00:43:48.479 --> 00:43:48.489
called to TC in shader toy this is just
 

00:43:48.489 --> 00:43:50.669
called to TC in shader toy this is just
to impress everybody they organized what

00:43:50.669 --> 00:43:50.679
to impress everybody they organized what
 

00:43:50.679 --> 00:43:53.699
to impress everybody they organized what
was called a to tweet contests so the

00:43:53.699 --> 00:43:53.709
was called a to tweet contests so the
 

00:43:53.709 --> 00:43:55.889
was called a to tweet contests so the
concept of the to tweak contest is you

00:43:55.889 --> 00:43:55.899
concept of the to tweak contest is you
 

00:43:55.899 --> 00:43:59.999
concept of the to tweak contest is you
have our many characters fit and two

00:43:59.999 --> 00:44:00.009
have our many characters fit and two
 

00:44:00.009 --> 00:44:02.099
have our many characters fit and two
tweets and that's how big your shader

00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:02.109
tweets and that's how big your shader
 

00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:05.489
tweets and that's how big your shader
can be and text wise so they all these

00:44:05.489 --> 00:44:05.499
can be and text wise so they all these
 

00:44:05.499 --> 00:44:08.879
can be and text wise so they all these
shaders fit within two tweets white

00:44:08.879 --> 00:44:08.889
shaders fit within two tweets white
 

00:44:08.889 --> 00:44:11.099
shaders fit within two tweets white
spaces and comments don't care but and

spaces and comments don't care but and
 

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:13.589
spaces and comments don't care but and
these are all again animated if you just

00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599
these are all again animated if you just
 

00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:15.089
these are all again animated if you just
do that search and go look that up and

00:44:15.089 --> 00:44:15.099
do that search and go look that up and
 

00:44:15.099 --> 00:44:16.919
do that search and go look that up and
all this stuff is online and the shaders

00:44:16.919 --> 00:44:16.929
all this stuff is online and the shaders
 

00:44:16.929 --> 00:44:17.580
all this stuff is online and the shaders
are public

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:17.590
are public
 

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:19.830

so you can learn really interesting

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:19.840
so you can learn really interesting
 

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.540
so you can learn really interesting
tricks and if you start thinking this

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:21.550
tricks and if you start thinking this
 

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.520
tricks and if you start thinking this
way it's not actually so hard and I've

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:23.530
way it's not actually so hard and I've
 

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.800
way it's not actually so hard and I've
done a few proof of concepts where you

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:25.810
done a few proof of concepts where you
 

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:29.270
done a few proof of concepts where you
can creates a 3d fractals and apply

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280
can creates a 3d fractals and apply
 

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.210
can creates a 3d fractals and apply
apply the VR angle to it as well so when

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:33.220
apply the VR angle to it as well so when
 

00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.370
apply the VR angle to it as well so when
you do that you end up creating spaces

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:35.380
you do that you end up creating spaces
 

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.700
you do that you end up creating spaces
are really interesting to explore and

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:37.710
are really interesting to explore and
 

00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:40.770
are really interesting to explore and
the major point here is that that's not

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:40.780
the major point here is that that's not
 

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.810
the major point here is that that's not
so many lines of code once you grok how

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:42.820
so many lines of code once you grok how
 

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.790
so many lines of code once you grok how
this stuff works you can be hyper

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800
this stuff works you can be hyper
 

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.230
this stuff works you can be hyper
efficient and come up with like

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240
efficient and come up with like
 

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.050
efficient and come up with like
incredible effects and you don't have to

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:49.060
incredible effects and you don't have to
 

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.580
