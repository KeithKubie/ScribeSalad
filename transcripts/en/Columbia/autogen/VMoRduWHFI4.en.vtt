the development was unplanned I didn't
 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.760
the development was unplanned I didn't
know what I was doing I just kept at it

know what I was doing I just kept at it
 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.670
know what I was doing I just kept at it
and in truth this is I can almost say

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
and in truth this is I can almost say
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.170

subsequently fifty five years later I
 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.810
subsequently fifty five years later I
sort of know what I'm doing but but I'm

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820
sort of know what I'm doing but but I'm

very small when I was a jester they were
 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.810
very small when I was a jester they were
tiny because I was not a draftsman in

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820
tiny because I was not a draftsman in

I've gotten on and my career it was
 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.660
I've gotten on and my career it was
working along with drawing and so I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670
working along with drawing and so I
 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.760
working along with drawing and so I
started out with gesture and small

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770
started out with gesture and small
 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.979
started out with gesture and small
drawings because that's what I knew how

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989
drawings because that's what I knew how
 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.979

to do part of it was the material and in
 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.290
to do part of it was the material and in
fact it was the crow quill pen and ink

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300

it's slow and it's very detailed so I

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760
it's slow and it's very detailed so I
 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.430
it's slow and it's very detailed so I
really didn't know that much about

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440
really didn't know that much about
 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.610
really didn't know that much about
drawing and materials and size and scale

the crow quill pen was all I knew so I

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230
the crow quill pen was all I knew so I
 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.979
the crow quill pen was all I knew so I
used that and it lent itself to working

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989
used that and it lent itself to working
 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.770
used that and it lent itself to working
very small it didn't dance on the page

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780
very small it didn't dance on the page
 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.410
very small it didn't dance on the page

with that allow the hand to just

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599
with that allow the hand to just
 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.470
with that allow the hand to just
play much more freely on a piece of

got bigger as I started to get more

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489
got bigger as I started to get more
 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.839

the 70s there was a sense of scale

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599
the 70s there was a sense of scale
 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.780
the 70s there was a sense of scale
there's a whole attitude toward scale

much much larger the wall was to be

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870
much much larger the wall was to be
 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.659
much much larger the wall was to be
considered and somehow that influenced

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669
considered and somehow that influenced
 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.940
considered and somehow that influenced
me and then I started to draw larger and

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950
me and then I started to draw larger and
 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.860
me and then I started to draw larger and
larger and larger because the details

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870
larger and larger because the details
 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.890
larger and larger because the details
and the feel of the hand and the way my

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900
and the feel of the hand and the way my
 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.740
and the feel of the hand and the way my
hand worked on the paper it was more

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750
hand worked on the paper it was more
 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.490
