Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Well, I read about you a fellow Boston native, and I've read about your Tesla journey and I was like, this is a fucking interesting story. This guy buys a broken Tesla, right? And then you couldn't get parts for it anywhere. Nope. So what had happened to the car had been in an accident? No. So the, I, I met the previous owner and he actually has, I think it was during Hurricane Sandy. Oh. He thought that, uh, he goes, wait a minute, that water level seems low enough for me to drive through it. And he just said to driving through the water, I think it got up to like the, uh, almost like the B pillar. Oh No. Like where his neck, his, yeah. And Jesus Christ. Yeah, I know. Right. So he thought he could fight the water. He lost obviously, and um, it was just under water and I'm like, you know what, I've got to try this thing.

Speaker 1:          00:44          And so what, what would Tesla do in that situation? If he wanted to bring it back to them? They would have to rebuild the entire car. They wouldn't even do it because at that point, uh, once, uh, anything liquid, you know, any kind of like water intrusion happens at an EMV phase. Right. The whole car off insurance companies just like, we're not going to do with too risky. Too risky. Not Worth it. We, you aware of the Fisker a dilemma at the hurricane sandy when they had a, the Fiskars that were parked at the, it was like at a, some sort of a doc. Right. They ought to ship. They all exploded. Yeah. They'll burn the water level. Rose, the water got into them and they just went off and they fucking firewalls. The whole bunch of them. Yeah. Look, this is a video of it.

Speaker 1:          01:23          You can watch the video of them fucking blowing up. So as the water level rose and the hurt, you'd see the water breaching. Yeah. Well the water gets to the cars and when it gets to the cars, they just start going off like fucking fireball. Oh yeah. I know that feeling. Oh Wow. Look at that. Boom, boom, boom. I knew it was like a supernova. I mean those are big ass fucking batteries. Just blowing the fuck. Chokes. It turns night in the day. It's amazing how many, they lost like 40 cards with me that they lost a fuck load and the company essentially went, they went radio silent. Yeah. For like a year. That's a big L to take. Yeah. Once people realize their car could just explode out, that's not good. Sorry, what happened? This kid, this video part, I didn't look at the name of the video.

Speaker 1:          02:10          I popped up when I type it into the Fisker explosion, but this was the explosion of the con Ed plant. Oh, that's a big difference. Yeah. That was a John [inaudible] cars. But there is a video of the actual Fiskars exploding isn't their thing. There's definitely pictures. Pictures. The second video won't be as exciting. Now let's leave it off. Fuck it this more. This is information set us back an hour. So that's the cars. That's what was left of them. Wow. And they all fucking blew up. It's a beautiful car though. Fisker did a great job of making a car. That looks really good. Right? But you know what's funny, I, I think the backends kind of ugly to you think the front looks like a fish. The back kind of ugly and then actually, have you ever driven one? No. You've been in one? No. When you drive one you'll be like, ah, I get why this didn't work out well Justin Bieber had all chrome one.

Speaker 1:          02:58          I remember that. Yeah. Does he still have it though? Cause you still have it. He probably, he probably doesn't even know. Yeah, he probably doesn't know at this point. Yeah. You know the amount of money that dude myself, yeah, probably has no idea if he has that car. No kidding. It's got it tucked away somewhere. But what do they drive? Like they're just, they're just not really great cars. It's not really a driver's car. It's a two plus two. The a the center console thing. Like you're closer to, sorry that. Sorry. You can move around if you want to take away the, uh, the center console is super wide. It's a super awkward car to drive and it's not really good at really anything, you know, it doesn't styling wise I'm like, oh there we go. Yeah. So you think that back end looks ugly? I don't think I could that much. No, no. I like it. But you know what's funny? The Chromos and looked that bad. Some guy got arrested in Germany. They pulled them over and it compounds it his car cause he had a gold shiny wrap on it. It was a two reflective or something. I see now there's a couple on sunset, like a Lamborghini or something. They'll let you do that in America, but in Germany they're like fuck off.

Speaker 1:          03:58          I took that Shit Bro. You know they're like harsh, cold, stoic folk. They don't want you doing that. And then I want you flexing too much over there. Not Too much. No, I bet they were like reluctantly are making cars like super flashy for like American markets and shit. I think so too. I, you know, I wonder. You think so? I don't know. I don't know. Yeah, me, I wonder how much of an influence it has. Like if you could leave them to themselves, right. What kind of crops did they make? Yeah. Yeah. Cause I feel like so much of it as like market driven, but they, when it comes to like engineering and handling like God damn German cars have it nailed. They really do. They really do. But you know what the Americans are, they were trying to sneak up and get clothes for a while.

Speaker 1:          04:43          But I mean like the German, just to this, this, this, the standard, the benchmark for every police with the Americans fuck with it is like, have you ever driven a Camaro? Zl One I have. Yeah. That's a preposterous car. It's an awesome car. It's amazing. I have a, um, uh, a corvette [inaudible] Ooh. Which year ends that, oh, six Oh six, which is, you know, the ls seven seven liter. And uh, it's an insane Chi. By today's standards. It only has like 505 horsepower. Funny. But like, it's, it's not a lot. It's a meme. It's a mean car. The car, I'll put you on your ass really quick, man. Talking to a man, our friend Taylor out there was telling us that they put a Tesla in ludicrous mode on a dyno and it had some insane number of Torque, 900 pound pound feet of Torque and somewhere in the neighborhood of a thousand horsepower and the dyno could barely even read it.

Speaker 1:          05:33          A lot of times they even go that high and a lot of cases, yeah, they're insane cars, man. I'm telling you, the Americans know how to do it now. I think it's interesting that you know, people don't realize this when they see a Tesla, it's a fully American car and they don't realize that. They're just like, oh, it's probably something like, you know, German or Japanese car, but the car is 100% made here. Is this it right here, Jamie? Yes. Is this the, which model is this? [inaudible] so that's the biggest one. So what does it say on a Mustang Dyno? So we're going to go from like a 20 mile an hour roll sound like these little boys will tell you this Tesla up here trying to figure out how fast she goes. I think I'm getting to jump. I thought I said 56 seconds. Yeah, no, I think it, uh, look at a community and even almost jumps off the diner at this point. There's so much torque.

Speaker 2:          06:22          Yeah. It's a very, very, very powerful car.

Speaker 1:          06:33          What I've tried to describe it to people, especially people that have never driven an electric car, I'm like, it doesn't even seem real. It seems like it violates physics. So how do you like yours, by the way? So I know, I know that Ilan mosque came here and bamboozle you into buying one pretty much. How do you, how dare you? I love it. I love it. It's great, isn't it? It makes other cars seemed stupid. Right? And I love cars. Oh yeah. I know. You're a car guy. I love them. I love cars that don't even drive that fast. I love mechanical engineered excellence. I love that when people figure things out, right? Yeah. Which is what brought me to you. I love the fact that you took this car that was fucked up, right? And you refuse to let it go. You like, I'm going to figure out how to fix this fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          07:14          How much did you buy it for? It was 15 grand. Just to be clear on something. I'm not like some like evil genius or brainiac. This was driven by my cheapness because I didn't want to spend the kind of money they were asking for one, right? So, so basically this car is like 15 grand. And um, the whole story started with my friend came over, he actually had a job at Tesla and he's like, buddy, listen, do these crazy cars. Uh, I knew you have a zero six but there's cars faster than that. You're going to love this thing. I was like, that electric crap box. I don't want anything to do with that. Whatever. Right? You brought the car over, great looking car. I said, all right, and I'll take it for a drive or whatever. And the thing was amazing, right? Amazing car.

Speaker 1:          07:52          So I was in tech and I'm just like, listen, like, you know what, how much does this thing cost? Like I make decent money, whatever. I'll just throw some money at it. And he's like, listen, this is the cost about 120. I said, you know what? Have a nice day. I'm not buying that shit. Um, and then he, so he left and I thought to myself like every night I was like, you know what? I got to get my hands on one of these cars, man. I gotta get one like, you know, sell a kidney, whatever. I sell a testicle or whatever I can do. And it's, I was searching online and you know, at what happens is whenever a car gets messed up, whenever a car gets a, as I say total in a way, and it's a total loss and insurance company, you'll take it and they'll kind of auction it off to like the highest bidder.

Speaker 1:          08:30          So I went to an auction site and I saw one for sale was like, you know, 15 grand. They said it didn't run her drive and it wasn't a flood and I'm just like 15 grand. I could do that. That's a piece of cake, man. I threw some money at it. Whatever. How hard can it be? You stick it in a bag of rice and I tie it up. He's like an iPhone, you know, you've got a rifle in the toilet right here. What I mean it's, it's like all had socks. You want a bag of rice and you get to go. So I figured out how to do it is by more rice for this thing. And uh, I got home and um, I was like, you know what, this is a, I got myself into some shit here cause uh, this, it was a lot more work than I thought I was going to be sight unseen.

Speaker 1:          09:05          Nope. Sight unseen. That's, that's the way it is the most times. They don't really let you on the auction lots too often. So they took five photos of it. It was sent from the interior, some from the side and I'm one under the front and I was just like, I could probably do this. Right, no big deal. So this begins his project, which takes how long to completion? I think it took me about maybe six or seven months or so of straight work. No. So I have, um, so I was working at the time and uh, I think only between the hours of like 7:00 PM and like 11:00 PM like every night and then weekends for a few hours until I figured it out. Yeah. So goodbye social life pretty much. Yeah. I was, I was a hermit for there for those months. And what actually ended up doing was, so I had the car right.

Speaker 1:          09:49          So I was freaking out because my wife was just like, how much was that thing? And like, you know what I mean? Of course. Yeah. She had a divorce papers ready pretty much. And uh, oh, I know this was a different one. Yeah. Fuck yeah, that was really messed up. Now I couldn't say if I want to get that one for that one was about guests for grand 20 grand. I paid for that. Yes. Yes. Total. Yeah, I know. But these, they're so valuable man. Really? Because you know why it's the, the, the battery technology on the motor technology that tussle is using. Everyone's just dying for that stuff, man. That's so any, any, any rec test so that you find minimum, I know I'm spilling the secret sauce here. Minimum Worth 15 grand. Even if it looks like that. Dead serious. That's insane. What that thing doesn't even have doors yet.

Speaker 1:          10:36          Still we took, I took the doors off, took the doors off, put the battery pack is still in there. Right. And the multitudes and the motor was still in there too. Do people take those and put them in like old cars or anything yet? Absolutely. It's a he that's the new generation of hot rodders man. Cause you saw something like that about a Mustang. It was like a 65, 66 Mustang that was electric, but I didn't know what train it used. So, so you know how um, you're a gearhead, you know this is the ls swap. They put literally an ls into everything. Yeah. I a landscape land cruiser, Toyota Land Cruiser with one ls, swap went. Oh Shit. Um, so that's the new ls swap basically. So the Tesla Motor is the new ls swap. Everyone is swapping the Tesla motor until you know Volkswagen bugs into Audis, into, into Porsche's, into everything.

Speaker 1:          11:23          Well I know that people were doing ls swaps into nine 11 and Porsche people are losing their fucking minds. I now take an old air cooled cars. Yep. Which are really notoriously difficult to get to a high horsepower. Exactly. Cause those air cooled cars, like you can only get them like around 400 plus horsepower. These stay stocked crumbling unless your singer, right? Well they've got that insanely engineered a new one. What is that called? Lionel lakes call. Either way it's going to cost you like you know, damn near $100,000 sitting at 80 power, something dynamic, lightweight, something. It's the most gorgeous looking of those portions have ever seen ever. Sanders. And they built that one up to 500 plus horsepower. Right? That's Hammad. How much does it cost though? That's the thing. Fucking million. 6,000,006. Yeah. You can buy one. That's a giant house, man.

Speaker 1:          12:08          That's a house with land. You might have a, well actually that's not true. And in La that's not a house. No. But la is not the real world. What is that? 67 Mustang meets Tesla. Avr Motors, all electric muscle car. Holy Fuck. That's a 68. That's a good looking too. That's one of the best looking rear ends of any car ever. An awesome looking God. Fuck. That looks incredible. 2.2 to 60. Yeah, there you go. What the fuck? So that's a new, that's a new one. So there's, it was going to cost you a ton of work that it's going to cost you a ton of money to recreate that same look. God with the look has this nice screen to what did, that's so weird though, to not shift a muscle car. I'm thinking I'm out. I'm out. I'm backing out. But you love your Tufts, although you don't shift that, but it doesn't look like that.

Speaker 1:          12:57          That would be a super ultra poser. Right? The door handles come out like a test all the way. It doesn't the Tesla doorhandles Oh fuck off next. No, no, no. There's a company that does, um, it's a company called Rev. Ology that makes old like 1966 to like 68 mustangs. But they do it with all new parts and modern technical resto mod pretty much not though because it's a new car there. They buy the full, um, that's uh, that's actually a brand new car that's never existed. Oh really? Yeah. It's a ground up build, ground up built. They buy the whole, you know, cause it's, I think it's called a unibody construction. Is that what it is? There's something, the way that these mustangs are constructed, the body's built into the frame and they bought this company sells them like completed versions of the body kit that are perfect with perfect tolerances.

Speaker 1:          13:50          Right. So like that. Like it's cool. Like that's one, there's 67 Shelby gt 500. What's the pricing? Oh Wow. Stupid expensive. Yeah. It's not gonna work. It's like two Teslas. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. But they're dope. It's dope as fuck. If you look at like what it looks like, go down, see some pictures of it, Jamie, you'd get a better, better sense of it. But this guy is, that's meticulous. Yeah. This company is very meticulous. I'm, I've been following their stuff for quite awhile and what they do is really incredible. Right? That's an all met all new sheet metal. I can, everything's new, but it has some killer brakes and it has a modern Coyote Mustang engineer, right? Fibo Yup. So it's a 460 horsepower engine in these old badass muscle cars. And that one's the gt 500 that was actually super charged. That is a 600 horsepower engine that it's dope.

Speaker 1:          14:38          They're fucking gorgeous. They're gorgeous cars. There's really pretty so, so what would you think about someone dropping an electric motor on one of these things? See, I love it. Look, I love, I love people doing crazy shit, but it's not for me. I need to shift if I'm driving that thing, I got to pretend I'm Steve McQueen. I hear you man. Oh Oh. Basic thing. So what do you think about the new, you seen the new Tesla roadster, right? Gorgeous. What do you think about it? I love it. Yeah, but it's theirs from the bottom up. You know what I'm saying? It's like, I don't mind not shifting in it. That thing seems like it's going to literally punch a hole through space time. Yeah, I think so too. I think they're looking at it like zero to 60 in like one point something seconds. I think it's one nine.

Speaker 1:          15:16          That's what they're saying. It's insane. That's bizarre. I know. It's crazy when you feel it in the p 100 deep mine. Like everybody that I get in the car and I stomp on the gas, they're like, they can't believe it. They can't believe that these are around you. It's like it's like vampires being around people. But people that just leap to the top abilities that walking around can regular until some shit goes down. Yeah. No, they're, they're absolutely amazing cars, man. And I think that's the main reason why I was like, I gotta get one of these man. So what was the struggle? Initial struggle. You have the car, you take it apart and what did you see? It's pretty much, I was kind of taking my time because I knew there was a point where I couldn't fix the damn thing. And I've just kind of wasting everyone's time.

Speaker 1:          15:55          Wife's like, Hey, is this thing almost done? I was like, yeah, babe, don't worry about it. We're good. Don't worry. Your money's safe. And, um, so there's a certain point where I took everything apart and I was like, alright, cool. I found a dead fish in the back of the car. So actually, you know what the turning point, this whole thing was that the turning point yeah. Was, um, I, I realized it was salt water and not fresh water. So, you know what? Saltwater does this stuff, right? So it just, it just kills everything. So, uh, 90% of the car was kind of toast. And, uh, I said to myself, all right, I'm going to call Tesla, you know, buy a motor by a battery pack, I'll be good. You know what I mean? Maybe I'll spend like 20 grand for a battery and like maybe 10 for a motor, I'll be filling for 40.

Speaker 1:          16:36          It's still cheaper than a hundred. Right, right. So, so I called them up and uh, you know, they were like, hey, you know, how's it going man? I was like, Hey, you know what a crazy thing happened, right? So I bought this tussles under water and um, I need like a couple of things. I need a battery, I need like a motor, you know, just, just told me those things, it's fine. They're like, well, we're not going to sell it. To was like, well why not? Because you have no capability of fixing the car yourself. You know, you're going to get yourself killed. It's not going to work. You know, give me your vin number. And I gave him the Vin number. They're like, no, that car is listed as salvage. That thing was underwater. We're not going to help you. And they just hung up the phone pretty.

Speaker 1:          17:06          Ooh. Yeah. So like this is the crazy part two is that they know, you know, I'm putting my conspiracy theorist hat on. They know where every single car is. They know what it's doing. They know if the airbags went off, they know if you farted the front seat, they know everything about these cars. So pretty much when you give them the vin number, you know, the cars are always kept it back to the mothership to give you the status in the car so they know what's going on. So you know, if you try to hide from you, just you just can't do it. Um, so, so I had the, I had the car and I said to myself, you know what? This isn't going to work. I've got to figure something out. So what I did, basically I bought another car for 15 grand and I was like, I got to swap this stuff over.

Speaker 1:          17:44          So I saw, so the other one that you bought for 15 grand, everything worked well. He was on a end collision. Okay. It wasn't a hard front end collision and the frame's bent or something. Rain was banned to thing was toast and I just took all the electronics from one to the other. How do you check to make sure that everything is damaged again? Well, that's a good thing. A lot of the wiring harnesses were cut right in the front end collision car. But the interesting part was that in the flooded car, the wiring harnesses, we're still good for the most part in the front really. So what I did was, I mean meaning not broken or torn or have Ben connectors, I just took those connectors off and actually clean them because they couldn't get parts, you know, from Tesla. And I took like the wet wiring harnesses that we're all corroded, pulled them out, got like, you know, a Qtip toothbrush and all that stuff he cleaned them with.

Speaker 1:          18:28          So I cleaned them with um, with baking, speaking soda and I'm like a wire brush and like I got a toothpick to, to really get in there and like cleaning the contacts and stuff. I just rinsed them out with water. By this time your wife was probably like, what? She's pissed. She goes, I noticed we're missing $30,000 from our bank account and two cars that don't work exactly to printers don't work, you know, and if there is a $30,000 missing from our bank account, like, what's going on here? So, um, it was just, it was painstaking, but eventually, you know, I got the job done then, so, so I ended up doing was so 30 grand, right. I told my friends, hey listen, you know, I'm in a mess here and we're building a test on it. Just like, you know, you're an idiot, you're not going to figure this out. Like no one's doing that. Cause this was, this was years ago, this is when the cars were still kind of coming onto the scene and they weren't as popular as they are now. And like you can't fix that. Like you're an idiot, you can't do that. I've seen your work.

Speaker 1:          19:23          And uh, so yeah, so after a while, you know, I took all the parts from one to the other, um, got one running and then the parts I didn't need anymore, like the, like the old battery pack and some of the action. So there were some parts of the battery that we're still good. So I actually sold those parts like online and on Ebay and stuff like that. And then I sold like the motor, he had water in it. Someone got, give me five grand for a motor that had water in it. That's how valuable these parts are. So mad. Was he planning on doing the same thing with cleaning it out? I, I have no idea to this day. I don't know. So I think he has in the same situation. I think he brought it home to his wife. He's like, hey look what I got.

Speaker 1:          20:03          I'd probably still at his house and uh, so after all of that, so all of the parts I ended up getting the car I have now for about six grand. So you take the engine and is that one of the four wheel drive ones? The ones you have. This was just the rear wheel drive one. And so it has just the rear engine. The single motor. Yep. One engine. And so you take those out, you put it all back in, you'll replace the wires and then it's good to go. What about the computer? What about, Gosh, so pretty much the, the computer thing was interesting because there was, so I called Tesla again, right? I was like, hey buddy, like this car is like 99% of the way there. Do you know, do they know who you are at this point? They still don't know who I am.

Speaker 1:          20:44          Nor did they care. They still probably don't care who I am but, but did you say, hey man, you remember you hung up on me? Like yeah, right. The car still doesn't work. Well still didn't work. Right. So the tough part was I had to, so remember I had no, I had no key for the car. Oh. So I was like, Hey, I need a key. You know what I mean? Like help me out here and get a key. And they were like, well, are you the same idiot that called my, yeah, I need the key. They were like, we can't, as I stated before, we can't help you because you know this, this is a salvage car, so you're on your own. So what I did was I actually in the, in the GPS screen, because the screen turned on the, the, the guy still had the home location.

Speaker 1:          21:24          So I pushed home on the GPS screen. Found the guy's address, right? This is creepy. I gets creepy, right? Found the guy's address. And I was like, Hey, you know, can we, uh, I called them up. I was like, hey, did you own like a white Tesla by chance? And he's like, who is like, yeah, I own one. I was like, yeah, um, so I bought it and I need the key. Do you have the key to the car? And he's like, no, I don't, I don't have that. Like, what do you call me for like, I don't understand is like, well, I'm rebuilding it, I'm putting the electronics from your condo or another, and, um, I want to figure it out. And he's like, you know what, I can't help you. I don't have the key. And I was like, damn socks, you know, cause you know, I have a family and stuff and you know, kind of give him the sob story, like, you know, he could really look for and helped me out would be good.

Speaker 1:          22:10          And, uh, we started talking about general topics and he's like, you know, you know, I know you're a car guy. That's awesome. Um, I had, uh, I had a zero six once and I was like, Hey, I have a zero six two. And he's like, yeah, it was, it was Le Mans blue. And I was like, Hey, mines the mines blue. And he's like, what year is it? I was like, it's an o six. He goes, I sold that same car or car like it like two years ago to a guy in Florida. I was like, I bought the car from a guy in Florida. So we started bonding. So it turns out I actually owned his old six. Yeah, it's crazy. Right? What are the odds of two human beings on the planet? You own both of this guy's car pulls of this guy's car.
