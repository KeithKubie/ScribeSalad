00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.750
Movies come in all shapes and sizes.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.180
Some are big and loud and thrilling, while
others are small, finely crafted gems.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.570
And there are few love stories as soft-spoken
and full of soul as Sofia Coppola’s Lost

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.570
in Translation.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.700
It’s a movie that sneaks up on you, using
artistry that feels so natural that the precision

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.550
of its craft is only clear if you think about
it afterward.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.890
This film also wrestles with complex questions
about modern consumer culture and how cinema

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.500
can authentically portray a woman’s point
of view.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.990
And did I mention it’s funny too?

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.120
Even as it tugs at your heart.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:46.000
[intro music plays]

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.820
Writer-director Sofia Coppola had only made

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:51.220
one feature film before she began working
on Lost in Translation.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.149
That film, The Virgin Suicides, was based
on a book by Jeffrey Eugenides.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.170
It tells the story of the mysterious and doomed
Lisbon sisters in 1974 Detroit, as remembered

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.360
by the neighborhood boys some forty years
later.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.180
It’s a complex, dreamy movie that establishes
Coppola as a master of tone, perspective,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.180
and imagery.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.330
With Lost in Translation, Coppola both expanded
her scope – exploring the eclectic world

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.700
of contemporary Japan – while also focusing
the drama on two central characters.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.450
Scarlett Johansson plays Charlotte, a 20-year-old
woman who’s come to Tokyo with her rock-and-roll

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.850
photographer husband, played by Giovanni Ribisi.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.590
A recent college graduate and philosophy major,
Charlotte is adrift – not only in this foreign

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.770
city, but in her marriage, and even her life.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.440
Bob Harris is a movie star.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.310
Or… he was a movie star.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.830
Now he flies to Tokyo to spend a week shilling
for a high-profile Japanese whisky company

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.700
– recording commercials, making talk show
appearances, and suffering from insomnia.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.780
In one of the film’s many ironies, Bob is
played by Bill Murray, who was once a major

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.850
movie star himself.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.830
Unlike Bob, Murray has emerged from the
height of his fame into a late career full

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.010
of meaty roles that are often as sorrowful
as they are funny.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.810
And his Bob Harris is no exception.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.229
This film is patient.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.479
We spend a lot of time getting to know Charlotte
and Bob alone before they ever meet each other.

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.479
We see them trapped in the interior spaces
of their luxury hotel, dealing with spouses

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.979
who don’t seem to be on the same wavelength,
and mesmerized by the lights and sounds of

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:09.979
the city.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.250
When they do start to interact with one
another, it’s tentative.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.590
A smile in an elevator.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.260
A look across a crowded lounge.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.270
And eventually, a brief conversation at the
bar.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.050
When Charlotte’s husband heads out of town
for a few days to work, Charlotte asks Bob

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.250
to come out with her and some of her Japanese
friends.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.270
The two have an easy, funny rapport.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.000
They seem to recognize something in one
another, like kindred spirits.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.440
Charlotte: So, what are you doing here?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.540
Bob: A couple of things.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.100
Bob: Taking a break from my wife. Forgetting my son's birthday.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.540
Bob: And getting paid two-million dollars to endorse a whiskey, when I could be doing a play somewhere.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.960
Charlotte is an old soul, and Johansson plays

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.180
her with an effortless, mournful charm that
belies her youth.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.420
Bob begins the film as a sad sack, until Charlotte
draws out his youthful charisma.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.850
And Murray makes both sides of his character
feel genuine, funny, and moving.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.550
As their relationship deepens, the movie never
quite goes where we expect.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.379
Bob and Charlotte comfort and confide in one
another, essentially falling in love.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.920
But they never cross the line into a physical
affair.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.970
Although we do see them struggling to figure
out how physical love fits into their connection.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.770
Near the end of the film, they share an awkward
set of goodnight kisses in an elevator.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.290
But they seem to be grappling with what’s
expected of them, rather than any deep-seated

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.290
sexual desire.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.060
In fact, the one thing that ruptures the bubble
of their relationship is when Bob sleeps with

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.000
an over-the-top lounge singer.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.230
But Charlotte seems just as upset by his betrayal
as she is by the fact that she feels jealousy

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.220
at all.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.940
Charlotte: Well, she is closer to your age.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.540
In the film’s now-famous climactic scene,
Bob catches a glimpse of Charlotte from the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.360
car on his way to the airport.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.660
Feeling unsatisfied in their initial goodbye,
he leaps out of the car, runs across traffic,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.830
and catches up with her.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.709
They embrace, clinging to each other for a
brief moment, and then Bob whispers something

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.780
in Charlotte’s ear.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.880
And we don’t get to hear it!

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.940
But... it must’ve been good.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.190
Because when Bob gets back in his car and
as Charlotte walks away, they both seem more

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.060
content, as if a weight has been lifted.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.390
It’s like their connection will somehow
last as they navigate the rest of their lives

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.600
and relationships.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.960
The ultimate bittersweet ending.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.349
Now, our job as critics isn’t just to figure
out what a film means.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.330
It’s also to figure out how that meaning
is created.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.470
Writing in Quarterly Review of Film and Video,
critic and scholar Todd McGowan makes a compelling

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.260
case for reading Lost in Translation as a
critique of global capitalism.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.760
That’s right.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.769
Capitalism.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.930
we’re going there!

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.059
He writes, “Bob and Charlotte are able to
connect during their stay … precisely because

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:32.319
they each realize that the excess that bombards
them throughout Tokyo conceals a fundamental

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:33.319
absence.”

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.419
Throughout the film, both characters seem
to be alienated from the bustling city that

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.419
surrounds them.

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.960
Bob gazes in wonder the neon lights of Tokyo
in the opening scene, utterly overwhelmed.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.139
And Charlotte is frequently sitting at her
hotel window, looking out at the city’s

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.160
urban sprawl, as if it’s all too much.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.090
And when she does go out, the film assaults
us with the loud noises of an arcade, the

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.599
blaring music of a bar, and the cacophony
of some intense Tokyo traffic.

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.949
But when she finds moments away from it
all, she seems more at peace.

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.480
Like, in a quiet hallway outside a karaoke
lounge, at a shrine hidden in the city, or

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.490
when she stumbles across women practicing
ikebana, the Japanese art

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.599
of flower arrangement.

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:08.770
Bob is even more steeped in excess.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.009
He’s even a part of it!

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:13.909
His picture is plastered all over billboards
and the sides of buses.

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.759
His old movies play on TV.

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.439
And he participates in a loud, garish Japanese
talk show.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:22.710
He also keeps getting messages from his wife
back home in Los Angeles, with questions about

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.699
colors, fabrics, and decor as she remodels
his office.

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.780
Eventually, a FedEx box arrives with carpet
swatches – a dozen, basically indistinguishable

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.099
shades of burgundy.

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.039
The moment is played for laughs, but it only
increases Bob’s sense of being overwhelmed

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:37.080
by commerce.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.389
So what does all this excess mean?

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:44.330
McGowan suggests that our desire for excessive
things and experiences is actually a product

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.169
of a global capitalist system.

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.069
And that system only functions when we’re
constantly hungry for more.

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.279
By this interpretation, Lost in Translation
is a film about unsatisfaction.

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:56.490
Bob is unsatisfied in his work.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.169
Charlotte doesn’t even know where to start.

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.249
And they’re both unsatisfied in their marriages.

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:05.690
At the same time, both of their spouses personify
the quest for excess – from Bob’s wife’s

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.599
focus on the carpet squares, to how Charlotte’s
husband relishes his role as a photographer

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.419
promoting glamor and music.

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:16.219
In McGowan’s reading, our heroes connect
by rejecting a never-ending quest for material

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:17.360
satisfaction.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.499
And they fill their lives with small, quiet
moments instead.

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:25.249
In a sense, they find meaning and forge their
relationship in absence, not excess.

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:30.490
They find joy in spontaneity, like a race
across traffic, an off-key karaoke performance,

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.399
or an unexpected ikebana ceremony.

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:36.009
These moments can’t be planned, can’t
be replicated, and – most importantly – can’t

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:37.009
be bought.

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:40.789
This focus on the power of absence is felt
throughout the film, which follows the pattern

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:44.039
of a traditional romance, from the meet-cute
to the climactic trip to the airport.

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:48.180
But at each major turn, the story withholds
key romantic beats.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.879
Like, Bob and Charlotte never consummate their
relationship.

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.599
Or when Bob races after Charlotte in the final
scene, he’s not doing it to sweep her off

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.389
her feet for a happily ever after.

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.620
And his whisper is the ultimate expression
of absence.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.089
The film builds to a climax that withholds
the final piece of information from us, and

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:07.280
in doing so, gives that absence incredible value.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.140
It's also really important to note that this is a film about outsiders in Japan.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.240
Directed by Sophia Coppola, an American who's an outsider herself.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.240
And because of that, something else gets lost in translation.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.440
This movie relies on some cultural stereotypes for comedy and plot.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.660
For instance, the call girl who tries to talk
to Bob in broken English is a caricature — the

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:29.909
audience is meant to laugh at her mispronunciation,
which doesn’t have any other purpose in

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:30.909
the story.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:35.349
And while ancient traditions, like temples
or ikebana, are glorified, the film also implies

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:39.229
that many modern Japanese people have forsaken
these “good” parts of their culture for

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:40.879
ridiculous excess.

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:42.479
Which is a really reductive perspective.

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:47.419
So even if it wasn’t intended, this movie
sometimes uses Japan as a backdrop and Japanese

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:51.719
people as gags in ways that reinforce stereotypes,
which can be harmful.

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:55.319
Now, it’s also worth looking at the characters
and relationship in Lost in Translation through

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.319
a feminist lens.

00:07:56.319 --> 00:08:00.569
The year it was released, Sofia Coppola became
the third woman ever nominated for a Best

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:01.580
Director Oscar.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.879
And Todd Kennedy makes the case in the journal
Film Criticism that Coppola’s films seem

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:08.909
to be building a feminine, if not feminist,
film form.

00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:13.330
The foundational text of feminist film criticism
by theorist and filmmaker Laura Mulvey,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.709
argues that mainstream cinema is overwhelmingly
films made by men, for men.

00:08:17.709 --> 00:08:21.039
In these films, women are usually objects
of desire or derision.

00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:23.839
In other words, they’re eye candy, or someone
to laugh at.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:28.090
The camera takes the point of view of the
male gaze, putting audiences in the perspectives

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.289
of the male characters within the film as
they – and by extension we – look at

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:33.289
the women.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:37.209
Kennedy argues that Sofia Coppola cleverly
uses the language, grammar, and tropes of

00:08:37.209 --> 00:08:42.680
mainstream cinema and the male gaze to force
us to step back and consider our expectations

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.339
and complicity in that form.

00:08:44.339 --> 00:08:47.800
A great example is the first shot of the film,
in which Scarlett Johansson is photographed

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.110
from behind and from the neck down, lying
on a bed.

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:52.269
She’s in a sweater and vaguely translucent
panties.

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:55.730
Kennedy writes, “This shot would seem to
match Mulvey’s description of a typical

00:08:55.730 --> 00:09:02.220
Hollywood scene in which the camera is active/masculine
and the female character is passive/feminine—an

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.220
object of desire.”

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.470
However, Coppola holds the shot for thirty-six
seconds, which is forever in film time,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.220
before the title of the film shows up.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.760
And Kennedy goes on: “What is interesting
about this shot is that it lasts so long as

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:20.160
to become awkward—forcing the audience to
become aware of (and potentially even question)

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.899
their participation in the gaze.”

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:26.190
Time and again, the film inverts the usual
Hollywood presentation of women on screen.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.440
Charlotte appears half-dressed a number of
times throughout the film, but these images

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.569
aren’t sexualized.

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:34.329
Instead, we’re asked to gaze with her
at the world outside her window.

00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:38.319
So while the outward aesthetic is familiar
to mainstream cinema, our perspective doesn’t

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:39.920
slip into the male gaze tropes.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.430
And these are just a couple examples of how
Coppola’s central female character is allowed

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.529
to be a whole, complex human.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:49.610
Charlotte is wrapped up in a warm, funny,
bittersweet film that never condescends to

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.310
her for a laugh, and has got a lot more going
on than just pretty pictures.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.190
Next time, we’ll take a journey with Sofia’s
father into the heart of darkness itself,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.100
the Vietnam War as seen through the film Apocalypse
Now.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:04.440
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.630

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:10.839
