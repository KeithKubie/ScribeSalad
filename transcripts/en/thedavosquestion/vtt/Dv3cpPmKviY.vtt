CAMILLA WEBSTER &gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Camilla Webster.
I'm the anchor for Forbes dot com. And my

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.290
answer to the Davos question, how you make
the world a better place? Well, for everything

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.950
everybody's said about the world economic
forum just being a gab fest, it is an inspiring

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.380
place to be. I've enjoyed the exchange of
ideas, and I think if we can bring some of

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.430
these ideas to the world, some of our world
leaders can really take the messages and things

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.750
they've learned here into the work place,
into the government, into the populations,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.450
we do have a chance of making 2008 a great
year. Thanks.
