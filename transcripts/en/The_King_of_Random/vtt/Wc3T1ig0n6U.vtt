00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.829
hey guys it's good to see you again I'm

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.120
back today with the fun and simple

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.680
little experiments that you can try at

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.029
home the only materials are going to

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.589
need for this project are an apple a

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.690
knife a ziplock bag and some paper towel

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.429
now for this project today I thought

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.630
it'd be fun to see if we could actually

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.790
sprout an apple seed now when you were a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.109
kid there's a good chance your parents

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.670
told you not to eat apple seeds or

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.230
swallow watermelon seed because it would

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.090
sprout a tree in your stomach but that's

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.800
not necessarily true because there's

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.330
quite a process to getting a seed to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.099
sprout and that is the purpose of this

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.080
experiment today now to get started we

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.880
need to extract the seeds from our Apple

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.320
and so you could just eat it and pull

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.059
the seeds out as you do or you could

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.620
grab a knife and cut very carefully at a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.910
45 degree angle to the center

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.300
okay so once you've got your seeds

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.740
separated from the apples go ahead and

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.180
grab one sheet of paper towel and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.920
something like this little water mixture

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.840
all we're going to do is take our paper

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.920
towel we're going to fold it in half

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.960
lengthwise and set it down the counter

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.340
we're going to use our little mixture to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.990
give it five to six sprays on one side

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.790
then flip it over and give it five to

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.589
six shots on the other side the goal is

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.210
we want to get this things damp but we

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.070
don't want it to be wet all right with

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.390
our paper towel moistened we can go

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.710
ahead and take a few of our apple seeds

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.090
and place them down into a line

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.460
somewhere in the top half area the only

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.750
thing left to do after that is to fold

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.370
the paper towel in half over top of the

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.960
seeds place it into the ziplock bag and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.210
seal it tight so there we have a guys

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.740
just like that we now have five of our

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.509
apple seeds tucked away inside with

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.280
moist paper towel and locked into the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.259
block bag by the way it's not a bad idea

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.000
to mark the date under the bag so you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.710
know when the three weeks is up the only

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.729
thing left to do now is to tuck this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.229
away deep into the back of our fridge

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.820
and completely forget about it for the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.070
next three weeks now it's just magic of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.600
editing we fast forward into the future

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.550
three weeks with a simple clap of our

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.890
hand boom here we are three weeks later

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.000
let's go check our result

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.110
all right I'm actually really curious to

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.660
see what we got here this bag has done

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.190
nothing but sit in that fridge for three

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.400
weeks in the dark completely in neglect

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.570
didn't the first thing I notice is the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.830
paper towel is actually still quite

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.750
moist still quite down which would make

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.460
sense because it was in a sealed ziplock

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.060
bag

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.440
all right let's peel back the top layer

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.680
until we've got oh my goodness look at

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.150
that our seeds have actually sprouted

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.640
some more than others these two over

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.050
here seem to have taken off quite

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.540
vigorously and viciously and these two

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.040
over here you can see little sprouts and

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.480
this one's got a little blood coming out

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.940
there as well all five of our seeds was

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.200
sprouted which i think is pretty cool

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.580
and now if we wanted to we could move

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.230
these things to a seed starter to help

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.490
them establish some roots and begin

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.260
budding into a tree and if we wanted to

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.209
we could actually grow them into apple

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.220
trees which is kind of mind-blowing but

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.230
I have to crush your expectation even if

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.940
you put years and years of effort into

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.800
growing your own apple tree the chances

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.690
of your apples tasting like the one you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.970
grew this from are very very slim the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.500
reason is because in our industry today

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.239
most of the apples are grafted onto

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.340
existing root structures so even though

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.930
you use the seeds from an apple you like

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.850
the apples you grow from it will taste

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.530
completely different so there you have

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.820
it guys now you know how to take the

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.959
seeds right out of the apples you're

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.340
eating stick them in the fridge for a

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.989
few weeks and grow an apple tree right

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.239
in your own backyard thanks for joining

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.410
me for this experiment I'll be looking

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.700
for the next one talk to you then

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.040
so though but now you know what the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.380
paper towels for hey guys thanks for

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.880
