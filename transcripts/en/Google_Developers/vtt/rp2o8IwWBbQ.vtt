00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.334
Bailey: Okay.

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:03.834
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:07.467
I'm John Bailey from the
University of Alaska, Fairbanks.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:11.868
And I'm in San Francisco
this week to help run

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:14.167
a special session
on the use of virtual globes

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:17.434
at the fall meeting of
the American Geophysical Union.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:21.033
We're running a session this
year in conjunction with Google,

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:23.434
so as sort of part
of the week's events

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:25.667
we've invited along
a few of the scientists

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:30.501
that are using Google Earth
and KML for display purposes

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:35.167
of their data to come down
to the downtown Google offices

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:38.033
and talk about their work.

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.567
And to start things off,

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:42.434
our first presenter
is Lisa Ballagh,

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.234
who works at the snow and ice--

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:47.667
National Snow and Ice Data
Center in Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:50.968
And she's gonna be talking
about how they visualize

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:54.400
data from glaciers
in Google Earth.

00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:03.501
Ballagh: Thank you, John.

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.767
As John mentioned,
I'm gonna be talking today

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:08.367
about two glacier data sets
in particular,

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.534
and how we can view them
in Google Earth.

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:12.701
And then I'm also gonna
be talking about GeoServer

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:16.367
and the role that GeoServer
plays in this project.

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:18.767
I'd like to acknowledge
my co-authors

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:21.033
Ethan Wang and Elena Wallace.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.968
They have contributed
tremendously to this work

00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:27.968
and I'd really like
to acknowledge their support.

00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:29.601
Before I get into the talk,

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:31.601
I'd like to give you
a little bit of background first

00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:33.467
on the National Snow and Ice
Data Center.

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.334
As John mentioned, we're located
in Boulder, Colorado.

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:37.901
And we're a big data archive,

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:40.634
so we have tons and tons
of satellite imagery,

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.968
we have imagery from submarines.

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:45.234
Or data, I should say,
from submarines.

00:01:45.234 --> 00:01:47.634
And we also have
photo collections.

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:49.033
We manage and disseminate

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:50.734
different snow and ice
data center,

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:54.634
and we're funded primarily
by NASA, NOAA, and the NSF.

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:56.267
The work that I'm gonna
be talking today--

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:58.033
about today is funded by NOAA's

00:01:58.033 --> 00:02:01.267
National Geophysical
Data Center.

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:06.234
I should say that

00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:07.868
at the National Snow
and Ice Data Center,

00:02:07.868 --> 00:02:10.901
most people come
to our website looking for data.

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.734
However, if they're
not looking for data,

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:14.801
the most--the second-most
popular search term

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:17.501
that they're looking for
is information on glaciers.

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:18.801
So I'm gonna be talking today

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:20.734
about two different
glacier data sets.

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:22.367
The Glacier
Photograph Collection

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:24.367
and the World Glacier Inventory.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:26.801
I'm gonna be showing how you can
visualize them in Google Earth,

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:29.367
and I'm gonna use GeoServer
to do this,

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:30.868
and then at the very end
I'm gonna be talking

00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:34.534
about our NSIDC
Virtual Globe site.

00:02:37.567 --> 00:02:39.734
We have a glacier
photograph collection

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:42.734
where we have glaciers
that extend back to the 1880s.

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.968
And then we have
information up to 2005.

00:02:45.968 --> 00:02:50.467
This is a really neat collection
because it was donated to NSIDC

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:55.100
in the, um--by William Field
back in the 1970s.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.167
And coverage primarily includes
Alaskan and Greenland glaver--

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:00.200
glaciers, although we do
have limited coverage

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.267
in other areas such as Canada,
Europe, New Zealand, and Peru.

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:08.200
This data set
is actually really important.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.100
It's one of our
most popular data sets at NSIDC.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.968
We have--it's doubled
in size this year,

00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:15.801
since January of 2008.

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.300
And with many contributions

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.767
by the USGS
Ice and Climate Project,

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.467
with many contributions
from Austin Post.

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:26.167
We now have over 10,000
glacier photographs online.

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:28.901
And this is a whole
project with accessibility,

00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:30.501
because when we received

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.634
this huge collection
from William Field a while ago.

00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:36.267
He gave us tons and tons
of glacier photographs,

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:38.200
but we had
the photographic prints.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.634
In order to actually
view this information

00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:42.901
you had to go
to Boulder, Colorado,

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:45.434
and you had to go
into our analog archives room,

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:46.467
and you could flip through

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:48.567
all the various
different photographs.

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:49.934
Which is great, however,

00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:52.934
thanks to NOAA's Climate
Database Modernization Program,

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:55.000
we have digitized
a lot of these photographs,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.901
and now they're
available online.

00:03:56.901 --> 00:04:01.133
We do have
several, um, thousand glaciers

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:04.133
that are not--er, prints that
are not available online yet,

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:07.734
but we are working with NOAA's
CDMP program to get this funded

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:10.968
and made available online.

00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:15.033
This just gives you
an example of Arapaho Glacier

00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:20.167
in 1912, 1966, and in 2004.

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:23.100
and you can kind of see
how the glaciers have--

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.300
how this particular glacier
has retreated over time.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.868
A subset of our collection
is a set of repeat photographs,

00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:35.100
where a photographer
will go to an exact location

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.534
and specifically try and repeat
a photograph from the past.

00:04:38.534 --> 00:04:40.968
So, for example, this is
Holgate Glacier in Alaska,

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:43.100
taken in July of 1909,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.868
and then taken again by
Bruce Molnia in August of 2004.

00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:49.701
And what's really neat about
this is that you can

00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:52.334
visually see some
of the retreat that's happened

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.767
with various glaciers over time,

00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:57.901
and this is really what
the public are interested in.

00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.767
Everyone is coming to our site
looking for glaciers,

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:03.334
and so we have
these photos now online,

00:05:03.334 --> 00:05:06.234
and we've also created
several different KML files

00:05:06.234 --> 00:05:07.801
so that you can
zoom into Google Earth,

00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:11.067
you can go to Alaska, look
at the different placemarks.

00:05:11.067 --> 00:05:12.234
You click on a placemark

00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:15.033
and it pops up information
in Google Earth.

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:16.234
What's also important

00:05:16.234 --> 00:05:18.100
about the Google Earth work
that we've done

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.834
is that we have information--
we have our metadata

00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:23.100
associated with these
glacier photographs.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.067
So you don't just have glacier
photographs without any context.

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:27.501
We have information

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:30.367
about each specific glacier
photograph in our collection,

00:05:30.367 --> 00:05:32.834
and this is really the most
important part, I think,

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:35.234
because you can view the photos,

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:36.901
which are obviously
very interesting,

00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:39.200
but without the metadata

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.667
you don't really know
what you're looking at,

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:44.834
and it's not very useful.

00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:47.434
I just talked about the glacier
photograph collection,

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:49.634
but the second data set
I'm gonna talk about

00:05:49.634 --> 00:05:51.767
is our world glacier
inventory data set.

00:05:51.767 --> 00:05:54.567
So while the glacier photos
are actually photographs,

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:58.467
this is more raw data
and statistics about glaciers.

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:01.667
This collection
has over 100,000 glaciers,

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:03.334
and it's a snapshot in time.

00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:04.667
So we have information

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:07.400
such as latitude and longitude
of the glacier,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.400
the total area,
the mean depth, and so on.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.400
Our objective--our objective
was to make this information

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.467
accessible through Google Earth.

00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:20.467
Now, with the glacier
photograph collection,

00:06:20.467 --> 00:06:22.868
we have static KML files,

00:06:22.868 --> 00:06:25.200
and when the glacier photograph
collection is updated,

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.267
we have to update our KML files

00:06:27.267 --> 00:06:29.267
to make sure
that they are in sync.

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:31.901
With the World Glacier
Inventory it's--

00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:33.367
it was just
too large to do this.

00:06:33.367 --> 00:06:35.033
We have over 100,000 records.

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:36.667
If we created a KML file,

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:39.234
it would be thousands
and thousands of pages long,

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:40.601
and it would probably crash

00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.167
if you tried to open it
in Google Earth.

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:45.434
So we had to come up
with some kind of solution,

00:06:45.434 --> 00:06:47.033
and we wanted it to be
a dynamic solution

00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:49.734
because every time we update
the World Glacier Inventory

00:06:49.734 --> 00:06:51.501
we don't want to actually go in

00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.300
and manually update
the KML file.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.367
We want this
to be done automatically.

00:06:55.367 --> 00:06:58.734
So our solution was
to use GeoServer for this,

00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:03.567
which will dynamically request
area-specific information.

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:08.300
So to get our World Glacier
Inventory from the--

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.467
from our one database into KML,
we're using GeoServer.

00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:14.567
If you're not familiar
with GeoServer,

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:16.467
here's a diagram
that kind of shows you

00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:18.434
the different inputs
that you can use.

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:20.968
So we have inputs
for the World Glacier--

00:07:20.968 --> 00:07:23.400
I'm using the World Glacier
Inventory for this,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.734
and then you can have
different output options.

00:07:25.734 --> 00:07:27.434
And what's nice about GeoServer

00:07:27.434 --> 00:07:30.868
is that it automatically creates
these output options for you.

00:07:30.868 --> 00:07:34.801
We're using Postgres,
um, as our input,

00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:37.400
so we've loaded all of our
World Glacier Inventory data

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.634
into this database,

00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:40.434
and then we're connecting it
to GeoServer,

00:07:40.434 --> 00:07:45.334
and then GeoServer automatically
creates this KML output for us.

00:07:47.567 --> 00:07:49.968
Here's a quick view
from Google Earth

00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:51.400
of our World Glacier Inventory,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.667
and I've kinda
zoomed in on Europe.

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:57.601
I've added a little placemark
here for the overview

00:07:57.601 --> 00:08:00.067
to give you context
for what we're looking at.

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:02.200
And then we have
little red arrows,

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.767
and each red arrow represents

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:07.567
a glacier in our
World Glacier Inventory.

00:08:07.567 --> 00:08:09.734
You can zoom in a little bit.

00:08:09.734 --> 00:08:13.634
And zoom in a little bit more.

00:08:13.634 --> 00:08:16.467
And you can click
on one of these icons

00:08:16.467 --> 00:08:19.100
and it gives you
information about the data.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.667
And this is pulled dynamically
from the database.

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.167
So the closer you zoom in,
it's recalculating,

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:26.200
"Oh, I'm only interested
in this particular region,

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.367
"I'm only gonna return

00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:29.968
"these results to you
through GeoServer."

00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:33.300
And I have formatted this
so that you can go back

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.334
to our documentation to get
information on the metadata.

00:08:37.334 --> 00:08:39.234
All of the field names
I've included here

00:08:39.234 --> 00:08:41.701
along with all of their values.

00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:44.167
And, for example,
let's say you don't know

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:45.767
what one of the country
codes means.

00:08:45.767 --> 00:08:47.234
You don't know what "CH" means.

00:08:47.234 --> 00:08:48.834
You can click
on our documentation

00:08:48.834 --> 00:08:52.634
and it has information on what
all the country codes mean,

00:08:52.634 --> 00:08:58.634
and that helps you
better understand the data.

00:08:58.634 --> 00:09:00.868
Michael Jones of Google
spoke last night

00:09:00.868 --> 00:09:03.901
at the AGU conference
here in San Francisco,

00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:07.801
and he was talking
about having scientists, uh,

00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:11.767
communicate the results
and distribute their data,

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:14.100
and he mentioned that
a lot of scientists actually,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.634
you know,
will distribute their data,

00:09:15.634 --> 00:09:17.000
and they'll put it online,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.534
but sometimes they don't
have any information--

00:09:19.534 --> 00:09:21.467
they don't have
any column headers.

00:09:21.467 --> 00:09:23.000
So you can look at the data,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.567
but it's not gonna
make any sense to you

00:09:24.567 --> 00:09:27.067
because you don't know
what the values mean,

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.033
you don't even know
what the headers are.

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:32.200
That's analogous to the output
you'll get using GeoServer

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.501
if you don't use KML templates
and styled layer descriptors.

00:09:36.501 --> 00:09:40.133
So in this example here,
I have used a KML template

00:09:40.133 --> 00:09:42.267
and a styled layer descriptor

00:09:42.267 --> 00:09:45.868
because if I don't,
you're gonna get this long table

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:48.067
with records from the database

00:09:48.067 --> 00:09:51.367
and it--it--it's not gonna
really make any sense to you.

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:54.334
For example, topographic scale
in the database

00:09:54.334 --> 00:09:57.300
might have a field name
of "topo_scale"

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.267
and you might not know
what that means,

00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:01.133
and it just gives you
this long output.

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.901
So I formatted it to make it

00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:06.868
a little bit easier
to understand in Google Earth.

00:10:06.868 --> 00:10:11.701
At the heart of this,
of course, is GeoServer.

00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:13.901
And the key with GeoServer
is interoperability.

00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:16.534
So you can take data
from various different sources,

00:10:16.534 --> 00:10:18.467
you can integrate it
into GeoServer,

00:10:18.467 --> 00:10:19.701
and then you can use this

00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:22.534
through several different
web mapping locations.

00:10:22.534 --> 00:10:24.501
It supports OGC standards,

00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:27.167
and you can share and edit
geospatial data.

00:10:27.167 --> 00:10:30.133
And what I like about GeoServer
is that it's GUI-driven.

00:10:30.133 --> 00:10:31.534
You don't have to
be a programmer

00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:33.534
in order to be able
to use GeoServer.

00:10:33.534 --> 00:10:35.834
And once GeoServer
is up and running,

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:38.334
you can load
your data into GeoServer

00:10:38.334 --> 00:10:41.234
and it automatically creates
the KML files for you.

00:10:41.234 --> 00:10:43.567
And the GUI is very intuitive.

00:10:43.567 --> 00:10:45.567
Another thing I should note
is that a lot of times

00:10:45.567 --> 00:10:47.133
when you think
of open-source software,

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:50.000
you think, oh, well, it might
not be very well documented.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.834
I must say
that I'm quite impressed

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:54.767
with the documentation
for GeoServer.

00:10:54.767 --> 00:10:57.267
Several--
the open source community

00:10:57.267 --> 00:10:58.534
has done a really good job

00:10:58.534 --> 00:11:01.067
of putting information
together about GeoServer,

00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:02.400
and whenever I have questions,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.000
I resort back
to the documentation,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.801
and I usually find the answers
that I'm looking for.

00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:12.901
This is an example
of the GeoServer main page.

00:11:26.434 --> 00:11:29.234
And from the main page I've
clicked on one of the layers.

00:11:29.234 --> 00:11:31.767
This is the World Glacier
Inventory Layer.

00:11:31.767 --> 00:11:33.567
And I'm clicking on "KML" here.

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:37.567
This--this page kind of lists
all the layers that you see,

00:11:37.567 --> 00:11:39.868
along with all of the outputs.

00:11:39.868 --> 00:11:42.300
You can also go in
and make configuration changes.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.033
So you can go
to data and feature types.

00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:47.701
And you can get
the World Glacier Inventory data

00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:49.133
that you've just loaded.

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:50.968
And you can change the style.

00:11:50.968 --> 00:11:53.868
Say, for example, you don't like
the red arrows that I have,

00:11:53.868 --> 00:11:56.367
and you wanna have a little,
white snowflake instead.

00:11:56.367 --> 00:11:58.868
You can create your own
styled layer descriptor,

00:11:58.868 --> 00:12:00.234
and it's pretty easy.

00:12:00.234 --> 00:12:03.200
You just, um, change
the style on this webpage,

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.534
hit "apply" and "save,"
and it's done for you.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:17.234
So this is an outreach project
that we're working on,

00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:19.601
and so we wanted
to take the data from GeoServer

00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:20.701
and put it into Google Earth,

00:12:20.701 --> 00:12:22.734
and we do this,
obviously, through KML.

00:12:22.734 --> 00:12:25.701
And since this is auto-gen--
automatically generated,

00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:27.801
it makes it really nice.

00:12:27.801 --> 00:12:29.234
Um, as I mentioned,

00:12:29.234 --> 00:12:31.467
the user output is not
very friendly at first,

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:33.667
but you can use templates
and styled layer descriptors

00:12:33.667 --> 00:12:35.934
and make it much nicer.

00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:40.200
Here's an example
styled layer descriptor.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.033
This is just a little piece
of code that I took out of it.

00:12:43.033 --> 00:12:45.501
But basically
I've highlighted that you can

00:12:45.501 --> 00:12:48.767
put this "snowflake_thumb.gif"
file in here,

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:53.167
and it--and you have to
save this file in GeoServer,

00:12:53.167 --> 00:12:54.868
but then everything
is snowflakes.

00:12:54.868 --> 00:12:57.167
Every single glacier
will be a snowflake

00:12:57.167 --> 00:13:00.567
instead of a red arrow
like I had it.

00:13:02.868 --> 00:13:05.734
Here's an example KML template
that I've created.

00:13:05.734 --> 00:13:09.067
This is just part of it,
but you can see, actually,

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:10.501
that part of the values in here,

00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:13.801
for example,
"glacier_num.value,"

00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:18.567
that's pulling information
dynamically from the database.

00:13:18.567 --> 00:13:22.701
And as you can see, I'm pretty
much using HTML tags here.

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:24.367
So I don't have to know
how to program,

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:26.968
I don't have to know
how to create a KML file,

00:13:26.968 --> 00:13:28.968
I just have to know
how to edit this template,

00:13:28.968 --> 00:13:30.133
and all of the information

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:34.067
is available through
the GeoServer website.

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:53.567
Next, I'm gonna show you
our virtual globe site.

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:54.701
This is a site that we have

00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:57.133
at the National Snow
and Ice Data Center.

00:13:57.133 --> 00:14:00.067
And this has
all of our Google Earth files,

00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:04.067
all in one place.

00:14:04.067 --> 00:14:05.801
You can see
on the left-hand side

00:14:05.801 --> 00:14:08.567
we have a little snapshot image
of the file,

00:14:08.567 --> 00:14:10.267
and then we also
have the KML files

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:12.734
that you can download
along with the data source,

00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:14.567
so that you can actually
go to the data source

00:14:14.567 --> 00:14:18.434
and find out
more information about this.

00:14:18.434 --> 00:14:21.267
I should note
that every file on this page

00:14:21.267 --> 00:14:22.534
has been peer-reviewed.

00:14:22.534 --> 00:14:24.133
We've set up
a peer review process

00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:26.400
for all of our KML files.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.367
Because our main goal
is we wanna create KML files,

00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:31.267
but we don't wanna
make them unusable.

00:14:31.267 --> 00:14:34.100
We wanna make KML files
that are of high quality.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.467
And so at least
three people have viewed

00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:38.901
every single file
that we've put on this website.

00:14:38.901 --> 00:14:40.901
And our goal,
obviously, is for outreach

00:14:40.901 --> 00:14:43.534
because we wanna make them
easier and more accessible

00:14:43.534 --> 00:14:46.901
to a broader audience.

00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:49.467
You can see the glaciers file
that I spoke about earlier.

00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:50.701
That's right here.

00:14:50.701 --> 00:14:52.434
You could download that.

00:14:52.434 --> 00:14:54.968
And if you look through
this website, you will not find

00:14:54.968 --> 00:14:57.868
the World Glacier Inventory file
that I spoke about earlier.

00:14:57.868 --> 00:14:59.934
Why is this?

00:14:59.934 --> 00:15:01.300
That's because it's on

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.801
our Google Earth
technical experiments page.

00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:07.300
So we're really trying
to foster innovation at NSIDC,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.400
and by doing this,
we wanna be able to have a way

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.534
to get files
out to the public

00:15:11.534 --> 00:15:12.868
that have not been
peer reviewed,

00:15:12.868 --> 00:15:14.434
but that are more innovative.

00:15:14.434 --> 00:15:17.067
So if you look on this page,

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:19.334
the World Glacier Inventory file
that I was talking about

00:15:19.334 --> 00:15:23.033
is here.

00:15:23.033 --> 00:15:25.267
And this will go through
our peer review process,

00:15:25.267 --> 00:15:27.968
it just has not yet.

00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:29.234
But this lists various files

00:15:29.234 --> 00:15:30.701
that we've been
experimenting with,

00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:33.033
so if you're wondering
what we've been up to lately,

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:35.801
you can go to this site and
take a look at some of the files

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:40.133
that we have been working on.

00:15:43.834 --> 00:15:46.033
This concludes my presentation.

00:15:46.033 --> 00:15:49.567
As I mentioned,
this is an outreach initiative

00:15:49.567 --> 00:15:51.200
to reach a broad audience.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.834
We really wanna
get our data out there,

00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:54.634
we want more people to use it,

00:15:54.634 --> 00:15:57.300
and we wanna make it
as easy to use as possible.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.434
A lot of people
like using Google Earth,

00:15:59.434 --> 00:16:02.234
which is why
I've shown this, um, pre--

00:16:02.234 --> 00:16:04.534
I've showed Google Earth
in this presentation,

00:16:04.534 --> 00:16:05.968
but KML is an open standard,

00:16:05.968 --> 00:16:09.067
so you can view KML
in other virtual globes,

00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:11.767
such as
Microsoft's Virtual Earth.

00:16:11.767 --> 00:16:14.033
GeoServer helps serve data
through Google Earth

00:16:14.033 --> 00:16:15.400
and its open-source software,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.367
which is why we have selected
Google--or, GeoServer.

00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:19.701
And users can

00:16:19.701 --> 00:16:23.701
view the glacier data sets
in a spatial environment.

00:16:23.701 --> 00:16:25.667
Feel free to contact me
if you have any questions.

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:28.167
Thank you very much.

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:31.267
[applause]

00:16:36.934 --> 00:16:39.133
Are there any questions? Yes.

00:16:39.133 --> 00:16:40.467
Man: It's not really a question,
per se.

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:41.567
It's an observation.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:42.567
Ballagh: Okay.

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:48.501
Man: [indistinct]...

00:17:03.734 --> 00:17:04.968
Ballagh: Great. Thank you.

00:17:04.968 --> 00:17:07.000
I will just
repeat what he said.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.801
Uh, he had more of a comment
rather than a question.

00:17:10.801 --> 00:17:14.767
He's a teacher, and he uses--
he's used our sea ice images

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:17.200
in some of the classes
that he has taught,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.601
and he's found them useful,
and he thanked us.

00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:22.000
Yes.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.501
Man: Does, uh, GeoServer support
export through [indistinct]?

00:17:26.501 --> 00:17:27.868
Ballagh: That's a good question.

00:17:27.868 --> 00:17:31.234
I don't know.

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:43.133
I should note, though,
that GeoServer does--

00:17:43.133 --> 00:17:45.968
you can create--
you can add on to GeoServer,

00:17:45.968 --> 00:17:48.534
so if it's not
available in GeoServer,

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:53.234
you can program it
and make it do that.

00:17:53.234 --> 00:17:55.367
Okay. Thank you.

00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:56.868
[applause]
