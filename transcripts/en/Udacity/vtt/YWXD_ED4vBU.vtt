00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.110
So the question that I'm going to pose to you

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.180
is the following, in an RPC, there is a

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.440
client call, followed by the server procedure execution, and

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.264
then the returning the results to the client. How

00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:15.608
many times does the kernel copy stuff from the

00:00:15.608 --> 00:00:19.675
user address spaces into the kernel, and vice versa?

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:21.938
And I want you to focus on the question

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.620
a little bit more carefully. I said, the entire

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.830
interaction, going from the client call, to server

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.840
execution, and returning results back to the client,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.840
the whole package in order to execute an

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.246
RPC. How many times does the kernel copy

00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:40.522
stuff from user address spaces into the kernel

00:00:40.522 --> 00:00:44.021
buffers, and vice versa? Meaning, from the kernel

00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:50.393
buffers, back out to the user address spaces. Is it done once? Is it done twice?

00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:52.850
Is it done three times? Or four times?
