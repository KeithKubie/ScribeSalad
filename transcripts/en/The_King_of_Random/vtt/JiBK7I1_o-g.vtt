00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.797
In today's video,

00:00:00.797 --> 00:00:03.050
we're going to try making
root beer using dry ice

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.580
inside a pressurized container.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:12.540
[Music]

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.660
Guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.740
I'm Calli.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.120
I'm The Hacksmith.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.860
We've got the Hacksmith joining
us for an experiment today,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.500
and I think it's gonna
be pretty fun.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.299
So Calli, what are we
going to be doing here?

00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:23.463
We want to make root beer,

00:00:23.463 --> 00:00:24.918
but we want to make
a lot of it.

00:00:24.918 --> 00:00:27.318
We want to try and carbonate
it with the dry ice,

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.600
but we need a bigger
container to do that.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.892
Well, why don't you guys use
the old flame thrower?

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:35.696
That is an excellent idea.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.050
Our flamethrower,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.912
if you haven't seen
the build video,

00:00:38.912 --> 00:00:40.912
is actually made
out of a CO2 tank.

00:00:40.912 --> 00:00:42.320
This is designed for holding

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.448
carbon dioxide,and so
while it's usually

00:00:44.448 --> 00:00:46.950
a bad idea to put dry ice
in sealed containers,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.250
this one can handle it.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.450
The idea here is simple.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.683
We're going to mix up a batch
of root beer flavoring and sugar

00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:54.137
inside our flamethrower tank.

00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:56.320
We'll then add a lot
of dry ice, seal it up,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.500
and hopefully, it will both
pressurize the tank,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.564
and carbonate the root beer.

00:00:59.564 --> 00:01:00.364
All right.

00:01:00.364 --> 00:01:02.350
So before we start
mixing up some root beer,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.246
why don't we do
a quick test using water?

00:01:04.246 --> 00:01:06.332
Just to see how it's
actually going to react.

00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:09.776
This whole tank holds
about three and a half

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:10.588
gallons of liquid.

00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:13.120
I think we're going to start off
with about two just to give

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.080
some space in there.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.380
And I smash it with a hammer.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:27.300
[Music]

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.550
We've got water in the tank,

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.306
and as soon as the dry ice
hits that water,

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:31.910
it is going to start
building pressure.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.987
So there's a good chance

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:34.737
that some of our dry
ice is kind of,

00:01:34.737 --> 00:01:36.402
can start getting
like spit back out.

00:01:36.402 --> 00:01:37.379
So I'm going to try

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:39.850
and do it little bits
at a time to minimize that.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.592
We'll see how this goes.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.380
[Music]

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.272
Okay, we actually got
quite a bit in there.

00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:49.852
Let's go for one more, then
we're going to throw this in.

00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:51.965
We're going to put this on
with the valve open.

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:54.165
So all of the escaping
pressure can come out,

00:01:54.165 --> 00:01:56.345
because otherwise,
it builds up pressure so far

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:58.200
that you can't thread
it on all the way.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.400
All right.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.372
Let's try this.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:10.060
[Music]

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.280
It's on.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.700
Close it off,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.438
and now hopefully,
it's building up pressure

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.669
inside the tank.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.720
Oh boy, that's...

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.000
[Music]

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.100
This is not supposed to happen.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.340
What do you think?
Should we risk it?

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.120
Just try it with the--

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:28.950
We might as well.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.494
Try with the root beer.

00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:31.300
Let's do it.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.200
All right.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.073
So to make the root beer,

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:37.750
we're going to start
mixing ingredients together,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.750
including two and
a half cups of sugar.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.560
There is a lot of sugar in soda.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:52.360
[Music]

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.040
All right, so now we're going
to use some root beer extract,

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.580
and we need 2 tablespoons
to 1 gallon.

00:02:58.085 --> 00:02:59.239
Oh, like a pro.

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:01.912
Look at that, not a drop wasted.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:12.860
[Music]

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.900
That's really strong too.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.660
I might have spilled
too much into mine.

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:17.850
Just how much of a mess

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.280
is this about to make as
soon as we start pouring

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.400
the dry ice into it?

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.520
You, ready?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.400
So far so good.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.800
You're right.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.420
I think we should give it
just a minute to really

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.820
build up some pressure
and carbonate that root beer.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.120
All right, I think
we need to do a test.

00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:47.229
See how well
this thing is shooting.

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:48.650
All right, here we go.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.640
3, 2, 1.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.420
Awesome!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.300
Not bad.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.160
Wait!

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.140
Don't aim at me.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.000
Aim where you're aiming before,
I'm gonna catch it.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.880
All right.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.600
[Music]

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.660
No!

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.300
[Music]

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.160
Yep, that's aluminum root beer.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.760
[Music]

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.660
Root beer foam.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.060
[Music]

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.060
That's not bad.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.740
I would say it's
slightly less carbonated

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.960
than most root beer are going
to get in the bottle,

00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:32.550
but it definitely is fizzy.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.851
Definitely is foamy.

00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:35.156
Man, it's root beer.

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:35.680
Not bad.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.450
It does have a slight taste

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.792
of the aluminum container
that it's been sitting in.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.380
Bartender, fill me up.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.477
Thank you, Bartender.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.040
Hey, thank you ,Bartender.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.860
[Music]

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.300
All right. I'm going to shoot
this straight up, and see

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.760
if I can at least get
some into this cup.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.980
[Music]

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.620
Some!

00:05:06.622 --> 00:05:07.952
Some!

00:05:07.952 --> 00:05:22.040
[Music]

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.550
I've got a precision
challenge for you.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.640
Rather than a mug,
I just have a soda bottle.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.750
We're going to see
if you can fill the soda bottle

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.402
from like 8 feet away.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.240
You're good.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.980
So when are we gonna put
those ponchos on?

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.640
Oh yeah, about that,
about that poncho.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.200
Oh, that glove is now...

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.840
Look at this,
Make a fist and squeeze,

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.032
root beer just drips
out of my glove.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.020
It is completely soaked.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.214
Now, we got a bottle
with some root beer,

00:05:58.214 --> 00:05:59.900
and a lot of root
beer foam in it.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.700
I don't think you're going
to get the whole word.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.140
[Music]

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.980
You can totally do it.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.100
You can totally do it.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.620
We did it!

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.840
Hacksmith.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.540
We've, we've got all the
ingredients and supplies to do

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.600
that a couple more times.

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.920
Let's make some more.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:36.180
[Music]

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.500
Oh boy.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.450
The bottom of
our tank is frozen.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:40.240
Oh, no.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.798
I wonder if that means
the hose is frozen.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.080
Only one way to find out.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.940
Now, when Grant
invited me down here,

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.622
I had no idea I get to shoot
both Nate and Calli,

00:06:50.622 --> 00:06:51.600
so I'm pretty excited.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.060
Let see how it goes.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:06.800
[Music]

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.360
Oh, it torn through.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.220
Now, you can protect yourself.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.660
3, 2.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:29.260
[Music]

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.420
This is actually
frozen to the board.

00:07:31.422 --> 00:07:32.367
This is--

00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:33.280
It's a slush.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.280
He's shooting me with slush.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.931
All right, I say
let's do another batch

00:07:37.931 --> 00:07:39.601
that had a lot more power.

00:07:39.601 --> 00:07:40.220
Yeah.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.560
But it gave us a lot of issues.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.100
Yeah, the freezing bottom.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.479
And we didn't get
a nice stream of root beer,

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:46.950
we got like a hard spray.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.888
We had the same problem
with this thing

00:07:48.888 --> 00:07:50.168
when we would use the CO2

00:07:50.168 --> 00:07:51.976
in the normal fuel
as a flamethrower,

00:07:51.976 --> 00:07:53.399
is that with too much pressure,

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:56.149
it tends to just vaporize a
little bit on contact with air.

00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:58.550
So I think we should go back
to the other method,

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:00.150
root beer first,
then the dry ice.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.150
Maybe we can have
a shooting competition to see

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.580
who can fill a mug fastest.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.858
It's time for a little
friendly competition.

00:08:05.858 --> 00:08:07.648
We've got three mugs over there,

00:08:07.648 --> 00:08:09.942
and we're gonna see
who can fill the mug

00:08:09.942 --> 00:08:11.133
the most in 10 seconds.

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:13.310
So we'll each take
10 seconds, and see

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.850
who can fill their mug most.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.450
3, 2, 1

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.500
. 1.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:26.900
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.560
He actually got some in there.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.840
I definitely went
to 11 seconds too.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.000
3, 2, 1.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:45.260
. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.300
Got extra second.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.660
I don't think I got any, guys.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.156
It's all right.

00:08:49.156 --> 00:08:49.911
&gt;&gt; I think..
&gt;&gt; Little bit.

00:08:49.911 --> 00:08:51.261
Not much, but I think some.

00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:53.679
To be fair, it's first time I
have ever shot that so...

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.600
All right. Now we've got the expert,
who's already been doing this.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.500
No pressure.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.960
Alright 3, 2, 1.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:10.600
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, 3, 2...

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.780
I think he gets a few
more extra second now.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.160
Aw, that's too bad.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.852
Oh, well, we beat him.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.932

Let's see how we do.

00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:22.295
Guys, we're all terrible.

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.742
That looks pretty empty to me.

00:09:24.742 --> 00:09:25.900
There's a drip.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.700
I got maybe a tablespoon.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:29.800
Yeah.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.473
Yeah, we got,
we got two drips each.

00:09:32.473 --> 00:09:34.992
And that, Nate's
the clear winner.

00:09:34.994 --> 00:09:37.302
Almost a quarter of a swallow.

00:09:38.472 --> 00:09:40.050

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.700
