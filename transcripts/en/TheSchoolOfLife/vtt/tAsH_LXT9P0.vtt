00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.520
We tend to be generous towards people

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.280
who can't get over someone.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.920
It sounds romantic, if a little sad.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.240
The love affair happened a year ago

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.880
but still the ex's thought remain loyal
to every detail of the story.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.480
Maybe they've moved to another country.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.540
Perhaps they've married someone else.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.240
Maybe, they're dead.
None of it matters.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.980
The most famous fictional love affair
of the 18th century

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.440
Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.300
is a hugely sympathetic study
of this kind of romantic fixation.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.080
The hero, Werther,
an ardent young student

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.680
falls passionately in love

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.260
with a charming and beautiful woman
named Charlotte.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.060
She likes him but
doesn't love him back

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.420
in part because
she's married to someone else.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.160
There are plenty of
other nice women

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.560
who single, attractive,
and interested in Werther.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.940
But, he has no time for them.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.140
The only one he cares for
is Charlotte.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.460
The one who doesn't care
for him.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.040
Eventually, unable to have
Charlotte's love

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.980
Werther decides to kill
himself.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900
The novel proved
hugely charming

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.200
to its original audiences.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.060
Who praised it for its deep 
and pure understanding of love

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.620
This sort of unrequited passion

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.380
so often celebrated in literature
and society more generally

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.700
may sound generous,
and in that sense, loving,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.700
but, a devotion to
an unrequited situation

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.820
is in truth, a clever way
of ensuring that we won't end up

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.860
in a relationship at all.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.460
That we won't ever need to suffer
the realities of love.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.700
Fixation on an absent other

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.140
allows us to be publicly
committed to love

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.520
while privately sheltered
from any of its more arduous demands.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.940
The fear of love maybe 
motivated by a range of factors

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.640
A squeamishness around hope,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.520
a self-hatred which makes
someone else's love feel eerie,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.020
or a fear of self revelation
which breeds a reluctance

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.340
to let anyone into
the secret part of ourselves.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.540
The fears are serious
and deserve sympathy.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.720
But they are generally not the issues

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.960
that the romanticly fixated person

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.200
ever wants to discuss.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.560
They prefer to keep the spotlight
on the unresponsive ex,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.080
rather than on their motives

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.840
for continuing to dwell on them.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.500
The way to unfixate
is not to tell ourselves

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.520
that we never like the person.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.160
It's to get very serious and specific
about what the attraction was based on.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.820
And then to come to see that 
the qualities we had admired in the ex

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.620
must necessarily exist
in the other people

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.220
who don't have the set of problems
that make the original relationship impossible.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.300
The careful investigation
of the character of one person,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.720
paradoxically but very liberatingly

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.680
shows that we could in fact,
also love someone else.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.660
This is not an exercise in getting us 
to give up on what we really want.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.800
The liberating move is to see

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.920
that what we want has to exist
in places beyond the pain enducing character

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.080
we originally identified it in.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.560
We should gently recognize
that being dissapointed and abandoned

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.720
has its curious satisfactions.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.460
It is in an emotional sense,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.200
a very safe position to be in indeed.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.580
Yet true love isn't to be acquitted
with pining for an absent figure.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.720
It means daring to engage
with a truely frightening prospect.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.320
A person who is available
and thinks

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.080
despite our strong background
supposition to the contrary

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.560
that we're really
rather nice.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.580
That is perhaps,
the only sort of challenge

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.340
that properly deserve
the lyrical and grand word

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.020
ROMANTIC.
