00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.100
Besides introducing the terminology
of alphabets, strings, and

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.650
languages, the major goal of this lesson

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.080
is to convince you that some
functions are not computable.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.690
Central to our argument will
be the difference between

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.950
countably infinite sets and
uncountably infinite sets.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.820
If you weren't familiar with this
distinction already, you may be thinking

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.430
to yourself, infinity's
a strange enough idea by itself.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.450
Now I have to deal with two of them?

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.960
Well, it isn't as bad as all that.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.350
A countably infinite set is
one that you can enumerate.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.360
That is, you can say,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.590
this is the first element, this is
the second element, and so forth.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.100
And, this is the really important part,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.480
eventually give a number to
every element in the set.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.700
For some sets,
an enumeration is straight forward.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.190
Take the even numbers.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.235
We can say that two's the first one,
four is the second,

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:53.520
six the third and so forth.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.530
For some sets like the rationals,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.480
you've to be a little bit
clever to find an enumeration.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.420
We'll see the trick for
enumerating them in a little bit.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.700
And for some sets,
like the real numbers,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.220
it doesn't matter how clever you are,
there simply is no enumeration.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.760
These are the uncountable sets.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.740
In what follows, we'll argue that
the set of all strings over an alphabet

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.840
is countable and give a few other
results that will be useful for

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.419
thinking about countability in general.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.976
Then we will show that the set
of languages is uncountable.

00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:27.080
Let's make this notion of countable and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.950
uncountable sets precise
with a formal definition.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.520
We say that a a set is
countable if it is finite or

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.660
if there is a one-to-one correspondence
with the natural numbers.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.630
A one-to-one correspondence,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.080
by the way, is a function that
is one to one, meaning that

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.450
no two elements of the domain get mapped
to the same element of the range.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.080
And also onto,
meaning that every element of the range

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.470
is mapped to by
an element of the domain.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.495
For example, here is a one-to-one
correspondence between the integers,

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:59.935
1 through 6, and the set of
permutations of three elements.

00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:03.385
Now, in general, the existence
of a one-to-one correspondence

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:06.575
implies that the two
sets have the same size.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:08.835
That is, the same number of elements.

00:02:08.835 --> 00:02:11.865
And this actually holds even for
infinite sets.

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:15.900
That is why we say that there
are as many even natural numbers

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.770
as there are natural numbers.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.760
Because it's easy to establish
a one-to-one correspondence between

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.360
the two sets.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.360
F of N is equal to 2 N, for example.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.180
For our purposes, we are most
interested in showing that for

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.210
any finite alphabet, the set of strings
over that alphabet is countable.
