in alignment with what's expected within
the general academic public but also it

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170
the general academic public but also it
 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.270
the general academic public but also it
helps us to muster up the restraint to

helps us to muster up the restraint to
 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.940
helps us to muster up the restraint to

what Smith called self command right so
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.009
what Smith called self command right so
those are that's that's one thing that

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019
those are that's that's one thing that
 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.199
those are that's that's one thing that
we need to recognize is that in that

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209
we need to recognize is that in that
 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.509
we need to recognize is that in that
moment we are engaging in a form of

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519
moment we are engaging in a form of
 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.819
moment we are engaging in a form of
self-censorship there where we're

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829
self-censorship there where we're
 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.699
self-censorship there where we're
censoring or dampening down what would

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709
censoring or dampening down what would
 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.410
censoring or dampening down what would
have been our immediate response that's

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
have been our immediate response that's
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.449
have been our immediate response that's
a good thing this is really important I

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459
a good thing this is really important I
 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.900
a good thing this is really important I
mean Smith's entire theory of how we are

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910
mean Smith's entire theory of how we are
 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.170
mean Smith's entire theory of how we are
able to live in a world where we are

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180
able to live in a world where we are
 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.619
able to live in a world where we are
governed by moral principles depends on

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629
governed by moral principles depends on
 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.280
governed by moral principles depends on
us being being able to align our conduct

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290
us being being able to align our conduct
 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.530
us being being able to align our conduct
with what's expected in society

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540
with what's expected in society
 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.940
with what's expected in society
generally so this is really really

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950
generally so this is really really
 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.880
generally so this is really really
important but let's imagine a different

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890
important but let's imagine a different
 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.119
important but let's imagine a different
scenario right where you're again in an

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129
scenario right where you're again in an
 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.789
scenario right where you're again in an
exchange with a fellow scholar or a

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799
exchange with a fellow scholar or a
 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.610
exchange with a fellow scholar or a
classmate and there are onlookers right

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620
classmate and there are onlookers right
 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.330
classmate and there are onlookers right
and this time you're getting challenged

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340
and this time you're getting challenged
 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.240
and this time you're getting challenged
in ways that are really confrontational

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250
in ways that are really confrontational
 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.099
in ways that are really confrontational
not just by your conversation partner

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109
not just by your conversation partner
 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.319
not just by your conversation partner
but by the the whole audience the whole

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329
but by the the whole audience the whole
 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.289
but by the the whole audience the whole
classroom perhaps the Twittersphere is

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299
classroom perhaps the Twittersphere is
 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.140
classroom perhaps the Twittersphere is
lighting up with condemnation of you and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150
lighting up with condemnation of you and
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.119
lighting up with condemnation of you and
your position right what do you do in

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129
your position right what do you do in
 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.789
your position right what do you do in
that case right and that's a time where

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799
that case right and that's a time where
 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.879
that case right and that's a time where
again Smith understood that the clamor

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889
again Smith understood that the clamor
 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.159
again Smith understood that the clamor
he called it the clamor and vehement

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169
he called it the clamor and vehement
 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:45.400

of public opinion may be so strong that
you start to you know say even the

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299
you start to you know say even the
 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.170
you start to you know say even the
seasoned scholar might say you know I I

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180
seasoned scholar might say you know I I
 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.849
seasoned scholar might say you know I I
want to take a pause here because I'm

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:51.859
want to take a pause here because I'm
 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.770
want to take a pause here because I'm
I'm worried that my impartial spectator

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780
I'm worried that my impartial spectator
 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.039
I'm worried that my impartial spectator
may be off off-kilter a little bit right

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049
may be off off-kilter a little bit right
 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.259
may be off off-kilter a little bit right
so I'm gonna pause I'm gonna think
