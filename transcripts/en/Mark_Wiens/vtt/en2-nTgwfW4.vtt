00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.431
- I'm gonna start with
a piece of camel meat,

00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:05.514
and there's also pieces of camel fat.

00:00:08.825 --> 00:00:11.408
(upbeat music)

00:00:13.686 --> 00:00:15.336
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:18.615
with migrationology.com in Muscat, Oman.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:20.443
Had an amazing sleep last night

00:00:20.443 --> 00:00:22.713
and woke up this morning
at about 6:00 a.m.

00:00:22.713 --> 00:00:25.617
It was already bright and sunny outside.

00:00:25.617 --> 00:00:28.700
We only have two full days in Muscat,

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.506
and Mustafa, who watches our videos,

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:36.339
he has kindly offered to take us around.

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.100
So, we are gonna be
hanging out with Mustafa,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.900
and he's coming to pick us up soon.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.780
Stay tuned for day number one in Muscat.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.152
Thank you very much.

00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:51.158
Okay we met up with Mustafa.

00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:51.991
- Hi there.

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.596
- [Mark] He's brought me this snack.

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:55.267
- [Mustafa] It is (speaks
in foreign language).

00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:57.009
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:59.759
It's a type of bread with
cheese in the middle.

00:00:59.759 --> 00:01:02.707
And so, I think we're gonna
go have some tea first,

00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:05.238
and eat this along with some tea.

00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:07.260
We're gonna stop at
this place at Dream Tea,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.681
to get a cup of tea real fast.

00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:10.435
I got a cup of Chair karak,

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:12.185
and this is milk tea.

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:16.913
Umm.

00:01:16.913 --> 00:01:19.387
Oh you can really taste
the cardamone in there.

00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:20.821
Oh, the cardamone is nice.

00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:24.988
And then, I gotta try this
piece of the cheese bread.

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:30.682
Oh, yeah.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.033
That's wonderful.

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:34.366
That's like a...

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.281
It's kind of like cream cheese.

00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:39.746
I like that. That's really good.

00:01:39.746 --> 00:01:42.079
That makes a good breakfast.

00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:45.774
The bread and cheeses are salty,

00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:49.561
to go along with the
sweet, milky, creamy tea.

00:01:49.561 --> 00:01:52.478
(electronic music)

00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:07.366
We just pulled up to the fish market.

00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:08.868
And it's about 8:00 a.m.

00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:11.261
It is blazing hot already in Muscat.

00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:13.798
And immediately, you can
smell the fish in the air,

00:02:13.798 --> 00:02:15.651
one of my favorite smells.

00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:17.734
That fist so so good, eh.

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:21.863
- [Mustafa] Of course,
now it is that season

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:22.866
for the yam.

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.283
- [Mar] Ah, okay.

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:29.548
Pretty calm, and relaxing fish market,

00:02:29.548 --> 00:02:31.293
but it's friendly.

00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:33.857
There are some amazing looking fish.

00:02:33.857 --> 00:02:35.545
And there's a lot of tuna.

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:39.788
There are some different types of mullet.

00:02:39.788 --> 00:02:40.665
Is it mullet?

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:41.519
- [Market Vendor] Milk fish.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.471
- [Mark] Milk fish?

00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:43.304
- [Market Vendor] Yeah.

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:45.247
- [Mark] Ah, okay. Very big.

00:02:45.247 --> 00:02:47.929
- [Market Vendor] (speaks
in foreign language).

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:49.758
- I think those are either swordfish

00:02:49.758 --> 00:02:50.984
or dolphin fish.

00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:54.183
I'm not totally sure, but they are huge,

00:02:54.183 --> 00:02:57.433
and yeah they're about two meters long.

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:02.729
Whoa.

00:03:04.845 --> 00:03:08.845
(market vendors talking loudly)

00:03:16.618 --> 00:03:19.260
I just love walking around fish markets.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.021
And definitely one of the biggest reasons

00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:23.925
is because I love to eat
fish and seafood so much,

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:27.816
that's my favorite genre of things to eat.

00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:29.780
But also, I just love looking at fish,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.421
the different types of fish,
the different colors of fish.

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:37.012
Also, dry fish is very
common in Omani cuisine.

00:03:37.012 --> 00:03:38.262
Those are huge.

00:03:39.696 --> 00:03:41.047
- [Market Vendor] It's barracuda.

00:03:41.047 --> 00:03:42.892
- Barracuda, yes.

00:03:42.892 --> 00:03:44.392
They are very big.

00:03:46.383 --> 00:03:47.962
Those are some huge barracuda.

00:03:47.962 --> 00:03:50.139
I just want to mention that
they are in the process

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.551
of building a new fish market.

00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:53.581
So, we went to the old fish market.

00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:56.062
But if you come to Muscat,
maybe in the coming years,

00:03:56.062 --> 00:03:58.341
they might have a new fish market opened

00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:01.166
right next to the old fish market.

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:04.499
(traditional pop music)

00:04:12.012 --> 00:04:14.525
We are just walking along
the harbor now in Muscat.

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:16.894
The fish market is right over on that side

00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:18.683
where we just were.

00:04:18.683 --> 00:04:21.970
But it's amazing how clear the water is.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.338
And I'm loving this view of the city.

00:04:25.338 --> 00:04:27.477
And then, behind, you have the gorgeous,

00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:31.645
just very rugged, jagged desert mountains.

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:33.895
The clear, turquoise water.

00:04:34.957 --> 00:04:37.327
Yeah, and it's so nice and peaceful.

00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:40.898
And we are coming up
now on the Muttrah Souk,

00:04:40.898 --> 00:04:43.231
which is a big market place.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.262
You can by everything at Muttrah Souk,

00:04:48.262 --> 00:04:51.767
including clothes, and spices, and food.

00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:52.600
- Yes.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.851
- Household items.

00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:54.684
- Yes, yeah

00:04:54.684 --> 00:04:56.607
- Just about everything you
can find in this market.

00:04:56.607 --> 00:05:00.630
- Back in the day, it used to
be more of a wholesale market.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.146
It had people from Israel for
example, they come over here,

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:06.572
shop for their shops over there,

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:09.452
and then they go back
and send it for them.

00:05:09.452 --> 00:05:10.285
- [Mark] Okay.

00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:12.308
We walk past this shop
and I could just smell

00:05:12.308 --> 00:05:14.912
the aroma of all the spices,
especially the cumin I think.

00:05:14.912 --> 00:05:16.699
In the back of the shop
is where I can smell all

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.592
of the spices.

00:05:18.592 --> 00:05:19.804
- Also spices yes.

00:05:19.804 --> 00:05:23.660
- Wow. Curry masala, all
sorts of different masalas.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.658
(traditional music)

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.950
- [Mustafa] So, Oman is
famous about its lemon here.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.783
- [Mark] Oh.

00:05:28.783 --> 00:05:30.682
What is it used for?

00:05:30.682 --> 00:05:33.262
- [Mustafa] For like curry and masala--

00:05:33.262 --> 00:05:34.785
- [Mark] Okay. In the food?

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:35.846
- [Mustafa] In the food, yeah.

00:05:35.846 --> 00:05:36.909
- Okay.

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.242
(traditional pop music)

00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:45.615
We are now walking
through the gold silk area

00:05:45.615 --> 00:05:47.802
where there are lots
and lots of gold stores

00:05:47.802 --> 00:05:49.453
and jewelry stores.

00:05:49.453 --> 00:05:52.248
This is my first time to visit Oman.

00:05:52.248 --> 00:05:56.140
But I have been to Zanzibar
a couple of times in my life.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.135
And also spent some time on
the east coast of Africa.

00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:02.817
And Zanzibar used to be a part of Oman.

00:06:02.817 --> 00:06:04.547
It used to be ruled by Oman,

00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:07.525
and you can see the
resemblance and the similarity.

00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:10.278
This market, some parts of this market

00:06:10.278 --> 00:06:12.428
actually have the exact same

00:06:12.428 --> 00:06:15.761
feel as parts of Stone Town in Zanzibar.

00:06:17.552 --> 00:06:18.385
Okay.

00:06:18.385 --> 00:06:19.218
- Okay.

00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:21.893
So for special occasions,
wedding, and so on, at night,

00:06:21.893 --> 00:06:23.966
you were this one with a silver belt.

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:24.799
- [Mark] Ah, okay.

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:26.426
- And this is usually made form silver.

00:06:26.426 --> 00:06:27.423
- [Mark] Uh hmm.

00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:28.800
- Yeah.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.774
- [Mark] So, you would still
wear that on special occasions?

00:06:30.774 --> 00:06:31.607
- Yeah.

00:06:31.607 --> 00:06:32.453
- [Mark] Okay.

00:06:32.453 --> 00:06:35.786
(traditional pop music)

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.735
I have kind of a small head.

00:06:39.735 --> 00:06:42.850
Can I pass for being Omani.
(laughing)

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.298
- [Mustafa] You'll apply for
the nationality tomorrow.

00:06:45.298 --> 00:06:47.013
- [Mark] And what is
this type of hat called?

00:06:47.013 --> 00:06:47.846
- Koma.

00:06:47.846 --> 00:06:48.679
- [Mark] Koma?

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:49.512
- Yeah, Koma.

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:51.402
(speaks in foreign language).

00:06:51.402 --> 00:06:54.904
- Mustafa has bought me and fitted me

00:06:54.904 --> 00:06:59.149
in a traditional Omani cap,
and a traditional Omani hat.

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:00.160
And this is...

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.853
These are only worn in Oman.

00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:04.229
- Yeah, in the Arab countries.

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:05.062
- In Arab countries?

00:07:05.062 --> 00:07:05.971
- Yeah.

00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:07.877
- So, also, it's very common to see on the

00:07:07.877 --> 00:07:09.143
east coast of Africa as well.

00:07:09.143 --> 00:07:10.719
Thank you very much, Mustafa.

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:11.552
- Welcome.

00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:12.385
- Thank you.

00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:13.218
- Welcome.

00:07:13.218 --> 00:07:15.635
- Oh, this is an amazing hat.

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:19.088
You guys gotta let me know how I look

00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:20.648
in the comment section below.

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.549
But I am loving this look.

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:23.407
Now, I can blend it.

00:07:23.407 --> 00:07:24.297
- [Mustafa] Yeah, you can.

00:07:24.297 --> 00:07:26.086
- Blend in like I'm Omani now.

00:07:26.086 --> 00:07:29.018
(laughing)

00:07:29.018 --> 00:07:32.022
- Except for the spoon in the t-shirt.

00:07:32.022 --> 00:07:33.215
This guy's got a spoon in the t-shirt.

00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:34.240
What does he mean?

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.297
- Yes.

00:07:35.297 --> 00:07:38.630
(traditional pop music)

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.421
We just took a quick drive over to

00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:48.495
one of the old areas of Muscat.

00:07:48.495 --> 00:07:50.991
Located in this area
is the Sultan's palace,

00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:53.287
which we are walking to right now.

00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:56.052
And also, there are a lot
of government ministries

00:07:56.052 --> 00:07:57.821
located in this area as well.

00:07:57.821 --> 00:07:59.018
- [Mustafa] This one is a local foreman.

00:07:59.018 --> 00:08:00.658
And this one represents the Sultan.

00:08:00.658 --> 00:08:02.900
- And you can't go into the palace.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.013
But you admire it from the outside.

00:08:06.013 --> 00:08:08.755
What's especially fascinating are the gold

00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:11.391
and I think, they're turquoise,

00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:13.407
or like a type of blue columns

00:08:13.407 --> 00:08:16.214
which go up the face of the palace.

00:08:16.214 --> 00:08:19.117
And also, what I really
like are the seals,

00:08:19.117 --> 00:08:23.033
the Oman seals, which
are golden on the gate.

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:25.145
Standing there, and then,
what we're gonna do.

00:08:25.145 --> 00:08:26.245
- [Woman] We're gonna do.

00:08:26.245 --> 00:08:27.745
- We're gonna all.

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:33.378
We have just pulled up
the Bait Al Zubair museum.

00:08:33.378 --> 00:08:35.967
And I don't think they allow
any photography inside,

00:08:35.967 --> 00:08:38.002
so, I'm just gonna walk around.

00:08:38.002 --> 00:08:40.516
And then, I will share
with you all what's inside

00:08:40.516 --> 00:08:42.266
after we walk around.

00:08:46.313 --> 00:08:49.352
It's really an Omani cultural museum.

00:08:49.352 --> 00:08:52.796
Inside, there was a big
collection of traditional

00:08:52.796 --> 00:08:56.554
Omani dress, as well as,
there was a big collection

00:08:56.554 --> 00:08:58.864
of swords and weapons.

00:08:58.864 --> 00:09:01.653
And then, this whole
complex, you can walk around.

00:09:01.653 --> 00:09:03.120
There's a coffee shop.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.057
There's kind of a library area.

00:09:05.057 --> 00:09:07.256
And then, there's a model of a traditional

00:09:07.256 --> 00:09:08.427
Omani home as well.

00:09:08.427 --> 00:09:11.477
I think it's probably
about 45 degrees right now.

00:09:11.477 --> 00:09:13.908
And it's also pretty humid.

00:09:13.908 --> 00:09:16.211
So, this is some intense heat.

00:09:16.211 --> 00:09:18.544
I am just dripping in sweat.

00:09:19.693 --> 00:09:23.390
And yeah, this is some
intense heat right now.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.796
It is so outside, that just
walking for like 15 minutes,

00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:30.607
it feels like your face is just peeling.

00:09:30.607 --> 00:09:32.922
The skin is peeling away from your face.

00:09:32.922 --> 00:09:34.849
And it feels like your
body is just melting.

00:09:34.849 --> 00:09:37.932
So, you cannot go long without water.

00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.791
(exhaling)

00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:49.255
(electronic pop music)

00:10:15.229 --> 00:10:16.728
Oh.

00:10:16.728 --> 00:10:19.478
(waves crashing)

00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:26.821
Oh. Maybe we should drive in a little bit.

00:10:27.685 --> 00:10:30.845
Yeah, you might want to
drive up a little bit.

00:10:30.845 --> 00:10:31.846
We just drove.

00:10:31.846 --> 00:10:33.609
It's a little bit outside of Muscat,

00:10:33.609 --> 00:10:35.644
to a beach called Qantab Beach.

00:10:35.644 --> 00:10:39.010
And Mustafa drove all
the way onto the beach,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.601
so we are getting a first
hand glimpse of the sea.

00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:45.405
It's incredibly beautiful
because you have have

00:10:45.405 --> 00:10:49.766
the really jagged, brown,
bone dry mountain rocks.

00:10:49.766 --> 00:10:53.191
But then, the water is
so incredibly turquoise,

00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:56.608
and blue green, crystal, sparkling water.

00:10:57.665 --> 00:11:00.582
(electronic music)

00:11:12.773 --> 00:11:14.703
We have just pulled up for lunch today.

00:11:14.703 --> 00:11:17.626
And we are gonna go to a
restaurant called Baid Al Luban,

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:20.442
which is a very well
known Omani restaurant.

00:11:20.442 --> 00:11:22.700
One of the unique things
about this restaurant

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.247
is that it's an old former hostile.

00:11:25.247 --> 00:11:28.750
And so, it's located right next to

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:30.507
the main harbor in Muscat.

00:11:30.507 --> 00:11:32.738
And so people would park their boats.

00:11:32.738 --> 00:11:34.443
And then, if they needed a place to stay,

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:36.692
they would rent a bed in this hostile.

00:11:36.692 --> 00:11:40.364
But it has been since renovated
into a very nice restaurant

00:11:40.364 --> 00:11:42.665
serving Omani food.

00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:45.770
And a number of you
recommended this restaurant.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.386
So, we are happy to be
eating here for lunch today.

00:11:48.386 --> 00:11:52.663
And Mustafa has ordered just
a variety of different dishes.

00:11:52.663 --> 00:11:56.496
I'm starting off with
this Frankincense water.

00:11:58.011 --> 00:11:58.844
Umm.

00:11:58.844 --> 00:12:00.689
Yeah, you can really
tasted the Frankincense.

00:12:00.689 --> 00:12:03.012
It tastes kind of like woody,

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:04.679
like evergreen tree.

00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:10.694
Yeah. It's really good.

00:12:10.694 --> 00:12:13.723
So, we're starting with a soup,
but it's actually a curry.

00:12:13.723 --> 00:12:17.464
It's an Omani restaurant,
but they sort of do some

00:12:17.464 --> 00:12:19.105
modern twists to Omani food.

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:21.420
So, they serve this curry like a soup,

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:24.170
and there's rice in it, and fish.

00:12:26.539 --> 00:12:28.172
Umm.

00:12:28.172 --> 00:12:31.600
Oh, yeah, you can really
taste the dry lemon,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.939
or dry lime, which is in here.

00:12:33.939 --> 00:12:35.263
Oh yeah.

00:12:35.263 --> 00:12:37.512
It's kind of like a dried fish stew.

00:12:37.512 --> 00:12:40.673
And I'm gonna go in for some of the...

00:12:40.673 --> 00:12:44.090
It's also lots of onions in this as well.

00:12:46.988 --> 00:12:48.790
It's a type of ghee.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.142
Some kind of animal oil fat,

00:12:51.142 --> 00:12:53.212
which you're supposed
to pour onto the rice.

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:55.372
Okay, that's probably good.

00:12:55.372 --> 00:12:56.205
Onions.

00:12:56.205 --> 00:12:58.456
Yeah, lots of onions in here.

00:12:58.456 --> 00:13:00.708
And I'm gonna make sure
to get some of that rice

00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:02.375
with that oil on it.

00:13:05.788 --> 00:13:07.020
Umm.

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.853
It's salty dried fish.

00:13:10.493 --> 00:13:12.695
But it's really tender.

00:13:12.695 --> 00:13:15.778
And then, those onions are so tender,

00:13:17.267 --> 00:13:18.929
that they just dissolve in your mouth.

00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:22.012
Has a depth of a smokey flavor to it.

00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:24.162
- [Mustafa] This is Harees.

00:13:24.162 --> 00:13:24.995
- [Mark] Harees.

00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:29.211
- [Mustafa] It is mashed
wheat with chicken.

00:13:29.211 --> 00:13:32.140
And the sauce is a Torsha.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.640
Torsha is like a raisin sauce.

00:13:37.714 --> 00:13:39.612
- [Mark] Is that olive
oil in the middle there?

00:13:39.612 --> 00:13:40.459
- [Mustafa] No, it's ghee.

00:13:40.459 --> 00:13:42.186
- [Mark] Oh, it's ghee, okay.

00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:43.326
It looks like olive oil.

00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:45.360
Okay, so there's ghee in the middle there.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.481
And this kind of a puree, but
stringy from that chicken.

00:13:48.481 --> 00:13:49.721
And then you gotta get some of that--

00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:50.678
- [Mustafa] Yeah, dip it.

00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:52.428
- That sauce as well.

00:13:55.906 --> 00:13:56.739
Umm.

00:13:57.951 --> 00:13:59.161
It's almost like mashed potatoes.

00:13:59.161 --> 00:14:00.654
If you didn't know it was wheat,

00:14:00.654 --> 00:14:02.293
you might think it was mashed potatoes.

00:14:02.293 --> 00:14:04.197
And then, you have these
little stringy pieces

00:14:04.197 --> 00:14:05.221
of chicken within it.

00:14:05.221 --> 00:14:08.554
It's salty, but then the sauce is sweet,

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:12.026
and kind of fruity.

00:14:12.026 --> 00:14:14.711
And that contrasts the saltiness.

00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:17.031
Wow, that's delicious.

00:14:17.031 --> 00:14:19.110
Okay, there's some coarse
black pepper in there,

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.711
but I think there's
also cardamone in there.

00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:25.389
Yeah, I think I can taste some cardamone.

00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:28.016
The next other dish,
and this one of the most

00:14:28.016 --> 00:14:29.744
import Omani dishes.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:31.182
It's called Shuwa.

00:14:31.182 --> 00:14:33.704
And this is lamb this time,

00:14:33.704 --> 00:14:36.305
which it's normally cooked underground,

00:14:36.305 --> 00:14:38.140
until it's fall apart tender,

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.921
with a variety of different spices

00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.389
and always eaten with rice.

00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:42.775
So, I'm gonna...

00:14:42.775 --> 00:14:44.914
Oh yeah, that feels very tender.

00:14:44.914 --> 00:14:47.997
I'll put some of this on to my plate.

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:51.389
You can see little
flakes of chili in there.

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:55.139
There are some chickpeas
as well in the rice.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:00.632
Uh hmm.

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.861
Tender lamb, and then,

00:15:06.961 --> 00:15:08.533
it has a really nice...

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.788
I think I can taste
some cinnamon in there.

00:15:10.788 --> 00:15:13.081
Lots of black pepper.

00:15:13.081 --> 00:15:14.908
And just a little bit of chili.

00:15:14.908 --> 00:15:16.880
Yeah, that is a delicious dish.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.739
And this is one of the
national dishes of Oman.

00:15:19.739 --> 00:15:21.168
This one is a

00:15:21.168 --> 00:15:23.058
tomato onion salad with some,

00:15:23.058 --> 00:15:25.059
the main side here is dried fish.

00:15:25.059 --> 00:15:29.226
I'll just take some of
this to put it on my plate.

00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:33.352
And there's also, I think this is spinach

00:15:33.352 --> 00:15:35.602
on the bottom here as well.

00:15:50.114 --> 00:15:52.645
Really nicely, lemony, and then, the fish,

00:15:52.645 --> 00:15:54.978
it's like salty, fish jerky.

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.246
Ah, that's really good,
because it's salty,

00:15:59.246 --> 00:16:02.520
but really, really lemony,
and really fresh tasting.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.407
And then, we got one more
salad dish over here,

00:16:04.407 --> 00:16:07.070
which is called Sahanet Kasha.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.740
There's some dried fish on top,

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.064
but the whole thing.

00:16:10.064 --> 00:16:13.124
This is kind of an arty version of it.

00:16:13.124 --> 00:16:15.990
And there's onions and
tomatoes in there as well.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:20.157
Okay, I think this is the
last dish that we ordered.

00:16:24.456 --> 00:16:25.289
Umm.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.949
That has kind of a...

00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:32.482
That one is not too salty.

00:16:32.482 --> 00:16:35.982
It sort of has a bitter fish taste to it.

00:16:35.982 --> 00:16:37.539
Really good as well though.

00:16:37.539 --> 00:16:40.343
And it's very refreshing.

00:16:40.343 --> 00:16:43.676
It has lots of tomatoes, lots of onions,

00:16:44.987 --> 00:16:48.122
so, it's kind of crisp, and really juicy.

00:16:48.122 --> 00:16:50.356
What really strikes me
as a dish that I haven't

00:16:50.356 --> 00:16:54.023
tried something like
it, is the mashed wheat

00:16:54.908 --> 00:16:56.717
with the shredded chicken in it.

00:16:56.717 --> 00:16:58.431
But it's really good and
it's really different

00:16:58.431 --> 00:17:00.059
from any other dish that I've had.

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:01.862
And then, definitely, the Shuwa,

00:17:01.862 --> 00:17:04.519
which is that slow cooked
lamb with the rice.

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:06.173
And then, I added on
a little bit of yogurt

00:17:06.173 --> 00:17:07.306
and tomato sauce.

00:17:07.306 --> 00:17:09.849
Is also, extremely good.

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.567
And what I really like about it,

00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:13.289
Is you can really taste the black pepper.

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:15.548
There's a lot of black pepper in it.

00:17:15.548 --> 00:17:20.092
And it's a few simple, maybe
some nutmeg or cinnamon

00:17:20.092 --> 00:17:21.682
in there as well.

00:17:21.682 --> 00:17:25.849
But it's the black pepper
that really comes in nicely.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.823
Yeah.

00:17:34.232 --> 00:17:36.264
- (Speaks in foreign language).

00:17:36.264 --> 00:17:37.852
- We finished that meal.

00:17:37.852 --> 00:17:39.207
We were all pretty full.

00:17:39.207 --> 00:17:40.893
That was a really good meal.

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:44.976
And so, Mustafa and I are
now having some coffee.

00:17:48.456 --> 00:17:50.575
Does this one you think have rosewater?

00:17:50.575 --> 00:17:51.408
- Yeah, it does.

00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:53.456
It has rose water and saffron.

00:17:53.456 --> 00:17:55.289
- Oh, and saffron too.

00:18:05.711 --> 00:18:06.544
Thank you.

00:18:17.884 --> 00:18:19.482
Umm.

00:18:19.482 --> 00:18:22.669
The coffee, it's not strong coffee.

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:24.063
It's quite light.

00:18:24.063 --> 00:18:25.981
But you can taste the fragrance,

00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:29.157
and in this one, there is both saffron,

00:18:29.157 --> 00:18:30.292
and also rose water.

00:18:30.292 --> 00:18:34.459
So, it has a little bit of a
spice, aroma fragrance to it,

00:18:37.615 --> 00:18:39.698
beyond the coffee flavor.

00:18:44.865 --> 00:18:46.412
Yeah, it's like a...

00:18:46.412 --> 00:18:48.855
It's weak enough where
you can just keep on

00:18:48.855 --> 00:18:50.500
drinking this all day long.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.758
But it's a very soothing coffee.

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.491
What was your favorite dish of the meal?

00:18:56.491 --> 00:18:57.490
The dried fish?

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.131
- The dried fish, yeah.

00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:00.902
That was mine.

00:19:00.902 --> 00:19:02.472
- That one was good.

00:19:02.472 --> 00:19:04.428
We are gonna head back to the hotel

00:19:04.428 --> 00:19:06.995
to rest for a little while.

00:19:06.995 --> 00:19:09.587
Because it is a very hot afternoon.

00:19:09.587 --> 00:19:12.331
So, it's common to take
a break in the afternoon.

00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:14.897
It's about 6:00 p.m. now,
we just spent two hours

00:19:14.897 --> 00:19:17.401
resting at the hotel,
trying to wait out the

00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:21.784
blazing sunshine, and we
are now heading out again.

00:19:21.784 --> 00:19:25.117
(traditional pop music)

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.429
We drove over to Qurum, which is,

00:19:33.429 --> 00:19:36.231
the main beaches right in central Muscat,

00:19:36.231 --> 00:19:38.660
just near to downtown area.

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.790
And the sun is going down,
it's the evening now.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.829
That really makes all the difference.

00:19:43.829 --> 00:19:47.289
And you can just walk along this coast,

00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:49.313
enjoy the great views of the sea,

00:19:49.313 --> 00:19:51.730
and also the rocky coastline.

00:19:53.548 --> 00:19:56.881
(traditional pop music)

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.969
Driving to an area called Al Seeb.

00:20:08.969 --> 00:20:12.302
(traditional pop music)

00:20:15.498 --> 00:20:19.431
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:20:19.431 --> 00:20:22.588
- The chicken, squid, shrimps.

00:20:22.588 --> 00:20:23.615
- [Mark] It all sounds good.

00:20:23.615 --> 00:20:25.483
(laughing)

00:20:25.483 --> 00:20:29.388
- [Mustafa] (speaks in foreign language).

00:20:29.388 --> 00:20:30.828
- [Cook] (speaks in foreign language).

00:20:30.828 --> 00:20:32.174
- [Mustafa] (speaks in foreign language).

00:20:32.174 --> 00:20:34.197
- [Cook] (speaks in foreign language).

00:20:34.197 --> 00:20:35.491
- [Mustafa] (speaks in foreign language).

00:20:35.491 --> 00:20:38.259
- There is not a lot of
street food in Muscat,

00:20:38.259 --> 00:20:41.025
but one of the most well
known, and one of the best

00:20:41.025 --> 00:20:43.981
places to eat street food is in Al Seeb,

00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:46.481
which is right near the ocean.

00:20:47.338 --> 00:20:50.921
And we have stopped by
to order to mishkak.

00:20:54.516 --> 00:20:57.571
Which are an assortment
of different skewers.

00:20:57.571 --> 00:20:59.506
We've got some shrimp, some chicken,

00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:02.265
some liver, some mutton, and some squid.

00:21:02.265 --> 00:21:04.271
There are few things better in the world

00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:05.964
than grilled meat on skewer.

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:08.565
I think the skewers of meat are marinated,

00:21:08.565 --> 00:21:10.506
and they are like partially cooked.

00:21:10.506 --> 00:21:12.929
And then, when you order them,
he puts them onto the grill,

00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:16.239
and he really fans that fire
to get the flames going,

00:21:16.239 --> 00:21:18.221
and so, they're gonna have, I'm sure,

00:21:18.221 --> 00:21:20.791
I am positive, and anticipating
that they're gonna have

00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:23.178
an extremely smokey flavor to them.

00:21:23.178 --> 00:21:26.041
(unwrapping foil)

00:21:26.041 --> 00:21:29.164
- [Mustafa] Yeah, very nice.

00:21:29.164 --> 00:21:31.626
- And I noticed that there
are a couple of butcheries

00:21:31.626 --> 00:21:33.284
right across the road,

00:21:33.284 --> 00:21:37.157
so I think there is a lot
of fresh meat in this area.

00:21:37.157 --> 00:21:39.861
And we're actually
right next to the beach.

00:21:39.861 --> 00:21:41.758
Although, it's night, so
you can't see the beach.

00:21:41.758 --> 00:21:44.118
The beach is right behind
this little structure.

00:21:44.118 --> 00:21:46.856
And you can just smell the meat grilling

00:21:46.856 --> 00:21:48.482
in this entire area.

00:21:48.482 --> 00:21:50.085
And they have two different sauces.

00:21:50.085 --> 00:21:53.187
They have a spicy sauce
and a tamarind sauce

00:21:53.187 --> 00:21:55.950
which should probably be kind of sweeter

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:58.484
and maybe, sour as well.

00:21:58.484 --> 00:22:01.039
A skewer that I want to try
the most right now first,

00:22:01.039 --> 00:22:03.455
is liver, and this mutton liver.

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:04.622
I'm gonna dip.

00:22:05.893 --> 00:22:08.060
Dip into that spicy sauce.

00:22:14.412 --> 00:22:15.245
Oh, yeah.

00:22:16.666 --> 00:22:20.695
Wow. That is like charred to perfection.

00:22:20.695 --> 00:22:22.526
It's spicy and sour.

00:22:22.526 --> 00:22:25.142
And then, that liver is so tender,

00:22:25.142 --> 00:22:27.728
but it's like crispified,
because it's been grilled

00:22:27.728 --> 00:22:29.823
on such a high heat, yet he flamed.

00:22:29.823 --> 00:22:32.001
I think there might be a
piece of fat in there too.

00:22:32.001 --> 00:22:36.001
You can taste some wonderful
grilled fat juices.

00:22:39.611 --> 00:22:40.444
Oh, yeah.

00:22:41.437 --> 00:22:42.886
Mutton liver, fantastic.

00:22:42.886 --> 00:22:47.053
Okay, I'm gonna try that
sweet tamarind sauce next.

00:22:49.529 --> 00:22:50.872
Umm.

00:22:50.872 --> 00:22:54.731
Oh, the tamarind sauce
is more sour than sweet.

00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:57.103
It's really good, umm.

00:22:57.103 --> 00:22:59.436
It's almost like a sour jam.

00:23:02.226 --> 00:23:04.166
Okay, next up. Let me go for the squid.

00:23:04.166 --> 00:23:06.708
Both of the sauces are extraordinary.

00:23:06.708 --> 00:23:08.963
The tamarind sauce is also really good,

00:23:08.963 --> 00:23:12.717
because it's more on the
sour side, than sweet side.

00:23:12.717 --> 00:23:14.626
But this spicy sauce,

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:18.653
I do have a bit of an
addiction to spiciness.

00:23:18.653 --> 00:23:20.236
Okay, that is good.

00:23:24.295 --> 00:23:26.909
Did I just fling some sauce at you?

00:23:26.909 --> 00:23:27.907
- [Camera Person] I think so.

00:23:27.907 --> 00:23:28.740
- Umm.

00:23:29.702 --> 00:23:31.603
Squid is a little bit chewy,

00:23:31.603 --> 00:23:36.406
but while you chew it, it
just keeps on giving flavor.

00:23:36.406 --> 00:23:37.923
Okay, the mutton skewer next.

00:23:37.923 --> 00:23:41.340
And I'm gonna go with tamarind this time.

00:23:47.252 --> 00:23:48.788
Okay.

00:23:48.788 --> 00:23:50.256
The mutton is amazing.

00:23:50.256 --> 00:23:54.256
I think it's marinated
or grilled in some cumin.

00:23:55.676 --> 00:23:57.388
That's such a wonderful combination.

00:23:57.388 --> 00:23:58.805
Mutton and cumin.

00:24:01.818 --> 00:24:06.126
Any type of meat on skewer,
grilled over charcoal

00:24:06.126 --> 00:24:08.341
is one of my favorite things in the world.

00:24:08.341 --> 00:24:11.389
And I am just dripping now in sweat.

00:24:11.389 --> 00:24:15.011
Not only is it like maybe
above about 40 degrees,

00:24:15.011 --> 00:24:16.706
but it's also extremely humid.

00:24:16.706 --> 00:24:18.226
We're right next to the beach,

00:24:18.226 --> 00:24:20.917
and this is the definition
of a meat sauna.

00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:25.548
You can just, the air
is just humid with meat.

00:24:25.548 --> 00:24:26.449
- [Cook] (speaks in foreign language).

00:24:26.449 --> 00:24:27.759
- Thank you.

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:30.577
And also, you can stand
here and eat your mishkak,

00:24:30.577 --> 00:24:33.827
but a lot of people just order,
just pull up in their cars,

00:24:33.827 --> 00:24:36.529
and then order, and
then just sit in the a/c

00:24:36.529 --> 00:24:41.376
as well to avoid the meat
sweats like have right now.

00:24:41.376 --> 00:24:44.793
Thank you, Mustafa. That was awesome man.

00:24:47.907 --> 00:24:51.826
- [Mustafa] (speaks in foreign language).

00:24:51.826 --> 00:24:52.659
- Alright.

00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:54.853
- [Mark] Yeah, mixed.

00:24:54.853 --> 00:24:56.291
- [Mustafa] (speaks in foreign language).

00:24:56.291 --> 00:24:58.234
- [Cook] (speaks in foreign language).

00:24:58.234 --> 00:25:02.401
- [Mustafa] (speaks in foreign language).

00:25:06.325 --> 00:25:09.492
- [Mark] Oh yes, this is a good place.

00:25:15.725 --> 00:25:19.892
(restaurant patrons talking loudly)

00:25:23.097 --> 00:25:23.930
- If we did, you don't have this

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.320
(speaks in foreign language).

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.153
- (Speaks in foreign language).

00:25:26.153 --> 00:25:26.986
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:25:26.986 --> 00:25:27.819
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:25:27.819 --> 00:25:29.662
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:25:29.662 --> 00:25:33.023
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:25:33.023 --> 00:25:35.642
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:25:35.642 --> 00:25:39.096
This restaurant is
famous for serving camel.

00:25:39.096 --> 00:25:41.957
You kind of walk up to,
there's a buffet line,

00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.859
where they have the dishes prepared.

00:25:43.859 --> 00:25:46.119
They have a number of
different types of rice.

00:25:46.119 --> 00:25:49.026
You choose your rice, and they
have two main camel dishes.

00:25:49.026 --> 00:25:52.363
One of them is chunks of
camel, which is fried.

00:25:52.363 --> 00:25:55.683
And then, one of them is
like a stew or a curry camel.

00:25:55.683 --> 00:25:57.414
And so, we got a mix of both,

00:25:57.414 --> 00:25:58.943
and they put it all into a bowl.

00:25:58.943 --> 00:26:01.044
And then, they gave us a platter of rice.

00:26:01.044 --> 00:26:03.793
And then, we also got a half
a chicken thrown on top.

00:26:03.793 --> 00:26:05.626
And this is fantastic.

00:26:07.074 --> 00:26:08.928
They put out a piece of plastic,

00:26:08.928 --> 00:26:10.564
and then put your food down,

00:26:10.564 --> 00:26:14.481
and it's got some yogurt
to go with it as well.

00:26:18.111 --> 00:26:18.944
Alright.

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:19.777
- [Mustafa] Whatever you prefer, yeah.

00:26:19.777 --> 00:26:20.869
- [Mark] However you want?

00:26:20.869 --> 00:26:22.242
- [Mustafa] Yeah, however you want.

00:26:22.242 --> 00:26:25.489
- [Mark] Okay. Oh, you make a--

00:26:25.489 --> 00:26:27.982
- [Mustafa] No, you don't make a bowl.

00:26:27.982 --> 00:26:30.372
But in Omani, you use your hand,

00:26:30.372 --> 00:26:35.012
so you hold it like this,
then you can either go for it

00:26:35.012 --> 00:26:36.650
like this, or you can push it

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.168
with your finger to your mouth, yeah.

00:26:38.168 --> 00:26:39.250
- Okay.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.319
I'm gonna start with
a piece of camel meat,

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:43.072
and there's also pieces of camel fat.

00:26:43.072 --> 00:26:46.404
Before mixing with any rice
or any yogurt or sauce,

00:26:46.404 --> 00:26:48.619
I'm just gonna try one piece of camel.

00:26:48.619 --> 00:26:50.119
A nugget of camel.

00:26:57.486 --> 00:26:59.531
Oh, that's amazing.

00:26:59.531 --> 00:27:01.791
Oh, that is insanely good.

00:27:01.791 --> 00:27:03.024
It's so tender.

00:27:03.024 --> 00:27:05.547
It does taste very
similar to beef, actually.

00:27:05.547 --> 00:27:09.464
But a little more meaty
tasting, gamey tasting.

00:27:10.898 --> 00:27:14.543
But not really, it's
actually surprisingly really,

00:27:14.543 --> 00:27:15.541
really tender.

00:27:15.541 --> 00:27:17.219
I wasn't expecting it to be that tender.

00:27:17.219 --> 00:27:18.517
This is the camel hump.

00:27:18.517 --> 00:27:22.017
So, that's just a pure chunk of white fat.

00:27:29.747 --> 00:27:30.580
Oh, wow.

00:27:33.239 --> 00:27:34.859
That just melts in your mouth.

00:27:34.859 --> 00:27:37.698
It does have a meaty taste to it.

00:27:37.698 --> 00:27:41.102
But it's not like a gelatinous fat.

00:27:41.102 --> 00:27:43.001
It just melts in your mouth.

00:27:43.001 --> 00:27:45.700
But it's almost like squid.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.562
It has a little bit of
a chewy texture to it.

00:27:48.562 --> 00:27:50.062
Yogurt to my rice.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.961
And also, this is a type of chatni.

00:27:53.961 --> 00:27:57.583
Like a tomato, it's like a tomato chatni.

00:27:57.583 --> 00:27:59.487
Put on to my rice here,

00:27:59.487 --> 00:28:01.989
and then also, I'm gonna go
in for some of the onions

00:28:01.989 --> 00:28:03.406
and salad onions.

00:28:04.386 --> 00:28:06.636
And I think this is rocket.

00:28:07.525 --> 00:28:09.203
Go in for some of that,

00:28:09.203 --> 00:28:11.370
that camel is just insane.

00:28:16.002 --> 00:28:18.919
I'm gonna mix all of that together.

00:28:25.358 --> 00:28:26.191
Whoa.

00:28:28.854 --> 00:28:31.623
That is insanely delicious.

00:28:31.623 --> 00:28:33.720
And the combination of the camel,

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.470
with the rice, the tomato chatni,

00:28:38.781 --> 00:28:42.364
the cooling yogurt,
that's ridiculous good.

00:28:43.582 --> 00:28:45.744
Next up, I'm gonna try the chicken.

00:28:45.744 --> 00:28:48.040
And this is chicken that has been steamed.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:48.873
Wow.

00:28:50.445 --> 00:28:52.707
I barely even pulled, and
just a whole chunk of chicken

00:28:52.707 --> 00:28:54.042
just came off.

00:28:54.042 --> 00:28:55.125
It's so soft.

00:28:57.435 --> 00:28:59.370
Oh, wow, that feels tender.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:03.398
And for this bite, I'm gonna
attempt to eat Omani style.

00:29:03.398 --> 00:29:08.330
And what they do, is you
kind of make it into a...

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.247
You kind of grab a whole fist full.

00:29:13.105 --> 00:29:17.272
And then, you kind of get it
into the center of your hand.

00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:22.208
And I will do my best to not spill.

00:29:31.241 --> 00:29:33.380
Okay, a little messy.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.213
Umm.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.137
Wow, the chicken is soft though.

00:29:39.137 --> 00:29:43.544
The chicken just sort of
dissolves in your mouth.

00:29:43.544 --> 00:29:46.566
And I think I got a raisin
in that bite as well.

00:29:46.566 --> 00:29:48.025
- [Camera Person] Mark
you have rice on your--

00:29:48.025 --> 00:29:50.608
- [Mark] Grab a piece of camel.

00:30:02.383 --> 00:30:03.456
- [Mustafa] Almost.

00:30:03.456 --> 00:30:04.706
- Almost. Okay.

00:30:06.751 --> 00:30:10.245
I need some practice at
that method of eating.

00:30:10.245 --> 00:30:12.469
But it tastes incredible.

00:30:12.469 --> 00:30:14.478
I'm absolutely loving this meal.

00:30:14.478 --> 00:30:16.244
The camel is delicious.

00:30:16.244 --> 00:30:17.968
And even the rice is really good.

00:30:17.968 --> 00:30:19.786
There are two different types of rice..

00:30:19.786 --> 00:30:22.548
The redder rice, or oranger rice,

00:30:22.548 --> 00:30:24.374
has a little bit of spice to it.

00:30:24.374 --> 00:30:27.531
And it also has kind of a clove fragrance.

00:30:27.531 --> 00:30:29.509
You can see some cloves in there.

00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:33.676
And then, it just compliments
the camel so nicely.

00:30:40.937 --> 00:30:43.187
That is insanely delicious.

00:30:44.372 --> 00:30:46.299
The whole combination.

00:30:46.299 --> 00:30:48.881
But that camel is stunner.

00:30:48.881 --> 00:30:52.342
That was just an absolute stunning meal.

00:30:52.342 --> 00:30:56.476
The camel was so tender, and so flavorful,

00:30:56.476 --> 00:30:59.094
that my mouth still, like,

00:30:59.094 --> 00:31:00.874
after finishing the
meal, my mouth is still

00:31:00.874 --> 00:31:03.163
overflowing with camel flavors.

00:31:03.163 --> 00:31:07.246
Yeah, this was an incredible
first day in Muscat.

00:31:08.603 --> 00:31:11.018
From here, just gonna
head back to the hotel.

00:31:11.018 --> 00:31:13.247
I wanna say a special thank you to Mustafa

00:31:13.247 --> 00:31:14.977
for bringing us around,

00:31:14.977 --> 00:31:18.742
and for showing us some
incredible sites around Muscat,

00:31:18.742 --> 00:31:21.077
as well as some incredible food,

00:31:21.077 --> 00:31:23.109
particularly this last meal,

00:31:23.109 --> 00:31:25.359
was just my kind of a meal.

00:31:26.437 --> 00:31:28.971
Stay tuned for tomorrow.

00:31:28.971 --> 00:31:31.554
We will have a full day in Muscat again.

00:31:31.554 --> 00:31:34.549
Actually, we'll be traveling to Nizwa.

00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:37.200
And so, stay tuned for the next video.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.507

00:31:47.348 --> 00:31:49.265
Good night from Muscat.

00:31:50.132 --> 00:31:51.361
And I'll see you on the next video.

00:31:51.361 --> 00:31:52.865
(beep)

00:31:52.865 --> 00:31:53.712
- [Woman] It's real?

00:31:53.712 --> 00:31:54.783
- It's real gold.

00:31:54.783 --> 00:31:56.060
- It's real?

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.839
Want to buy me one?
(laughing)

00:31:57.839 --> 00:31:58.831
Thank you.

00:31:58.831 --> 00:32:00.503
- [Mustafa] Yeah, now is the time.

00:32:00.503 --> 00:32:01.586
(laughing)

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:04.417
It won't have diamond, only gold.

00:32:04.417 --> 00:32:05.250
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.156
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:32:06.156 --> 00:32:07.748
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:32:07.748 --> 00:32:09.630
Now, if you did, you don't have this

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:10.812
(speaks in foreign language).

00:32:10.812 --> 00:32:11.645
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:32:11.645 --> 00:32:12.478
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:32:12.478 --> 00:32:13.432
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:32:13.432 --> 00:32:17.658
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:32:17.658 --> 00:32:20.586
- (speaks in foreign language).

00:32:20.586 --> 00:32:21.419
Okay.

00:32:21.419 --> 00:32:23.357
- [Camera Person] Take one (laughs).

00:32:23.357 --> 00:32:24.524
After take 10.

00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:28.994
- For dinner tonight, we
are at a restaurant called

00:32:28.994 --> 00:32:32.280
(speaks in foreign language).

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.553
(laughing)

00:32:33.553 --> 00:32:34.386
Not quite.

00:32:35.484 --> 00:32:37.672
For dinner tonight, we
are at a restaurant called

00:32:37.672 --> 00:32:39.768
(speaks in foreign language).

00:32:39.768 --> 00:32:40.862
And this...

00:32:40.862 --> 00:32:42.990
(laughing)

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:46.409
Okay, I better not say the
name of the restaurant.

00:32:46.409 --> 00:32:49.210
- [Camera Person] Yogurt on your lip.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:51.627
- And I got yogurt on my lip.

00:32:53.907 --> 00:32:56.574
It is easy to pick out my shoes.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.620
(traditional music)
