00:00:00.696 --> 00:00:02.768
- All right, so we have Ying Ying

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:06.912
had run a total of 30
laps for Running Class,

00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:08.554
or Running Club, I should say.

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.114
So Ying Ying ran a total of 30 laps.

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:15.826
Then, Ying Ying ran four
more laps before school.

00:00:16.401 --> 00:00:19.301
So she ran four more laps before school.

00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:21.541
Three more laps at lunch,

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.320
three more laps at lunch.

00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:26.436
And two more laps at recess.

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:27.794
Ying Ying's doing a lot of running.

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:30.151
Two more laps at recess.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:31.334
So what I want to do is,

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:33.894
I want to figure out
the total number of laps

00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:36.129
that Ying Ying ran, and I'm going to do it

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.425
using a number line.

00:00:37.425 --> 00:00:39.046
So let's draw a number line here.

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.706
Let's draw a number line.

00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:47.461
And Ying Ying starts at 30 laps.

00:00:47.462 --> 00:00:48.417
She had run 30 laps,

00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:51.886
and then she keeps running
more laps than that.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:52.988
So my number line,

00:00:52.988 --> 00:00:54.309
I could start it wherever I want,

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.991
but it might be convenient
to start it at 30.

00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:59.185
And obviously I could do it at 29,

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:00.668
and then I could go 30,

00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:02.333
actually let me just
keep going up from there.

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:07.334
31, 32, 33, 34, 35, a few more left.

00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:16.497
36, 37, 38, 39, and let's say 40.

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:23.890
And I could go all the way to 41.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.327
That's how much space I have.

00:01:25.658 --> 00:01:26.369
So let's see.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.681
Ying Ying started at 30 laps.

00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:30.956
So she started at 30 laps

00:01:31.652 --> 00:01:33.053
for Running Club.

00:01:33.053 --> 00:01:36.628
Then she ran, Ying Ying ran four more laps

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:37.554
before school.

00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:39.809
So on the number line, if I go four more,

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:41.110
that's going to be to the right.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.036
I'm going to be increasing by four.

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:46.855
So I'm going to be increasing
by one, two, three, four.

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:48.891
So those four laps before school

00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:51.995
take us from 30 to 34.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.834
Then she runs three more laps at lunch.

00:01:56.348 --> 00:02:01.118
So then from 34, she's gonna
go one, two, three to 37.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.250
She's gonna go to 37.

00:02:03.682 --> 00:02:05.531
So that's what those
three more laps at lunch

00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:06.522
do for us.

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:08.945
And then two more laps at recess.

00:02:08.945 --> 00:02:11.398
So she was at 37,

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:14.974
and now we're gonna go one, two, to 39.

00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:19.464
So how many total laps does Ying Ying run?

00:02:19.753 --> 00:02:24.156
Well, Ying Ying runs a total of 39 laps.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.311
39 laps, and we were able to figure it out

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:28.851
using this number line.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.800
Now let's do an exercise
very similar to this

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.970
that you might see on Khan Academy.

00:02:35.316 --> 00:02:37.037
So this one right over here.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.912
Let me get rid of the
stuff about Ying Ying

00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:40.167
so we don't get confused.

00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:42.101
So this says, and it's
a little bit smaller

00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:43.783
but hopefully you can see what it says.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.870
A red ant army started
with 100 marching ants.

00:02:50.818 --> 00:02:53.007
So we're gonna start with 100.

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:54.108
And actually they tell us,

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:55.385
well let me just read the whole thing.

00:02:55.572 --> 00:02:57.599
They started with 100 marching ants.

00:02:57.786 --> 00:03:02.252
Then the red army lost
three ants down a hole.

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:06.903
So actually let me, so lost
three ants down a hole.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.789
Three ants were eaten by a bird.

00:03:10.018 --> 00:03:11.049
That's unfortunate.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.756
And one ant just blew away.

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:15.442
I guess ants are fairly light creatures,

00:03:15.442 --> 00:03:16.555
so that makes sense.

00:03:16.843 --> 00:03:17.976
One ant blew away.

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.318
Which number line shows how to find

00:03:20.318 --> 00:03:22.812
how many ants the red army has left?

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.180
Well, the army started
with 100 marching ants.

00:03:27.205 --> 00:03:28.342
We underlined that over here,

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:29.903
so we need to start with 100.

00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:32.137
We need to start with 100.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.027
This one starts with 10.

00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:35.978
So I can immediately rule this one out.

00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:39.863
And so we could just select that one,

00:03:39.863 --> 00:03:41.260
but let's just make sure it makes sense.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.987
So we start with 100,

00:03:43.561 --> 00:03:46.649
and then we lose three ants down a hole.

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:47.867
So we're gonna go down.

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:49.351
Remember, we're losing ants,

00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:50.794
so we're gonna go to the
left of the number line.

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:51.809
We're gonna go to lower values.

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.450
We're gonna go down one, two, three.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.964
So these are the three
ants we lose down a hole.

00:03:57.173 --> 00:03:58.591
So three down the hole.

00:03:59.022 --> 00:04:01.495
Then we have three that
were eaten by a bird,

00:04:01.623 --> 00:04:03.203
so you're gonna lose three more.

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.954
That's those three right over there.

00:04:04.954 --> 00:04:06.758
It goes to 94 ants left.

00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:09.155
And then we have the one
ant that gets blown away.

00:04:09.424 --> 00:04:13.035
So that gets us down to 93 ants left.

00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:15.702
So the red army, or the red ant army,

00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:18.846
has 93 ants left.

00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:23.824
93 ants left.

00:04:24.072 --> 00:04:25.531
And we are done.
