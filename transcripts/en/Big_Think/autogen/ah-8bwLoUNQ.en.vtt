everybody knew that there was a need for

everybody knew that there was a need for

itself and the identified protein was
discovered in 1996 and it was a really

discovered in 1996 and it was a really
 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.490

the virus uses it and also what made it

the virus uses it and also what made it
 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.499
the virus uses it and also what made it
particularly exciting was some

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509
particularly exciting was some
 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.149
particularly exciting was some
epidemiology work which was published

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159
epidemiology work which was published
 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.750
epidemiology work which was published
literally weeks after the protein was

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760
literally weeks after the protein was
 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.500
literally weeks after the protein was
identified in that same year and that

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510
identified in that same year and that
 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.750
identified in that same year and that
showed that a number of humans have a

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760
showed that a number of humans have a
 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.880
showed that a number of humans have a
genetic variation on that receptor which

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890
genetic variation on that receptor which
 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.490
genetic variation on that receptor which
effectively wipes it from the surface of

effectively wipes it from the surface of
 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.190
effectively wipes it from the surface of
the white blood cells and by doing that

the white blood cells and by doing that
 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.399

HIV infection so those subjects did not
seem to be infectable by HIV and and

seem to be infectable by HIV and and

over a decade since its discovery
there's only a handful of what we call

have been found to be infected by the
 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.570
have been found to be infected by the
virus this was obviously really exciting

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580
virus this was obviously really exciting
 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.450
virus this was obviously really exciting
because not only validates the target as

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460
because not only validates the target as
 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.810
because not only validates the target as
a one that if you block you could stop

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820
a one that if you block you could stop
 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.510
a one that if you block you could stop
the virus from entering the cells but

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520
the virus from entering the cells but
 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.600
the virus from entering the cells but
also told us that it would be relatively

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610
also told us that it would be relatively
 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.190
also told us that it would be relatively
safe to do so with a small molecule drug

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200
safe to do so with a small molecule drug
 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.229
safe to do so with a small molecule drug
therefore giving us both both confidence

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239
therefore giving us both both confidence
 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.759
therefore giving us both both confidence
that it will work and that it will be

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769
that it will work and that it will be
 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.449
that it will work and that it will be
safe all in one experiment what ensued

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459
safe all in one experiment what ensued
 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.440

is actually even more interesting

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450
is actually even more interesting
 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.390
is actually even more interesting
because you would have

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400

because you would have
so that with this great idea it would be

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890
so that with this great idea it would be
 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.470
so that with this great idea it would be
relatively straightforward to discover

relatively straightforward to discover
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.190
relatively straightforward to discover
drugs and and I have to say that over a

taken over a decade to take to get
