I mean think of your credit card

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810
I mean think of your credit card
 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.320
I mean think of your credit card
transactions for example if I know your

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330
transactions for example if I know your
 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.120
transactions for example if I know your
credit card transactions all right I

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130
credit card transactions all right I
 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.859
credit card transactions all right I
already know where do you like to

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869
already know where do you like to
 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.380
already know where do you like to
vacation what kinds of wines you like to

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390
vacation what kinds of wines you like to
 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.380
vacation what kinds of wines you like to
buy and drink what you like to do in

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390
buy and drink what you like to do in
 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.690
buy and drink what you like to do in
your spare time think of what happens if

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700
your spare time think of what happens if
 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.380
your spare time think of what happens if
I have the totality the totality of your

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390
I have the totality the totality of your
 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.920
I have the totality the totality of your
digital fingerprint all the videos all

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930

the vacations everything perhaps I can

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
the vacations everything perhaps I can
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.310
the vacations everything perhaps I can
create a reasonable facsimile of you and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320
create a reasonable facsimile of you and
 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.710
create a reasonable facsimile of you and
then of course the question is is that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720
then of course the question is is that
 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.749
then of course the question is is that
really you well to paraphrase former

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759

President Bill Clinton it all depends on

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
President Bill Clinton it all depends on
 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.620
President Bill Clinton it all depends on
how you define you if you define you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630
how you define you if you define you
 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.020
how you define you if you define you
as the biological entity with your

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
as the biological entity with your
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.060
as the biological entity with your
memories then of course it is not you

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070
memories then of course it is not you
 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.870
memories then of course it is not you
but if you define your soul as entropy

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880
but if you define your soul as entropy
 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.410
but if you define your soul as entropy
and information that is if you say that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420

your soul is information that evolves

with time via the laws of entropy then

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270
with time via the laws of entropy then
 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.630
with time via the laws of entropy then
you can be digitized

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640
you can be digitized
 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.570
you can be digitized
because your soul is digital the other

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580
because your soul is digital the other
 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.180
because your soul is digital the other
immortality of course is biologic and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190
immortality of course is biologic and
 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.020
immortality of course is biologic and
genetic immortality we have artificial

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030
genetic immortality we have artificial
 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.730
genetic immortality we have artificial
intelligence systems that can scan

tremendous amount of data to look for

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900
tremendous amount of data to look for
 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.740
tremendous amount of data to look for
patterns so in the future we will take

people run them through an AI system
 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.950
people run them through an AI system
that look for patterns where is error

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960
that look for patterns where is error
 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.140

aging process for example take a car

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120
aging process for example take a car

wait is aging take place in a car well

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360
wait is aging take place in a car well
 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.670
wait is aging take place in a car well
that's obvious right

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680
that's obvious right
 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.860
that's obvious right
most of the aging takes place in the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870
most of the aging takes place in the
 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.480
most of the aging takes place in the
engine because that's where you have

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490
engine because that's where you have
 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.220

you look for the buildup of error in a

to that we found all sorts of enzymes

to that we found all sorts of enzymes

why does it live so long

why does it live so long
well the short answer is we don't know

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:13.649
well the short answer is we don't know
 

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:16.760
well the short answer is we don't know
but there's a theory that says the

where it's cold very cold where

oxidation takes place at a much lower

oxidation takes place at a much lower
 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.050
oxidation takes place at a much lower
level than for us mammals had at living

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060
level than for us mammals had at living
 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.540
level than for us mammals had at living
in North America for example and so this

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550
in North America for example and so this
 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.790
in North America for example and so this
means that perhaps by controlling the
