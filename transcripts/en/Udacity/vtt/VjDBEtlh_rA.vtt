00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.520
&gt;&gt; Alright, so that wasn't so bad. You are able

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.930
to compute some probabilities from this joint distribution. So let's

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.820
see what happens when we start talking about more variables.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.870
More propositions that could be true or false. What I did

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.300
is I filled in thunder as another variable and thunder

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.440
can be true or false in each of these cases. And

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.440
I wrote down what the probabilities could be from my

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.370
experience in Atlanta in the summer. I was, I was around

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.520
over last summer, and in 2004, so let's, so I'm an expert obviously, so

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.369
I'm able to estimate these probabilities to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.880
the nearest percent. Anyway the point is, that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.900
one of the things you should notice here is that each time we add

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.670
one variable what happens to the number

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.210
of probabilities that we have to write down?

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.390
&gt;&gt; Well in a world where it's binary it goes up by two.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.407
&gt;&gt; A factor of two, right?

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:48.150
&gt;&gt; A factor of two.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.470
&gt;&gt; Not just, not just two more, but like, twice as many. And so

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.100
if we have a complicated scenario that we want to be able to reason about,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.170
and it's got, I don't know, a hundred variables, that's going to be a lot.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.630
&gt;&gt; That's, that's, I can't even, I can't even think about that.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like two to the hundred is.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.330
&gt;&gt; That's, that's not even a real number.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.709
&gt;&gt; It's technically a real number, but

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.660
it's an, it's an unimaginably large number.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.685
&gt;&gt; There's only like four numbers, one, two, three, many, and too many.

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:12.229
&gt;&gt; So it's going to be really inconvenient as we start adding more

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.525
of these and especially if we add

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:15.685
variables like, you know, remember the restaurant

00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:18.290
example that we worked on when we were doing decision trees.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.110
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah those were the days.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.460
&gt;&gt; Then there was variables like food type,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.850
and what was the deal with food type?

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.900
&gt;&gt; It had lots of values that it could take on.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah like five or something like that.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.760
&gt;&gt; Thai an, American and Italian.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.321
&gt;&gt; Right and so if we had, add variable like that it's going

00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:40.702
to multiply the number of probabilities that we need by five. So this is

00:01:40.702 --> 00:01:43.520
going to get really big really fast. So would it be nice if

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.550
we had an more convenient way of writing it out in this distribution?

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would be nice.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.740
&gt;&gt; So it turns out that we can factor it.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.070
&gt;&gt; But I thought we already had a factor of two?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.290
&gt;&gt; Well that was a joke but it actually is pretty close to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.860
being the truth, which is the idea that instead of representing all, so,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.705
so, in this case, there's eight numbers. Instead of representing them as eight

00:02:01.705 --> 00:02:05.870
numbers, we're going to represent it by you know, 2 times 2 time 2.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.979
So we really are going to essentially factor it. putting,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.820
putting things into pieces that we can recombine, smaller pieces

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.189
that we can recombine into, into larger pieces. And it,

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.010
yeah, it turns out that actually works out really well.
