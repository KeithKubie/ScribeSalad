00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.560
The equations below all define
the same polynomial function,

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.520
f of x.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.880
So they've just written
f of x in different ways.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.640
Here they've fully factored
f of x out as negative 4,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.500
times x minus 3,
times x minus 2, times

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.470
x plus 1, times x plus 5.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.440
Then here, it looks like
they factored it once,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.504
and then they factored
it into two quadratics,

00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:20.920
and then they
completed the square

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.920
for each of those quadratics.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.900
And then here, this
is just factoring it

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.450
into two quadratic expressions.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.620
And then here, this is the
thing just fully expanded out,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.465
multiplied out as a polynomial.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.310
Which form of f of
x is most useful

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.621
for determining end behavior?

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:42.120
So when we think
about end behavior,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.992
we really want to focus on
the highest degree term.

00:00:44.992 --> 00:00:47.200
We really want to focus on
this term right over here,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.920
because as x becomes
very, very, very positive,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.490
this term is going to dominate.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.460
And as x becomes very,
very, very negative,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.270
this term is going to dominate.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.420
And so this term is
really going to describe

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.660
what the end behavior is.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.930
We can even think about
the end behavior here.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.690
We have an even
exponent, so it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.570
going to have behavior
like x squared,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.420
which is just another way of
saying that as x gets positive,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.130
the function is going to
get positive, very positive.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.990
And as x becomes very
negative, the function

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.364
is going to become
very positive,

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:16.890
because it's an even exponent.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.550
And the fact that there's a
negative coefficient in front

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.830
of this highest
degree x term, this

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.990
tells us it's going to
be similar to the shape

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.370
of negative x squared.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.357
It's going to be
downward opening

00:01:29.357 --> 00:01:31.190
if you were to think
about its end behavior.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.080
So which form of the
function is most useful?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.550
Definitely D, the
expanded out version.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.290
So I'll go with D.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.330
So like the equation below, it's
similar end behavior f of x.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.830
We already talked about it.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.790
It's an even exponent, or it's
an even degree, we could say.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.220
And then we have a negative
out in front of it.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.040
So it's going to have
similar end behavior to y

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.045
is equal to negative x squared.

00:01:54.045 --> 00:01:55.670
And then they say,
which form of f of x

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.845
is most useful for
finding zeroes?

00:01:57.845 --> 00:01:59.470
When we're finding
zeroes, we're trying

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.940
to find the x values that would
make the function equal to 0.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.452
And this first form
right over here

00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:06.660
where we're all factored
out-- that's the most useful

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.169
for finding 0s.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.160
We know that if we wanted to
set this whole thing to be

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.219
equal to 0-- we said, hey,
when does this equal 0?

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:16.510
That means that one of these
expressions-- at least one

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.190
of these expressions
need to be equal 0.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.500
We can independently
set them equal to 0

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.580
and then solve for x.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.890
So, this would be 0 when x is
equal to 3, x is equal to 2,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.890
x is negative 1,
and x is negative 5.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.007
So A, Is definitely the
most useful for finding 0s.
