00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.090
Welcome to the presentation
on graphing lines.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.200
Let's get started.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.530
So let's say I had the
equation-- let me make sure

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.170
that this line doesn't
show up too thick.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.370
Let's say I had the equation--
why isn't that showing up?

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.760
Let's see.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.990
Oh, there you go.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.692
y is equal to 2x plus 1.

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:29.670
So this is giving a
relationship between x and y.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.930
So say x equals 1, then y would
be 2 times 1 plus 1 or 3.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.140
So for every x that we can
think of we can think

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.350
of a corresponding y.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.710
So let's do that.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.520
If we said that-- put
a little table here.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.400
x and y.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.630
And let's just throw out
some random numbers for x.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.940
If x was let's say, negative
1, then y would be 2 times

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.940
negative 1, which
is negative 2.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.810
Plus 1, which would
be negative 1.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.480
If x was 0 that's easy.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.310
It'd be 2 times 0, which is 0.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.672
Plus 1, which is 1.

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:17.830
If x was 1, y would be
2 times 1, which is 2.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.700
Plus 1, which is 3.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.520
If x was 2, then I think
you get the idea here.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.730
y would be 5.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.530
And we could keep on going.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.540
Obviously, there are an
infinite number of x's we

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.820
could choose and we could
pick a corresponding y.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.410
So now you see we have a
little table that gives the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.470
relationships between x and y.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.540
What we can do now is actually
graph those points on

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.500
a coordinate axis.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.870
So let me see if I can draw
this somewhat neatly.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.425
I'll use this line so
I get straight lines.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.970
That's pretty good.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.905
Again, let me draw some
coordinate points.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:08.210
So let's say that's 1,
that's 2, that's 3.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.170
This is negative 1,
negative 2, negative 3.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.180
So this is the x-axis.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.340
We have 1, 2, 3.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.020
Notice we could keep going.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.730
1, 2, 3, and this
is the y-axis.

00:02:32.255 --> 00:02:35.990
And this would be 1,
2, 3, and so on.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.220
This would be negative 1.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.360
I think you get the idea.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.550
So we can graph each
of these points.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.440
So if we have the point x is
negative 1, y is negative 1.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.710
So x, we go along the x-axis
here, and we go to x is

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.745
equal to negative 1.

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:52.990
Then we go to y is equal to
negative 1, so the point

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.775
would be right here.

00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:56.520
Hope that makes sense to you.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.670
That's the point.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.650
I'll label it: negative
1 comma negative 1.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.140
It's a little messy.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.920
That says negative 1
comma negative 1.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.330
That point I just
x'ed right there.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.820
Let's do another one.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.880
That's this point.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.280
I'll do it in a different
color this time.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.960
Let's say we had the
point 0 comma 1.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.410
Well, x is 0, which is here.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.110
And y is 1, so that
point is right there.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.885
Let's do one more.

00:03:21.885 --> 00:03:25.350
If we have the point 1 comma 3.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:33.140
Well, 1 comma 3, x is
1 and we have y is 3.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.730
So we have the
point right there.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.750
Hope that's making
sense for you.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.180
And we could keep graphing
them, but I think you see here,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.550
and especially if I had drawn
this a little bit neater, that

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.090
these points are
forming a line.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.980
Let me draw that line in.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.370
The line looks
something like this.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.860
That's not a good line.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.280
Let me do it better than that.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.350
The line looks
something like this.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.860
You see that?

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.720
Well, that's actually a pretty
bad line that I just drew.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.670
So it would be a line that goes
through-- let me change tools.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.960
It'd be a line that goes
through here, through

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.960
here, and through here.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.010
I don't know if I'm making
this clear at all.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.630
Let me make these
points a little bit.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.420
You see the line will go
through all of these points,

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.200
but it will also go through the
point 2 comma 5, which will

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.800
be up here some place.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.600
For any x that you can think
of, if you had x is equal to

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.510
10,380,000,000 the
corresponding y will

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.770
also be on this line.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.180
So this pink line, and it
keeps going on forever, that

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.850
represents every possible
combination of x's and y's that

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.580
will satisfy this equation.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.770
And of course, x doesn't
have to just be whole

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.880
numbers or integers.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.670
x could be pi-- 3.14159.

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.090
In which case it would be
someplace here and in which

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.240
case y would be 2 pi plus 1.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.130
So every number that x could
be there's a corresponding y.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.990
Let's do another 1.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:21.535
So if I had the equation y is
equal to-- that's an ugly y. y

00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:29.020
is equal to negative 3x plus 5.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.180
Well, I'm going to draw it
quick and dirty this time.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.180
So that's the x-axis.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.020
That's the y-axis.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.334
Let's put some values here.

00:05:39.334 --> 00:05:41.630
x and y.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.860
Let's say if x is negative
1, then negative 1 times

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.245
negative 3 is 3 plus y is 8.

00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:52.750
If x is 0, then y is 5.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.020
That's pretty easy.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.690
If x is 1, negative 3
times 1 is negative 3.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.620
Then y is 2.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.990
If x is 2, negative 3
times 2 is negative 6.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.730
Then y is 1.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:08.070
Is that right?

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.610
Negative 6-- no, no.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.315
Negative 1.

00:06:10.315 --> 00:06:12.810
I knew something
was wrong there.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.610
So let's graph some
of these points.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.000
So when x is negative 1 and I'm
just kind of approximating.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.710
When x is negative
1, y is negative 8.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.610
So that point would be
someplace around here.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.680
And there's a whole module I'm
graphing coordinates if you're

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.540
finding the graphing a
coordinate pair to be

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.240
a little confusing.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.700
Oh, wait.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.790
I just made a mistake.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.830
When x is negative 1, y is 9.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.070
Not negative 8, so
ignore this right here.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.270
When x is negative
1, y is positive 8.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.610
So y being up here someplace.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.540
When x is 0, y is 5.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.440
So it'd be here someplace.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.720
When x is 1, y is 2.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.650
So it's like here.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.310
When x is 2, y is negative 1.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.550
So as you can see-- and
I've approximated it.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.740
If I had graphing paper or if I
had a better drawn chart you

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.210
could have seen it and it would
have been exactly right.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.950
I think this line
will do the job.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.430
That every point that satisfies
this equation actually

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.470
falls on this line.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.700
And something interesting
here I'll point out.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.790
You notice that this line
it slopes downwards.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.510
It goes from the top left
to the bottom right.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.800
While the line we had drawn
before had gone from the

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.160
bottom left to the top right.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.740
Is there anything about this
equation that seems a little

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.320
bit different than the last?

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.240
I'll give you a little
bit of a hint.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.230
This number-- the negative 3,
or you could say that the

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:52.280
coefficient on x-- that
determines whether the line

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.040
slopes upward, or the line
slows downward, and it tells

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.725
you also how steep the line is.

00:07:56.725 --> 00:07:58.900
And that actually,
negative 3 is the slope.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.350
And I'm going to do a whole
nother module on slope.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.400
And this number here is
called the y-intercept.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.960
And that actually tells
you where you're going

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.970
to intersect the y-axis.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:10.460
And it turns out here,
that you intersect the

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.250
axis at 0 comma 5.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.470
Let's do one more real fast.

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.130
y is equal to 2--
we already did 2x.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:35.374
y is equal to 1/2 x
plus 2 So real fast.

00:08:35.374 --> 00:08:37.180
x and y.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.270
And you only need two
points for a line, really.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.120
So you could just say
let's say, x equals 0.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.410
That's easy. y equals 2.

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.580
And if x equals 2
then y equals 3.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.660
So before when we were doing 3
and 4 points that was just to

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.650
kind of show you, but you
really just need two

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.230
points for a line.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.930
So 0 comma 1 2.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.730
So that's on there.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.320
And then 1, 2 comma 3.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.950
So it's there.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.110
So the line is going to
look something like this.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.440
So notice here, once again,
we're upward sloping and that's

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.870
because this 1/2 is positive.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.120
But we're not sloping-- we're
not moving up as quickly as

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.870
when we had y equals
2x. y equals 2x looked

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:24.452
something like this.

00:09:24.452 --> 00:09:26.390
It was sloping up much,
much, much faster.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.620
I hope I'm not confusing you.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.710
And then the y intercept of
course is at 0 comma 2,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.160
which is right here.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.300
So if you ever want to graph
a line it's really easy.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.760
You have to just try out some
points and you can graph it.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.440
And now in the next module I'm
going to show you a little bit

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.360
more about slope and
y-intercept and you won't

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.480
even have to do this.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.490
But this gives you good
intuitive feel, I think,

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.320
what a graph of a line is.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.250
I hope you have fun.
