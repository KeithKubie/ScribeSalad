00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.344
Let's see, the is rise is one,
two, three, four, five, six.

00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:05.841
Six.
And the run,

00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:10.330
well, there's no horizontal
change at all, it's a zero, and

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.850
look what we have here, a division
faux pas, six divided by zero.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.640
Now, I don't know about you, but
I do not know how to divide by zero.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.760
This doesn't make sense.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.690
This is what we call undefined slope.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.220
In fact, all vertical lines,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.840
since they have no horizontal change,
will result in an undefined slope.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.479
We just can't calculate it
because we can't divide by zero.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.450
So, let's take everything we know about
slope and what's positive, negative,

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.330
zero, and undefined,
and answer a question.
