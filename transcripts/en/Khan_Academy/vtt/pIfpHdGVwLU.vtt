00:00:01.352 --> 00:00:03.620
- [Instructor] James is
interested in weather conditions

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.897
and whether the downtown train

00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:07.588
he sometimes takes runs on time.

00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:10.504
For a year, James records
whether each day is sunny,

00:00:10.504 --> 00:00:13.752
cloudy, rainy or snowy, as
well as whether this train

00:00:13.752 --> 00:00:15.763
arrives on time or is delayed.

00:00:15.763 --> 00:00:18.630
His results are displayed
in the table below.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.083
Alright, this is interesting.

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:23.622
These columns, on time,
delayed and the total,

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.434
so for example, when it was sunny,

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:28.161
there's a total of 170
sunny days that year,

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:31.217
167 of which the train was on time,

00:00:31.217 --> 00:00:33.185
three of which the train was delayed,

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:36.058
and we can look at that
by the different types

00:00:36.058 --> 00:00:39.744
of weather conditions, and
then they say for these days,

00:00:39.744 --> 00:00:43.262
are the events delayed
and snowy independent?

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:45.469
So to think about this, and remember,

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:46.867
we're only going to be able to figure out

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:49.163
experimental probabilities,
and you should always view

00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:51.679
experimental probabilities
as somewhat suspect.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.928
The more experiments you're
able to take, the more likely

00:00:54.928 --> 00:00:59.017
it is to approximate the
true theoretical probability,

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.955
but there's always some
chance that they might

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:03.498
be different or even quite different.

00:01:03.498 --> 00:01:05.695
Let's use this data to try to calculate

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:07.669
the experimental probability.

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:09.204
So the key question here is what is

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:12.704
the probability that the train is delayed?

00:01:14.223 --> 00:01:16.208
And then we wanna think
about what is the probability

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:20.291
that the train is delayed
given that it is snowy?

00:01:23.858 --> 00:01:26.774
If we knew the theoretical probabilities

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:28.666
and if they were exactly the same,

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:31.511
if the probability of being
delayed was exactly the same

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:34.413
as the probability of
being delayed given snowy,

00:01:34.413 --> 00:01:38.976
then being delayed or being
snowy would be independent,

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:41.158
but if we knew the
theoretical probabilities

00:01:41.158 --> 00:01:44.173
and the probability of
being delayed given snowy

00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:46.879
were different than the
probability of being delayed,

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:50.453
then we would not say that
these are independent variables.

00:01:50.453 --> 00:01:52.951
Now, we don't know the
theoretical probabilities.

00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:56.088
We're just going to calculate
the experimental probabilities

00:01:56.088 --> 00:02:00.171
and we do have a good
number of experiments here,

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.577
so if these are quite different,

00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:06.642
I would feel confident saying
that they are dependent.

00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:09.985
If they are pretty close with
the experimental probability,

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:12.413
I would say that it would be
hard to make the statement

00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:15.767
that they are dependent,
and that you would probably

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:19.077
lean towards independence,
but let's calculate this.

00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:22.382
What is the probability that
the train is just delayed?

00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:25.636
Pause this video and
try to figure that out.

00:02:25.636 --> 00:02:26.762
Well, let's see.

00:02:26.762 --> 00:02:30.929
If we just think in general,
we have a total of 365 trials,

00:02:31.834 --> 00:02:34.501
or 365 experiments, and of them,

00:02:36.178 --> 00:02:38.761
the train was delayed 35 times.

00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.483
Now, what's the probability that the train

00:02:42.483 --> 00:02:44.484
is delayed given that it is snowy?

00:02:44.484 --> 00:02:47.329
Pause the video and
try to figure that out.

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.513
Well, let's see.

00:02:48.513 --> 00:02:51.180
We have a total of 20 snowy days

00:02:52.023 --> 00:02:55.773
and we are delayed 12
of those 20 snowy days,

00:02:57.991 --> 00:03:01.408
and so this is going to be a probability,

00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:06.380
12/20 is the same thing
as, if we multiply both

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.463
the numerator and the denominator by five,

00:03:08.463 --> 00:03:12.630
this is a 60% probability, or
I could say a 0.6 probability

00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:17.034
of being delayed when it is snowy.

00:03:17.034 --> 00:03:19.222
This is, of course, an
experimental probability,

00:03:19.222 --> 00:03:21.021
which is much higher than this.

00:03:21.021 --> 00:03:24.131
This is less than 10% right over here.

00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.050
This right over here is less than 0.1.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.413
I could get a calculator
to calculate it exactly.

00:03:29.413 --> 00:03:32.121
It'll be nine point something percent

00:03:32.121 --> 00:03:35.210
or zero point nine something, but clearly,

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.601
this, you are much more likely,

00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.472
at least from the experimental data,

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:42.061
it seems like you have
a much higher proportion

00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:44.240
of your snowy days are delayed

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.531
than just general days in general,

00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:50.409
than just general days,
and so based on this data,

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.450
because the experimental probability

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.439
of being delayed given
snowy is so much higher

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.312
than the experimental probability
of just being delayed,

00:03:58.312 --> 00:04:01.818
I would make the statement
that these are not independent,

00:04:01.818 --> 00:04:03.176
so for these days, are the events

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:06.009
delayed and snowy independent? No.
