Anthony: Hey guys Anthony here for Dnews at the
Imagine Cup

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.280
in St. Petersburg with Jing Loon. So you
guys

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.559
created something called KITS. Tell me
about KITS.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.829
Anthony: Now what I love is you guys are using a Kinect as well, right?

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.829
2: Yup.
Anthony: So this is really interesting. Now tell me a little bit about

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.030
where the idea for this came from. Now in
Singapore, if I understand correctly,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.590
everybody spends a little time in the
armed forces right? 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.800
2: Yup. Two years.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.290
Anthony: So, tell me about what the cost if this
will be

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.130
Anthony: How do you get the precision out of
the Kinect that you need to learn what

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.590
everybody has to do?

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.000
Anthony: That's very cool. So

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.409
you guys you you built this whole
framework that it runs on and you are

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.100
planning not just to bring this to the
military that you're planning to bring

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.130
it to other areas as well. Can you talk a
little about that?

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.549
Anthony: Tell me about Singapore

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.860
as a tech community. 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.980
Anthony: So how does it feel to be here at the Imagine Cup sort

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.650
of seeing

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.000
projects from other countries and
other places that may not be as 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.819
technologically inclined as Singapore is?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.110
Anthony: You guys did a
great job thank you so much Jing Loon.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.690
