CAROLINE: My name
is Caroline and I'm

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.360
delighted to introduce you to
today's speaker, Danny Fields,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.730
in conversation with
Fionnuala Meehan.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.080
Former manager of The
Ramones, Danny is a music icon

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.930
and is widely recognized as
a founding father of punk.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.000
Fionnuala is a huge music
fan, I've been told,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.440
and attends the punk rock
festival, Download, every year.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.010
Their conversation will
last about 30 minutes

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.630
and it will be followed by an
audience Q&amp;A, after which Danny

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.580
will be signing
copies of his book

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.330
for those of you who are
here in time to receive one,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.580
just at the side of the stage.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.288
I think we're in for
a pretty good treat,

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:39.530
so I'll hand you right over.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.490
Thank you for coming.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.490
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Danny.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.950
DANNY FIELDS: Hello.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.210
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
Welcome to Dublin.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.130
Welcome to Ireland.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.840
DANNY FIELDS: Thank you.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.020
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: And
welcome to the Google office.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.450
This is our-- as I was
saying to you earlier--

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.130
this is our EMEA headquarters.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.530
So not just Irish
people in the audience,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.350
but people from all
over the region.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.559
DANNY FIELDS: If I could
see them, I would know that.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.475
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yes.

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:00.007
Yeah.

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:01.090
DANNY FIELDS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.010
And if you're going like this,
I won't know, so feel free.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.430
You can stick your
tongues out any time.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.510
I cannot see you guys.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.760
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Don't worry.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.060
We'll have plenty of
audience participation later.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.920
So 50 years-- we
were just talking--

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.710
50 years in the music industry.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.053
That's pretty amazing.

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:23.470
And in looking at your life
across things like journalism,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.640
being an author,
promoter, manager--

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.024
DANNY FIELDS: I have to
scoff at all those words.

00:01:29.024 --> 00:01:30.190
They're kind of [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.235
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: They
sound pretty impressive.

00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:32.735
DANNY FIELDS: Yeah,
but we're trying

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:35.610
to redefine each
one of them in turn.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.714
But, yes, you have
to have a word for--

00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:38.630
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yes.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.360
DANNY FIELDS: OK.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.570
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: And
so, you don't strike me

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.590
as a person who,
maybe, consciously made

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.890
a decision to do a certain
amount of time in each one.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.549
So how did you end up having
such a fantastic career?

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.090
How did you make
the decision to move

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.470
between those different things?

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.470
DANNY FIELDS: Well, when
you have nothing to do,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.607
you have to do something.

00:01:56.607 --> 00:01:57.190
You know what?

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.210
I'm guided by what I love
to see and who's talented

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.760
and who's beautiful and who says
it great and shoots it great.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.289
And is great.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.990
That's it.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.082
And sounds great, of
course-- number one.

00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:13.290
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Number one.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.370
DANNY FIELDS: Or great
songs, number one.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.410
And I was one of-- what
do you do with this kid?

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.150
He's like-- I graduated
from college when I was 19.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.980
Didn't know-- do
something-- a career--

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.760
I didn't want to be a doctor
like my father, that's

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.430
for sure.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.860
I was not a
business-- certainly,

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.504
for sure, and to this day.

00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:41.920
I answered an ad
in the newspaper.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.620
I got a job at a magazine
for teenage girls.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.240
And [SLAP] I was in
the music business.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.740
OK.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.710
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: That's
where it all started.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.501
DANNY FIELDS: Yeah.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:50.690
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.470
It's pretty humbling to look
at all of the fantastic artists

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.650
that you've-- some discovered--
worked with over the years.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.880
I mean, The Doors,
Velvet Underground,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.540
The Ramones, The Stooges.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.210
When you saw these bands
for the first time,

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.899
were you reacting-- was it just
instinct, where you were going,

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.440
yeah, I'm going to
bet on these ones.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.731
These ones are going to be big.

00:03:13.731 --> 00:03:16.230
How did you-- how did
you make those decisions?

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.010
DANNY FIELDS: When you love
something or someone-- for me,

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.850
the first band I loved
was The Velvet Underground

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.540
because they were kind
of our house band.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.510
They were rehearsing
where we hung out.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.570
We'd follow them on the road.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.270
And their commercial
destiny was clearly zero.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.630
There's nothing-- no place
you could go with that.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.020
But we didn't-- you don't
care because you love it.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.870
And love their songs.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.055
"Heroin" was the national
anthem of my little unit--

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:49.870
not the drug.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.970
The song.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.790
You heard that and you were
defined for the time being

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.390
and you were placed.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.150
And you just stay with them.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.750
Love them.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.430
Stay with them.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.510
If they break up-- which they
did-- then stay with the ones

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.210
you loved who were
doing the songs, which

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.840
for me-- three
musicians from that band

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.000
were subsequently very important
to me, who are Lou Reed, John

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.940
Cale, and Nico.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.890
And each of them became--
you get absorbed.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.948
It's the story of life.

00:04:28.948 --> 00:04:32.570
We can't see it from above.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.220
We can only look at it now.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.980
It's been 50 years, as
you say, and go, oh,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.552
that's what happened.

00:04:38.552 --> 00:04:41.010
Because when it's happening,
you don't know it's happening.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.280
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.810
And can I ask you, of
all of those artists,

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.780
maybe who some of
your favorites were?

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.280
Is that--

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.100
DANNY FIELDS: I
don't like favorites.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.550
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
--an unfair question?

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.370
DANNY FIELDS: I have
so many favorites.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.970
Beethoven is a favorite.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.950
But I don't want
to hear about him.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.604
I don't know much about him.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.620
All those bands were--
would've had careers.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.800
The Ramones would
have been signed,

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.680
The Stooges-- in
spite of themselves--

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.590
would've been signed.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.310
Nico is the artist I'm
proudest of having something

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:24.320
to do with because she was
thought of as a beauty, which

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.630
she hated.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.590
As much as you can hate
being called a beauty.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.650
I can't imagine that.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.390
No one's ever called me that.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.310
But she didn't like
being merely beautiful.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.320
And she had been through
Brian Jones and Jimmy Page

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.110
in New York.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.640
And her first solo album
was recording songs of her

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.300
boyfriends'-- Jackson
Browne and Lou Reed.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.310
But she was writing the
most astonishing songs.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.150
She was a songwriter and she
worshiped English language

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.420
poetry.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.150
And she would hang
out in my apartment

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.950
and look at-- because in
college, I majored in poetry,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.030
so I had a lot of complete
works of Chaucer and John Donne.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.910
You all know what
that must look like.

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:22.710
And she said, oh, I want this
to be the name of my own album.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.530
And it was a poem by Wordsworth.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.420
And the phrase was
"The Marble Index."

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:34.690
And this referred to
a bust of Isaac Newton

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.210
in Cambridge that was in marble.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.020
And had a line in
it-- of course,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.210
it's not a familiar poem.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.210
It's not a household
poem at all.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.910
Contemplating a bust of
Isaac Newton in Cambridge.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.990
And it referred to the
marble index-- marble,

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.630
as in a statue-- of
a mind-- and now I'm

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.940
going to get this not exactly
right-- traveling alone

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.370
through the universe,
which is Isaac Newton.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.590
And of course, Nico-- and her
grandiosity and insanity--

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.460
identified with that.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.205
And said, oh, the marble index.

00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:12.250
I said, what?

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.290
Is that an album title?

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.890
OK.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.180
Oh, it's Wordsworth.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.150
Oh, OK, Nico.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.500
Yeah, you can call it that.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.810
So bringing her together with
the president of the record

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.170
company, she sat on the
floor with a harmonium.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:33.880
[MIMICS HARMONIUM] And he said,
yes, we've got to sign her.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.820
Get me John Cale on
the phone, quick.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:44.260
And they did astonishing
collaboration, which was 1968.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.860
It was 100 years
ahead of its time

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.940
and will be 100 years ahead
of its time in 2068, 2168.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.150
That's how amazing
that album was.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.110
I'm proudest of that.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.170
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
You're proudest of that.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.878
DANNY FIELDS: OK.

00:07:57.878 --> 00:08:04.202
Because there's this amazing
songwriter blossoming

00:08:04.202 --> 00:08:06.200
and being recorded as that.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.260
And the amazing
musicianship of John.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.130
It was two people in
that studio and it

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.620
sounds like you have
the Berlin Symphony

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.870
Orchestra or something.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.570
He did it all.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.710
And I had a feeling that--
from the days of The Velvet

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.240
Underground, they were kind
of waiting to collaborate.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.130
This was it.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.850
And that was it.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.200
And my favorite photographer did
the cover shot-- Guy Webster.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.970
And great album.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:33.469
That's it.

00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:34.629
That's number one.

00:08:34.629 --> 00:08:35.049
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: OK.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:35.770
DANNY FIELDS: Everything else--

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:36.070
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
That's fantastic.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.903
DANNY FIELDS: --it
would've happened anyhow.

00:08:37.903 --> 00:08:39.052
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: OK.

00:08:39.052 --> 00:08:42.520
DANNY FIELDS: Not to--
I didn't do anything.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.110
That is the one thing I did.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.400
I need some of this.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.186
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Let
me pour it for you.

00:08:48.186 --> 00:08:49.280
I'll pour it for you.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.170
DANNY FIELDS: Bear with me.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.420
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: There we go.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.750
DANNY FIELDS: Yeah,
this was easy.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.666
OK.

00:08:56.666 --> 00:08:58.290
Ask a question while
I whet my whistle.

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:58.670
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
I was just going

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.370
to say, while you're pouring
there, I'll ask a question.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.055
So your book-- it's
a beautiful book.

00:09:05.055 --> 00:09:06.305
DANNY FIELDS: It's a non-book.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.720
All books are non-books now.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.385
It's photographs.

00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:16.100
It's photographs.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.270
It's a book of photographs
that I took of The Ramones

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.720
in the first two years I was
with them as their manager.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.720
Because they were perfect
and they came to me

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.770
completely formed.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.174
They were-- there was
nothing I could say.

00:09:33.174 --> 00:09:35.715
Change your hair, or change your
shirt, or change your shoes,

00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:38.130
or change the order
of your songs,

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.610
or-- ugh-- change the
bass-- untouchable.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:44.220
Because they're perfect.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.960
Because I would not have
liked them in the first place

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.100
if they had not been perfect.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.630
But-- oh, and you're the manager
and there's nothing to do.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.830
The hotel rooms are
booked, the gig is booked,

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.880
the money's collected.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.021
All that's done.

00:09:59.021 --> 00:09:59.520
Legal.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.980
All that's done.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.040
I just started taking
pictures of them

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.520
because I was with them.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.310
And I had access to
them and I was learning

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.920
how to be a photographer.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.420
Just by [CLICK].

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.820
And they're just beautiful.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.060
They're beautiful pictures.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.060
And the boys are dead and I
thought this should be a book.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.290
They're just-- I'm
not going to tell you

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:31.562
they're beautiful photographs
it sounds so vain, doesn't it?

00:10:31.562 --> 00:10:33.270
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
But-- no, but they are.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:33.400
DANNY FIELDS: But they are.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.210
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
They are beautiful.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.020
DANNY FIELDS: And
it's a limited edition

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:41.900
by a friend of mine
in Paris, Fabrice

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.570
who did a book on Genesis
P-Orridge and a book

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:46.880
on Marc Almond.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.320
Has amazing taste
that goes all over.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.070
And he said-- and his partner
Richie Franklin in London--

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.560
so they commute.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.210
And they wanted to do a
book of those photographs.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.210
And I thought, yeah, OK.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.760
And now I'm a
photographer because--

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.380
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
Another one [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.421
DANNY FIELDS: It says so.

00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:07.520
A book of photographs,
and that's what it is.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.580
What I had to do-- a photograph
is worth a million words,

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.520
or a thousand words--
what's the cliche?

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.740
You still have something
to say about it, especially

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.120
if you were there.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.520
And here we see Dee Dee
picks up a piece of shit

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.360
on the capitol of
the United States

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.240
and puts it on a
balcony and lines

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.720
it up with the Washington
Monument and stands back

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.150
and-- you're, OK, it's art.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.690
Because Dee Dee
was a great artist.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:38.773
And there, he's being a
was a great visual artist.

00:11:38.773 --> 00:11:41.800
I don't mean to use
the-- it's not all that.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.180
But who else would
have been there

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:48.100
to watch him do that
without going, ew!

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.460
What are you doing?

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.840
He was making art.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.310
So there's that.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.700
And then just posing--
learning how to be them.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.010
And then alone in
the dressing room.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.770
You just-- I could be there.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.570
I could be this close to
them, wherein they were

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.530
being private, with a camera.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.940
And it wasn't like
ambushing them.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.140
But it was because
they knew I was there.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.940
They were learning how to be
ambushed by a photographer, who

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.910
was me-- who was their manager.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.140
So if any of the
pictures were terrible,

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.300
they would never be seen.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.799
I would-- you know,
I'm the manager.

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:25.640
They know I'm not going to let a
terrible picture get out there.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.655
And then part of
that part-- this

00:12:29.655 --> 00:12:31.920
is learning how to be with
a photographer who's not

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.310
your manager and
you don't be caught

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.770
with a piece of spaghetti
hanging out of your mouth.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.555
Learn-- when you see that
camera anywhere near you--

00:12:42.555 --> 00:12:45.240
you are-- this is work.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.780
OK.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.650
And I thought that these
points had to be made.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:49.360
This is work.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:49.997
You're public.

00:12:49.997 --> 00:12:50.580
You're famous.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.930
You're entertainers--
always now.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:57.840
Off stage, on stage.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.410
And that's the book.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:03.130
So it's a book of
photographs and I love it.

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.940
It's called "My
Ramones" because it's

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.900
the four Ramones I
knew at the beginning,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.270
before Tommy, the
drummer, left and was

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.370
replaced by another drummer,
who's quite a good drummer.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:19.150
But he's not my Tommy and
it was no longer my Ramones.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.330
And then they fired me.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.814
And then they went and
recorded the song "Danny Says,"

00:13:23.814 --> 00:13:24.980
which everbody was playing--

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.320
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yes.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.800
They were just saying
it's not about you.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.508
DANNY FIELDS: OK.

00:13:27.508 --> 00:13:29.840
The song was called
"Tommy Says," when

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.600
Tommy Ramone was telling
them, your next job

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.440
is in-- wherever it was.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:44.110
And it's Joey lamenting
that he wishes he

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.510
could be with his girlfriend.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:48.170
But Tommy-- and then
switched to Danny

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:52.790
because it sounded better--
says we've got to go to Idaho.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.152
I never told them-- they
never even went to Idaho

00:13:55.152 --> 00:13:56.360
when I was working with them.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.180
But it's good.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.060
It works.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.980
It's Phil Spector.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.650
It was supposed to be a hit.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:02.590
And it should've been.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.650
It's really a good song.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.900
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
It's a great song.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.690
DANNY FIELDS: It's not about me.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:06.690
I wasn't there.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.100
I had been fired before
they went into the studio

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.380
to record it.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.940
But still, it's like-- this is--

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.910
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: So you
can't believe everything

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:13.350
you read on the internet.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.150
DANNY FIELDS: It becomes
part of your life

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.600
because people say it is.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.080
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: I know.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.070
Absolutely.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.170
The book is beautiful.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.870
The photographs are amazing.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.230
DANNY FIELDS: Thank you.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:22.790
Thank you.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:23.190
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: They are.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.150
DANNY FIELDS: I
love to hear that.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.240
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
And the commentary

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.130
on New York, as well.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.150
You're a New Yorker.

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:28.576
You were born in Queens, was it?

00:14:28.576 --> 00:14:29.640
DANNY FIELDS: Yeah.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.690
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
And so if anybody--

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.439
I suppose if you're
interested in New York

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:34.890
and interested in The Ramones,
it's a fantastic book.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.840
And I learned what
CBGB stand for.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.920
I never knew what
CBGB stood for.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.212
So that's one to look out for.

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:40.920
DANNY FIELDS: OK.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.535
Well, that will serve you well.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.740
It was really the first two
years of their existence.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.420
And that's when I
was there and that's

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:54.860
when I was taking pictures.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.800
And then-- pshhh.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.482
But that's the record of--

00:15:01.482 --> 00:15:02.440
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.390
It is a fantastic
record of what happened.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:11.190
And we were talking earlier
about if that was today,

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:15.220
would bands-- similar bands--
be Snapchatting and constantly

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.880
streaming what's going on?

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.690
What's your view of--
because you, clearly,

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.800
wanted to record what
was going on then.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.710
You were there taking pictures.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.610
What's your view on
things like YouTube

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.280
and Snapchat and Facebook?

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.581
What's your view on them?

00:15:29.581 --> 00:15:31.830
DANNY FIELDS: Facebook was
a nightmare for a few days.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.860
And I said, get
this out of my life.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.670
This is horrible.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.960
I don't like what it does.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.190
And my friends are going to
be people I know and like

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:46.790
and want to hug, and
be with, and talk to.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:50.860
And what I say to my friends I
could not say to anyone else.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.500
That's what the
definition of a friend

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.230
is-- you can communicate
with-- so I'm not going public

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.870
with my-- what's in my heart.

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.260
That required that
disconnect-- which, I can't.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.140
It's still there.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:07.360
I still get alerts from them.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.570
And then someone
else put me on there.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.700
There's some tombstone
with my name.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.620
So if you write to them
and say something about me,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.630
it's going to be there.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.730
But just-- no.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.560
I have-- no.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.980
I have enough wonderful friends
who I love-- whom I love--

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.700
and I don't want to pick
them out of the crowd.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:29.070
Another-- Snapchat?

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.300
I don't even know what it does.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.370
YouTube is my life, and Google.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:38.880
Those two are my life
because there's the universe.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.680
And any song you
ever want is there.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.600
It's on YouTube.

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.870
That's-- what more do you need
in life but YouTube to hear it

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.730
and Google to find
out what happened?

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:49.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.436
And the rest is bullshit.

00:16:51.436 --> 00:16:52.560
It's a bunch of commentary.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.670
I don't want to see 600 pictures
of me and my girlfriend.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:01.240
And we went to ride a pony.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:01.740
And--

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.680
There's no-- there's
no editing there.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.870
Indulge-- if you
indulge 46-year-olds,

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:16.369
what are they going
to come up with?

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.160
Well, not much better than
what you can see anywhere,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.290
except by accident.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.790
Every once in a
while, there's going

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.869
to be something--
oh, this is great.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.810
But I don't care.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.350
Take it away-- Snapchat.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.837
Don't take away my
YouTube or my Google.

00:17:31.837 --> 00:17:33.420
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
We will not do that.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:37.030
DANNY FIELDS: Facebook
and-- it's a menace.

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:38.880
It only causes trouble.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.610
The only-- people I love and
respect-- I can't name names.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.240
A wonderful woman, who's
a very, very old, dear

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.130
friend, who's a great
international performer

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.700
and brilliant.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:57.950
And she is on Facebook and
she will be sitting in Berlin

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.880
in an apartment with her
and she'll say, look, look,

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.510
they love what I
had for breakfast.

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.050
What?

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.620
They love what you
had for breakfast?

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.160
You're you.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.380
You're an artist, you're a
performer, you're amazing.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.330
They love what you
had for-- and you

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.770
see the need for approval coming
through this Facebook bullshit.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.880
I hate that.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.360
This is, like, whoa.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:23.974
I love you.

00:18:23.974 --> 00:18:25.640
I don't care what you
had for breakfast.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.515
I'll always love you.

00:18:26.515 --> 00:18:30.700
I've seen you want to
stage, get naked, or talk

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.180
about what's corrupt and
what's evil and what's good.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.180
I don't want to know what
you had for breakfast.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.122
And I certainly don't know why
you want 120,000 million people

00:18:41.122 --> 00:18:42.580
to know what you
had for breakfast.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.120
Or you care that they like what
you had-- how can they like

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.410
what you had for breakfast?

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.484
That was your egg.

00:18:49.484 --> 00:18:50.408
It was not their--

00:18:50.408 --> 00:18:51.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.297
This is all so-- I'm
too old for this world.

00:18:55.297 --> 00:18:56.880
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: I
wouldn't say this.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.670
DANNY FIELDS: I got to get off
this bus pretty soon anyhow.

00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.925
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: No,
I wouldn't say that.

00:19:00.925 --> 00:19:08.500
On a more personal note, as
we're on personal matters now,

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.750
what was it like-- or tell
me about coming out-- well,

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.610
I said this to you
earlier about coming out.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.980
And you said, well, I
didn't really come out.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.688
But can you talk a
little bit about that?

00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:17.840
Because that-- still,
today, is still

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.315
difficult for some people.

00:19:19.315 --> 00:19:20.190
DANNY FIELDS: I know.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.860
I don't-- I was born out.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.890
I don't know what
that means-- come out.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.660
But I'm from New York.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.165
And all my friends--
I just never--

00:19:32.165 --> 00:19:36.190
and I went to school
at Penn and at Harvard

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:40.720
and there was no such
thing as coming out.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.985
You didn't have to
say, Mom-- well,

00:19:43.985 --> 00:19:46.260
what-- Mom found a letter.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.760
OK.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.020
You know, this happens.

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.040
And then, yeah.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.320
I mean, it's all-- can't
be a surprise, Mom.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.610
It's what you always
feared, expected, dreaded.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.230
Yeah.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.600
Let's move on.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:05.000
So I-- saying that and being
dismissive about it makes

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.610
me think, well, there's someone
there in the middle of nowhere

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:14.360
who is ashamed,
concerned, depressed,

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.780
confused about his
or her sexuality.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.140
Which now, has got-- you've
got 15 niches of that.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.720
I can't follow
this LGG-- there's

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.990
another letter-- every
week, there's a new letter.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:32.380
So I just call it BLT. And
everyone knows what that means.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:36.850
And it sort of has
everything in it.

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:39.420
I can't follow this jewel--
if you're less talented, ugh!

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:42.900
This niche.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:45.130
I don't know.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.650
I know, I'm sounding
cynical here.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:53.730
My heart is with anyone who
feels that they are not--

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.460
don't deserve to be a
human being because of whom

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.030
they love.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.770
And what bodies
they want to hold.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.590
And what they want to touch.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.360
All that.

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.640
Who made those rules?

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.250
Nobody.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.230
We don't need to reproduce.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.150
Because that's
where we came from.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.923
And we're living with a very
unfortunate set of biblical--

00:21:15.923 --> 00:21:19.950
some people wandering through
a desert, saying, do this.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.070
Don't do that.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.420
Not me.

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.740
Not modern.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:29.519
But I can't do any good by
saying these things, can I?

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:31.310
I just sound like, oh,
you'll be all right.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.930
Look at me.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:32.900
I'm fine.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:38.180
I, famously-- I read in
a "Village Voice" story

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.900
that I was famously gay.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.275
Famously gay, what
does that mean?

00:21:42.275 --> 00:21:43.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.280
It was about a
Bette Midler show.

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.720
Even people who
are famously gay,

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:55.180
like me, hugged and
kissed her after the show.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.800
What does famously gay-- how
can you-- what does that mean?

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.980
But that's what it means.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:06.160
And do what you want and I
will, hopefully, do what I want.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.030
Which is, right now,
have some water.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:08.530
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
Have some water.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.860
DANNY FIELDS: Because that
was hard going through that.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:10.930
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:12.630
That was-- no, thank you for--

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:14.088
DANNY FIELDS: It's
not a Facebook--

00:22:14.088 --> 00:22:19.313
it's not-- I thought, I can't
promulgate these things.

00:22:19.313 --> 00:22:23.230
It's not a papal
thing from anyone.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.210
Just, good luck.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.011
Find who you love
and just, fuck them.

00:22:29.011 --> 00:22:31.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.410
And dating?

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.800
I hate dating-- the word dating.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.450
What does that mean?

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:46.000
First, you have sex, and then
you decide if you want to date.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.790
Not the other way around.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:48.750
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Not
the other way around.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:51.124
DANNY FIELDS: No, because if
you don't like the sex, then

00:22:51.124 --> 00:22:53.830
how much more time are you
going to spend with this person?

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:54.740
OK.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.685
All right.

00:22:55.685 --> 00:22:56.560
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: OK.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.670
DANNY FIELDS: We're here
to talk about music.

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.586
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yes.

00:22:58.586 --> 00:23:01.720
Movies where they-- [LAUGHS].

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.377
So you still live in New York?

00:23:03.377 --> 00:23:04.960
DANNY FIELDS: Yes,
I live in New York.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.000
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yeah, you
would never live anywhere else?

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.510
DANNY FIELDS: I would
gladly live anywhere else.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.570
But I'm forced to live there.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.100
And it's OK.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.040
It's near-- there are airports.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.620
And I spend a lot
of time in London.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:24.550
I've been in London five
months this past year,

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:25.580
a month at a time.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.790
And it's almost
my other city now.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:31.770
It used to be Los Angeles.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:38.660
And no one should be--
no one-- me should not

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.410
be limited to one place
because the world is so full.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.030
And especially Europe.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:44.910
Now, wait a minute.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:45.847
Now, I'm in Europe.

00:23:45.847 --> 00:23:47.930
But when I was in London,
I'm no longer in Europe.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.160
That really sucks.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.200
I can't believe that.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.010
But I won't get into it.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.130
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Well, you're
definitely in Europe now.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:55.546
DANNY FIELDS: I
can't believe what

00:23:55.546 --> 00:24:00.605
it's done to my universe--
my London world.

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.420
Because it's just wonderful,
brilliant people--

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.180
artists and bar
owners and waitresses

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.640
and busboys and whatever.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.670
I can't believe what
it's done to them.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.050
This is like a shadow
over London this time.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.560
Someone threw something on them.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.180
There's this greatest,
wonderful city-- giant

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.980
city-- in the world and
they're all, what happens now?

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.084
This is kind of a tragedy.

00:24:26.084 --> 00:24:28.500
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: A lot of
people are very upset about it.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.480
DANNY FIELDS: Too close to
it to even talk about it.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.950
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: So I
have one more question.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.915
So if you have a
question in the audience,

00:24:33.915 --> 00:24:37.340
you can start getting ready now.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.900
So, 50 years in
the music industry.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.290
Who-- if you look around
today-- you talked about all

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:46.466
of the artists and your
favorite artists earlier.

00:24:46.466 --> 00:24:48.090
If you looked around
today, would there

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.560
be any artists
where you'd think,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:51.815
god, I'd love to
have discovered them

00:24:51.815 --> 00:24:53.190
or I'd love to be
promoting them?

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.310
DANNY FIELDS: Yeah.

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.380
There's always going
to be songwriters

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.510
and that's the most
important thing to me.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.290
But I can't name one
and it wouldn't be fair.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:08.540
I saw a band in London in an
almost empty bar in November

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.952
in Camden, called False Heads.

00:25:10.952 --> 00:25:11.660
And I loved them.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.950
I just loved their energy
and they were rock and roll

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:15.840
and we stayed friends.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.800
What I can do for
them, I don't know.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.625
I'm not in the
music business now.

00:25:20.625 --> 00:25:27.130
Of the people I've worked with,
we said before, I'm-- Nico.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.910
And now, I love--
everyone's going to hate me,

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.800
I love electronic dance music.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.692
And I love-- well, this is
how it happened, if I may.

00:25:39.692 --> 00:25:42.800
I go to a jam and
they play music.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.550
And it's usually
late at night and I

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.090
work out and listen to music.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.920
And there's this great song.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.350
I said, wow, what is the song?

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.560
This is the number one hit.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.810
I'm kind of good at that.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:57.560
Not always, but kind of
good at spotting the hit.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.730
And I had to find
out who's playing,

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.100
and it was a Spotify
fitness feed.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:02.750
OK?

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.120
If you have a gym,
you can call Spotify

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:11.010
and say, send me fitness stuff--
music that we can put on.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.140
And they can do bass
and drums or they

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.970
can do '80s, like Cyndi Lauper.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.420
This was from the feed
called Tomorrowland.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.010
This was my first encounter
with Tomorrowland,

00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.119
which is a gigantic
and famous and-- how

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:29.410
could I not know what this was?

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.120
Because I'm not 17.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.420
I didn't know what it was.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:36.990
It's this franchise of new
electronic dance music.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:40.970
And these giant spectacles,
where the lights-- I mean,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.450
forget Van Gogh and
Rembrandt-- whoever

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:47.140
is doing those lights-- whoa!

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.000
This is an artist.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.620
This is so great.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.770
And then some guy's standing
on stage doing this.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.510
Everyone's going crazy
and picking their arms

00:26:55.510 --> 00:27:00.130
up in the air because they
know that you can't move

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.460
very far from side to side.

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.230
They know that.

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.019
They don't have to be
told and I love that.

00:27:07.019 --> 00:27:08.310
And much of the music is great.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.840
OK.

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.210
This one song was
by Stromae, who

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.490
is a Belgian-- half-Belgian,
half-- his father

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.510
was killed in the
Rwandan massacre.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:21.090
How many people do you know
that you could say that about?

00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.075
Now, I don't know
him but, well--

00:27:23.075 --> 00:27:25.010
and his mother is Belgian.

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.590
And he's unbelievably great.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.530
And he's got YouTubes.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.830
And then his YouTubes will
take you to Tomorrowland,

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:41.070
where I saw Paul Kalkbrenner,
the Berlin genius.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.000
And I always get a, duh.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.700
And I get a jaw, like what?

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.890
And then last night, I
said, well, I like Avicii,

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:50.180
and there's this groan.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.190
Oh, we want our money back.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.000
Well, you know, well,
I like "Wake Me Up."

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:54.610
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: You
like what you like.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.720
DANNY FIELDS: I mean,
what a great song.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.870
It's the number one song.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:58.840
That's all.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.932
It's the song.

00:27:59.932 --> 00:28:01.140
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Absolutely.

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:01.750
OK.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.120
I'm going to open it
up now for questions.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.340
DANNY FIELDS: You hate
me because I said Avicii.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.930
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: No,
we don't hate you.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:08.138
Does anybody have a question?

00:28:14.266 --> 00:28:15.640
AUDIENCE: Hi,
Danny, how are you?

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.848
DANNY FIELDS: Can I use that?

00:28:16.848 --> 00:28:18.530
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Yeah.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:18.920
DANNY FIELDS: I
just want to see.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.586
AUDIENCE: You want
to try this, as well?

00:28:20.586 --> 00:28:22.010
This one, as well?

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.010
I was just wondering--
looking back

00:28:24.010 --> 00:28:27.400
and one of my favorite
music ever, maybe,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.620
is like Detroit,
MC5, The Stooges.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.320
When that happened, it was,
like-- looking at the YouTube

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:36.580
videos, for example-- it was
the most energetic thing,

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.770
even by today's standards.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.932
But then, after
that, became the--

00:28:40.932 --> 00:28:42.390
DANNY FIELDS: What's
your question?

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:43.264
AUDIENCE: --the punk.

00:28:43.264 --> 00:28:44.040
Is that--

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.290
DANNY FIELDS: I do this a lot.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:49.410
Because I know you guys want
to contribute questions.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.330
AUDIENCE: So what happened
to The Stooges and MC5

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.280
when punk happened?

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.196
DANNY FIELDS: Oh, god.

00:28:54.196 --> 00:28:55.060
When punk happened?

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.892
Well, there was no punk
when they happened.

00:28:56.892 --> 00:28:57.850
And they didn't happen.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:59.830
And they were both fired
by the record company

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.880
that I signed them to.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.270
Which, then, 60 years later,
said, well, we're so proud.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.850
This is the record company that
brought you these two bands,

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.250
that they fired.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:14.250
So the lineage is so complex.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.170
I suggest you read,
"Please Kill Me"

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:18.795
for the American side of it.

00:29:18.795 --> 00:29:23.280
And a book by John Robb
about punk in England.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.490
The Ramones, in fact,
met each other--

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:29.140
because there had never
been four different kinds

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:31.780
of people-- because
they were Stooges fans

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:35.050
in their high school in 1970.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.110
OK.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.910
That's how they bonded.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.250
It's kind of an answer
to your question--

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:45.430
is that you-- something
becomes something else

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:49.570
or comes into the mind and
consciousness of somebody else

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.070
who says, yes, we like
what they're doing.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.760
Let's do it as they do.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.520
The New York Dolls,
as well, which I wish

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.890
had been part of my life,
but they're not, formally.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.940
Except I loved them
and they invented

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:09.300
another universe that went
this way and it went that way.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.950
And then it got called punk.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:17.250
I'm not sure by whom--
I'm not sure it works.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.720
Someone said, oh,
the New York Times

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.124
is doing a big story on punk.

00:30:21.124 --> 00:30:23.290
And the writer said, oh,
we'll get you an interview.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:28.500
But in three to five sentences,
tell me what you think punk is.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.150
I said, if I can't do it in
more than three to five words,

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.520
forget it.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.340
And I haven't
picked them out yet.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:40.040
But I would say young-- don't
get up there and flop around--

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:47.000
and stylish and
aggressive and fabulous.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.550
So that's punk.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.930
I don't know.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.440
That wasn't an answer to your
question, was it, at all?

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:53.940
Come back.

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:54.870
Ask me a follow-up.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.120
AUDIENCE: It was pretty much
an answer to my question,

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.275
all right.

00:30:58.275 --> 00:31:00.400
DANNY FIELDS: You can have
a follow-up because that

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.836
was such a terrible answer.

00:31:02.836 --> 00:31:05.771
I know it was.

00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:07.270
AUDIENCE: Do you
know-- for example,

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.880
for MC5, it seems
like Wayne Kramer--

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.330
all that energy--
he's been doing,

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.530
now he's been to "Jail
Guitar Doors" thing, which

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:18.070
is interesting and important.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:22.180
But I guess he just kind
of disappeared for a while.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:22.930
DANNY FIELDS: Yes.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.270
He's great and he's here.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:26.950
And he's great.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.000
And he was-- it was his
energy, the first time I ever

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.210
saw the MC5 on stage at the
Grande Ballroom in Detroit--

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.310
September 22, 1968.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.240
And don't ask me
how I remember that.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:41.820
But it was.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.020
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
That's impressive.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:49.890
DANNY FIELDS: Great, great,
great source of nuclear fusion.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:51.770
Something happening
there that is

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:58.680
extra musical, that's beyond
chords and notes and yes.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.130
And Wayne is great.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:05.680
And the band, unfortunately,
got a little bit meh.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.580
Well, too political for a band.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.880
And this did in the
Sex Pistols, as well,

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.880
who are another
great band who were

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:21.450
destroyed because no one
wants a band that's political.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.640
It is not wanted.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:28.180
It's associated with destruction
and revolt and smashing

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.880
and burning.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.210
And it's unfortunate.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.120
Next question.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.060
No, I'm sorry.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:34.597
We'll talk.

00:32:34.597 --> 00:32:35.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.410
Yeah

00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.960
AUDIENCE: Actually, it's-- hi.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.660
It's a follow-up on
what you just said.

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:45.110
So '60s, as we read
from books and you saw,

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.800
were also a time of
destruction and violence,

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.060
as well as a fight for
rights in the United States.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.910
A lot of great
discoveries and trouble.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.717
Much like what's going on
now in the United States.

00:32:56.717 --> 00:32:57.300
Do you think--

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.341
DANNY FIELDS: I don't know
what you mean by that.

00:32:59.341 --> 00:33:01.830
Because what's going on in the
United States cannot be said

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.145
in 20 words or less.

00:33:03.145 --> 00:33:04.020
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:10.480
DANNY FIELDS: And this is not
a Murdoch headline, so please--

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.530
AUDIENCE: Do you think
that this decade, with all

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.030
of the tumultuous
events, will bring us

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:21.670
something as culturally
powerful as '60s did?

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.180
DANNY FIELDS: Well, if I
could predict the future,

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.770
I'd be so rich and
famous, I would not

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.247
have to be sitting here now.

00:33:27.247 --> 00:33:28.163
AUDIENCE: But you are.

00:33:28.163 --> 00:33:28.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.370
DANNY FIELDS: I would
buy more than one island.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.600
OK?

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.430
I don't know.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:35.230
How can I know?

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:36.760
You guys-- it's up to you.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.460
I'm getting off this bus.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.040
It's up to you to steer
it from now on, I hope.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:50.110
I'm sure there will be things
that we can't imagine now.

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:53.870
That's Shakespeare's-- "more
things in heaven and earth than

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:55.430
are in your philosophy."

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.480
There are.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.730
And because there
are more of them,

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.380
it means we can't
give them a name

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.990
and put them in a
directory or a folder.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.840
So I hope so and I believe so.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.770
Or else there's-- go to Facebook
and talk about what you ate

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:13.800
for breakfast.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.650
Or make the future.

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.230
I think it's a choice.

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.800
That's a bad answer, too.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.690
It's hard to be simplistic
about these things,

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:26.130
but I know what
you want to know.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.850
And I didn't make it.

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:30.389
I came upon it.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:37.540
I came upon a mini
universe-- several of them--

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:43.210
that was generating excitement,
art, talent, wonderfulness,

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.949
songs, music, paintings, light.

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:46.860
All that.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.850
Dance.

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:49.179
All that.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.949
The future's going to be
putting them all together.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:57.150
That's why I like the EDM shows
because it's all one thing.

00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:02.112
I think that package is what
I'm really-- you will see.

00:35:02.112 --> 00:35:03.320
I probably won't live to see.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.490
But there will be that.

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.740
I know that.

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.400
Pass your plastic-- your sponge.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.280
Oh, OK.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.643
It's been passed.

00:35:13.643 --> 00:35:14.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.390
I was wondering--
I've read that you

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.409
introduced Iggy Pop to Bowie.

00:35:18.409 --> 00:35:20.700
And I was wondering if you
could tell us a little bit--

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.910
how'd that happen
or why did you--

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:22.060
DANNY FIELDS: OK.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.310
I'll tell you how it happened.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:27.450
Because-- this is
not miraculous.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.410
There's no-- it sounds cosmic.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.402
Oh, my god.

00:35:31.402 --> 00:35:32.860
This meeting--
there must have been

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.860
one god touching-- you know,
the Michelangelo's ceiling

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:39.850
thing-- Adam's finger.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.460
It did not happen that way.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:48.014
David had come to-- David
had-- we knew he was--

00:35:48.014 --> 00:35:49.555
we knew from reading
"Melody Maker"--

00:35:49.555 --> 00:35:55.780
we didn't really know him then,
that he loved Iggy's work.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.190
He loved Lou Reed.

00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:01.530
And he came to New York and
hooked up with Lisa and Richard

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.520
Robinson who put
out "Rock Scene"

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:12.330
magazine and were widely
media-savvy in the '70s.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:18.990
And Iggy happened to be
staying at my flat in New York.

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.830
And Lisa Robinson
called me and said,

00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.210
we just had dinner
with Lou Reed.

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:25.580
And now David wants to
meet Iggy and I heard--

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.290
isn't he staying with you?

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:28.010
Yeah.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.700
He's sleeping.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.500
We'd just watched
some terrible Western

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.210
and he was sitting on the couch.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.960
And [SNORES].

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.010
Come to Max's.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.390
David wants to meet.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.300
Can you bring Iggy
to Max's Kansas City,

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:44.955
which was the action
central hangout in New York.

00:36:44.955 --> 00:36:46.790
It was just around the corner.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:47.963
So, Iggy.

00:36:47.963 --> 00:36:48.830
Uhhh.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:49.810
I said, wake up.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.550
David Bowie wants to meet you.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:52.745
Uhhh.

00:36:52.745 --> 00:36:54.870
The one who said you were
his favorite new vocalist

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.150
in "Melody Maker."

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.579
Oh, OK.

00:36:57.579 --> 00:36:58.370
It's just at Max's.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:59.630
It's around the corner.

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:00.640
Come on, wake up.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:06.820
And so we walked the 200 or 300
yards there and it was late.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.570
Almost-- there were
very few people there.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.210
It was around 3:00 AM.

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:18.420
And I said, Iggy, here's what
you asked to be delivered.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.980
And the two of them just
started talking about music.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.380
And Lisa and Richard
and I, who were

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:29.270
responsible for this match,
went off in the corner

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.770
and ordered a port or vodka
and just watched them.

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:37.050
And yes, they seemed
to be getting along.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:37.840
That was it.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.700
So I didn't do-- it
was not miraculous.

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.180
It was, you're a house guest.

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.130
Get up, someone
wants to meet you.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.280
That was it.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.890
I had not plotted this.

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:51.240
Oh, some day, he
can-- because we

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.240
didn't know who
he was, except we

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.040
thought he was great and
fabulous and beautiful.

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.410
He was in New York
looking for his idols, who

00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:01.430
were Lou and Iggy.

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.340
So that's all I did.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.180
Just, Iggy, come on.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:04.940
Let's go.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:07.160
Let's walk a few blocks.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:07.660
That's it.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.220
And it becomes legendary
and you want to know,

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:11.520
what was really like?

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.571
It was really like
[INTENTIONALLY MUMBLES]

00:38:13.571 --> 00:38:15.820
and they started talking
about music and we moved away

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.747
and that was it.

00:38:17.747 --> 00:38:18.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.330
DANNY FIELDS: Not--
there was not lighting

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.360
and the Red Sea didn't part.

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:22.860
Nothing.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.675
Just, that was it.

00:38:23.675 --> 00:38:25.050
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
I think we have

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:26.400
time for one more question.

00:38:34.397 --> 00:38:35.230
AUDIENCE: Hi, Danny.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.396
Thanks a million for coming.

00:38:36.396 --> 00:38:38.480
It's really interesting
to hear you talk.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.970
I understand you worked
with The Doors, as well.

00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.011
I'd be curious to hear
how that relationship came

00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:44.198
about and even what
you did with The Doors.

00:38:44.198 --> 00:38:45.542
[DANNY SIGHS]

00:38:46.322 --> 00:38:47.030
AUDIENCE: Or not.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.710
Or talk about--

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.376
DANNY FIELDS: Well,
no, I mean, it's OK.

00:38:49.376 --> 00:38:51.950
I mean, look.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:54.230
They were part of
my life because-- it

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.960
was another accident.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.860
A woman I knew in Los
Angeles said oh, my band

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.812
that I work with is
coming to New York.

00:39:01.812 --> 00:39:02.520
Will you do this?

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.010
She was doing me a favor.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.640
I had a band go
into Los Angeles,

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.670
she had a band come to New York.

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:09.714
Would you check them out?

00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:11.630
See if there's anything
you could do for them?

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.480
They could use a little press.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.985
I went to see them.

00:39:15.985 --> 00:39:19.850
At about the same time,
my greatest groupy

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:25.740
gals-- I mean, the real
forefront of the-- that word

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.260
is patronizing, I know.

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.530
It's sexist, I know.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.810
But these girls knew
what was happening.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:34.070
And oh, he's the sexiest guy.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.400
This great band playing uptown.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.400
I heard it from them.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.486
Then I get to the person
who represents herself

00:39:41.486 --> 00:39:42.610
as the manager of the band.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.230
Would you go see them and
see if you can help them?

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.510
So I went to see them.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.080
And went, well,
this is a good band.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.050
And I went to the rec-- and I
said-- I said I'm going, too.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:53.930
I'm your press agent.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:54.720
Hello.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.320
Your LA woman asked
me to help you here.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.200
OK, OK.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:04.690
This is 1967, I think.

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:07.780
And I said, I'm going to come
and interview you and ask you

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.950
and each of you-- you sit there.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.940
What's your favorite flower and
what do you look for in a girl?

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.250
And all that.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.855
And that was the
beginning of that.

00:40:15.855 --> 00:40:17.230
And I went to the
record company.

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.705
I said, hi, I'm your--
it was so different then.

00:40:20.705 --> 00:40:22.900
It was like a little village.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.720
OK.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.410
And I'm the press agent for
your band called The Doors.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.760
Oh, wow, we never
met a press agent.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.150
They never met a press agent.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.300
Come over.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.260
And eventually, Elektra
hired me to just start

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.330
a press department for them.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.820
And so I found
myself, officially,

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:47.800
the publicity person for
this person who turned out

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.090
to be an astonishing asshole.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:53.540
Although, one of the
most talented people

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.580
I've ever known.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.290
And one of the smartest.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:59.360
And one of the meanest and
cruelest and most brilliant

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.350
and-- except for his poetry,
which is not very good.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:06.310
Everything else
he did was, whoa.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:07.620
He was extra human.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.450
And you know he's
not really dead.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.463
That's a whole other thing.

00:41:11.463 --> 00:41:13.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:16.350
I mean, there is a corpse
buried in Paris somewhere.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:21.110
But he's-- he keeps making
trouble like he did then.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.610
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
I think that's it.

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.058
That's a great note to end on.

00:41:24.058 --> 00:41:25.540
DANNY FIELDS: OK.

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.584
But I-- what can
I say about him?

00:41:28.584 --> 00:41:29.750
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: Brilliant.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.740
Listen, thanks so much
for being here today.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.210
DANNY FIELDS: Thank you.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.050
FIONNUALA MEEHAN: For
answering all of our questions.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.500
DANNY FIELDS: Thank you.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.440
FIONNUALA MEEHAN:
For sharing so much.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:34.810
It was absolutely fascinating.

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:36.430
DANNY FIELDS: Thank
you and thank you.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.260
Thank you.
