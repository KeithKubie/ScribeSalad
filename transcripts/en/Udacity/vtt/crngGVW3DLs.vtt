00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's add the landmark.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's say the landmark is being seen at all time steps.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's say in the very first time the difference between position and landmark is 10.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Obviously this is a 1-dimensional example

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and not 2-dimensional as the picture suggests over here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Then it's 5, and then it's 2.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, what's the landmark position?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You can work this out in your head. It's a single number.

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
