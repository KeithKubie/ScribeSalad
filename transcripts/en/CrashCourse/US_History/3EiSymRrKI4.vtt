00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
U.S. History.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.940
There are two kinds of revolutions: those where things DO change and those where things don’t change.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.759
Like, not to get all Crash Course Mathematics on you or anything, but a Revolution is a 360 degree turn, which leaves you back where you started.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.200
That’s what happened with the French Revolution, basically they just exchanged a Bourbon for a Bonaparte.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.180
What? I don’t have to say it all French-y.
This is American history.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.160
And shut up French people about how if it weren’t for your support in the American Revolution, this would be the History of Southern Canada.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.600
But other revolutions, like the Industrial
Revolution, actually change things.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.689
So, which was the American Revolution?

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.729
Well, little of column A, little of Column
B.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:41.360
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Yeah, we went from a bunch of rich white guys running the show all the way to a bunch of rich white guys running the show.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.800
You’re not wrong, Me from the Past.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.260
But the 1700s were a pretty good century for
rich white guys everywhere.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:55.060
I mean, they were running the show in Holland and Portugal and Spain, but only the United States became the country that invented baseball, the Model T, and competitive eating.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.240
So you’re right, Me from the Past, but even if the US didn’t live up to its rhetoric, that rhetoric was still powerful.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.820
And in the end whether you care more about ideas or policy defines whether you think the American Revolution really was Revolutionary.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:15.720
[Theme Music]

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.360
All right, let’s start with the War for
Independence.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.080
If you’ve been watching Crash Course, you’ll
know that we’re not big on gratuitous war details.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.300
But we’re obligated to tell you something
about it.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.260
The main strategy of the British in the Revolutionary war was to capture all the cities and force the colonists to surrender.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.350
And the first part of that strategy pretty
much worked.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.400
They captured Boston and New York and Charleston,
but all the colonists had to do was NOT QUIT.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.920
I mean, they had home-field advantage, knowledge of the terrain, easier supply lines, and Mr. Creepy Eyes down here.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.720
So while the British took the cities, the Americans,
or Continentals, held onto the countryside.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.240
The most famous battle of the war was probably
the battle of Trenton, where Washington was like,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.580
“I’m gonna cross the Delaware on Christmas
morning.”

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.100
He had a funny voice. Everybody knows
he had a funny voice. It’s famous.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.780
That’s a made up fact!
Don’t put it on your AP test.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.840
“What do I know about Washington?
Well, I know he had a funny voice.”

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.780
Washington surprised a bunch of Hessians, which was a pretty impressive victory especially since he had just come off of a string of defeats.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.220
But he wasn’t able to turn it into an all out rout, and ended up having to spend a miserable winter at Valley Forge.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.640
But remember, generals always get to eat.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.400
But the most important battle, at least in
the North, was not Trenton, but Saratoga.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.880
This was a major defeat for the British, and while it’s often put forth as an example of the superiority of the Continental fighting man, the British mostly lost because of terrible generalling.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.800
The French would eventually bankrupt themselves helping us, which would lead to their own Revolution.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.420
As thanks, we named our most important food
after them.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.700
In the South the country-city trend continued with the British taking Charleston but then continuing to lose smaller scale battles and be harassed by guerrilla style tactics.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.180
The key battle of the war in the south – because it was the one where the British surrendered – was at Yorktown in 1781.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.800
Lord Cornwallis made the brilliant tactical decision to station his troops on a peninsula, surrounded on three sides by water filled with French ships, and the British lost the war.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.880
So what did this all mean for actual people?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.460
Well, Americans like to think that we all pitched in together and got rid of British tyranny, and lived happily ever after.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.680
Also that the Continental army was the bravest, most loyal, and most effective fighting force in human history thanks to the leadership of George Washington.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.040
[Patriotic Rock Music]

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.780
But actually, well, yeah, let’s go to the
Thought Bubble.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.660
Morale among continental soldiers was
often pretty low.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.480
Rations were poor and soldiers went unpaid.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.980
As Joseph Plumb Martin, a soldier from Connecticut,
wrote, they felt they were,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.000
“starving in detail for an ungrateful people
who did not care what became of us.”

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.850
And many other colonists didn’t fight for
independence; they fought with the British.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.890
Others were pacifists, like the Quakers, who often had their property confiscated when they refused to fight.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.840
And in colonial America, of course, losing
property also meant losing rights.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:48.980
And for slaves, the so-called fight for freedom was very different than it was for Continental soldiers, because loyalty to Britain in the war could mean freedom.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.400
In 1775, British governor Lord Dunmore issued a proclamation that granted freedom to any slave who deserted his master and fought for the British.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.340
Something like 5,000 slaves took him up on
the offer.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.720
And in addition, many slaves saw the revolution
as chance to escape.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.540
Boston King left a cruel master and later
wrote,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.400
“I determined to go to Charles-Town and
throw myself into the hands of the English.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.040
They received me readily, and I began to feel the happiness of liberty, of which I knew nothing before.”

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.480
100,000 slaves are estimated to have fled
to the British.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.100
Now, many slaves were returned to their masters, but more than 15,000 left the U.S. when the British did.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.900
And it’s worth remembering that the British empire abolished slavery in all of its territory by 1843 and without a civil war.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.080
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.620
So, Native Americans were also profoundly
affected by the Revolutionary War.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.760
Generally, they wanted to stay out of it, and the Colonists mostly wanted them to remain neutral, too.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.060
Like, the Continental Congress was eager to remind the Iroquois of their history of neutrality, writing:

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.000
“This is a family quarrel between us and
Old England.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.940
You Indians are not concerned in it.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.960
We don’t wish you to take up the hatchet
against the king’s troops.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:57.280
We desire you to remain at home, and not join
on either side, but keep the hatchet buried deep.”

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.060
Right, well, many of the Iroquois fought for
the British, anyway.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.840
The Oneidas joined the Patriots, fighting
against the Iroquois.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.110
Sometimes there were divisions within tribes
themselves.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.660
Like, with the Cherokees; younger chiefs tended to side with the British, older ones with the Americans.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:20.340
And it should be mentioned that, unsurprisingly, American troops were particularly brutal to American Indians who fought for the British, burning their villages and enslaving prisoners, contrary to the accepted rules of war.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:30.980
And, if the American revolution was really about, as Thomas Jefferson would have it, "the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," then the Indians were definitely the losers because they didn’t get any of those rights.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.270
So, we know slaves and Indians didn’t get
much out of the Revolutionary War.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.640
How did it go for women?
Yeah, not great.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.400
Some colonial women fought in the war:

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.500
Deborah Sampson dressed up as a man and fought at several battles, once even pulling a bullet out of her own leg.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.960
But women didn’t get much out of the Revolution – they were basically still considered wards of their husbands.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.840
Or, if they were unmarried, saleable assets
of their fathers.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.060
However, the idea of Republican Motherhood
became really important.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.320
It held that for the republic to survive,
it was necessary to have a well-educated citizenry.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.880
And since women were the primary educators, they themselves needed to be educated so they could, to quote Founding Father Benjamin Rush,

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:08.009
“instruct their sons in the principles of
liberty and government.”

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:09.480
But not vote or own property.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.850
So the war didn’t end slavery, it didn’t
much change the roles of women.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.750
And it didn’t displace the elite, land-owning,
pasty white guy leadership of America.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.180
So what was revolutionary?
Well, the ideas.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.440
A lot of which are summed up in a single sentence
of the Declaration of Independence:

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:35.280
“We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.640
So, when the colonies became states, they all created constitutions, which opened voting to more people.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.460
While most states still had property qualifications for voting, the bar was lowered, so there were far more voters than there had been.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.280
Although they were mostly white and male,
but still.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:52.140
Another aspect of the American revolution that was pretty revolutionary was the beginning of true religious freedom.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.010
Like, with independence, the Church of England
ceased to be the Church of America.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:05.850
And some founders, like Jefferson, were Deists, believing that God had created the world, but then stepped away to, like, create other universes or try to build a boulder too big for him to lift.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:16.199
Jefferson called for a “wall of separation” between Church and State that’s best embodied in the Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom in Virginia, which Jefferson was so proud of that he had it mentioned on his tombstone.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.130
And the American revolution profoundly changed
the economy, too.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.710
Like, all these new ideas of liberty led to a decline in apprenticeship and indentured servitude.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:30.530
And, immediately after the war, you began to see the split between the North, with its reliance on paid labor, and the South, with its reliance on slavery.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:36.039
Slavery was actually on the decline in the South until Eli Whitney went and invented the cotton gin in 1793, which:

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:40.240
A. made it possible to turn a profit growing
inferior American cotton,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.140
and B. reinvigorated slavery.
Yay, innovation.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.640
Oh, no. It’s time for the Mystery Document!

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.040
The rules are simple: Mystery Document.
Get it wrong: shock pen. Get it right: WOOO.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:08:00.520
“An equality of property constantly operating to destroy combinations of powerful families, is the very soul of a republic –

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.430
While this continues, the people will inevitably
possess both power and freedom;

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:12.260
when this is lost, power departs, liberty expires, and a commonwealth will inevitably assume some other form.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.580
Let the people have property, and they will
have power –

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:24.240
a power that will for ever be exerted to prevent a restriction of the press, and the abolition of trial by jury, or the abridgment of any other privilege.”

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.800
Stan, why did you put communism in my Mystery
Document?

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:28.680
All right, so we’ve got a fan of wealth
distribution.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.289
But, it isn’t Marx because: a) he’s not
American, b) he wasn’t born.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:37.560
There were a bunch of far-left hippies in early America with their hemp-growing and their liberty-espousing.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.520
Ugh, I hate the shock pen.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.940
All right, I’m gonna guess that it is noted
lexicographer, Noah Webster.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.960
[Dinging Noise]
AH HA YES!

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:50.600
Yes, yes, yes! Yes!
NAILED IT! Yes.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.780
Stan, that was the best one ever.
That was my biggest victory to date.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:09:02.280
So it’s worth remembering that some early Americans proposed a vision of liberty that sprung out of the idea of equality of property, which is very different from the way we imagine liberty today.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.920
But ideas of liberty – as diverse as they were – are really at the heart of what makes the American Revolution revolutionary.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.040
And that brings us back to slavery.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.160
The most common complaint among American high school students is that the Revolution was deeply hypocritical.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:20.440
I mean, how could this guy write that “All men were created equal” when he himself held slaves?

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.000
And had kids with one of them.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.440
And, even crazier, American colonists, often referred to themselves as slaves because they were denied the right to have a vote in parliament about their taxation.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:39.000
Now, some people recognized that it was a smidge hypocritical to claim to be enslaved by British taxation while they themselves were ACTUALLY enslaving people.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.140
But very few made the leap to say that liberty
should mean freedom for the slaves.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:49.240
One exception was James Otis of Massachusetts who wrote, concerning America’s slaves, that unless they were free, there could be no liberty:

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.760
“What man is or ever was born free if every
man is not?”

00:09:53.760 --> 00:10:01.700
But most of the Founders, including this guy and this guy, were the cream of the colonial elites, and so they held slaves and made arguments against abolition.

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:09.380
Like, many historians now argue that Jefferson was trying to condemn slavery in the Declaration of Independence, but without slavery he wouldn’t have had his amazing life.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.360
I mean, if he’d been working, he couldn’t have designed Monticello or stolen all of those ideas from John Locke.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.820
And speaking of Locke, Locke equated liberty
with property.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:25.960
And a revolution based on securing property against tyranny couldn’t very well turn around and take slaves, who after all were considered property.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.220
I mean, Jefferson once calculated that his slaves gave him a better financial return than his real estate investments.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.240
That being said, there were many and frequent
protests against slavery.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.920
The most vociferous protesters were often African Americans, and in the northern states at least, their pleas were heard.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:50.140
Between 1777 and 1804, all states north of Maryland got rid of slavery, although most did so at a very slow pace and were careful not to deprive slave owners of the value of their property.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.540
Like, as late as 1830, there were still about
3,500 slaves in the North;

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.820
and on the eve of the Civil war there were
still 18 in New Jersey. NEW JERSEY.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.420
So, the number of free people of color in
the U.S. skyrocketed.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:06.760
There were fewer than 10,000 in 1776; by 1810,
there were nearly 200,000 free black Americans.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:13.540
So, in the end, real change came, as it usually does, not through a revolutionary event but through a revolutionary process.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.040
To me, the really novel idea that emerged from the American Revolution was of American equality.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:27.840
Now obviously this was (and remains) a vastly unequal social order, but I’m talking about the kind of equality that Gordon Wood described in his famous book “The Radicalism of the American Revolution”:

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.740
The idea that no one American is inherently
better than any other.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.460
Prior to the revolution, and certainly in Europe, there were definitely classes of superior people, usually determined by birth.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.050
I mean, people knew their place and they were
expected to be deferential to their “betters.”

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:48.300
But all that talk of freedom and inalienable rights introduced the idea that birth wasn’t destiny, and that all people should be treated with respect.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:55.860
And the idea that no one should be denied the opportunity to succeed because of who their parents were catalyzed change not just in America but around the world.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:09.160
And while the U.S. no longer leads in equality of opportunity, that early American idea that we are all equal in our capacity to reason and to work became the foundation not just for the American Revolution, but for many others that would come afterward.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.280
Thanks for watching.
I’ll see you next week.
