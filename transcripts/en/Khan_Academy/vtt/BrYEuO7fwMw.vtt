00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:02.802
- [Voiceover] We're asked
to use the translation tool

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:05.890
to determine the translation that will map

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.559
triangle WIN, so this right over here,

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.801
onto the other triangle.

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.004
So let's see if we can
translate this thing.

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:16.047
So I'm gonna use the translation tool.

00:00:16.047 --> 00:00:17.522
So I'm gonna start with the translation.

00:00:17.522 --> 00:00:20.042
So it says translate by,

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:21.365
and this is gonna say so
how much do we translate

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:22.606
the x coordinates, and how much

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.462
do we translate the y coordinates?

00:00:24.462 --> 00:00:25.913
Let's see, if I want to map,

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:29.187
if I want to get point W to correspond

00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:30.674
to this point right over here,

00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:32.392
which it seems like it should,

00:00:32.392 --> 00:00:35.109
I would have to go from x equals two,

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:38.916
to x equals negative five.

00:00:38.916 --> 00:00:42.166
So my x would have to decrease by seven,

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.688
so let me type that in.

00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:45.615
Negative seven,

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:47.054
and then, let's see,

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:49.979
on the y side, and we saw that,

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.136
by just typing in negative seven,

00:00:51.136 --> 00:00:53.702
here we moved it to the left by seven.

00:00:53.702 --> 00:00:57.128
And now, in the y axis,

00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:59.183
I need to move it down by, let's see,

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:01.237
one, two, three, four.

00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:04.720
So my y coordinates, I
move it down by four.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.136
And let's see.

00:01:06.136 --> 00:01:07.123
What happens?

00:01:07.123 --> 00:01:09.689
And it looks like I was able
to successfully translate it

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.650
by translating x by negative seven,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.310
every point here, every point

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.981
on this has been shifted
to the left by seven,

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:18.071
and has been shifted down by four.

00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:20.381
And I was able to get onto this triangle.

00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:21.947
I was able to, through the translation,

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:24.630
the image is now in kind
of that target triangle

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.624
that they asked me to map to,

00:01:27.624 --> 00:01:29.180
to translate to.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.637
We got it right.
