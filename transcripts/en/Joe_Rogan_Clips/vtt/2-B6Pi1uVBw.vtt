1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.220
The Joe Rogan experience.
Let me bring up Dresden before and after the war

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.620
and take a look at that.
They say the middle of the dressing was,

3
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:12.660
is how does the son,
Jesus,
speaking of 200 degrees because of the,

4
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:15.120
when the allies palmed it,
but just take a look at the,

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.680
what it looked like before and after.
Oh,
we're so lucky.

6
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.990
We don't have to tolerate that shit right now.

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.160
I remember who was the guy who wrote,
um,
Oh God,
where the,
where the,

8
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:30.480
where the monsters are or where the,
uh,
I,
I wrote a children's book,

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.480
it was a call where the monsters are,
I don't know.
And he was,

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.580
we was in the war and he said,
do you believe in God?
And he said,

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.550
and he just casually said,
no,
no,
the war took care of that for me.

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.580
I never forgot it.
I was like,
fuck.
He just died in five years ago.

13
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.640
I had Eddie Izzard on yesterday and we were talking about wars of aggression

14
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.840
that most likely we've seen the end of wars of aggression.

15
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.310
There's trying to conquer new territory like that World War II was probably the

16
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:59.070
last one of those.
Look at that man.
That's,
so that was Dresden.

17
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.910
Dresden looked like the surface of the moon when they were really done with it.

18
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.140
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Oh my God.

19
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.030
That lady got barbecued.
Yeah.
That's terrific.
Those are all bodies,
man.

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.760
She,
and that was their stress in,
there you go.
Just that,
that bill will go,

21
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.580
stop scrolling.
Look at that.
What the fuck man?
Yeah.
That's what war did.

22
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.910
That's what World War II is.
The destruction of old Europe.

23
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.680
Imagine what it would look like to,

24
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:29.400
to watch those bombs hit and just level everything like that.
Well,

25
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.400
it's carpet bombing.
So civilians that,
you know,
the,

26
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:35.760
the objective was actually to kill the Ra,
the German worker,

27
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.070
to really bring that country to its knees.
It was,

28
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.720
it was back when total devastation and the enemy was essentially a tactic.

29
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.050
Um,
it was a horrible,
horrible thing.

30
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.800
Wow.
Yeah.
It's,
is,
these images is so stunning.
Oh,
here.

31
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:56.520
This is how human beings rebuild,
yet they prevail.
Yeah.
And you know,

32
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.460
that's okay.
Um,
we were talking about yesterday was a,

33
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.810
that would most likely have seen the end of these wars of conquest where people

34
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:10.560
try to take over new territory.
It's territory is no longer a commodity.

35
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.280
Now it's services,
it's ideas,
it's technologies,

36
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:18.000
it's it land in that sense.
What do you need?

37
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:22.800
Concept was that we're moving in a better direction and that things are becoming

38
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:24.930
less and less,
at least overtly aggressive.

39
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.410
More people are able to see what's really going on too and more people can

40
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:33.411
communicate mean this is really the only generation ever like these last two or

41
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:38.730
three generations where you're able to easily translate anything than anyone

42
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:41.310
saying any other country.
Like how often do you go?
Like,

43
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.130
I'll read like could be abnormal Grumet offs,
um,
uh,

44
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.040
Instagram page and it's in Russian,
you know,

45
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.020
and I'll translate it and so I could read what he's saying.

46
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.690
And I do that with a lot of other fighters too.
I just hit the translate button.

47
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.110
Yeah.
My,
how dope is that brings you closer to that.
Yeah,

48
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.150
we'll do you get to know them,
you know,
you know,

49
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:59.410
and you see that they,

50
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.140
they're pretty fucking similar even though they're different,
you know,

51
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:06.040
they're into family,
Ferris worship and their food and their community.

52
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:10.390
They laugh.
They laugh.
Yeah.
I mean,
you were at air assaults with each other.

53
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.970
If you live there,
you'd be in that style of living too.

54
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:15.680
And it's a hard place to live.
So you gotta be a tough mother fucker.

55
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.810
That's right.
Yeah,
that's right.
But there's a pretty,
there's,

56
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.450
there's something predictable too about how to live their certain norms and

57
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.820
practices.
You know,
there's,

58
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.300
there's a lane with Russia being run by Putin,

59
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.140
that seems to me to be the last big country that might invade somebody's like

60
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.330
Russia being run by Putin.

61
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.810
You could almost see him pulling a cry me a somewhere else in the world.

62
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.030
You could almost see him.
I think Russia and I think the history of Russia.

63
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.810
I have not been there.
I was there when I was very young,

64
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.260
but I've not been there since I and I have people who have gone there and they,

65
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.550
they actually really enjoy it.
And it's,
you know,
just great people,

66
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.540
like great people,

67
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:03.160
the Russian people who suffered maybe more than anybody in the 20th century,

68
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.760
but great people and industrious and everything else.

69
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:10.870
But I do think that they're run by a gangster.
Well,

70
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.290
but it's not just that they're run by gangster.
Yes,

71
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:19.291
but I th I think that sometimes the way I'm a populace thinks about certain

72
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.890
things can inform their destiny right now.

73
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.343
So think about this.

74
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.590
If you are always invaded and you had a flat topography and tanks could roll in

75
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:37.810
German tanks or whatever it is,
and you paid such a price,
the price for that.

76
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.110
Again,
I told you when I went there in 1985 you didn't see any old men.

77
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.210
They were all killed.
But aggression,

78
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.990
male aggression was what kept those Nazis at bay and when they were,

79
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.290
when they surrounded Leningrad.
Now Saint Petersburg and stuff like that.

80
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.124
A lot of stories that,

81
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.600
and I think that when you've been traumatized,

82
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:03.520
to the extent that rush has been traumatized,
certain strengths,

83
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.241
you know,

84
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:08.890
the ability to stand up against aggression and to be brave and powerful,

85
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.330
those become that.
That becomes the commodity.
That's where,

86
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:16.390
that's the guy that gets all the money,
all the women,
all the,
you know,
whatever.

87
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.000
And I think that's a product of their history.
So Putin is an admired man.

88
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.730
Putin gets,
I bet you if putting had very fair elections,

89
00:05:24.731 --> 00:05:26.890
he would get elected in to power.

90
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:29.950
He's respected you trying to say doesn't have fair elections.
Yeah,

91
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.120
well there's a large site.
My larger point is on the record.
I'm not saying that,

92
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.520
I'm not saying that's her.
I don't know anything about Russian elections,

93
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.480
but I will say this,

94
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.630
I don't know why you're putting words in my mouth while those guys get door,

95
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:43.870
what the hell is going on?
Would get elected anyway,
I think still love him.

96
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.070
So my fever allowed open criticism of them.
Well,

97
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:49.870
there is open criticism,
believe it or not.

98
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:53.380
Sure of the guys who get shot a well know,
openly criticized.
Then they get shot.

99
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.720
There's actually,
there's actually,

100
00:05:55.721 --> 00:06:00.110
there is a press that is critical.
Right,
right,
right.
But it's not,

101
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.470
you know,
they've killed journalists.
Yes.
He's not a threat to his power.
Well,

102
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:06.140
how many,
how many journalists have been murdered?
I don't know.

103
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:10.070
But enough poisons and all kinds of weird shit.
Google,
Google journalists,

104
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.370
critical of Putin murdered also with supporters will beat the shit out of you.

105
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.410
Yeah.
So,
sure.
So,
so,
so what I'm saying is that I think Russia's,

106
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.370
what are you saying?
I think Russia needs to embrace a diff,

107
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.820
the softer strengths.
Are you a foreign policy advisor?
Yes,
I am.
This at low.

108
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.900
There's a philosophy I have.
This is my philosophy.
Ready?
Okay.

109
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.340
So my philosophy is this,

110
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.550
this country is a great country and our culture is an interesting culture.
Why?

111
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.690
Why?
Because not only are we represented of hard strengths,

112
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.670
the military,
the NFL,
the fucking UFC,
all that shit.
The what?

113
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.970
Eagles and eagles' fucking baller,
Bro.
You're right.
It's a classic there.

114
00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:52.400
Canada's fucking national elements.
The beaver.
Well,
Russia as a bear.
Okay.

115
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.590
But so Americans,
again,
a very aggressive,

116
00:06:54.591 --> 00:06:56.270
but you know what America's trade secret is?

117
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.090
We've also provided safe quarter two are gentler spirits.

118
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.890
What this violent deaths of journalists started in the Yeltsin era.

119
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.340
Okay,
so they just been doing that.
Yes.
Forever.
Yes.

120
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:10.940
So there's just like presidents just do that in Russia.

121
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.810
Always have murder,
crossfire,
terrorist act.

122
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.610
In 2008 there was six of those dude,
a murder Olean.
There was another six.

123
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.970
Listen,
two of them were brought to trial.
[inaudible].
Look at me right now.

124
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.740
Putin is Gandhi putting this Gandhi compared to Khrushchev,

125
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.310
God d compared to Stalin.
Connie compared to Lennon.
Gandhi compared to any,

126
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:35.990
anybody who was in power before him.
They,
those guys used to kill wholesale.

127
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.320
I mean,
that's a fact.
Up to their elbows in blood.

128
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.990
Who was that guy that got murdered recently that was running?

129
00:07:41.991 --> 00:07:43.250
It was a political opponent.

130
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.680
They shut that dude down when his death was not related to the journalist's
work.

131
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:52.520
The conviction rate exceeds 90% what?
I put them in jail too.

132
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.210
If they don't just kill him when the debt,
what does that quote though?

133
00:07:56.211 --> 00:08:00.230
When the death was not related to the journalists work to convince.

134
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:05.270
So you're talking about rates of conviction.
Oh,
okay.
That was a weird quote.
Oh,

135
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.280
rates of conviction are very high,
you know,
of course,

136
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:09.140
to the guy with the biggest gun in that society.

137
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:13.390
They do hold all the power to though Nasbe a notch.
Those kinds of trials.
Yeah.

138
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.000
You're going straight to the pokey son.
Do not pass.
Go.
Good luck with your trial.

139
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.680
That's true.
The judge was like,
yeah,
I listen to Ya 20 years.
Fuck off.

140
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.200
But aggressive,
aggressive,
aggressive part of the world.

141
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.760
The United States like Russia,
however,
we're smarter.
No,
we're better Wheaton.

142
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.980
Nope.
We protect our,
we protect our funnier up.
Why are we funnier?

143
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:36.620
Because we're better.
That's not too general,
sir.

144
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:40.190
On James at the comedy store to General,
sir,
you're being too general.

145
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.780
This is a quiz.
Why we're better battery,
because we,

146
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.810
we have protections for our,

147
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:53.210
the people on the fringes are creatives.
Our weirdos are fashionistas.

148
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:55.890
All the people that make our culture interesting.
Steven jobs,

149
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.030
he wasn't good at crossfit.
No.
He's going to yell at employees.
Yeah.

150
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.260
Either was Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King,
but they,
but we provide the,

151
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:06.030
at least there was Duke recourse.

152
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.680
At least we know that there are softer strengths.
They have to be protected.

153
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.680
It makes you more interesting and it makes you more creative and stronger.

154
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.770
You gotta be innovative.
You're innovators are Weirdos like Leonardo Da Vinci.

155
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.430
I apparently was gay.
What?
Ah Huh?
I said,
yeah.
Wait a minute.

156
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.260
Guess what?
What?
There are a lot of very smart in Russia.
If you're gay,

157
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:31.160
it's not that safe for you to have stuff of building.
Yeah.

158
00:09:31.161 --> 00:09:34.640
So what you do is when you do that with people who are creative and you

159
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.060
marginalize a group of pill,

160
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:38.280
cause there are different in the name of purity or whatever,

161
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.780
didn't think you're fucked.
Like really weird public statement about homosexual.

162
00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:46.080
I like the law in Russia,
like his homosexuality illegal in Russia.
Well,

163
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.970
a lot of times they're acquainted with pedophiles.

164
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:51.750
The LGBT community has real trouble there and it's hard to get apartments.

165
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.670
It's more of a subtle,
it's hard to,
it's hard to just live and make a living.

166
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.320
So what happens is all those creative people who could be contributing and

167
00:10:01.321 --> 00:10:05.580
coming up with beautiful ideas there,
they're marginalizes perverts,

168
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:10.680
deviance.
And that's the dumbest.
Don't get to inherit the earth.

169
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.410
The meek.
A lot of times that the people that provide you your fucking goodies.

170
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.310
Russian gay propaganda law for the purpose of protecting children from

171
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:21.630
information,
advocating for a denial of traditional family values.

172
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.800
Whoa.
The gay propaganda law and the Anti Gay law,

173
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:30.801
the bill that was unanimously approved by the State Duma on 11th of June,

174
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:33.420
2013th holy shit man.

175
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:38.010
Say you want to protect children from exposure to,
you know,
home activity.

176
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.050
Yeah.
And it was signed into law by President Vladimir Putin on the 30th of June,

177
00:10:43.051 --> 00:10:46.110
2013 how long is he going to be president?
So let me,

178
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:48.570
but let me ask you a better question.
So with those kinds of laws,

179
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.030
those kind of laws that marginalize anybody,
that's not,

180
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.070
that's not normal quote unquote,

181
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.840
that's not traditional prototypical male female.
Right.
Awesome.

182
00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.940
When was the last time you bought,
and I'll wait.

183
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.910
When's the last time you bought one Russian product?
Pleased.

184
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.700
Besides the fact that they're essentially a one crop economy,

185
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:07.740
which is oil and I guess some other commodities.

186
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.500
What happens is you kill all your creativity.

187
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.950
What happens is you are not a strong country.
Your weaponry isn't even cut.

188
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.650
That's the irony of all this shit,
right?

189
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.080
You have that mindset and you have one idea of what strength is.

190
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.930
You're going to be fucking week and you're not going to be creative as a

191
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:24.390
coalition and cough.
A good rifle.
It's a very good rifle.

192
00:11:24.391 --> 00:11:27.660
Make some good shit design in 1957 I believe.
Oh,

193
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.740
let's just say 2012 previously holding the position from 2000 2008 so he's been,

194
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.200
right now he's on seven years in office.
Our sir,

195
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:41.940
he's been longer that Lauren and Matt.
Yeah,
but I mean seven now.
Currently.

196
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.060
And then he did it eight years before.
Yeah,

197
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.670
but he didn't even take four years off when he took four years off.

198
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:51.030
He was like running shit from behind.
He's got to look like I'll kill you.

199
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.900
Like he's like will kill you.
Yes.
A black belt in judo definitely kill you.

200
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.950
Yeah.
Legit black belt in judo.
Yeah.

201
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.530
Like he can actually throw people around probably smart as fuck.
And in his mind,

202
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.990
you know,
Putin is running a country that requires a strong man.
Yeah.
It's,

203
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.590
it's who they respect.
So he's caught in that too.
Even if he,

204
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:13.720
if we king of the world,
let's say you're the king of the world,

205
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:18.340
how do you fix Russia?
You,
you,
you come back,
come at them with up,

206
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:21.790
you present an idea,
the idea I just presented,

207
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.650
which is the idea that you might want to protect the people that you consider to

208
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:30.280
be queer as deviants and Weirdos,
nerds or whatever they are.

209
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:34.960
Because those people,
a lot of times our,
your creatives,
I don't know why,

210
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:35.794
but they are,

211
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:41.020
and think they lived in too much of a wartime culture for like for too long.

212
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.290
I deal that they developed this hardness to them that yes,

213
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:48.350
while they're lacking in the creativity and the innovation and make it afford

214
00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.201
that.
And I don't.

215
00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:52.460
And I think that a lot of times when you've been traumatized that you're,

216
00:12:52.461 --> 00:12:56.620
you're dealing still with the residue and the trauma of World War One and World

217
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.340
War II.
And that's very real.
And you know,
and also by the way,

218
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:04.210
communism and having nothing and,
and you know,

219
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.590
they have strong communities.
I mean,

220
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.220
my friend went to Russia and said everybody was nice to him.
Fucking,

221
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.520
they're good people and they're innovative people in their quick look at how

222
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:16.210
good they are at boxing.
Anything the Russians put their mind to that they,

223
00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:20.490
that they hold value for.
Like strengths,
like MMA,
like,

224
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.730
like boxing.
Look at how good they are.
So they're,
they're incredibly industrious,

225
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.090
disciplined,
smart people.
I just wish,
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.300
How do you get weed over the hell no,
I bet you don't.
I bet if you have money,

227
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:33.570
you get everything you want,
right?
If you've got money,
yeah.

228
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.080
If you're connected to the oligarchy,
but.
