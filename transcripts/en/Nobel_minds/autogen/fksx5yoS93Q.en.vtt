one night a year there will be you know
this will be the center of something I

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299
this will be the center of something I
 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.660
this will be the center of something I
mean the tenth of December this thing

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670
mean the tenth of December this thing
 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.820
mean the tenth of December this thing
will glow and and become a public

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830
will glow and and become a public
 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.090
will glow and and become a public
destination but I think that in terms of

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100
destination but I think that in terms of
 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.630
destination but I think that in terms of
the sustainability and the robustness of

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640
the sustainability and the robustness of
 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.290
the sustainability and the robustness of
the institution is something for 365

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300
the institution is something for 365
 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.989
the institution is something for 365
days a year then we have to think about

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:28.999
days a year then we have to think about
 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.290
days a year then we have to think about
the diverse visitors that will come so

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300
the diverse visitors that will come so
 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.990
the diverse visitors that will come so

local people will come very informally
so the building tries to offer something

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160
so the building tries to offer something
 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.730
so the building tries to offer something
at the public level so the ground floor

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740
at the public level so the ground floor
 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.130
at the public level so the ground floor
will be an exhibition space it will be

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140
will be an exhibition space it will be
 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.560
will be an exhibition space it will be
free entry and it will be changing and

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570
free entry and it will be changing and
 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.260

very important that this is very
 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.600
very important that this is very
transparent with three entrances that

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610
transparent with three entrances that
 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.869
transparent with three entrances that
coming in and this is such a very open

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879
coming in and this is such a very open
 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.709
coming in and this is such a very open
and transparent place which I think will

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719
and transparent place which I think will
 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.849
and transparent place which I think will
help relate the building to its locality

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859
help relate the building to its locality
 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.899
help relate the building to its locality

over the last century in that sense it's
an extraordinary virtual and real

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570
an extraordinary virtual and real
 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.570
