00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.190
For every carefully planned script or crystal-clear
director’s vision, there’s an unplanned

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.119
twist or total accident that ends up being
just as important to a finished film.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.060
Sometimes, that means an unforgettable movie
moment has nothing but luck to thank, or that

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.240
audiences will never know what really went
on behind the scenes – until now.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.680
Here is Screenrant’s look at How it Was
Shot: 10 Most Iconic Movie Scenes.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.980
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.320
The Indiana Jones series has featured plenty
of movie magic, but not all of it is glamorous

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.610
special effects or stunt work.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.219
In the Last Crusade, Indy and his father take
a wintery trip on a German zeppelin.

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.730
Since the scene was actually filmed in the
summer, the extras covered in fur coats and

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.280
hats were dripping sweat.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.140
Sean Connery made a veteran decision, and
removed his pants, making sure that his lower

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.010
half wouldn’t be visible on screen.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.700
Harrison Ford followed suit, and their entire
scene – filmed with them in their underwear

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.790
below the table – made it into the finished
cut.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.790
Jurassic Park

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.530
Jurassic Park has been scaring and thrilling
fans ever since it was released in 1993.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.860
In the most iconic scene, a T-Rex terrorizes
a brother and sister trapped in a flipped

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.860
jeep.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.780
Designed and developed by a team at Industrial
Light and Magic, the dinosaur model weighed

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.250
12,000 pounds and packed enough power to pose
a serious threat to the crew.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.830
To be safe, an alarm would sound when the
dinosaur went live.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.310
But the heavy rain on set took the real toll
on the beast, eventually causing it to malfunction,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.130
coming alive all on its own, further terrifying
crew members.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.970
In an effort to ease tension on set during
the T-Rex’s scenes, director Steven Spielberg

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.560
would give his best dinosaur roar into his
megaphone, keeping the cast and crew too busy

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.670
laughing to be worried.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.670
The Shining

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.560
The Shining is famous for its slow, building
tension and suspense, taking a turn when Jack

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.100
Torrance spirals into madness after months
holed up with his family at The Overlook Hotel.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.990
Discovering his wife and son have barricaded
themselves in the bathroom, Jack tears down

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.110
the door between them in one of the film’s
most iconic scenes.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.021
Tensions were high on set, with Jack Nicholson
and co-star Shelly Duvall at the mercy of

00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:57.200
the unpredictable director, Stanley Kubrick.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.650
Nicholson, an ex-volunteer firefighter, was
so efficient at breaking down the doors, the

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.659
props department was forced to build thicker
ones.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.500
Add Kubrick’s love of retakes, and a total
of sixty doors were destroyed.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.500
Jaws

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.370
One of the scariest films ever made, Steven
Spielberg’s Jaws terrified audiences when

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.709
it was released in 1975.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.590
A giant shark terrorizing Amity Island was
a nightmare on and off-screen, going far beyond

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.810
its schedule and budget.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.299
The biggest problem: three animatronic sharks
named Bruce.

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.470
Despite being designed by some of the best
in the business, the sharks often sank, required

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.760
nightly repainting, and their internal mechanisms
needed weekly replacement thanks to the saltwater.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.299
It wasn’t all bad, since the delays forced
Spielberg to get creative.

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.430
The shots from the shark’s point of view
were the solution, but ended up so integral

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.280
to the suspense it’s hard to imagine what
kind of movie Jaws would have been if everything

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.010
went smoothly.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.309
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:47.499
George Miller is the definition of a hands-on
director.

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:52.620
So when it came time to make his vision for
a modern Mad Max a reality, he was glad his

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.209
150-person stunt team felt the same way.

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.400
Fury Road was years in the making, but the
constant delays were a blessing in disguise

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.329
for stunt co- ordinator Guy Norris.

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:05.170
With so much time to prepare, the team figured
out how to execute the stunts safely and flawlessly.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.200
Never one to cut corners, Miller also had
the safety team for the Olympic Opening Ceremony

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.689
on hand, erasing enough danger to let the
actual actors perform some of their own stunts.

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.469
While the entire end chase is is visually
stunning, it’s the “polecats” who stand

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.609
out, swinging like pendulums and plucking
victims out of their seats.

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.989
It’s not CGI trickery either: the Polecat
team trained for 8 weeks with former members

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.370
of Cirque du Soleil, becoming experts by the
time the cameras started rolling.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.389
Apocalypse Now

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.779
Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam epic is considered
one of the greatest films ever made, but it

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:35.779
didn’t come easy.

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:39.279
The production ran into too many problems
to count, but Martin Sheen being struck with

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.480
a heart attack from the grueling schedule
was easily the worst.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.349
The director kept it quiet, and flew Sheen’s
brother to the set to act as his stand-in

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.510
until the star could recover.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.439
To see the toll it took, audiences just have
to watch the opening scene, where Martin Sheen

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.799
isn’t acting – he really was drunk, really
did slice his hand open on a broken mirror,

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.150
and really did collapse in tears, later attacking
the director off camera.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.029
A Nightmare on Elm Street

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:06.400
There are plenty of reasons to stay alert
in the tub, and this scene reminds us of two:

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.709
drowning, and Freddy Krueger.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.549
The movie has too many gruesome scenes to
count, thanks to writer and director Wes Craven.

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.180
One of the most unforgettable kills comes
when a young girl falls asleep in the bath

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.699
and is pulled underwater by a clawed hand
from below, with the audience watching her

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.220
grasp for something solid.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.949
The creepy stunt was pulled off by placing
a bottomless bath tub over a swimming pool,

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.509
and then building the set around it.

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.259
Luckily for the actress, her stuntwoman was
called in to do the really scary stuff, giving

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.400
her one less thing to have nightmares about
after seeing the finished movie.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400
Superman Returns

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.210
You can’t have a Superman story without
a trip to Smallville Kansas, but when the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.720
movie was set to be filmed in Australia, director
Bryan Singer was faced with a serious problem.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.780
To show the Kent farm with a full field of
corn as a young Clark learned his superpowers,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.949
the filmmakers had to build one from scratch.

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.259
That meant building a road in the middle of
nowhere, and planting and growing an entire

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.400
field of corn for four months before shooting
could start.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.150
Since most of the footage using the setting
was cut from the movie, only one sequence

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.150
remains.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.370
Probably not the best use of the film’s
budget.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.370
Alien

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.170
No fan of science fiction will ever forget
watching as the cast of Alien first stumbled

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.620
their way onto the dark, deserted spaceship
that started all the madness.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.889
The remains of the fan-titled Space Jockey
steal the show, but to make sure that the

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.090
corpse carried enough weight on film, director
Ridley Scott replaced the actors with children

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.320
for the longer shots – specifically, his
and cinematographer Derek Vanlint’s kids.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.900
Their faces are hidden, but the movements
are clearly those of younger astronauts.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.840
In fact, it was only when the kids began passing
out from the overheating spacesuits that the

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.520
director decided to make them a bit more comfortable
– something his adult cast members had been

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.210
demanding since the start of the film.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.319
The Exorcist

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:42.550
Sometimes even a great scene can end up on
the cutting-room floor, and that’s exactly

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.319
what happened in The Exorcist.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.520
After a young girl is possessed, her mother
enlists two priests to perform an exorcism,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.090
with problematic results.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.650
The possessed girl can rotate her head a full
360 degrees, but her best trick was only revealed

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.539
to audiences when the film was re-released
in 2000 for its 25th anniversary.

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.699
The scene shows Regan arched backward and
skittering down a flight of stairs, a technique

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.130
referred to as “spider-walking.”

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.530
The stunt was performed by contortionist Linda
R. Hager, who was clipped into a harness suspended

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.580
by wires and lowered down the stairs.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.469
The wires were too hard to remove in post-production,
so the scene was cut from the original release.

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.889
After being cleaned up with some modern day
CGI, fans finally got to see the scene as

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.819
it was intended.

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:22.330
