00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.802
- I wanted to find out who I am.

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:08.107
- I wanted to know
what makes me, me.

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:09.776
(inspirational piano music)

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.945
- And that's why I
used InThoseGenes
to get my pie chart,

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:15.949
to find out exactly who I am.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.185
- The most surprising
result is that I'm 23%

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.987 align:start position:0%
dumb ass who stands immediately
when the plane lands,

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:25.158
knowing damn well I
ain't going no where.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.960
- I'm 1/3 people
pleaser, 1/3 loud

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.297 align:start size:81% position:19%
mouth breather,
and 1/3 a** eater.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.499 align:start position:0%
Honestly, I thought that
percentage would be much higher

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.602 align:start size:84% position:16%
because I love
chewing on that booty.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:38.872
- I am so excited
to find out that I

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:43.142 align:start size:84% position:16%
am 52% woman who
loudly and confidently

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:45.278
pronounces the L in salmon.

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:46.512
What can I say?

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:48.180
I walk the walk and
I talk the talk.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.816
Why would the L even be there?

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.785 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I used to wonder why my
wife and girlfriend hated me.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:56.288 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now I know it's because
I'm 98% not shit,

00:00:56.288 --> 00:00:59.058
ain't never been shit,
and will never be shit.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.459
The other 2%?

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:01.528
Man of God.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.564 align:start size:84% position:16%
- When I found
myself in the trunk

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.333 align:start size:97% position:3%
of Diane Keaton's car on
Christmas Eve, high as a kite,

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.303 align:start size:94% position:6%
that bitch get turnt,
she stabbed three people.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:11.704
My results? Oh yeah.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.707 align:start size:81% position:19%
This says I'm 117%
person who has

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:19.145
a short attention span due to
the consumption of hard drugs.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:20.814
(gasps) Oh, my god.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.014
That's a chart.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:25.184
- I'm 50% person who
says ax instead of ask.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:27.487
Must be my Black
part, I'm biracial.

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.023
And I'm 50% racist,
which is why I made

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:32.692
that joke about Black people.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.527
Must be my white half.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.029
Can I call the cops on
these results (chuckles)?

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:39.565
I'm only joking, partially.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.900
- Walk, calm, lip balm.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.169
- I'm eating some butt tonight.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.104
- I feel a breeze,
is that a ghost?

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:47.106
- [Narrator] And for
an additional $9.99,

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.008
you can trace your
actual genealogy

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.277 align:start size:81% position:19%
and find out where
you came from.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.545
- This is a little heavy.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:00.286
(chains rattling)

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.087
Are you for real?

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:04.290
Why do Black folks do this?

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:07.026
(chains rattling)

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:07.861
Who did this?

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:10.763 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Narrator] InThoseGenes
takes the mystery

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.598
out of what makes us this way,

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:14.533
by using our unique
DNA fingerprints

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:16.302
to answer the age-old question,

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.606
who am I, who are
you, who are we?

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.241
(chains rattling)

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.710
(overlapping angry chatter)

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.644
- Do you guys have a--

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:26.912
- Wait why does she have a whip?

00:02:26.912 --> 00:02:29.081
- Oh it's because I'm biracial.

00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:30.750
This is highly problematic but

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.152
contextually, very accurate.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:36.322
