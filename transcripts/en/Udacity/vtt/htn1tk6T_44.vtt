00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.950
In a subscription model the customer
pays your required price

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.980
to have access to the product.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.480
Subscription provides
an excellent opportunity

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.950
to create continued revenue streams

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.330
which is wonderful because the lifetime
value of our users will be higher.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.590
&gt;&gt; And when users purchase
subscriptions in your Android Apps,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.060
Google Play handles all
the check-out details for you.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.620
If you have an iOS App,
the Apple store also does the same.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.320
In other words,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.250
you don't have to directly process
any financial transactions.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.200
This insures a consistent and
familiar purchase flow and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.681
improves user experience.

00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:36.690
It also causes you a lot less headache.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.990
&gt;&gt; Some tips for using this model.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.890
It is recommended to use
a free trial subscription

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.830
to allow users to explore
the app first and see the value.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.960
You could set a time limit or
any other limit that fit your scenario.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.270
For example, Dropbox will limit the
space you could use on their free tier.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.880
Due to some direct
carrier billing limits,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.500
we also recommend monthly subscription.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.570
Annual subscription may exceed limits,
causing the purchase to be blocked.
