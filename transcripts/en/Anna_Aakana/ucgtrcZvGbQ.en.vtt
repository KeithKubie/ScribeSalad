00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.820
So recently, I was agonizing over a crush.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.360
He hasn't texted me in a week,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.740
but his Venmo transaction history seems to indicate

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.640
that he's really busy eating pizza with his friends.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.580
And a friend of mine who clearly took pity

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.700
on the pathetic rationalizations she was witnessing

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.060
sat me down and said, "You know, my mom

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.880
had the best piece of dating advice about how

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.360
to tell if someone likes you or not.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.860
Yeah? Is it in his Venmo transaction history?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.900
No.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.800
How often he initiates texts? I made a chart

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.460
No. If they like you, you'll know

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.920
and if they don't,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.400
you'll be confused.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.640
What?!

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.940
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.880
There you have it!

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.850
It's that easy. That's how easy it is.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.627
I don't need to give you a three minute video for this shit.

00:00:41.627 --> 00:00:45.300
The average person opens Instagram 150 times a day,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.980
so guess what? Even though we like to tell ourselves that

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.880
they're busy, or

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.820
they're shy, or

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.780
they're intimidated.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.700
Nope!

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.140
Stop making excuses.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.800
It's simple, really it's simple.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.426
If you're upfront with your interest and who you are

00:00:57.426 --> 00:00:59.080
and they aren't reciprocating,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.800
they are not your person!

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.900
Move on.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.160
There's a billion other fish in the sea,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.540
but there's also a lot of trash.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.240
Oh, there's a lot of trash,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.400
and you're going to be out there cleaning up the beach

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.900
looking for one solid shiny fish to bring home,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.300
but you're wading through water bottles and plastic bags and mixed signals.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.000
So if you're not getting a green light,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.820
go!

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.000
Go off!

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.180
Like I am now.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.920
Also, I'm doing my first headline show on July 24th

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.220
at the Moroccan lounge in downtown LA.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.020

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.180
as well as a VIP upgrade package

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.200
that comes with a meet-and-greet, early show and sound check access,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.440
and a merch item.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.560

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.980
