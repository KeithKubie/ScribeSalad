Speaker 1:          00:00          My kids always make fun of me because I'm bald. So my whole head is covered with sweat and they come over my head like it's so gross. And then how old are your kids? The youngest ones are eight and 10. And you have, you have, uh, how many? Three. I have three daughters, all daughters, 22 year old, a 10 year old and an eight year old. Live longer with daughters. If you, if you, if you plot, uh, Dad's survival on the y axis and fraction of female children on the x axis. A survival is slightly longer for men who have higher fraction of daughters because boys drive you to your fucking grave cause they're so goddamn crazy. There's lots of theories as to why it happens. But I think, and that is in fact one of them, it's framed a bit more scientifically. Well my basic theory, my 10 year old is a maniac.

Speaker 1:          00:45          My 10 year old daughters. And I would just imagine if she was a boy, I'd be terrified that she knows just lighting things on fire. Blowing up buildings. Yes. Yeah. Boys are a problem. That can be, I mean, I think, yeah, I mean, I think, um, you know, I think it's, um, I think, um, the, the, well, I mean we could get onto the whole gender issue. I'm not sure we want to, but I think, um, boys are responsible. Let's talk about chimpanzees. It's easier. Okay. Male chimps do most of the violence. About 95% of the violence and murders are committed by male chimpanzees. And most of the victims are males. And, um, you know, I think it's, there's no doubt that, um, biology plays a very important role in male proclivity to violence, for example. Sure. So let's tear trouble. Yeah. So boys can be a problem that way.

Speaker 1:          01:36          And Yeah. And I think the many ways in which a society are of cultural traits that we invent, their purpose is to shape and guide those tendencies to violence, to kind of mitigate them. So we don't just need, again, going back to the books or observe, please do. We don't just need, uh, we don't just use culture for that purpose there. There's an argument in the book that we humans have, have domesticated ourselves. So if you look at, if you compare a dogs to wolves and domesticated cats to wild cats from which they descended, or a Guinea pigs to the wild Guinea pigs from which they descended or, or horses to, uh, to the wild horses to which they send, if you, again and again, you compare these couplets, these pears, you find that the domesticated version of these animals that are much more placid, much more peaceful, they also tend to have floppy ears.

Speaker 1:          02:30          They have piebald for, so Guinea pigs and dogs and cows all have splotchy black, white, and Brown for why is that? The animals from which they evolved didn't have those, the kind of splotchiness. So, uh, and they become much more peaceful if you compare human beings and, but they had a, uh, the, those animals were domesticated by humans. Like I deliberately allowed the reproduction of this member of the litter and not that member because this member was, was, was nicer. And so across time we evolve a more a domesticated version of the ancestral species. So we get, you know, we get my miniature Dachsund from a wolf, like the wound, like the kind of things that were photographed out in your studio here. Crazy transition. Uh, now if you look at humans and you compare us to, uh, to the [inaudible], to our ancestors or to other primates for all the world, it looks like we have been domesticated, we are more peaceful and placid.

Speaker 1:          03:30          We have sex outside, non reproductive sex is and other things. So these domesticated animals, we'll have sex, uh, even when it's not time to reproduce. Uh, we, uh, we, um, uh, we, our tails, we don't have tails anymore, but our tails gets shortened or all these features that we have, these, these behavioral qualities and these physical properties that we have are, are we get a feminization of our faces. Our jaws become smaller. Like if you look at, you compare these domesticated animals to their non domesticated ancestors, the domestic version or less violence. So we lose a lot of the traits that physical and, and, uh, um, psychological traits associated with violence. But there was no one that domesticated us. So the theory is, the question is how, how did that happen? And one of the theories that's discussed in, in, uh, in blueprint and that's advanced by other scientists, this is not my work, is that we self domesticated.

Speaker 1:          04:26          And that what happened over the centuries, over the millennia, over millions of years, is that weaker individuals into our groups. When one individual became too autocratic and too violent and too powerful, they banded together and kill that guy. And so over time we were killing the more violent members of our species, weeding out those people, and therefore the gene pool changed across time. And we self domesticated. We are more peaceful today than we would have been because we domesticated ourselves. And this is one of the arguments that's also made to help explain the origins of goodness, actually in the origins of cooperation. Because that would take a few good people to kill the bad person that's running everything that's evil. Correct. That's exactly right. Recreational sex does occur in Bonobos, which is really weird, isn't it? Yeah. They're so similar to regular chimps. Yes, but they're not the same species.

Speaker 1:          05:25          They also have homosexual sex. Uh, they use sex to make up, you know, so, uh, it's, yeah, they're very licentious a species. That's exactly right. And, and, and, and Bonobos are felt to be a self domesticated chimpanzee. So the similar, so bonobos are to chimps as uh, as let's say dogs are to wolves and, but there was the dogs. We domesticated the Banabos self domesticated is the theory. Do they know why or how? Well, the theory is that they did it. Like we were saying by weeding out the more of aggressive members it was, what we know must have happened is that the nicer guys must've been able to have more offspring. So the gene pool changed over time because of the differential success of the, of the, of the nicer guys. Now people have looked at this even in human societies, they've looked, for instance, there's a study I talk about in the book of different pathways to reproductive success amongst that Sumani which is a group in Amazonia and other societies are similar.

Speaker 1:          06:26          So you can either be like big and strong or you can be charismatic and have useful knowledge. And both ways. You have more children. Mm. Um, so there are these competing ways, uh, in our species of enhancing your reproductive fitness. Are you aware of support [inaudible] work with baboons? [inaudible] that's a fascinating case, right? Because they were studying baboons in Africa. They would eat from human garbage and a bunch of them got sick and died. And it turns out that the most violent and ruthless of them got sick and died. And it changed the entire culture of the baboons tribe. I don't know that story. That's an interesting one. Let's start grooming each other and being kind to each other. Oh my God. Yeah. That's a good example. But there was an alleged dental, it was an accident, an accident, and that it lasted for generations. Yes.

Speaker 1:          07:18          And when he returned to study them, he found that they were still this different, kind of talked about this a little bit. Yeah, I'm doing a shitty job. I'm sure I'm explaining it, but I'm, I'm, no, I think you'll have the books fascinate. Yeah. Work. Yes. He's very impressive. And a, I know the, I, I'm, uh, now that you're reminding me, I'm a little familiar with that particular study. I didn't know that it started with garbage, however, that at coincidentally, x extermination of the more violent members of the troop. Yes. Yeah. So they were removed from the gene pool and it changed the entire culture to the point where generations later they were still using this more peaceful ways. Full. Yeah. Yeah. More kind. Well, it didn't just change the culture. It may have changed the culture, but it appears were arguing the two of changing gene pool, second evolutionary pressure that's been applied. So you have, you know, big dogs and small dogs. You don't allow the big ones to reproduce. You just reproduced the small ones. You get small dogs in the end.
