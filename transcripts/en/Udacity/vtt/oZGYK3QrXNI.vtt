00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.710
One issue with programming at this higher

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.490
level of abstraction is that an operator might

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.730
write multiple modules, each of which effects

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.340
the same traffic. For example, an operator might

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.490
write an application that monitors traffic. Another

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.280
one that specifies how routing should take place,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.200
another that involves the specification of firewall

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.960
rules And yet another that balances traffic load

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.270
across the links in the network. Ultimately,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.049
all of these applications, or modules, must

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.930
be combined into a single set of

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.220
open flow rules that together achieve the network

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.320
operator's overall goal. For this, we need

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.870
composition operators, or ways that specify How these

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.150
individual modules should be combined or composed

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.030
into a single coherent application. Let's now talk

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.050
about two different ways to compose policies.
