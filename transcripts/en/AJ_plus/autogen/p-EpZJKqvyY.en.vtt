00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.460
 happen 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.109
 and we are in the people 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.109
 We do not accept material 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.859
 one 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.750
 we see let the school take well my 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.450
 name is teresa guaita 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.030
 I am one of the fighting cholitas 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.100
 a woman of polis eresma cholita that 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.170
 takes the pollera the centers the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:55.110
 oil and braids practically 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.110
 and the hat do not forget the hat 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.510
 for cholitas life has not always 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.520
 been easy 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.520
 before we were discriminated 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.170
 this chola told him in this chola 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.030
 you do not see 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.980
 and that's why it happened to my mom I 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.490
 as a child I've heard that 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.830
 they said and treated him not only line 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.220
 even the mobility did not let him 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.220
 go up 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.200
 are the taxis pick us up the woman from 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.200
 pollera 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.490
 I do not know why I do not understand so far 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.490
 because there is that discrimination 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.450
 we are all equal we all have a 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.860
 like a nose an eye we eat we live what 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.420
 same 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.420
 we are all the same 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.920
 as cholita for me it is very important 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.640
 wrestling has improved the situation 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.110
 thanks to wrestling not 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.000
 I trained ten years ago but that's how 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.480
 professionally five years ago 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.480
 from the ring 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.830
 how he hurts himself over the ring 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.500
 there are some times that hurt me 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.849
 There are some times I hurt my knee 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.849
 many times I broke my head 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.000
 people from all countries have the see 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.000
 exclusively to worley chops 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.220
 when they are in the fight says not the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.970
 fight of cholitas we want to see fight 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.970
 solo 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.820
 and that's why I have a lot 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.820
 pride the pollera 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:19.330
 when I'm in the ring I feel 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:22.380
 excited and happy I forget then 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.380
 change my character 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.389
 ah 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:30.689
 I'm proud to be a soloist 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.689
 fighter 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.669
 I imagine that future Bolivia 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.080
 there is an equality there are no opportunities 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.080
 of work so that 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.870
 has changed since 2005 thanks to 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.550
 our indigenous president that we have 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:09.000
 Evo Morales 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.250
 as he did it he took off often he was 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.800
 He treated the woman in a bad way but 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.200
 today thanks to him little by little 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.040
 was changing that from the 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.040
 discrimination 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.159
 in the face of discrimination I decree not to 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.900
 them there may even be a process that 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:28.639
 can follow them and put them in jail 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.560
 and nine of those who say let's say is 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:35.260
 we are alone 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.260
 Juan would be 24 26 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.060
 nowadays we are taken into account in everything 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.060
 side 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:59.180
 we can see chops in parliament myself 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.180
 single senators 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:07.200
 there is still a lot of economy left 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:10.340
 a lot of work but at least light with 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.340
 my clothes with a lot of pride 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:25.150
 two 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:29.470
 I go to the doctor when he feels 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:32.319
 better nutrition sleep for my daughters 

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.840
 when they are big that help their 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:38.510
 neighbor 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.510
 that do not discriminate against people 

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:46.789
 if I'm worried, I worry a lot 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:55.090
 but I know that someday they are going to 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.090
 get everything to be happy 

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:07.710
 ah
