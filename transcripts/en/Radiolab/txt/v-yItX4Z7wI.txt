Speaker 1:          00:00          Hello, I'm Jan [inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. Our topic today, parasites. Parasites. No, we've met them. They were nice and we've met them when they're not so nice. I don't know that we've met any nice ones really or we haven't. I thought I thought that [inaudible] Nice. Yeah, they were nice. So, and now the question is, let's just talk about scale. I mean for the most part they're irritating and Ludo and they seem kind of invisible, visible and sort of offstage. But when you back off a little bit and consider them, you know, in the effects that they have on the world, there are actually these powerful sculptors of monumental narrative. There was, these are little guys telling very big stories. And Zach, here's an example. Recently I went to visit a guy named Dickson Despommier, but Columbia University, he's eight. There's intelligence and well, there's a bunch of different things we ended up talking about. Um, well he told me this crazy story. The story I love telling the most. Oh, and before we start, I just want to say one thing. The following. Two stories contain moments that are a little bit gross. Just want to make sure you've been warned.

Speaker 2:          01:08          The story I love telling the most is how we eradicated hookworm.

Speaker 1:          01:13          The story begins in 1908 John D Rockefeller, Sr really rich guy's sitting in his New York office and he's thinking, how can I make more money selling something to the south? Yeah, I've got all this money. You've got all these resources. I just need a new market. In terms of new markets, the south was pretty much untapped if only those damn southerners were just get off their butts and get going. Problem was, they weren't, they weren't getting off there.

Speaker 2:          01:39          The forms were not operational. The economic engine was turned off. The economy was in the toilet. And so John D Rockefeller wanted to know why, why aren't they producing more? Yep. What's happened to their economic engine? So he thought, I know all form of commission. So he said that a bunch of economists and sociologists and people like that on the original Rockefeller Commission, they did everything a commission could possibly do to try to find out why these southern gentlemen were not rising to the occasion and they came back with the following conclusion. Well, we don't exactly know what's wrong, but we think that these people are sick from something cause they don't. They don't behave like we do. What does that mean? They are slow? Not Mentally. They're slow. Physically. They're Pale. I'll give you an example. You remember the movie deliverance short. Okay. Remember that little guy that played the Banjo? I remember the other scene that we all know we're not, but if you can recall what that little bed Joe player looked like,

Speaker 1:          02:44          why are we looking guy? But he looked old, sickly pear, simply pale and yet an adult. Well that is not a description of all southerners. No description of in one teeny corner in a no. But what the commission did say about a lot of the southern people that encountered is that a lot of them, they just don't look right. They look weak. They look when they looked kind of La man won one, they one hale, lethargic. It's interesting way in or one one future. So the thought was that maybe these southerners had some kind of laziness disease. This is really what a lot of folks thought. The one member on the committee suggested a Rockefeller like, you know what? Perhaps these people are anemic, anemic

Speaker 2:          03:23          there. They're anemic. Do you say, yeah, they're anemic. It sounds like a medical problem. Then maybe they're not lazy after all. Maybe they're anemic and maybe they're just waiting.

Speaker 1:          03:33          Okay, next thing you know, Rockefeller puts together another commission, this one with doctors and he sends them back

Speaker 2:          03:37          down to the south to find out what the basis for the anemia was. And not only did they find anemia, but they found a correlation of the anemia was soil types. That's bizarre. Sandy loamy soils, anemia, hardpack clay soils. Hm. No anemia. Sandy loamy swells, good farmland, hardpack clay soils, not such good farmland. So all the rich farmers were anemic and all the poor farmers were doing okay.

Speaker 1:          04:03          And this seemed to be a clue. The incidence of anemia was linked somehow to the soil. Maybe bump a bum. Yeah. Something was in the soil.

Speaker 2:          04:12          That's correct. So somehow they hit upon this idea of looking for hookworm.

Speaker 3:          04:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:19          the hook. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa.

Speaker 3:          04:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:24          all right, let's run some tests. And when they did, big time, they discovered hookworm big time. Okay.

Speaker 3:          04:32          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:32          So the anemia is due to hook hookworm

Speaker 3:          04:35          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          04:35          Now the question became, how are these southerners getting the hookworm and giving it to one another and a pretty good place to start to look for an answer. Was there a feces because of these silkworms or in you? They're going to come out at you when you go to the bathroom. So they asked these southerners, when you guys [inaudible] where do you do it?

Speaker 2:          04:54          Most of them said something like this. I came over there. You see a tree over there? That's right. Deprecate. So I deprecate over there, but I live over here.

Speaker 1:          05:02          Okay, so then the investigators ask the next question. When you go to that tree and do it, do you, do you wear any shoes? Most of them said no. Barefoot. Just like everybody else because it's comfortable. So clearly these worms are in the feces that are landing near the tree that are somehow getting into people's feet the next time they come to use the tree. But no one intentionally steps in their own, you know, no one does that, which meant,

Speaker 2:          05:30          oh my goodness. Oh my goodness, it can crawl, right? So let's find out how far it can crawl. So what they did these researchers is they built a sandbox and then they took some hookworm infested stool and put it right in the middle. Then every day we'll sample from the stool sample out in the sand in all directions, and find larvae and find out how far that can travel. How's that sound? So now we have larvae in the stool and they began to crawl away from the stool seeking a victim. On Day one, they crawled an entire foot in all directions, but they weren't a two feet. On Day two, my God, they're at two feet. At Day three, they're in three feet. I can't believe it was the crawling on a long way. Day Four, they crawl to four feet. What about day five? No, I'm allowed to ask that. And what about day five? Five feet? No, no. Four feet. That's it. So after four feet, they're what? Exhausted. One would assume on day six there were still at four feet. And on day seven they were dead.

Speaker 1:          06:42          Yay. Yay.

Speaker 2:          06:48          So how in the world could you deal with this problem when these worms can crawl? They can crawl four feet. It doesn't matter where your difficult, they're going to crawl away from that. And within a four foot radius of that stool sample, you're going to get hookworm unless you do something radical that's never been done before. They devised a scheme for burying the stool sample into the ground six feet deep

Speaker 1:          07:19          because the worms can only make it four feet. Well then that's two feet past the point where they die. We call that the,

Speaker 2:          07:29          so the outhouse was invented by exploring the lifecycle of hookworm and in fact, Rockefeller got his wish the south did rise again.

Speaker 1:          07:40          That sounds too easy to me though. You're telling me that, that uh, an understanding of hookworm which created the outhouse. We removed the quote southern laziness disease and they did rise with the, and you, you bring that all back to the hookworm? I do. Really, no, I believe bring it back to sanitation. Yeah, it'd be fair. You can find plenty of other reasons why the south rose again. Air Conditioning and highways and university, right, and stuff like that. So though chrome had some help, but what is clear is that when we as a country began to distance ourselves from our own excrement, to put it bluntly, when we stop walking around in our own, there were all of these unintended concepts.

Speaker 4:          08:15          Salmonella disappeared is the Luda disappeared. Shigella disappeared. Colorado disappeared. GRD had disappeared. Cryptosporidium anything that's associated with parasites in feces disappeared. Every time we build out houses and people use them religiously, guess what? Their kids can stay in school. They could learn more. They got ahead.

Speaker 5:          08:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:02          Dixon, his mom. Yeah. He is a professor of public health in Environmental Health Sciences and Microbiology at Columbia University. Can they make longer titles at the university?

Speaker 6:          09:12          Literally wrote the book on parasites. The book is called Parasitic Diseases. You know it very well. It's assumed to be a major motion picture. Now it's fourth edition in its fourth edition. And while we're on the subject of hookworms and the glorious campaign to Deworm America, because this has been a very carefully crafted and intentionally fair program, you have heard the case against hookworms. Now let's turn the coin and say something nice about hookworms. And to begin that discussion, let's go to our reporter Patrick Walters. Okay, so pat, are you there? Are you there? Yeah, I'm here, Robert. So tell us a little bit about this fellow. What's his name exactly? His name is Jasper Lawrence, right? Jasper Lawrence. So where is he from? He actually grew up in England and he grew up in this little farm in the southwest corner of England. Sorry. It's important to know, I think before hearing any part of his story that Jasper has had allergies for pretty much his whole life

Speaker 7:          10:06          on really bad days. My eyes would swell up so much from Poland or airborne allergens that they would feel like they were swelling shut. I could feel my eyes squeaking in my sockets. It was an enormously uncomfortable feeling,

Speaker 6:          10:21          but it was nothing debilitating. They were just allergies. So, you know, he's just like, like most other people have allergies. Just learn to deal with it, you know, you live with it. But

Speaker 7:          10:28          what changed for me in my late twenties, early thirties, was my asthma. And in that time I was living in Santa Cruz. I was relatively recently married. We had three cats, um, that had been grandfathered in with the relationship. And I started landscaping business. I really didn't want to work for [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          10:45          someone else pick someone with allergies, starting a landscaping business that seems kind of unexpected, unexpected, stupid is actually the word for it.

Speaker 7:          10:54          And uh, within six months or a year, he starts to notice this really weird barking cough. Was there anything particular that brought this on? Like, no, it would, it was just sitting and breathing. Cat certainly didn't help. Right. And uh, during that period, my asthma got much worse. Very, very quickly. By the time it was 1996, 1997, I was seeing specialists having skin allergen tests and cycling through emergency inhalers, trying Singulair and all these other drugs that were coming on the market. I was being hospitalized, um, at least a couple of times a year. I mean, I, I looked terrible. I had dark eyes and Pale, waxy skin. I had that allergic look. It was a really bad time and

Speaker 6:          11:40          he decides in that summer of 2004 to take a vacation, he made this visit to England.

Speaker 7:          11:46          Yeah. I took my two daughters back to see my aunt who had raised me very early in the visit. I was sitting at her table and she asked me if I'd seen a BBC documentary about parasites and their connection with things like asthma and allergies and multiple sclerosis. And of course I hadn't, but I went upstairs and got on the Internet after lunch and I've stayed on the Internet until perhaps two in the morning.

Speaker 3:          12:14          I was reading and reading and the work of all these researchers have been steady after the neck, Japan and epidemiological studies. And African animal models and multiple sclerosis, this enormous weight of evidence that in the developing world, people don't really have asthma or allergies. And what he discovers is that behind all of this too, his shock is,

Speaker 6:          12:43          oh, hookworms hookworm yeah,

Speaker 7:          12:46          yeah. I learned that asthma was 50% less likely in someone who had a hookworm infections. So this sort of just like hits you. Oh yeah. What'd you think when you, when you read that? Oh, I immediately was determined to clean hookworm immediately. I couldn't wait.

Speaker 6:          13:03          So hookworms are these very tiny worms, the size of a little hair. But if you take a microscope and use zoom way in, I have this big circular mouth brimming full of pointy teeth. Very scary to look at. They have these toothy mouths so that they can burrow up through your feet, Grad through your blood, and eventually end up down in your gut and start chewing on the inside of your intestines.

Speaker 7:          13:33          This guy wants aquariums in his intestines. Absolutely. And so you, did you just Google it? Yeah. Hook Hook Worms for sale. I mean, you know, someone's gotta be selling them, but not, nothing. I contacted every laboratory supply company in the world and parasitology research centers and they all said the same thing. No various flavors of no. And so I came to the conclusion that I was going to have to go to the tropics.

Speaker 6:          13:58          So fast forward, a little jasper is in Cameroon along the coast, quite literally and figuratively. The armpit of Africa is 200 miles north of the equator. It's extremely hot. You find a guy to drive him around and so he and his driver would go to a village. You get out of the car, walk up to these villagers and ask them if they could see the latrine.

Speaker 7:          14:22          Just an open area of ground, usually with bushes so people can have a little bit of privacy. And I would go over to the area, remove my shoes and start walking. The first time I did that, I uh, I almost couldn't do it. It was, it must've been 110 degrees that day. 100% humidity and the stench and the noise from the insects, it was so repulsive and so disgusting.

Speaker 6:          15:02          How many villages of the trains do you think you've visited? Between 30 and 40

Speaker 3:          15:07          okay.

Speaker 6:          15:09          Jasper spent two weeks there walking around in the village latrines and then he flew home. Hm.

Speaker 7:          15:17          Yeah. I got back from Africa in early February, so I was looking at allergy season coming up and the day I realized that I no longer had allergies. I was such a good day. I got into my car and I started driving and I had the window down and I felt the breeze blowing across my face in the past. What that meant was that very quickly my eyes would be itching uncontrollably, snot and s phlegm was going to be pouring out of every orifice in my face and it didn't happen. It didn't happen. I just started screaming in the car. I was so, so happy and I didn't have an, I had an asthma attack since I went to Africa. I no longer have allergies. The vast majority of the benefits that I've experienced has come from hookworm. Yep.

Speaker 6:          16:19          What, what is the hookworm doing? Do you know? Also the immune system that we learned about in elementary school is all about like these attacks cells, they go after foreign invaders and destroy them, right? And that's a big important part of the immune system. But if the immune system were allowed to attack and destroy things unchecked, it could kill you. And there are lots of diseases where the primary symptoms are caused by the immune system attacking the body that it's really designed to protect. Allergies and asthma are just two of these. Some of the more serious ones are like type one diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease in which the immune system actually starts attacking the inside of the intestines. They are like 80 FTSE disease, 80 of them. And so what scientists have found in lots and lots of mouse studies and in some human studies to this point too, is that once the hookworms get inside the gut and the immune system actually starts attacking, somehow hook rooms actually stimulate the cells, which just quiet things down,

Speaker 3:          17:21          nobody

Speaker 6:          17:22          and tell the attack cells to stop attacking.

Speaker 3:          17:27          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          17:27          so these are like lullaby sells Jackley what? Lots and lots of scientists think Joel Weinstein stock, Tufts Medical Center and dozens of others is that over thousands and thousands of years hookworms almost developed in tandem with the human immune system coevolution parasites living within your body, your immune system changes. He got to a point where the hookworms could survive safely. Worm gets a home is food coming down the food pipe and in return the human immune system gained some kind of some form of positive regulatory advantage

Speaker 3:          18:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          18:08          so that if you had this glitch where your immune systems started attacking your own body, the presence of the hookworms would keep things controlled. That's the gift. You do something for the worm, the worm does something for you. So then by that logic, what we in the West and the richer countries have done stupidly as we have cleaned ourselves up too much and we don't have enough worm easy on us. Yeah. This is called, they called the hygiene hypothesis, the hygiene IP that we're not dirty enough to clean.

Speaker 7:          18:40          We function like rainforests where ecosystems and we've entirely eliminated a class of organism that coevolved with us and or genetic predecessors for millions of years.

Speaker 6:          18:51          Now, I don't want to leave the impression that hygiene is bad for you. People can't go back to living in filth, kids playing and sewage by the river bank. But in improving our hygiene, we are also excluding organisms that may be important for making a swell. So then what does Jasper do about all this? He decides to start a business selling hookworm to people. What you can call him up and he will literally FedEx a dose of hookworms to your door. How I break in for a second. Fat I jad where does he get the hook and from, this is weird. Jasper gets the hookworm from himself. Could you describe how you go about getting hookworm from, uh, your stool into, uh, one of your patients?

Speaker 7:          19:41          Well, it's a very easy organism to work with. It, it just, it gets up when it walks out of it. So it doesn't take an enormous amount of work to separate it from the feces. And then I haven't done that. I repeatedly wash them in solutions of antibiotics to make sure that anything that could live on them is killed. People contact us, we'll have them complete a questionnaire, submit a recent blood tests, then we'll ship them a dose and all the materials and equipment and the instructions necessary to infect themselves. Two ways. Is this the same

Speaker 6:          20:08          freeing to do Jasper? Yes. Jasper has done tons and tons of research, but he's not a doctor. The treatment is not approved by the FDA. And I wonder is there any serious sort of double blind study trying to figure out whether some safe delivery of hookworm might make sense? Yes. And so one of the guys who was sort of a pioneer in this hookworm research is David Pritchard. I'm professor David Preciado immunologist and Paris fetologist up the University of Nottingham where I study parasites and the wound healing properties of maggots. So we've now got two safety trials under our belts, but we've yet to conduct the trials to show that therapeutic benefit results from infection with words. So Pritchard infected himself pretty much just to make sure that we're safe. What we did was 10 of us in the lab took worms at different doses. We were either given 10 25 50 or a hundred worms and then we have to report on the symptoms.

Speaker 6:          21:05          Along the back of that study, we determined the 10 wounds were tolerated by it. Richard, when he did this, proof of safety study actually gave himself 50 hookworms. Oh. Which put him out of commission for Awhile. I felt pretty bad. I mean pain in the gut really, you know, you can feel them cause they are biting on your tissues. I mean if you have too many hookworms they can cause things like diarrhea and the most serious side effect and the side effect that makes them a sort of a public health enemy is that they can give you an email

Speaker 5:          21:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          21:37          so if you have too many you, you lose quite a bit of blood to these parasites. Well, you know, if you take too many hookworm, which you're not gonna if you come to us, the worst thing you're going to get is anemia. But it's not like you wake up one morning and you're drained to blood.

Speaker 5:          21:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          21:50          very slow to develop and it's very easy to deal with. Jasper is kind of just gone for it, you know? It's a very sort of like cowboy move to the scientific community. I think they believe that I'm premature. It's not FDA approved and offering this to the public. You don't know what it is. You don't know its purity. It's not safe. But I've talked to several clients who had really severe allergies and asthma. They say they've just achieved these great results and Jesper also says he had seen success with that with a few multiple sclerosis patients and several crumbs. Do these patients too, like how many people do you think that you have infected? It's about 85 right now. How is business isn't everything that

Speaker 7:          22:28          businesses is adequate, but I honestly don't know why I don't wake up in the morning with my front garden 20 deep with people with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, allergies. I just don't know why I'm not completely buried the way he sees it. People are scared. Well, they're the people who are coming from a point of view of what I learned in kindergarten about clean drinking water and sewers to them. Worms and parasites are so repulsive that there's nothing good to be said about them, but I can make you better. It's simple. It's cheap. I mean, for God's sake, these organisms fall out my rear end every day a half a million at a time. The raw material is human excrement for God's sake.

Speaker 6:          23:11          No.

Speaker 7:          23:12          All people have to do is open their minds.

Speaker 6:          23:16          Are you really that scared of a little warm

Speaker 3:          23:30          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          23:31          thanks to reporter Pat Walters and to Jasper Lawrence and to the worms and to look. I'm, thank you. Hookworms thank you. Hope for more information about hookworms on our website, and that's the end of this section with clean up the address. radiolab.org yes. Slash no [inaudible] dot org.
