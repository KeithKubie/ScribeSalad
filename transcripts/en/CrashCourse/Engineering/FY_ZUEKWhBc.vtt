00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Engineers like making things better.

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:09.030
From mechanical parts to electronic circuitry:
if it can be improved, somewhere an engineer is
working on making it more useful to the world.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.760
Of course, the goal of all this is to make
our lives better.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.080
But there’s another way in which life, in
the sense of living organisms, can be tailored
to our benefit.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.840
At the boundaries of engineering and scientific
research, genetic engineers are working with
the very blueprints of life: DNA.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.400
By editing DNA and the genes contained within
it, the field of genetic engineering is allowing us to
change the nature of living beings.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.180
That can sound a little scary, and it’s
certainly not without its controversy.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:43.000
But done correctly, it could help us create more food,
design new materials, treat or cure diseases, and even
improve people’s lives before they’re born.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.380
[Theme Music]

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.380
The world of genetic engineering revolves around DNA:

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.370
a molecule found in nearly all the cells of
most living things, which governs how those
cells grow and function.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.140
At its simplest, it consists of two, long sugar
phosphate strands that spiral around one
another in the famous double helix formation.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.840
And it’s what links those two spirals together
that determines the genetic content of DNA.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.780
Four types of molecules, called bases, make up
the biological code that stores information on the
structure of cells and how they operate.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.220
The sequence of those bases makes up
the organism’s genes.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.620
And if the organism reproduces, it passes
on some or all of those genes.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.260
There’s a lot of cellular machinery that goes into
translating the code from DNA into the proteins that
carry out different functions within a living being.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.760
But as you probably know, the end result is that
different genes produce different characteristics
in different living things.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.860
Through millions of years of evolution and genetic
inheritance, differences in DNA are why a tiger has
stripes but a jaguar has spots,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.800
or why sunflowers and roses have
different types of petals.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.280
And humans have been tinkering with that
DNA for thousands of years – long before
we even knew it existed.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.499
The most widespread example is the food we
obtain from crops.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.100
People have selectively cultivated crops and
bred them to be bigger, yielding more food.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.020
That’s essentially the same as picking crops
with the right genes.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.940
We’ve also tried to make them more resilient
to problems like diseases or a lack of rainfall.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.280
As for animal DNA, we bred wolves into domesticated
dogs more than 10,000 years ago.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.380
So in some ways, genetic engineering has gone
on for millenia.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.760
But one of the pioneers of modern genetic
engineering was American geneticist Norman
Borlaug.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.160
In 1944, Borlaug was hired by the International
Maize and Wheat Improvement Center to, well,
improve maize and wheat.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.160
Wheat is the third most-consumed cereal crop
in the world, so improving its yield would have
a huge impact.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.260
Borlaug and his team tried some traditional
crop breeding techniques to make wheat more
resistant to diseases like stem rust,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.780
which is caused by a fungus that shrivels
the stems of plants and can even kill them.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.180
And to an extent, they were successful, but
the new disease-resistant wheat plants came
from wheat that had long, thin stems.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.440
The new crops inherited those traits, too,
which caused them to fall over,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.400
which interferes with their growth and can
reduce the final yields of the crops by up to 50%!

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.400
So, Borlaug and his colleagues used their
background in genetics

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.840
to cross-breed the new wheat with a shorter, Japanese
variety that was more resistant to falling over –

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.700
a trait that they successfully introduced into
the disease-resistant kind.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.020
Wheat that doesn’t fall over might not sound
like the most amazing of accomplishments.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.580
But Borlaug’s wheat was developed at just
the right time to prevent a catastrophic famine
from happening in India and Pakistan.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.360
In 1962, Borlaug and his fellow scientists introduced
their new wheat to those countries, doubling the crop
yields in the region over the next decade.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.360
The achievement became known as the “Green
Revolution.”

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.820
As a direct result of Borlaug’s work, it’s
estimated about 300 million people were
rescued from starvation,

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.340
and he was awarded the Nobel Peace
Prize for his work in 1970.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.460
So genetic engineering has already changed
the world for the better in significant ways.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.520
And today’s techniques give genetic engineers
an even more accurate and powerful toolkit for
tackling other challenges.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.680
In addition to addressing food shortages,
we could tweak the development of certain
plants for the production of biofuels,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.500
like ethanol derived from corn or
genetically engineered algae.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.720
In fact, algae can be engineered to produce
more than just fuel.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.120
If we can edit the right genes, we could create
large amounts of what are known as diatoms.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.180
Diatoms are special forms of algae with cell
walls made of silica.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.160
They’re literally living in glass houses!

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.640
That special property gives diatoms lots of
applications in nano-engineering.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:32.760
They can be arranged onto surfaces to
produce biosensors, used to detect explosives,
or sent to deliver drugs inside the body.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.240
Genetic engineering could help synthesize
and manipulate diatoms more efficiently.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:44.800
And the medical benefits aren’t limited to delivering
drugs – genetic engineering could also be used to
produce medications in the first place.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:53.220
Certain kinds of bacteria produce enzymes – proteins
that speed up chemical processes – which can, in turn,
produce the chemicals used in pharmaceutical drugs.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.680
For example, the enzyme P450 is used to
create drugs for cancer treatment, but it’s
naturally produced by plants.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:10.660
By inserting the genes of a P450-producing plant into bacteria, researchers can create factories of genetically engineered bacteria that generate P450 in greater amounts.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.760
This type of strategy can make the drug production
process much more efficient – a similar method is
already used to produce insulin, for example.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.920
Even better than treating diseases would be
stopping them from happening in the first place.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:29.160
Which brings us to one of the more controversial
uses of genetic engineering: genetic treatments
for unborn animals, including humans.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.000
Certain diseases are caused by issues in an
organism’s DNA.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.700
Mutations happen when there’s a glitch in
the DNA-copying process and the base pairs
in the gene aren’t transcribed perfectly.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.320
In humans, for example, mutations can lead to
heart conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.580
which thickens some of the muscles in the
heart, stopping it from pumping blood efficiently
and forcing the heart to work harder.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.320
If we could edit the DNA in an embryo to fix
a mutation or delete a carrier gene for a disease,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.340
it would prevent the disease from being
there when the person was born and grew up.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.660
On a genetic level, it’s like removing an
entire disease.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:12.100
Of course, many are concerned that genetic engineering
would be used to modify humans for other traits, from
the color of their hair and eyes to their intelligence.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.000
And whether or not that’s something we want
to do as a species is still being debated.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.960
But modern methods are far from delivering that
kind of control, while certain diseases are already
being tackled with current techniques.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.000
So genetic engineering has an enormous amount
of potential.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.500
But the real challenge comes from how we actually
chop and change genes.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.940
There are a few different ways geneticists do this,
but two breakthrough techniques have blown the doors
open in genetic engineering over the last decade:

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.720
Optogenetics and CRISPR.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.660
Optogenetics involves modifying cells to make
them sensitive to light – brain cells, for example.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:51.680
Understanding the human brain is an enormous
challenge, one that the National Academy of Engineering
in the US has made one of their Grand Challenges for
the 21st Century.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.560
And one of the major obstacles is that we still
don’t know exactly what each cell in the brain does.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.500
Since the human brain has certain structures similar
to those in other animals – especially mammals –

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.100
studying the brains of those animals
can help build a better model of our own.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:13.680
Essentially, we need to be able to turn individual brain cells on and off and see how that affects an animal’s behavior to help understand how neurons work together throughout the body.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.920
Changing the variables and measuring the outcomes
– that’s the heart of scientific testing.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:25.400
Brain cells have certain proteins on their surfaces
called ion channel receptors, which are chemical
channels into the cell that act like switches.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.220
They activate or deactivate brain cells when
a chemical, like a neurotransmitter, hits them.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.540
Here’s where it gets clever.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.020
Viruses are usually bad news for the organisms
they’re being hosted in.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:41.660
Certain viruses can attack a cell’s DNA
and insert rogue bits of genetic code, making
the cell malfunction.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:47.740
But because some viruses can introduce DNA
to cells, they can also be put to good use
for genetic engineering purposes.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:56.340
For example, viruses modified to carry certain bits of
DNA can give a cell light sensitive proteins, called
opsins, embedded in its ion channel receptors.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:04.410
Do that to brain cells in, say, a rat, and you can turn
those cells on and off by beaming pulses of light directly
to the cell using fiber optic cables.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:10.440
Researchers have already used this technique
to study the motion circuits in the brains of mice,
even controlling their motion.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.080
They’ve also manipulated cells that govern
sleep in fruit flies, waking them up and putting
them to sleep with flashes of light.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.400
Both the motor cortex in mice and the sleep cycle
in fruit flies have parallel structures in humans,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.280
so optogenetics offers a powerful way to
model human brain physiology.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:33.340
Another star genetic engineering technique uses
chunks of bacterial DNA called Clustered Regularly
Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.500
To avoid that mouthful, the technique is referred
to simply as CRISPR editing.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:44.260
CRISPR can edit DNA in a way that’s easier
to customize, and can both remove particular
genes from a cell and add new ones.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.460
It relies on on a defense mechanism found
in bacteria to defend against viruses.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:53.140
Bacteria like E. coli produce certain proteins
that fight off viruses attacking the cell.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:09:00.720
When they succeed in fighting off the invaders,
enzymes in the cell actually take parts of the virus
DNA and store it within the cell.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:10.460
If another virus attacks later on, the bacteria produce special attack enzymes, known as Cas9, that carry around those stored bits of viral genetic code like a mug shot.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:17.460
When Cas9 enzymes come across a virus, they
see if the virus contains genetic information that
matches the mug shot.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.680
If it’s a match, the Cas9 enzyme chops up
the virus’s DNA to neutralize the threat.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.820
These mechanisms are exactly what genetic
engineers need:

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:34.040
the ability to store and recognize portions of
genetic code on a microbiological level, and to
cut DNA and add parts of it where needed.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.540
So, with CRISPR-Cas9, genetic engineers have
an incredibly versatile toolkit for editing genes in living beings.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:47.430
So, among other things, CRISPR could help
cure diseases like cancer, sickle cell disease,
and certain kinds of muscular dystrophy.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:53.360
In theory, all you have to do is remove the
mutations and put in the correct, healthy
DNA sequence.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:00.460
There are lots of other approaches genetic
engineers can use, too, but CRISPR is one of the most
popular ones being used in research right now.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.380
Still, CRISPR is far from perfect in its current
form.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:11.680
Changing DNA isn’t consequence-free, and if done
incorrectly, it can even cause the very genetic diseases
and mutations researchers want to cure.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.980
So there’s a long way to go before we’re
fully genetically engineering humans on the
DNA level.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:24.260
But in the future, techniques like these may lead to cures
for all kinds of diseases, and like so many fields of
engineering, improve a lot of people’s quality of life.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.800
In this episode, we looked at genetic engineering.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:34.180
We saw that DNA was the underlying mechanism
for how genes are inherited by living things and how
it determines an organism’s features.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:42.210
We saw how selective breeding can improve agricultural
practices, and the potential DNA-level engineering could
have on other fields of engineering.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:49.780
Finally, we saw how optogenetics and CRISPR
have opened up new ways for genetic engineers
to change the DNA inside living cells.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.800
In our next episode we’re gonna be combining
two awesome things: food &amp; engineering.
