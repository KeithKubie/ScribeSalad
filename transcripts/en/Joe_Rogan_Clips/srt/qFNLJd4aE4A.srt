1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,750
The Joe Rogan experience.
That's like a,

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:06,620
the Indian footage they found um,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,310
footprints of what they think is
big foot in India and people saying,

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:15,600
Hey asshole, this is an animal hopping.
Yeah, this thing's only got one leg.

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:17,670
If there's a big foot, it's
a one legged, big foot.

6
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:21,720
Like some doctor Seuss creature.
Like they're like look stupid.

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,990
That's not two feet. That's not bipedal.
What do you guys do? Look at that.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,830
That's one leg. Look at that.
Yeah. Boing. Boing. Boing.

9
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,060
That's an animal jumping you assholes.

10
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,630
The thick part is where their
butland's the front part is their paws.

11
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,740
They just keep going. See you see
one of them. It's even broken up.

12
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,790
Like look at that one picture where like
one of those footprints is actually two

13
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:45,740
separate marks in the, in the snow.
I'm not even a wildlife biologist.

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,920
The one right there. I'm not
even a wildlife biologist.
Rabbit Bro. It's a rabbit.

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,300
Those are kind of big via rabbit though.
Like a whole body rabbit,

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,360
rabbit, they some big ass rabbits. How
big the router Himalayas duty you seeing?

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,780
I don't know. That's what I want to
ask you the question to Himalayas,

18
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,840
like what would it be? What, what
is your animal? It could be, well,

19
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:04,680
one of the things,

20
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:08,010
this is very interesting about animals
is that when they go further north,

21
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,600
contrary to logic, like what you
would think they actually get larger,

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,440
you would think, well, it's colder
up there. They probably get smaller,

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,590
little thicker, but no, they preserve
their body temperature by being larger.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,650
That's why Moose are so big.
They're the furthest north, uh,

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,890
of all the cows makes she makes sense.
Totally makes sense.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,600
If you get a deer from Mexico,
they're tiny. They're like
a hundred pounds, right?

27
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:34,530
There's a deal. Do your call, the coups
deer and a really big one is a hundred.

28
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:38,170
It's cows or coups depending on
who you asked. C O u s but it's a,

29
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,950
a variation of the white tail
deer that's really small.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,370
It only weighs like 100 pounds and it's
in Mexico full ground one. It's like a,

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,590
like a dog size.
Right.

32
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,190
And then there's other ones that are in
Saskatchewan that same species that are

33
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:52,830
300 pounds.
How do you know so much about deers?

34
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,060
Because I killed them and ate them.
Oh, you're a, I forgot you're out.

35
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,480
That explains the giant bow outside.
Yeah. Ah, that's how I get my meat.

36
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,711
Nopes please.

37
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:04,050
You know what a supermarket like everyone
else had to go to supermarket occasion,

38
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:07,500
but most, most of the meat that I eat,
I try to eat from animals that I kill.

39
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,000
Where do you hunt and La. Not La is
tricky. The tents get in the way.

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,240
You're lying to say the lineup.
Yeah.

41
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,700
But you can get a lot of coyote hunting
in La if you want this fucking coyotes

42
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,720
everywhere out here. Man. We
should eat a coyote from La. Uh,

43
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:26,160
I don't think I'd eat a coyote
period. Right? Yeah, less
than that. It was a goof.

44
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,470
Uh, or I was really hungry.
You can eat them though. I
mean you can, it's just meat.

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,170
Yeah, it's, you'd have to
cook it really, really well.

46
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:39,171
But when you cut away all the fur and
mange and all the shit on the outside

47
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,850
watch left, just getting a tissue.
Where do you, uh, what do you hunt?

48
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,920
Typically the mountains.

49
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:48,480
Usually every year I go to
Utah in the mountains of Utah.

50
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,290
Go El Co. What do you got Jim? Further
explanation on this. Oh, it's a bear.

51
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,850
Okay. They call Yeti something
different about him. Elaine Brown bear,

52
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:00,510
or a Tibetan blueberry. Oh,
what they, with all due respect,

53
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:05,440
what we call Yeti is with all probability,
the either the,

54
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,050
Oh, no, no, no. Okay. Then
it's not like they called the
Himalayan Barry Yeti. Right.

55
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,660
It's like they're saying
that it was probably a bear
that was making those marks.

56
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,130
That makes sense. If those are big marks
at the bears, hopping through the snow,

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,070
if it sticks now, that's a,
that makes sense. That guy,

58
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:21,330
who knows he's a nice guy with
all due respect to everyone. Yeah.

59
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,560
Single footprints or when the bear walks
on four feet. Yeah. That makes sense.

60
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,580
All right.
Yeah.
