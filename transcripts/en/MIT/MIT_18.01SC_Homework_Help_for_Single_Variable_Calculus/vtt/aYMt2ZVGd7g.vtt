00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:07.690
Hi.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.200
Welcome to recitation.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.640
Last time in lecture we graphed
some trigonometric functions

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.560
and some inverse
trigonometric functions.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.480
And there was a slight
error in one of the graphs

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.650
that Professor Jerison did.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.460
So I just wanted to
talk a little bit

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.280
about it and about
what the problem was

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.590
and with the correction is.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.960
So the function in
question is the arctangent

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.950
or the inverse tangent.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.980
And so I like to write arctan,
where Professor Jerison usually

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.732
writes tan to the minus 1.

00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:37.940
But they just mean-- they're
just two different names

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.140
for the same function.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.010
So the inverse
function of tangent.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.400
Now I've got a
graph set up here.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.650
And what I've graphed
are the lines,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.820
y equals x-- that's
this diagonal line--

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.830
and the graph y equals tangent
of x-- so that's this curve--

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.410
and here I've got one
of the asymptotes of y

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.620
equals tangent x at pi over 2.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.120
Right?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.300
So as x approaches pi over 2
from the right, tangent of x

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.170
shoots off to infinity getting
closer and closer to this line.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.880
And, you know, it does
something similar down here.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.860
And then of course,
it's a periodic function

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.890
so there are many
copies of this.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.370
So one thing to
notice about this

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.680
is that the tangent
comes in here.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.310
The graph y equals
tan x comes in

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.250
and it is tangent to the line
y equals x at the origin.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.990
So the slope of tan x
is just its derivative.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.010
So we saw in an
earlier recitation

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:48.650
that d over dx of tan x is
equal to secant squared of x.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.540
And so the derivative
at 0 is secant squared

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.260
of 0, which is 1 over 1
squared, which is just 1.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.400
So the slope is 1.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.150
And in fact, a
stronger thing is true,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.070
which is that for positive x,
tangent of x is larger than x.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.390
So this falls away.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.320
So you can figure
that out, for example

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.810
by looking at the difference
and higher derivatives

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.330
if you wanted to.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.260
So the result of this, is that
the graph of the arctangent,

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.120
that is what you
get when you reflect

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.310
this graph across
the line y equals x,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.310
and because of the way
these graphs-- because

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.140
of this property
that this graph has,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.060
that it lies above the line
y equals x for positive x,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.670
when you reflect it what you
get is something that lies just

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.120
below the line y equals x.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.381
When you reflect this whole
picture, that the piece,

00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:46.000
this piece gets reflected
and comes entirely

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.560
on the other side of that line.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.470
So the height here
will be pi over 2.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.410
That'll be the
horizontal asymptote.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:12.470
And it'll come below-- so
this is y equals arctan x.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.110
So it will come below that line.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.840
And similarly, over here it'll
come, it'll be the reflection,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.380
so it'll come above that line.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.470
And again it has an asymptote,
horizontal asymptote,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.000
at minus pi over 2.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.070
So the one feature
I want to point out

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.770
is specifically these two curves
only intersect at the origin.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.850
So in the graph Professor
Jerison showed you,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.060
they looked more
like square root

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.920
of x and x squared, which have
a later intersection point.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.080
But here, for x bigger
than 0, y equals

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.340
tan x is always bigger than
x, which is always bigger

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.950
than y equals arctan x.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.330
And then they come in and right
at the origin, their tangent

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.900
to each other, they both
have derivative 1 here.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.760
And then for negative
x, and then they cross.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.860
And so arctan x is larger
than x is larger than tan x

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.190
when x is less than 0.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.880
So that was all I wanted
to share with you,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.240
just this slightly
cleaner picture

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.120
of the arctan of x that I get
by being able to put it up

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.600
on the board ahead of time.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.360
So that's that.
