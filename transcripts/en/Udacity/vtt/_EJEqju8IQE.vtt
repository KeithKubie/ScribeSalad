00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I won't give you a number, but here is my solution.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The hardest part is to get the outlier removal correct.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For that I sorted the data and I computed the lower and upper quartile.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And these are the exact formulas I used in the exact case.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It turns out even if it doesn't factor nicely, those give me good numbers.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And then I compute a new data set where I just extract data in the range

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000
from the lower quartile to the upper quartile using this simple command over here.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
There's many different ways to implement this.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Then, the maximum likelihood estimator is very simple.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You've already developed the functions mean and standard deviation. I just use those.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And they were supplied for to you in the code we gave you.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And finally, this is the inverse of the standard score z that I've told you.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
If the standard score z is this expression over here,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000
then you can easily solve it for x by bringing x to the left side.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
With this formula, we get this kind of code over here and we return the corresponding x value.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now when you hit "run" you get the answer to the fascinating question

00:01:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of how much I weigh but I won't tell you.
