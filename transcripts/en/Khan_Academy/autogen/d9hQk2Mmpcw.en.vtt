00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.010 align:start position:0%
connected to Massachusetts so they
 

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
connected to Massachusetts so they
divide<00:10:22.430><c> this</c><00:10:22.730><c> territory</c><00:10:23.300><c> up</c><00:10:23.510><c> so</c><00:10:23.720><c> that</c><00:10:23.839><c> it</c><00:10:23.930><c> can</c>

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.050 align:start position:0%
divide this territory up so that it can
 

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
divide this territory up so that it can

so<00:10:27.020><c> they</c><00:10:27.050><c> say</c><00:10:27.410><c> all</c><00:10:27.860><c> right</c><00:10:27.980><c> we</c><00:10:28.250><c> can't</c><00:10:28.520><c> solve</c>

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:28.850 align:start position:0%
so they say all right we can't solve
 

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.790 align:start position:0%
so they say all right we can't solve
this<00:10:29.089><c> problem</c><00:10:29.630><c> of</c><00:10:29.810><c> the</c><00:10:30.170><c> balance</c><00:10:30.500><c> of</c><00:10:30.589><c> power</c>

right<00:10:32.960><c> now</c><00:10:33.080><c> so</c><00:10:33.470><c> what</c><00:10:34.100><c> we're</c><00:10:34.190><c> going</c><00:10:34.310><c> to</c><00:10:34.339><c> do</c><00:10:34.520><c> is</c>

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:34.670 align:start position:0%
right now so what we're going to do is
 

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.579 align:start position:0%
right now so what we're going to do is
just<00:10:34.910><c> kind</c><00:10:35.089><c> of</c><00:10:35.120><c> extend</c><00:10:35.750><c> our</c><00:10:36.080><c> balance</c><00:10:36.470><c> we're</c>

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:38.780 align:start position:0%
going to keep this compromise going to
 

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
