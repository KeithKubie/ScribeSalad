00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For the first question, we're going to see that you understand procedures.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Your goal is to define a procedure--called "udacify"--that takes as input a string

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and outputs a string that is an uppercase "U" followed by the input string.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here's an example.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
If you print the result of calling the udacify procedure that you defined,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
passing in "dacians" as a string, the output should be the string "Udacians"

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with a capital "U."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
See if you can define the procedure "udacify."
