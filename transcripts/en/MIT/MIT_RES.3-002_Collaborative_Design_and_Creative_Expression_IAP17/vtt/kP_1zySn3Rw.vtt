00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.940
GUEST SPEAKER 1: A
lights game, where

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:24.490
basically if you tap on the red
light, you increase your score.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.110
And each time you tap correctly,
it keeps switching in between.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.040
And so, the original
concept for this game

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.592
was a kind of a game sort of
like Guitar Hero or Dance Dance

00:00:34.592 --> 00:00:37.050
Revolution, where you have the
music synced with the light.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750
So you're tapping
them in rhythm.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.640
And if you get then in
rhythm and at the right time,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.790
the right buttons, that's when
you get the highest score.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.400
But we were having a lot
of issues with regards

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.449
to just getting this
hardware and software set up,

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.740
so we decided to throw it on
the stove for the project.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.600
It's not my plain theory.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.080
We could apply this very
easily to that type of project.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.950
So basically what the
components we have here are,

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.440
we have capacitive sensors.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.190
So basically just a wire
where you just touch it,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.390
it just changes the
capacitance of the circuit

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.470
so you can just register that.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.836
They're pretty receptive,
pretty receptive.

00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:18.660
Lost the [INAUDIBLE] somewhere.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.700
GUEST SPEAKER 2: And
they're in rainbow order.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.565
You hit them in rainbow
order, so you have the ability

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:22.273
to project ahead.

00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:24.980
You know it's going to go
here, here, here, here, here.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.010
No problem.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.010
GUEST SPEAKER 1: See, you
follow the orange one,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.100
you see that one is
what becomes red next.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.766
GUEST SPEAKER 3: Oh,
you told them the--

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:32.679
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:33.530
--secret.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.030
GUEST SPEAKER 4: And one of the
cool things that we realized

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.980
is that, upon making this,
that actually having LED set up

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.310
farther away from
the acrylic covering

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.606
actually makes the
squares seem brighter

00:01:48.606 --> 00:01:50.400
because the light
kind of diffuses.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.300
As opposed to being
right next to the acrylic

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.862
where you just see the LEDs.

00:01:55.862 --> 00:01:57.540
But if you back
off, you actually

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.340
get a lot more illumination.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.400
One of the cool lessons.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.470
GUEST SPEAKER 1: We would love
to give a lot of credit to Tay.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.190
He was the guy in our group who
made this acrylic with a laser

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.559
printer, and put the wood
so that each of the squares

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:15.600
were in their own places.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.058
He just made this
beautiful set up.

00:02:17.058 --> 00:02:18.880
Unfortunately, he's
not here today.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.320
GUEST SPEAKER 4: Also a lot
of the soldering back here.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.164
There's a lot of
soldering that's going on.

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:25.080
These are really cool.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.660
Also, they sell LEDs.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.105
These LEDs were actually one
series of LEDs down the strip.

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:35.740
So there's like 150
LEDs on a couple

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.119
of meters of this kind of a--

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:40.160
GUEST SPEAKER 5: A spool.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.651
GUEST SPEAKER 4: On a spool.

00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:46.200
And you can actually control
each one individually

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.975
with Arduino.

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.830
Just be careful not to
power up all of the,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.780
because you'll actually
pass a lot of current

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.600
through your USB.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.920
Probably damage
your USB Arduino.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.330
One of the things that
we learned about wiring

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.390
and knowing how much
current's going through.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.418
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
Luckily, we learned--

00:03:03.418 --> 00:03:05.250
AUDIENCE: Are you going
to continue to USB, or?

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.958
GUEST SPEAKER 1: No,
we learned this one.

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:09.390
GUEST SPEAKER 5: Luckily Andrew
had the magic line of code

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.630
which allows you to just limit
the total amount of current

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.421
you're putting out.

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:14.610
So even if you ask it to
draw a ton of current,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.889
you just dim LEDs.

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.180
GUEST SPEAKER 4: We were
actually warned about a minute

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.870
before we were going to try
it, so it saved a laptop

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.500
from being destroyed.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.600
So it was a big lesson.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.110
GUEST SPEAKER 3: Anybody
want to have a try?

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.697
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Well, firstly,
do you want to say anything?

00:03:31.697 --> 00:03:33.780
GUEST SPEAKER 3: That was
about the right summary.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.480
And we will maybe
attempt to continue

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.430
to add more features,
including timing

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.290
so you get more
points for ending it

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.790
in the rhythm with
lights or music.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.340
We were originally going to
include some of the processing

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.095
code that the Arduino
team used last time

00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:48.720
to make some lights
that flash and sync

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.943
with the beat of the music.

00:03:49.943 --> 00:03:51.780
But due to technical
difficulties

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.250
with wiring, and
capacity, et cetera.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.020
That's going to be
in a later version.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.430
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
so, that's our project.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.120
Yeah?

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.540
AUDIENCE: You mentioned an
acrylic piece was printed.
