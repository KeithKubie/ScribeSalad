00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.650
STEPHEN CARPENTER: I have two
activities that I've prepared.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.280
So interpretation, this idea
of constructing meanings

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.080
or developing meanings
about works of art,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.550
or we can think
of interpretation

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.760
as someone is
speaking one language

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.880
and then we take that
language and we are able to--

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.230
not only do we speak and
understand this language,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.260
then we can take those
ideas and those words

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.510
and turn them into
a different language

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.290
that someone else speaks.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.020
We can have interpretation
function in that way as well.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.650
So it's about taking
ideas from one context

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.580
into another or one mode of
representation in communication

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.550
into another.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.690
But in terms of art
and art practice,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.740
art criticism and
interpretation work together.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:03.070
So this image I think is
useful for our purposes here.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.630
Imagine that this
image was the poster

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.530
for a movie, full length,
feature length movie.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.790
And imagine you were responsible
for writing the copy--

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.890
for writing the text for the
voiceover of the movie trailer,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.820
but all you had was
this image to go by.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.400
You probably heard
movie trailers,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.220
those little
commercials for movies.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.130
And usually my
experience, they start off

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.670
with one of two phrases or a
version of one of two phrases.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.340
One of the phrases
is usually something

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.260
like this, "Imagine a
place--" And you can imagine--

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.584
you've heard this phrase
before from movie trailers.

00:01:55.584 --> 00:01:58.000
"Imagine a place" and the
music is start doing [HUMMING]..

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.480
You see the scenery.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.636
Another phrase that is often
used is "In a world where--"

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:06.135
You've--

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:08.938
I see nodding going on,
so that means, oh, I've--

00:02:08.938 --> 00:02:10.479
you could probably
name several films

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.680
that have movie trailers
that start that way.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.350
So take one of those phrases--

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.111
"imagine a place," or
"in a world--" and--

00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:22.110
I don't know if you have
something to write with

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.580
or if you want to
keep it in your head.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.020
And if you come up a sentence
or two, that would be great.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.320
But the sentence or two that
starts with one of those two

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.510
prompts would function as
the beginning voiceover copy

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.570
for the movie from
which this still comes.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.170
We got it?

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.680
All right.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.721
Here's the movie trailer.

00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:43.380
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.890
- What would you do in
a world without justice?

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.820
In 2017, humankind's
most precious resource

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.000
is used as a weapon of control.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.631
Will you punch up against power?

00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:59.404
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:59.404 --> 00:03:01.195
STEPHEN CARPENTER: I'm
going to that movie.

00:03:01.195 --> 00:03:03.682
[LAUGHS] Wow, all right.

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:04.890
So part of what I'm hearing--

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.590
like I heard swimming upstream,
adversity, these water hoses,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.280
I heard--

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.430
there was an issue of
control, resistance.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.860
This border wall
suggests there's

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.660
something about being
in and out and not

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.090
being able to attain something.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.290
And then the X Games--

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.620
what'd you call it?

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.250
Cheerleading?

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.745
Extreme-- ultimate cheerleading.

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:28.620
Extreme cheerleading.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.286
So there's an activity,
but then there's

00:03:30.286 --> 00:03:34.680
something else that
pushes it or ramps it up.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.060
Add some context here.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.170
This is a still image from
a performance by performance

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.710
artist Dread Scott.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.400
The title of the work is
called, On the Impossibility

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.900
of Freedom in a Country Founded
on Slavery and Genocide.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.300
And he's referencing
a range of events,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.340
but specifically
a particular event

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.730
in the '60s where
there was a protest

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.040
against racial injustice.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.620
Where the authorities
used water hoses,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.730
high-powered water hoses to
push back African Americans.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.160
This was not a single
event, these kinds of things

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.600
happen all the time in the '60s.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.725
So this is part of Dread
Scott's performance,

00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:16.320
this is a still from
his performance.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.940
I find it remarkable listening
to even the comedy trailer,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.090
that you were picking
up on elements of what

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.712
his performance--

00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:28.170
what he intended his performance
to be about, but also what

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.650
other people have interpreted
his performance to be about.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.100
Charles Garoian is a performance
artist an art educator

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.720
who also taught high school in
the Bay Area in San Francisco.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.040
And he taught his students
in late '60s and the '70s--

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.780
into the '80s
actually I believe--

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.570
about performance
art and happenings,

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.420
and the ways in which our
bodies can perform symbolically

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.700
to construct works
of art that relate

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.300
to social issues
and cultural issues.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.000
So his work is documented
in several of his books,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
one of which is called
Performing Pedagogy where

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.840
he interprets several works
of art and performance art

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.270
and then provides
a set of activities

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.810
that teachers and their
students can perform

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.360
to learn some of
the basic structures

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.250
or some elements
of performance art

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.270
using one's body as
an artistic medium,

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.390
but also a way in which to
comment on social issues.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.260
But it's the idea of using our
bodies as symbolic vehicles

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.430
that become powerful.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.260
And also the ways that
our bodies can move

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.000
and the ways in which
our bodies interact

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.090
with other objects
or other ideas,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.060
the way in which we might
maybe think of taking our body,

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.070
doing something to it,
doing something else to it.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.120
So there's an activity that
I often do with my students--

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.160
undergrad, graduate
students, students

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.230
who are learning to
be teachers that I

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:54.480
borrowed from Charles Garoian.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.780
Here's a still image of
one student doing this.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.520
And what I'd like you to do
is to identify a statement.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.730
Could be an excerpt, it
could be song lyrics,

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:15.420
it could be a poem, but it needs
to be a set of words that--

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.360
ideally it's a text or a
sentence or several phrases--

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.390
that you could or
someone else could say

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.526
within a 30-second time period.

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:28.400
So borrowing from Charles
Garoian's approach,

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.350
one of the activities is
to take an image and--

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.060
a body, and the body engages
in a repetitive motion,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.970
a repetitive activity.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.990
And the ideas that that body
in motion in relationship

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.990
to or in juxtaposition with
or in critique or conversation

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.940
with that image will inherently
start to construct or suggest

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.747
different interpretations,
just like what

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:55.330
you did when you saw
the image and you

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.200
added some text to that.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.920
But there's a third
element, and that's the text

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.180
that you've come up with.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.360
So what is going to happen--

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.080
so here's another student
doing something similar.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.424
So what's going to happen is,
I'm going to hit this button,

00:07:09.424 --> 00:07:10.840
and then I'm going
to go over here

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.256
and I'm going to
start performing.

00:07:12.256 --> 00:07:15.100
I'm going to do a repetitive
motion for 30 seconds.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.494
When I get over there, you're
going to speak your text.

00:07:18.494 --> 00:07:19.410
AUDIENCE: Oh, my text?

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.880
STEPHEN CARPENTER: Yes.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.170
AUDIENCE: Oh, I thought
I was reading your text.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.390
STEPHEN CARPENTER: No, no.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.280
Oh, you would rather
not share your text?

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.830
AUDIENCE: I mean, I don't mind,
it's just not 30 seconds long.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.250
I can say it over
and over again.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.360
STEPHEN CARPENTER:
That would be fine.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.260
All right, we'll do that.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.801
Then I have two
other images so we'll

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:32.961
be able to get to
two other people.

00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:34.210
But you'll see how this works.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.610
You ready?

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.860
Go.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.550
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.860
Sometimes you gotta post
bad pictures of yourself

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.840
online so that
people are impressed

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.700
when they see you in person.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.020
Sometimes you gotta post
bad pictures of yourself

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.990
online so that
people are impressed

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.090
when they see you in person.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.610
Sometimes you gotta post bad
pictures of yourself online

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.750
so now people are impressed
when they see you in person.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.910
Sometimes you gotta post
bad pictures of yourself

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.594
online so that
people are impressed

00:08:02.594 --> 00:08:03.760
when they see you in person.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.990
LARRY SUSSKIND: Time.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.080
STEPHEN CARPENTER: All
right, thank you, Larry.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.380
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.921
STEPHEN CARPENTER: See, I had
to trust him because, you know,

00:08:10.921 --> 00:08:13.940
three minutes could
have been 30 seconds.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.700
You see what happened?

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.340
We have a repetitive
motion, which

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.990
might suggest certain ideas
and concepts, meanings.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.690
We had this text.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.024
Be where-- say it again?

00:08:26.024 --> 00:08:27.690
AUDIENCE: Oh, sometimes
you have to post

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.490
bad pictures of yourself online
so that people are impressed

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.780
when they see you in person.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.530
STEPHEN CARPENTER: So
not only do we have text,

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.990
we gotta put in relationship
to this movement.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.180
But this image,
what does this image

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.429
have to do with this movement?

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:43.450
I mean, it's interesting, you
can put two ideas together

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.210
or put these two things together
or these two things together,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.480
but all three of them?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.290
Anybody want to attempt to
weave these three together?

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.770
Go ahead.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.870
AUDIENCE: Since the
theme of repetition,

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.480
I didn't catch it at first,
but the fact that you

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.670
kept repeating it
and then your hop

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.680
kind of synced in
with that, and then

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.760
looking at this
image, just the fact

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.580
that there's all these windows
and all the pieces of the image

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.870
deconstructed-- sort
of fell into this cycle

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.780
of posting pictures online and
seeing people multiple times

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.080
and it did sort of in
time come together for me.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.300
STEPHEN CARPENTER: OK, nice.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.920
So why would I do
something like that?

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.557
Well, at the end of the
semester, the students in one

00:09:27.557 --> 00:09:29.390
of my graduate classes
I teach at Penn State

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.360
and also at Vermont
College of Fine Arts,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.686
after going through that process
of the randomness of making

00:09:35.686 --> 00:09:37.060
those connections,
they then have

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.540
to go through the process of
intentionally combining image,

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:43.760
text, and body movement
for a public performance

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.560
that lasts at
least five minutes.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.579
So these are-- the top row
are stills from one video,

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:51.370
the bottom row are
stills from another one,

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.400
and the one at the top,
the student was interested

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.060
in the idea that someone told
her at one point something

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.980
like, there have
never been any wars--

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.906
international wars on US soil.

00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:06.780
And she thought, this
doesn't make any sense,

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.280
and a history teacher
told her that.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.630
So the idea was that this
performance speaks back

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.676
to that, and this was
performed in Philadelphia.

00:10:12.676 --> 00:10:14.800
And so you can see in these
three different images,

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.425
she's using her body
in different ways.

00:10:16.425 --> 00:10:17.710
She's holding a photo of--

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.200
a satellite photo
of a plane bombing.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.720
She created almost a little
memorial and burial for this

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.580
and has watered it generously
and then puts her own body down

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:28.510
in this bench.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.390
That it's essentially a
whispering bench where she

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.326
she's sitting at one end and
can whisper into the corner,

00:10:34.326 --> 00:10:35.950
and the person sitting
at the other end

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.660
can hear what she's saying.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:39.250
And the one at the
bottom is a student

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.940
who performed outside
of Karachi-- that's

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.400
at Carnegie Hall, in
front of Carnegie Hall.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.420
And symbolically speaking
to a death in her family,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.650
but also her own musical
aspirations and the way

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.690
in which they relate
to her own life,

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.860
but also she was equating
it to gun violence.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.890
And so she was
cleaning the clarinet

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.140
and puts it in this
case in various ways

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.270
that make you suggest--

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.980
they suggest, is this a
musical instrument or is it

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.760
an implement for an
instrument of killing?

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.960
So these are some outgrowths
from that quick assignment

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.910
that we did.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.670
So in summary, you
could engage learners

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.410
like we've done today
in any of these ways,

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:28.960
or you could do boring stuff.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.140
It's really up to you.
