RYAN SANDS: Welcome to the talk.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.300
Thanks for coming.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.480
We're here to welcome and
talk to Bryan Lee O'Malley.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.890
He is a Canadian.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.365
And also he is a part--

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:12.740
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Are there
any Canadians in the house?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.115
RYAN SANDS: Oh my.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:15.740
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
That's out of here.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.900
RYAN SANDS: I grew
up in Michigan.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.290
It's very close.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.820
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Oh yeah.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.250
That's-- you're
basically Canadian.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.750
RYAN SANDS: I grew
up with DeGrassi.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.630
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
But I hate you.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.635
RYAN SANDS: Brian's
also a cartoonist.

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:27.780
He's author of "Lost at Sea,"
and the wildly successful,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.360
and popular, and awesome
"Scott Pilgrim" series,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.750
which was made into a
movie by Edgar Wright.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.520
And a game and
some other things.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.720
It's being released right
now in color additions.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.309
I think-- is five out yet?

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.350
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Five
is coming out next week.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.980
RYAN SANDS: Oh.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.330
How exciting.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.800
And he's here to
talk about "Seconds,"

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.630
his new graphic novel, which
just came out on Tuesday.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.640
I read it on the
way home from work.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.390
And it's fabulous.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.440
But yeah, so thank you.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.920
And can you please help me
introduce Bryan-- welcome him.

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:04.769
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
I won't clap.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.240
RYAN SANDS: I'm gonna get
progressively sweatier

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.410
throughout the night.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.870
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: You're
wearing a sweatshirt.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.578
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:01:09.578 --> 00:01:12.444
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
That's what happens.

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:15.460
It's called that for a reason.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.960
Anyway.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.668
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:01:16.668 --> 00:01:17.380
So.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.760
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Hello.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.750
RYAN SANDS: I have a
bunch of questions.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.550
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: OK.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.820
RYAN SANDS: I wrote
some of them down.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.403
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
We knew each other

00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:23.900
prior to this--
whatever this is.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.810
RYAN SANDS: We're
Twitter friends.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.440
You follow me.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.190
I almost DM'd you.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.440
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: We've met.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.410
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.500
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: And
you do comics as well.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.630
RYAN SANDS: Oh yeah.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.580
So outside of work, I publish
comics in a small little press.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.940
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Publisher of some renown.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.584
RYAN SANDS: You're
taking over the--

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:39.750
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: I'm
just intro'ing you properly.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.720
That's all.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.290
RYAN SANDS: So I read
the book on Tuesday.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.970
I grabbed it on the BART home.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.180
I really loved it.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.340
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: They
sell it on the BART?

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.950
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.770
At the BART station.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.270
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Someone
just sold it to you at the BART?

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.260
RYAN SANDS: I bought it
with the clipper card.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.330
It's my favorite
thing you've done.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.220
Which is an interesting
and exciting thing to say,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.490
because I love your
previous work so much.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.240
But it made me-- I'm 32.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.830
It made me feel like
I'm 32 in like a--

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.830
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: It
was like a reality check.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.538
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:11.650
Like in a sad way, and
then like a happy way too.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.830
I was like, wow.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.680
And I think for me, like
when I think about being 30,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.550
it is about like accepting
a lot of really dumb cliches

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.300
that people always
tell you that are true.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.850
And you're like, oh goddamnit.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:24.910
That's true.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.550
So I think a lot of the book
was about-- when I read it

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.880
on Tuesday, it reminded
me of like-- it's

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.590
about accepting the fact
that you're the sum of all

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.390
the good and bad
choices you've made.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.380
And so everything you have or
don't have, or lost or enjoy

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.300
is the sum of all
these weird choices.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.640
So I wonder how much of the
book was actually a response

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.340
to the success of
"Scott Pilgrim?"

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.794
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: It's a
hard question to parcel out.

00:02:51.794 --> 00:02:52.710
RYAN SANDS: I'm sorry.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.700
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
No, it's fine.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.200
It's a good place
to start, I guess.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.527
While I was working
on "Scott Pilgrim,"

00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:08.550
I was annoyed that
it was-- I'm not sure

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.000
how I'm going to phrase this.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.870
I got a really bad review in
the Comics Journal in 2006,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.680
on the third "Scott
Pilgrim" book.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.740
So I was like, why doesn't
the art comics establishment

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.040
like me?

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.830
And I wanted to do
something, I wanted

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.350
to do a book that's
more arty and literary,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.300
and dark and serious.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.310
So for years that's
what I was thinking

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.060
that I would do after
"Scott Pilgrim."

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.899
And then when I
finally got there,

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.815
"Scott Pilgrim" had
already become successful.

00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:44.148
And I didn't care that I had
a bad review in a magazine.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.970
So I was like, I'm gonna take
this darker subject matter

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.490
and just try to make it
really fun, entertaining,

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.205
and true to myself.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:04:00.720
And not just entirely a
reaction to "Scott Pilgrim."

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.212
There's aspects to the story--
the story's about a girl who

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:07.420
works in a successful
restaurant, but she wants more.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.520
And she's trying to start her
own more successful restaurant

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.430
on her own terms.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.040
So that's obviously
a clear metaphor

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.380
for me wanting to move on
and start something new.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.310
So there's that.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.590
But from there, it just kind of
spins off into it's own thing.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.465
RYAN SANDS: I thought
it was interesting too,

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:27.270
in the story, the second
restaurant that the protagonist

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.900
is thinking to
start, she's like,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.040
I'm going to control the
name, and how it looks,

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.530
and it's going to be mine again.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.750
I thought that must be-- a lot
of our friends are cartoonists,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.770
and it's like the most solitary,
singular-- like writing.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.660
Where you're just
alone with your ideas.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.900
And so it must have
been interesting to work

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.500
on something that eventually
became a shared project.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.000
There's a lot of people who
were working on "Scott Pilgrim."

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.100
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: It
was like an industry.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.920
It was like 500 people had jobs
because of "Scott Pilgrim."

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.010
So that was weird.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.594
It was weird to
relinquish that control.

00:05:05.594 --> 00:05:07.260
In the early days of
the movie planning,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.000
it was maybe four or five of us.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.990
And that was fun.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.560
It was a little
tight knit group.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.150
But then it got way
out of hand, and I

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.505
felt like I was this figurehead.

00:05:16.505 --> 00:05:19.400
Because I didn't really have
anything to do with the movie

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.130
aside from they would
ask me a question,

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.205
and I would answer it.

00:05:24.205 --> 00:05:27.020
And that's about all I did.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.090
But during the actual movie,
I was just standing there,

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.020
and everyone was like,
oh, it's the guy.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.370
So it had all this adulation,
but it was kind of meaningless.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.402
And I didn't really have--
it was completely out

00:05:41.402 --> 00:05:41.985
of my control.

00:05:41.985 --> 00:05:44.840
It was this whole crew.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.550
I was not even a
part of it at all.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.320
RYAN SANDS: And it's like
Katie, the main protagonist,

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.580
has that same experience,
but at a restaurant

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.060
where she's walking
around asking

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.540
people how their food is.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.970
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Right.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.428
RYAN SANDS: But
she didn't make it.

00:05:56.428 --> 00:05:59.434
Because she made the thing, and
now it's running without her.

00:05:59.434 --> 00:06:00.850
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Yeah, exactly.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.010
Her ideas live on without her.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.250
And everyone still loves
them, and they love her.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.010
I mean some of the
stuff like that,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.180
is almost subliminal for
me to put in the book.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.240
But now that you mention it,
it sounds a lot like my life.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.830
RYAN SANDS: I think when I
was thinking about the book,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.540
after I finished it
and started rereading,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.974
I realized that both of
the books-- both the "Scott

00:06:27.974 --> 00:06:29.390
Pilgrim" series
and the new book--

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.926
are about consequences in a way.

00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:33.300
And I don't think
I saw that when

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.100
I read "Scott Pilgrim" as a
teenager and as a college kid.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.430
But it's about dealing with
the consequences of having

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.460
had relationships with people.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.085
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
You were not a teenager

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:43.540
when "Scott Pilgrim" came out.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.540
RYAN SANDS: When the first one
came out, I was a teenager.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.498
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: No.

00:06:46.498 --> 00:06:47.650
It came out 10 years ago.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.982
RYAN SANDS: Was I forever 21?

00:06:48.982 --> 00:06:49.940
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: 22.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.450
RYAN SANDS: Oh shit.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.114
Was I?

00:06:52.114 --> 00:06:54.030
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: You
just said you were 32.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.422
RYAN SANDS: Oh.

00:06:55.422 --> 00:06:57.630
I didn't know you were going
to be doing mental math.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.000
I was trying to sound--

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.620
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
We're at Google.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.850
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.540
That's true.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.090
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: This
is how they do basic math.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.570
RYAN SANDS: OK.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.278
I was a young'un.

00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:04.922
And then I've grown.

00:07:04.922 --> 00:07:06.630
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
You felt like a teen.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.370
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.578
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: So did I.

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:12.160
RYAN SANDS: I still think of
myself as a tween, deep down.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.050
The new book is about
consequences too,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.380
in terms of more career and
sort of generalized path stuff.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.190
And then the really exciting
thing that isn't just quickly,

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.570
is this sort of
monkey's paw element.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.880
Where like, what if you
could change things?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.400
And the implications of that.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.870
Can you talk a little bit
about how in the book,

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.340
you're using that impulse to
use fantastical elements to talk

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.790
about pretty real stuff?

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.310
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Right.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:47.434
I mean I think the fantastical
elements came first.

00:07:47.434 --> 00:07:49.480
I was sort of
inspired by this story

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.938
that my mom used
to read to me when

00:07:50.938 --> 00:07:55.040
I was a little kid, about a
boy who finds a second chance

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:55.740
ticket.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.630
And he accidentally
let's his dog run away,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.350
and then he just
fills out this ticket,

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.870
and says he wishes
he didn't do it.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.710
And then it's undone.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.965
That's the entire story.

00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:08.840
RYAN SANDS: The dog
doesn't come back undead?

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.610
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
The dog is just back.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:10.485
Yeah, that's the end.

00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:12.750
It's like, oh,
everything's fine.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.922
His mom comes home
and everything's fine.

00:08:15.922 --> 00:08:18.100
A simple story.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.020
But it always stuck in my head.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:27.110
I worked in this restaurant
and I started thinking about

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.000
the second chance ticket,
and restaurant, and then

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.510
this idea of this house
spirit thing, which

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.250
is kind of an old Russian
folklore sort of thing--

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.669
Eastern European-- that
there is like a spirit that

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:46.490
reigns over your house, but
it's almost a benevolent thing.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.737
So all that stuff kind of
meshed together in my mind

00:08:51.737 --> 00:08:53.320
when I was working
at this restaurant.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.160
And I had a lot
of time to think,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.540
because I was the food runner.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.940
All I did was bring food
from the basement kitchen

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.810
to the diners, and not
really interact with anyone.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.560
So I was just looking
over the sketch book

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.820
and having ideas for stuff.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.360
And I just let this kind
of grow for six years

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.802
while I was finishing
"Scott Pilgrim."

00:09:15.802 --> 00:09:17.760
RYAN SANDS: You've had
this idea, or the kernel

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.890
of the idea, for a long time?

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.931
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:09:19.931 --> 00:09:21.800
Literally the first
"Scott Pilgrim" came out

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.765
and I made no money, and I
got a job in a restaurant.

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:27.210
And that's where I had
the idea for "Seconds."

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.071
So it's been there
since the beginning.

00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:30.820
RYAN SANDS: Dishwashing
cartoonist is like

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.037
a well-known, revered--

00:09:32.037 --> 00:09:33.620
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Classic archetype.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.867
RYAN SANDS: Michael
DeForge was a dishwasher.

00:09:35.867 --> 00:09:36.950
I've heard of many other--

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:37.060
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
He might have

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:38.520
worked in the same
restaurant as me.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.060
RYAN SANDS: Yeah, you guys--

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.710
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: In Toronto.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:40.209
Yeah.

00:09:40.209 --> 00:09:42.350
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.821
I thought the setting
was really interesting.

00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:46.820
It takes place in a
restaurant, as we mentioned.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.720
And it seems like chefs in
restaurants are very in vogue

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.560
in terms of-- not in vogue,
but fascinating to people.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.450
Like there's a special magic.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.500
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: It seems
like a celebrity culture

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:57.999
right now.

00:09:57.999 --> 00:09:59.447
They're like a rock star.

00:09:59.447 --> 00:10:01.530
RYAN SANDS: Feels like
it's like that and stand up

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.630
are these two things
that-- there's podcasts,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.070
and people really want to know
the unique qualities of it.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.403
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Cartoonists.

00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:08.810
RYAN SANDS: And cartoonists.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.070
Yeah.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.980
We don't have a WTF
podcast for us yet.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.810
But I was interested about--

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:18.610
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: First.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:21.640
You starting it.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.360
RYAN SANDS: But what about
a restaurant, I guess,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.872
is unique or magical.

00:10:25.872 --> 00:10:27.830
Like a restaurant has a
house spirit, but maybe

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:29.677
not like this office, perhaps?

00:10:29.677 --> 00:10:30.760
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Right.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.259
Yeah.

00:10:31.259 --> 00:10:34.300
The restaurant where I worked
was a really old building.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.400
I've always liked old buildings.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.130
They've always been
fascinating to me.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.220
But then the restaurant-- it's
like a working restaurant is

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.100
its own closed community.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.730
And there's always
interesting characters

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.830
that work in a restaurant.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.010
It's very ethnically
diverse generally.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:58.620
And it just seemed like a
natural place to tell a story,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.680
if I'm going to stick to
"write what you know."

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.150
The only other thing I know
other than drawing comics

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.980
is, I worked at a
restaurant for six months.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.580
That's all my life
experience to date.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.340
And it just made sense to me.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.460
I like food, and I
like chefs, and I

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.970
like writing about
boisterous, outgoing people.

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.425
I'm not like that at all.

00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:24.700
RYAN SANDS: Yeah,
there's a lot of yelling,

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.241
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
It fascinates me.

00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:28.061
Yeah.

00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:30.060
And people are just kind
of really over the top.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:33.240
And so I wanted to write
a character like that.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.757
RYAN SANDS: Do have
chef friends who--

00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:37.090
there's actually a really good--

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.930
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Work at Google?

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.610
I do actually have a chef
friend who works at Google.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.160
RYAN SANDS: There's a
really good recipe in there.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.370
And I was like,
that sounds real.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.565
It actually sounds
really delicious.

00:11:45.565 --> 00:11:46.890
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: It is.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.702
I do have chef friends.

00:11:48.702 --> 00:11:50.660
The friend who got me
the job at the restaurant

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:53.740
originally owns his own
restaurant in Toronto now,

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.140
called Me &amp; Mine.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.470
So if anyone ever goes to
Toronto, check out Me &amp; Mine.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.600
It's really good.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:07.250
And another friend in LA
is a dabbler, I guess.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.710
And he came over and
cooked this recipe,

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:14.420
so I could take detailed
reference photos.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.330
And he made it up.

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.905
It's a crazy recipe with rabbit
with a green tea reduction.

00:12:18.905 --> 00:12:20.280
I never would have
thought of it.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:20.860
RYAN SANDS: Mushrooms in it.

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:20.930
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.110
Mushrooms-- that was
important for the story.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.270
And he just invented
this recipe.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:27.730
He came over and
did it one night.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.670
And we all ate it.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.620
And it was delicious.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.280
And I put it in the book.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.700
RYAN SANDS: There's
also a hamburger

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.000
that looks really good.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.334
There's some really tasty foods.

00:12:36.334 --> 00:12:37.374
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:12:37.374 --> 00:12:40.170
The hamburger is my-- I had an
art assistant on this book--

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.520
Jason Fisher, who's well-known
for drawing hamburgers.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.250
That's his thing.

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.850
So I gave him one big
juicy burger to draw.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.504
RYAN SANDS: My wife
has a patch of his.

00:12:50.504 --> 00:12:51.420
It's a huge hamburger.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.830
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.
he makes these patches

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:54.110
that he puts on jean jackets.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.460
Some of them are this big.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.350
You put it on the back
of your denim jacket.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.070
A giant burger.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:58.890
RYAN SANDS: You're at
that level now where

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.970
you can be like, I need the best
hamburger drawer in the world.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.880
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Get
me the best burger drawer.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.080
Only the best.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.560
RYAN SANDS: You
went to Hollywood,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.450
and now you're a tyrant.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:08.866
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Comics tyrant.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.210
RYAN SANDS: The other
thing I want to talk about

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.150
was the fairytale
structure of it.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.620
And the part that
felt that way was,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.260
there's this disconnection
between the narrator

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.980
and the way that the
actual main character

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.200
argues with the narrator
version of herself.

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:35.830
So I was curious to
see-- a lot of people

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.029
made a lot of fuss about
the manga connections

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:38.820
in "Scott Pilgrim."

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:44.030
So I was curious, some of which
I think were real influences,

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:48.380
and some were just sort of like,
oh that's cute-- must be manga.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.590
For the new book, you mentioned
the child's book that you read.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.420
What were some of the
other comics influences?

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.900
Because it feels like way
different tonally, and also

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.030
the look of it is different.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.690
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
I mean I was more

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.320
inspired by European
comics this time.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.680
Like French stuff.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.210
Franco-Belgian influence.

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:10.500
Like Donjon was a huge--

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.500
RYAN SANDS: Oh, dungeon.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.124
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Dungeon in English.

00:14:13.124 --> 00:14:14.970
Donjon.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.670
It was a huge thing for me.

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.350
That was even before
"Scott Pilgrim,"

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.210
it was maybe 2002, 2003.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.339
I was just obsessively
collecting these books

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:25.880
that no one's probably
ever heard of.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.270
But their--

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:27.670
RYAN SANDS: It's one of my
favorite comics of all time.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.170
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Of course it is.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.180
But they're these French albums.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.145
And this famous dude named--
who's the guy who started it?

00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:35.020
Trondheim started it?

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.200
RYAN SANDS: Nsfar.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.060
Yeah.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.470
Trondheim Nsfar.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:41.190
They started this
series where-- they

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:42.840
started volume
one of the series,

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.200
and then they did volume--
I think, 99 and negative 99.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.700
So that it was the origins
of all the characters,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.930
and then the far
apocalyptic future

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.290
of all the same characters.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.570
And they were like, we're
going to meet in the middle.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.620
We're going to do 100
books on either side.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.910
I think they did five.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.300
But they're all amazing.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.180
Its such a mind
boggling concept.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.420
And the art was so beautiful.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.410
It was really inspiring as
a starting-out cartoonist.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.880
RYAN SANDS: It's also--
they're small looks too.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.030
Each one's 40 pages.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.620
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Only 40 pages.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.300
But they're really dense.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.130
RYAN SANDS: It's the far future.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.505
You're like, oh
no, he hates him.

00:15:18.505 --> 00:15:19.370
And he's like--

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.950
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
He has no arms.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.930
It's really crazy.

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.522
It was a huge influence on
"Adventure Time," I know that.

00:15:25.522 --> 00:15:29.050
Pen loved that stuff.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.940
RYAN SANDS: I guess I was
thinking a lot of your stories

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.230
are very epic.

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:35.039
This story is a very
small story and--

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:36.330
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Small epic.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.407
It's an internal epic.

00:15:38.407 --> 00:15:40.990
RYAN SANDS: In terms of like,
it doesn't cover that much time.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:43.270
It's like one character's life.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.430
But it's a huge project.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:49.600
I was wondering, did
you have an impulse

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.530
to do shorter stuff
before you started,

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.319
or did you always
see it as a big book?

00:15:55.319 --> 00:15:56.360
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.912
I always saw it as exactly
this size and shape.

00:15:59.912 --> 00:16:00.870
RYAN SANDS: Oh perfect.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:01.580
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
I had to fill out

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.870
those pages with something.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.245
RYAN SANDS: With
the little image

00:16:04.245 --> 00:16:06.260
of you tweeting on the toilet.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.800
If you guys haven't
seen it, you'll

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.347
see Bryan and other
friends in the background.

00:16:11.347 --> 00:16:12.930
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Yeah, I mean, this

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.890
is the trend size
of the Tezuka books

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.750
from Vertical, which are my
favorite presentation of comics

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.690
right now.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:24.960
And I just wanted it
to feel like a novel.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.740
So that was one of
the initial goals,

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.240
was just the actual physical
dimensions of the book.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:37.550
And I wanted a story that would
fit in that package basically.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.780
And I wanted to tell
a story about a boss,

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.110
about someone who's
actually done some stuff,

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.130
but is still fucked up.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.270
So I had to wait
until I was old enough

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.157
to tell a story like that.

00:16:53.157 --> 00:16:55.490
RYAN SANDS: I was thinking
about the success you've had.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:59.215
And it's funny you mention Pen.

00:16:59.215 --> 00:17:01.340
Your career sort of reminds
me of Pen a little bit.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.720
Pen Ward is the creator
of "Adventure Time."

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:07.367
He started out doing a
lot of indie small comics.

00:17:07.367 --> 00:17:09.950
It's a good thing, but because
of the popularity of the things

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:15.579
you've made, maybe it might be
hard to try out ideas, or try

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:16.270
experimenting.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.410
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: I
think he's in a corner

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.640
right now with that stuff.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.869
His popularity is
really overwhelming.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:27.020
RYAN SANDS: And the same could
be said for you too, I know.

00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.157
Like any tweet gets--

00:17:28.157 --> 00:17:30.240
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: I feel
like I'm over the hump.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.240
And I'm kind of moving on
with the rest of my life.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.394
He's still in the
thick of it, for sure.

00:17:35.394 --> 00:17:37.310
RYAN SANDS: Do you feel
like you have a space,

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.350
or what is your space for
sort of experimenting?

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.550
Like this is another big book.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.430
And I think-- I know-- that
it's going to be very popular.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.080
And so I was just
curious, do you

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.550
have a place to try out
ideas or just to tinker?

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:56.065
Where lots of Tumblr
kids and Twitter people

00:17:56.065 --> 00:17:56.969
are following you?

00:17:56.969 --> 00:17:58.260
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Not really.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.350
And I don't tend
towards doing that.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.960
I tinkered plenty in this book.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.750
I did lots of things
I wanted to try

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:08.990
and wanted to do differently.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.640
And I keep telling
people lately I

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.390
wanna do some short
story, short comics.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.973
RYAN SANDS: Yeah, I
saw you said that.

00:18:15.973 --> 00:18:18.800
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah,
which would be fun in theory.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.990
It seems like a great idea.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:25.280
And I want to do like-- I
really like some of the minis

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.020
and risograph stuff
that I've seen lately,

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.240
and stuff that you do.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:34.900
And it'-- I think there's lots
of different spaces to do that.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:39.130
And I like the idea of just
doing a 20 or 30-page story

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.720
and just dropping it online
for free, unannounced.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.940
Like some day.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:45.021
That would be fun.

00:18:45.021 --> 00:18:46.520
RYAN SANDS: Do you
use-- do you mind

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.870
me asking-- I don't ask
about the process stuff,

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.560
but do you use a sketch book?

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.386
Or how do you keep
track of your thoughts?

00:18:53.386 --> 00:18:54.760
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
I'm terrible.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.560
I buy sketchbooks.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:56.300
RYAN SANDS: It
wasn't a judgement.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.591
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: No, I know.

00:18:57.591 --> 00:18:58.100
I used to.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.490
I used to use the
sketchbook all the time.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:06.872
But lately I just write down
ideas in Notepad, or Evernote,

00:19:06.872 --> 00:19:07.830
or one of those things.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.780
And it's like a jumble.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.950
And I'm terrible at
picking up a pen.

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:14.160
I never do it.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.461
I don't draw when I'm
not working on a book.

00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:20.210
Like the signings I'm
doing this week will

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.037
be the most drawing
I've done all year.

00:19:22.037 --> 00:19:23.620
RYAN SANDS: Do you
have a wrist guard?

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.820
We have a lot of
ergonomics here at Google.

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.125
Like ergonomic keyboards.

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:30.375
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: I just
kind of work on my posture.

00:19:32.809 --> 00:19:33.850
RYAN SANDS: It's working.

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:34.891
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:19:34.891 --> 00:19:36.300
I try.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.290
RYAN SANDS: I saw a
couple of friends of ours

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.596
who worked with you on
the book as assistants.

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:43.220
Justin Harben I know
lettered the book.

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.020
And then Jason Fisher did some
pencils and some background

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:47.680
drawings.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.470
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:49.030
Burgers.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:49.880
RYAN SANDS: Drew burgers.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.921
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:19:50.921 --> 00:19:54.560
and Nathan Fairbairn from
Vancouver did the colors.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.370
He's also been doing the
colors in "Scott Pilgrim."

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:00.525
RYAN SANDS: And
like we said, comics

00:20:00.525 --> 00:20:01.900
are great to read
and really fun.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.965
But I know making
them can be intense.

00:20:03.965 --> 00:20:05.125
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Can be very solitary.

00:20:05.125 --> 00:20:05.410
Yeah.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.118
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:20:06.118 --> 00:20:07.560
So it must have
been-- what was it

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.540
like to have collaborators
or people to talk to?

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.660
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: It was cool.

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.820
So I guess I've been working
with Nathan for about two

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.440
or three years now on the
"Scott Pilgrim" books, which

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.710
has been a more
and more fruitful

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.070
collaboration as it goes on.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.540
We can kind of read each
other's mind a little bit.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.200
He knows what I want, and
I'm happy with what he does.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.770
Volume 5, we just finished.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.500
I barely have any notes at all.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.708
It was just like, this looks
great, this looks great.

00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:37.100
Maybe change the color of
her boots, or whatever.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.540
And with "Seconds," I had a
very specific vision in mind.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.926
But I just send him a
vision board of stuff.

00:20:44.926 --> 00:20:46.550
RYAN SANDS: Like a
Pinterest board or--

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:46.730
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.440
No, it was an Evernote
file, actually.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.947
We us Evernote.

00:20:50.947 --> 00:20:52.280
I think Evernote is very clunky.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.380
But I still use it
because it's useful.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.380
I sent him pages from this
French comic called "Beauty"

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.270
by [INAUDIBLE] and
[INAUDIBLE], which

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.870
is so amazing, so beautiful.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.420
And the colors are so perfect.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.150
So I ripped it off, wholesale.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:16.220
And also the movie
"The Secret of Nimh."

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.090
RYAN SANDS: Oh yeah.

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.620
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: About
the mice, from the '80s.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:19.286
RYAN SANDS: Yes.

00:21:19.286 --> 00:21:20.250
I love that movie.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.499
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: I had
not seen it until last year,

00:21:22.499 --> 00:21:24.956
they played it at the screening
at the New Beverly in LA.

00:21:24.956 --> 00:21:26.870
So I saw that as
a double feature

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.000
with the Chipmunk Adventure.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
RYAN SANDS: "Secret of
Nimh" is scary, isn't it?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.950
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: It's
very dark and weird.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.900
But the color palette
again, was beautiful.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.220
And it was actually very
similar to the color palette

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.303
in "Beauty," so I sent him
a whole bunch of stills

00:21:39.303 --> 00:21:41.070
from that and pages
from "Beauty."

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.550
And then I had
already colored part

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.090
of the book in just a few tones.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:46.780
And I knew I wanted
a lot of red,

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.830
so it was very
intuitive from there.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.310
And he's very hands-on
and very dedicated.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.850
He would go through
the entire book.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:58.910
I mean, coloring
comics takes forever.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:21:59.530
It's horrible.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:00.320
RYAN SANDS: It's
like making sausage.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.310
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
It's horrible work.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.150
I feel bad for him.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.610
He's like a little
slave orphan boy.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.520
But he would go
through the whole book

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.140
and change the color of
one thing, just on a whim

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.725
without even me saying anything.

00:22:12.725 --> 00:22:14.850
He would be like, I just
don't like how this looks.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:18.370
He would do like
150 pages of work

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:21.470
just for himself, for
his own peace of mind.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.920
So again, that's how
dedicated he was to it.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.516
And it was crazy.

00:22:25.516 --> 00:22:27.640
RYAN SANDS: Did you do any
of that stuff in person?

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.642
Or was it all remote?

00:22:28.642 --> 00:22:30.350
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
I was gonna say next.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.830
Jason, my drawing
assistant, ended up

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:37.527
staying with me for like the
last-- it was like five weeks,

00:22:37.527 --> 00:22:38.610
but it was two and a half.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.984
And then he went
home for a week.

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:41.532
And then two and a half more.

00:22:41.532 --> 00:22:42.710
RYAN SANDS: A comic's camp.

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:43.010
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: So yeah.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.530
We totally camped out.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.000
He stayed at my house
for a month and a half.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.400
And it was great actually.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.780
I'd never worked side by
side with anyone on the books

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.634
before.

00:22:54.634 --> 00:22:56.050
I was worried it
would be awkward.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.960
But we got along really well.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.089
We spent most of the
time with headphones on,

00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:01.130
just doing our own thing.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.220
But then we would kind of
confer from time to time.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:09.040
And it definitely led to better
ideas and a more structured

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.790
visual approach
throughout the whole book.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.280
We were able to go over
everything in more detail.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.150
It was just fun.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:16.880
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.755
Yeah, it must be nice
to have another person.

00:23:18.755 --> 00:23:21.360
Because cartoonists
are a weird beast,

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.610
because you spend all this
time working on this thing.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.359
And then you hope
someone will look at it.

00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:27.840
And then you go to these cons
that are like summer camp.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.880
And you're like, Hi.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.597
Please like me.

00:23:30.597 --> 00:23:32.930
So to actually get to have
the creative process together

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:33.721
must have been fun.

00:23:33.721 --> 00:23:36.430
Did you-- I think I saw
you said in an interview

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.760
this week that the ending
changed a little bit.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.649
During that time, you kind of
reworked some of the ending.

00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:43.690
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.022
I rewrote it.

00:23:46.022 --> 00:23:48.230
I can't really remember what
the original ending was.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.400
And you guys probably
haven't even read it.

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.180
I just I ended up just having--
after a 16-hour work day,

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:57.120
I was lying in bed.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.790
I couldn't stop
thinking about the book.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.460
That's that whole thing
where when you stop working,

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.690
you try to stop thinking about
it, then the idea comes to you.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:12.650
I had this whole idea for
a new 16-page sequence

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.190
two weeks before the book
was supposed to be turned in.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.950
And yeah, somehow we did it.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:18.700
We did everything.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.280
Even though we still
had probably 40 pages

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.080
to do in those two weeks.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.064
We did the whole thing.

00:24:24.064 --> 00:24:24.980
RYAN SANDS: Deadlines.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.700
That's the only reason
any comic ever gets done.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.030
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Editorial and just the threat

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.992
of not having it out in time
for Comic Con or whatever.

00:24:33.992 --> 00:24:34.700
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.360
Wow.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.700
That's cool.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.270
I think we're going to
have some time for you guys

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.480
to ask questions in a minute.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.480
And then I think we'll do
a book signing after that.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.220
But I had a couple more things.

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.765
One thing I saw
you mentioned was

00:24:47.765 --> 00:24:49.620
that you're interested in games.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.910
And I thought a lot of your
storytelling and the characters

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.290
you created especially would
be such a great fit for games.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.020
Is that something
you're doing now,

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.455
or you're interested in trying?

00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:01.680
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.940
I worked on the "Scott
Pilgrim" video game

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.430
with a really cool team
of guys from Montreal.

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.120
And they are still doing work.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.080
And we're trying to
start a new game.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.330
Just like from the ground up.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.750
RYAN SANDS: Not
a "Seconds" game.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:16.410
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: No.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.701
Although I think a "Seconds"
game would be really cool.

00:25:18.701 --> 00:25:20.752
RYAN SANDS: It's like
"Cooking Mama" and then--

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:23.085
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: But it
has a time reversal mechanic.

00:25:23.085 --> 00:25:26.130
It's like Braid meets Tapper.

00:25:28.702 --> 00:25:31.160
I was playing a lot of Tapper
at this arcade near my house.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.993
RYAN SANDS: These are
like really good ideas

00:25:32.993 --> 00:25:34.660
we're throwing away
into the public.

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.701
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Well.

00:25:35.701 --> 00:25:37.010
Whatever.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.740
This is a confidentiality
agreement.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.010
You guys all signed that.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.124
Yeah.

00:25:44.124 --> 00:25:46.290
So I'm just trying to start
a game with these dudes.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:48.081
I won't say anything
about it, because it's

00:25:48.081 --> 00:25:49.870
super early stages.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.670
But yeah, trying
to create something

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.890
that satisfies me
as a storyteller,

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:55.581
but also I'm
working hand in hand

00:25:55.581 --> 00:26:02.710
with this game developer, Dom2D,
who is like a really cool guy.

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.490
I think it'll be really fun.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.560
And maybe it won't
be what I envision,

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:09.140
but I like that
process of-- basically

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.990
like a process of reduction.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.420
Like a huge idea
that gets scaled down

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.860
to this manageable
framework to actually create

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.650
something that'll get done ever.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:19.860
I still wanna do comics, too.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.400
But--

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.525
RYAN SANDS: If you do a JRPG,
it could get really big.

00:26:24.525 --> 00:26:26.650
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: We
immediately nixed that idea.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:28.105
But maybe next time.

00:26:28.105 --> 00:26:30.730
But this time we're going to do
something with a smaller scope,

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.450
but that also is
satisfying for me.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.480
My thing is I like characters.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.910
I like character interactions.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.080
I feel like there's not
enough of that in games.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:45.120
There's too much
focus on yourself.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.100
I think there needs to be more
interactions and friction.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.920
I think that's
what appeals to me.

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.055
I'm trying to-- at every
step of the way-- games that

00:26:54.055 --> 00:26:57.340
are sent to me, this whole
theoretical document.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.970
And I'm like, where can we
fit more humanity into it.

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:01.470
Yeah.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:02.368
It is a Google doc.

00:27:04.954 --> 00:27:06.120
I use a lot of Google Drive.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.399
Let's mention all
the Google products.

00:27:08.399 --> 00:27:09.440
RYAN SANDS: We don't, no.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.020
We don't do that.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.250
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: We did
use Google Drive for "Seconds"

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.100
though.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.305
But I paid for it.

00:27:13.305 --> 00:27:14.180
RYAN SANDS: Oh I see.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:14.440
OK.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.940
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
No one else did.

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:17.670
I was the boss.

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:19.740
RYAN SANDS: Yeah,
I think there's

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:22.480
a lot of cartoonists
trying out games now.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.920
I've seen a lot more people
going into that world,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.125
because of the
storytelling potential.

00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:28.250
That's an interesting spot.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:29.291
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:30.430
Art and graphics.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.755
Wait-- graphics are art.

00:27:32.755 --> 00:27:33.505
RYAN SANDS: Words.

00:27:33.505 --> 00:27:36.410
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Words and
pictures are in games, as well

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:38.301
as in comics, so it makes sense.

00:27:38.301 --> 00:27:38.800
Yeah.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.500
RYAN SANDS: That's cool.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.400
So I think we'll
open up to questions.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.515
If anyone in the audience
wants to ask Bryan a question.

00:27:45.515 --> 00:27:49.800
I'll give you guys a minute to
get your courage and thoughts.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.600
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
You guys are too chill.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.974
AUDIENCE: So I
was wondering, you

00:27:52.974 --> 00:27:55.130
mentioned that during
the "Scott Pilgrim" movie

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:56.840
that you were involved
with the making.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.214
And I was wondering
if there were

00:27:58.214 --> 00:28:00.520
any of the scenes or
parts of the movie

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.190
that you were not so happy with
the way that they turned out.

00:28:07.867 --> 00:28:09.700
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Even four years later, I

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.670
would hate to say it.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:12.900
Because so much work
went into all of it.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.720
And I respect all the work.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.370
And it's such a
complicated process

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:24.040
that it's hard to
pick anything out.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.330
And there's parts
of the movie that

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:29.050
are so much better than
the corresponding part

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.430
of the comic, in my mind.

00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.240
Like they were able to polish
it and make it funnier,

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.070
and make it more exciting,
and more visually

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.950
dynamic and stuff.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:43.580
So that was really
depressing as the cartoonist.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.530
I was like, I can never do this.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.830
I can never make
things this exciting,

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:53.596
because I'm just working
with static images.

00:28:53.596 --> 00:28:55.970
The other thing is, I got to
see a rough cut of the movie

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:57.303
before I finished the last book.

00:28:57.303 --> 00:29:00.610
So I feel like I got to
address some of my concerns

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.620
with the ending of
the movie in the book.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:07.026
Like I was able to
inject more affection

00:29:07.026 --> 00:29:08.150
for some of the characters.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.440
Because I think at the end
of the movie, if anything,

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.130
my complaint is that it becomes
action-oriented and loses

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.230
track of the heart.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:21.790
So with the last book, I was
able to give the characters

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:25.806
more time and more
love, I guess.

00:29:25.806 --> 00:29:28.620
RYAN SANDS: And the
book's the final word.

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.410
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Well, for some people.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.510
AUDIENCE: Now that
you've got "Seconds" out,

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:36.051
in terms of writing, what are
you kind of looking to do next?

00:29:36.051 --> 00:29:38.539
Can you give us
any sneak previews?

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:40.080
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Well like I said,

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.980
I think I'm going to
do some short stories,

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.430
because I just have various
ideas like kicking around,

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.540
that I wouldn't want to flush
out into a larger project.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:49.820
But that would be fun.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:51.560
And it would be fun
to do different art

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:56.450
styles and different genres,
and actually do a collection.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.250
And I'm trying to
write a video game.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:01.759
What else am I trying to do?

00:30:01.759 --> 00:30:02.800
RYAN SANDS: Give us more.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.270
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.600
I want to do another series.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.680
That's my next big goal.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.650
Like I want to do
another-- my real followup

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.239
to "Scott Pilgrim"
kind of thing.

00:30:13.239 --> 00:30:14.780
But it's probably
still a year or two

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.790
off before I'll start that.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.770
It'll be great.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:23.490
Yeah, I'm thinking
about serialization.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.770
Because "Scott Pilgrim" was like
one book a year, or one book

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:28.730
every 15 months or whatever.

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:32.010
And I want to try to
and do more than that,

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:34.470
or more granular level
of serialization.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.740
But I just don't know
what format will be best.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.907
So I'm just kind of looking
at my options right now.

00:30:38.907 --> 00:30:40.489
RYAN SANDS: I know
from other friends,

00:30:40.489 --> 00:30:43.070
they said that serializing
a comic changes the way

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:44.534
they write it, in a major way.

00:30:44.534 --> 00:30:46.450
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: I
really want to try that,

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:47.922
because I've never done it.

00:30:47.922 --> 00:30:50.380
AUDIENCE: As an artist, I was
really curious about the type

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.171
of media that you use
when you're drafting,

00:30:52.171 --> 00:30:54.020
and when you reach
the final stages.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.670
Like, are you on a tablet?

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:57.940
Is it all hand done?

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.360
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
That's a good question.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.550
For this book, I used the Wacom.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.420
How do you say it?

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.310
Wacom.

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.810
Wockem.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.390
I've seen them say it
in official videos,

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:13.400
and I still can't do it.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.170
Anyway, I use a tablet screen.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.790
Cintiq, for the penciling stage.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:21.739
So I did all the roughs,
laid out the panels.

00:31:21.739 --> 00:31:23.530
It's a lot easier to
do panels in Photoshop

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.190
because you can
do straight lines.

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.400
And you can move stuff around.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.830
It's very fluid.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.360
So that made sense to me
to compose things that way.

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.800
And then I've got a
large format printer,

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.760
and I printed everything
out in blue lines.

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.980
And I ink it traditionally
with a brush and ink.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.164
So that's my backwards
approach to comics.

00:31:44.164 --> 00:31:46.330
RYAN SANDS: Jillian Tamaki
does stuff that way, too.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.550
She uses Manga Studio,
and then prints it out,

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.030
and then inks the printout.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:50.310
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.726
Jillian is like
me in that we just

00:31:51.726 --> 00:31:55.030
like the tactile nature
of brush and paper.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:59.390
So yeah, that's what started
to make the most sense to me.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:04.890
I didn't get a
Cintiq until 2011.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:07.900
I started doing posters
and comic covers and stuff.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.600
And it's just so much
easier to compose graphics

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:16.040
and composition--
compose composition--

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.870
on a digital medium.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:22.470
And then I just much
prefer to draw with ink.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:25.750
AUDIENCE: So coming
from a Pen Ward's view,

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.170
we see his work generating
a lot of opportunities

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.830
for new, younger creators
who are then able to grow out

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:34.570
of it, especially from
animations standpoint.

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:38.080
Do you see talking about
these next stages in life,

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.740
the success of the
cartoonist being

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.849
where you grow opportunities for
others, and you share the work?

00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:46.140
Or do you think there's still
a path for the individual

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.090
to sort of lock down in a
room, create great work,

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:52.420
and sort of churn it
out as an individual?

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.690
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
That's a complex question.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:33:00.210
I think I will
always do work that

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.580
is solitary to some degree.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.210
And like what you say about
Penn Ward and "Adventure Time,"

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.460
to me it's complicated,
because "Adventure Time" is not

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.475
a comic.

00:33:11.475 --> 00:33:12.100
It's a cartoon.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.600
It's a totally
different medium, and we

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.820
have lots of cartoonists
friends who work on it.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.849
And I don't think any of them--
some of them do animation--

00:33:20.849 --> 00:33:22.640
but most of them just
do storyboards, which

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.300
is like a form of comics, but
it's all behind the scenes.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.690
It's not really
for the public eye.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:34.200
So I don't-- I'm glad all
my friends are getting work.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.110
But at the same time, I
wish they could get money

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.450
doing their own work.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.860
So really I feel like
my goal in life--

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.740
aside from my personal
creative goals--

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:50.190
is to somehow help
my friends all

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.849
become rich by doing
their own thing.

00:33:52.849 --> 00:33:54.140
RYAN SANDS: Like Biggie Smalls.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:54.680
You bring them up.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.055
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Yeah exactly.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.510
You're a small publisher,
and you're stuff is so cool.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:06.080
And there has to be more
ways for what you're doing.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:09.046
That's my goal, is to take
any money and notoriety

00:34:09.046 --> 00:34:11.170
that I have, and kind of
trying to turn it to those

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:12.929
ends, and try to
help people I know

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.530
who are deserving of success.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:20.429
Because I don't need to go
any further success-wise.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:24.957
I think I've gone as
far as I need to get.

00:34:24.957 --> 00:34:26.540
If that answers any
of your questions.

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.159
I don't know.

00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:31.530
RYAN SANDS: "Adventure
Time" is like Star Wars.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:35.520
Now it's like a place where
other stories can happen.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.060
And that can only happen
through collaboration.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.179
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: And so
many of my favorite cartoonists

00:34:42.179 --> 00:34:44.030
and people work on that show.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.290
And they're making
beautiful work.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.130
I don't really watch
"Adventure Time."

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.590
I watch the occasional episode,
and they're always great.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.852
But I just want to read more
comics from those people.

00:34:53.852 --> 00:34:54.560
RYAN SANDS: Yeah.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.199
Definitely.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:56.420
We talk about that a lot.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.190
They have health
insurance and jobs.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:59.149
But then we don't see--

00:34:59.149 --> 00:35:01.523
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: But I want
to see more of their work.

00:35:01.523 --> 00:35:03.310
RYAN SANDS: More of
their comics, yeah.

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.570
AUDIENCE: I was curious.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.520
Do you ever have
commitment anxiety?

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.830
Like this comic,
it's going to take--

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.500
I have to put in so
many hours to this.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.500
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yes.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.110
AUDIENCE: Sort of
like-- am I sure

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.857
I want to spend time with these
characters that I've chosen?

00:35:20.857 --> 00:35:22.190
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Seven years.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.690
Yeah.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:24.509
AUDIENCE: Is that
something you work past?

00:35:24.509 --> 00:35:25.550
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:28.740
Well when I started
"Scott Pilgrim,"

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:33.080
I set out to do something that
would take years of my life.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.009
It was a given that
it would take--

00:35:35.009 --> 00:35:36.425
if I was going to
do six books, it

00:35:36.425 --> 00:35:39.590
would take at least six years.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.590
So that's kind of a big
thing to commit yourself

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:45.550
to when you're 24, 25-years-old.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:47.687
And you don't really
know what that means,

00:35:47.687 --> 00:35:49.520
and it's impossible to
know what that means.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.000
But that is what
I set out to do.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.214
I like comics that
are longer, that

00:35:55.214 --> 00:35:56.630
have more of a
span to them, and I

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.270
like exploring
characters over time.

00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:01.220
So I just thought that
that's what I had to do.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:02.480
And I'm glad I did it.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.159
And then this
"Seconds," I thought

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:06.700
it was going to take
maybe two years.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.410
It ended up taking about four.

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:11.210
Which sucks.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:14.679
And I mean, I had the
idea for "Seconds"

00:36:14.679 --> 00:36:16.470
right after the first
"Scott Pilgrim" book.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.490
So after like book three
or four, I was like,

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.420
can I just stop doing
"Scott Pilgrim" forever,

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.400
and just do "Seconds" instead?

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:24.900
Yeah.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.330
There's always moments of doubt.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.580
And then I just funneled
all those moments of doubt

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.540
into my book about doubt
that is called "Seconds."

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.810
And in doing "Seconds," it
was like-- so like halfway

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:41.260
through "Seconds," I did 150
pages of roughs on the Cintiq.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.310
And then I hurt
myself, and I literally

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:45.530
couldn't hold a
pen for six months.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:48.240
I thought I would
never finish the book.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.140
And I can't believe I
did finish the book.

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.580
There's like parallel
realities, like this

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.860
is the best one for sure.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.450
Or maybe there's one
where I didn't get hurt.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.650
That would be better.

00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:02.609
So this is pretty good.

00:37:02.609 --> 00:37:03.816
I'm glad I finished the book.

00:37:03.816 --> 00:37:05.310
Because yeah,
there's self-doubt.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.240
There's physical obstacles.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.820
And life gets in the way.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:15.210
But I'm just driven to
actually tell the story.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.970
RYAN SANDS: Gives you a lot
of time to simmer the idea.

00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:18.470
Right?

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.310
Like suss out what's
actually good about it.

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.620
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.870
I think the time off
in the very middle

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.660
of the book actually helped.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.520
Which sucks to think about.

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.130
I wouldn't want to
go back four years

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.390
and tell myself, oh,
you're gonna spend

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.260
almost a year not
working on this book,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:39.150
and just thinking about it,
and feeling bad about yourself.

00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.960
But it's like it all
ends up in the book.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.527
And I think it's a
stronger book for it.

00:37:44.527 --> 00:37:45.610
AUDIENCE: I got a haircut.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.790
But I'm not a fan or anything.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.100
RYAN SANDS: You guys can't
see, but there's a cosplay.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.040
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Come here.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:52.790
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:56.800
And this is Ramona here
in roller blades, too.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.045
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
That's just her outfit.

00:37:59.045 --> 00:37:59.920
She's not dressed up.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.730
RYAN SANDS: We have cos
players in the building.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.856
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Do you work here?

00:38:05.856 --> 00:38:06.810
Where's security?

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:08.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.330
My little story is that
I was Scott Pilgrim

00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:11.496
for two Halloweens in a row.

00:38:11.496 --> 00:38:15.450
And I was devastated how few
people in the techy community

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:16.370
recognized it.

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.494
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Really?

00:38:17.494 --> 00:38:18.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.240
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY:
Do they watch movies?

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.970
They download them, but
then don't watch them.

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:27.549
They put them on a hard drive.

00:38:27.549 --> 00:38:29.090
AUDIENCE: Did I even
have a question?

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.600
Oh, do you like web comics?

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.570
What's your thought?

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:34.940
Have you ever considered
a daily, weekly comic

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:35.520
or something?

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.882
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: No.

00:38:36.882 --> 00:38:39.040
Hm.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.050
I haven't been reading
a lot of them lately.

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.630
Some of my good friends do them.

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:46.420
Octopus Pie by Meredith Gran.

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.550
It's one of my favorites.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:50.589
She's one of my favorite people.

00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:53.172
RYAN SANDS: You could serialize
your new thing online and then

00:38:53.172 --> 00:38:54.000
collect it in books.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.630
This is what a lot of
people are doing now.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.671
BRYAN LEE O'MALLEY: Yeah.

00:38:56.671 --> 00:38:58.465
I mean, that's an option.

00:38:58.465 --> 00:38:59.840
A lot of people
are doing-- aside

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.670
from "web" web comics--
a lot of people

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:05.369
are doing online PDF
sales and stuff like that,

00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:06.285
which I think is cool.

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.221
But most of my friends aren't
doing "web comic" web comics

00:39:13.221 --> 00:39:13.720
right now.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:17.500
I don't know who's doing them.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:20.015
I'm not really paying that
much attention to them.

00:39:20.015 --> 00:39:22.390
RYAN SANDS: Can everybody help
me thank Bryan for coming.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:24.540
Thanks again, Bryan.
