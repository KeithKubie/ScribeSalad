00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.160
We've got four numbers here.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.850
What I want to do is try
to round each of these

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.720
to the nearest 10 and
to the nearest hundred.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.130
So I encourage you to pause the
video and try that right now.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.360
So let's make two columns.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.900
Let's make one first
for the nearest 10

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.612
and then make another
column for the nearest 100.

00:00:22.612 --> 00:00:25.120
And let's start with 154.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.370
So 154, what is the
multiple of 10 above 154?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.189
Well, it's 160.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.640
And the multiple of
10 below 154 is 150.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.950
So we're going to round
up to 160 or down to 150.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.300
Well, when we're rounding
to the nearest 10,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.990
we need to look
at the ones place.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.830
One place to the right of the
place that we're rounding.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.150
So we look at this
4 in the ones place.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:58.320
Since 4 is less than 5,
we round down to 150.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.400
Now, let's think about
that same number,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.442
rounding to the nearest hundred,
so 154 to the nearest hundred.

00:01:05.442 --> 00:01:07.650
So now we need to think
about if we were to round up,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.680
what's the multiple
of 100 above 154?

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.980
160 isn't the multiple of 100
The multiple of 100 above 154

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.550
is 200.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.490
What's the multiple
of 100 below 154?

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.300
Well, that's going to be 100.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.860
So if we're going to round
to the nearest hundred-- so

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.260
we look at the hundreds place.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.850
We'll look one
place to the right

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.750
of that, which is
the tens place.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.320
If that place is 5 or
greater, we round up.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.730
If it's less than
5, we round down.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.272
Well, this is clearly 5
or greater so we round up.

00:01:39.272 --> 00:01:40.230
So this is interesting.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.720
When we rounded to the
nearest 10, since we had a 4

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.710
in the ones place,
we rounded down.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.660
But when rounded to
the nearest hundreds,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.760
since we had a 5 in the tens
place, we rounded up to 200.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.960
Let's do some more of these.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.770
This is fun.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.270
So 4,674.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.110
The multiple of 10
above that is 4,680.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.620
The multiple of 10
below that, 4,670.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.560
Remember, we're concerned
only with the multiple of 10.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.000
So do we round up or down?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.400
Well, we're thinking about
rounding the tens place.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.520
So that's why it's either going
to be an 8 if we round up,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.380
or a 7 if we round down.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.330
To figure that out, we
look at the ones place.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.440
If the ones place is 5
or greater, we round up.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.410
If it's less than
5, we round down.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.053
It's, once again, less than
5, so we round down to 4,670.

00:02:41.053 --> 00:02:43.344
Now let's round the same
number to the nearest hundred.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.610
What's the multiple
of 100 below this?

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.900
Well, the multiple of
100 below this is 4,600.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.510
The multiple of 100
above this is 4,700.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.780
If we're trying to think
about rounding to the nearest

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.980
hundred, we want to
look at the tens place.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.840
The tens place is 5 or greater,
so we round up to 4,700.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.790
Now let's tackle 9,995.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.297
And once again,
always try to pause

00:03:15.297 --> 00:03:16.880
these, if you haven't
done so already,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.020
to try to do this on your own.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.890
So 9,995.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.880
What is the multiple
of 10 below this.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.180
Well the multiples of
10 below this is 9,990.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.400
And what's the multiple
of 10 above this?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.785
Well, if you increase this by
10, you actually get to 10,000.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:41.160
So you might say, hey, well
isn't this a multiple of 100,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.720
and actually this is a
multiple of a thousand--

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.280
it's also a multiple of 10,000.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.260
It's all of those,
but the multiple

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.610
of 10 right above
9,995 is 10,000.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.090
You just have to add a little
bit to this to get to 10,000.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.990
Or the multiple of 10
below it is clearly 9,990.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.560
10 more than that
gets you to 10,000.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.990
So how do we around this?

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.880
Well, once again, if we're
rounding to the nearest 10,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.300
we want to look
at the ones place.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.890
The ones place is 5 or greater
so we round up to 10,000.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.450
Now, let's round to
the nearest hundreds.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.260
You should be getting
used to this now.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.529
To the nearest hundreds, what
is the hundreds below this?

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:26.120
Well, it's 9,900.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.590
What is 100 above this, the
next multiple of 100 above this?

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.230
Well, if you add 100 to 9,900
you once again get 10,000.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.564
So how do we decide whether
to round up or down?

00:04:37.564 --> 00:04:39.480
Well, we don't look at
the ones place anymore.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.040
We're now rounding to
the nearest hundred.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.831
So we want to round to
the nearest hundred.

00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:44.850
To do that, we look
one place to the right,

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.730
which is the tens place.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.140
If this is 5 or
greater, we round up.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.240
If it's less than
5, we round down.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.830
It is 5 or greater so once
again we round up to 10,000.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:06.590
Now we have one more, 8,346.

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.860
The multiple of 10
below it is 8,340.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.550
Multiple of 10
above that is 8,350.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.000
If we're going to round
to the nearest 10,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.120
we need to look
at the ones place.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.500
The ones place is 5 or
greater, so we round up.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.672
Now, let's round to
the nearest hundred.

00:05:30.672 --> 00:05:40.640
8,346, the multiple of
100 above this is 8,400.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.179
The multiple of 100
below this is 8,300.

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:47.095
Notice we're rounding
to the nearest hundreds.

00:05:47.095 --> 00:05:50.710
If we were to round up, the
hundreds place becomes a 4.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.030
If we round down, the
hundreds place stays at 3,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.997
but it's followed by zeroes.

00:05:54.997 --> 00:05:56.830
If we want to round to
the nearest hundreds,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.170
we need to look
at the tens place.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:05.189
The tens place here is less than
5, so we round down to 8,300.

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:07.230
Notice, again, when we
round to the nearest tens,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.000
we rounded up to 8,350.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.620
When we round to the
nearest hundreds,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.120
we rounded down to 8,300.
