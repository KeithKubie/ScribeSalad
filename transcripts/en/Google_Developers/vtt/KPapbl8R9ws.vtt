CLIFF SAMANIEGO: Hi,
I'm Cliff Samaniego

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.630
from Google Play Games
Business Development team.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.790
Let's talk about Google
Play Game Services' Sign-in

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.000
in Best Practices.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.500
First off, why should we
care about signing users in?

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.540
For users signing in to
Google Play Game Services,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.310
it's the first step in
unlocking achievements, creating

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.910
competition with leaderboards,
saving a player's game state,

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.890
and opening up multiplayer
game possibilities.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.470
For game developers,
getting users signed in

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.050
will allow you to utilize
Play Games Analytics.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.720
If you're unfamiliar with
Play Games Analytics,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.960
it's a near-zero analytics
feature in the developer

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.240
console that provides more
insight into your player base

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.050
and user engagement with
games that will help measure

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.200
overall business success.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.660
From these insights
you'll be able to assess

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.400
the health of your
game's business

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.650
through performance highlights,
understand business drivers

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.800
through your games
active players,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.980
learn about retention
numbers, and balance

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.190
your in-game economy
with sources and syncs.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.730
This in turn can help you better
manage your game's mechanics

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.430
and performance,
leading to higher game

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.950
retention and monetization.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.760
OK.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.640
So now let's look at sign
in flow best practices.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.520
There's three ways to integrate.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.800
First, an automatic sign
in upon game launch.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.990
Second, an automatic sign
in upon finishing the game

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.130
tutorial.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.000
Third, feature a sign
in button prominently

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.960
upon launching your game.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.460
Automatic sign in on game start
is the most effective sign

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.900
in option, and this
is what we recommend.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.320
Here's some examples of good
sign in implementations,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.310
"Clash of Clans" by
Supercell and "Marvel Contest

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.570
of Champions" by Kabam.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.010
As you can see, after
launching the game,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.050
Google Play Game Services will
effortlessly walk the user

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.680
through the sign in flow.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.900
Another interesting
example of automatic sign

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.440
in is "Racing Rivals" by Glu.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.570
Not only does the game
show auto login or auto

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.840
sign in upon game
start, but it also

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.200
provides a clear added value
to the user for signing in.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.920
As you can see, the dialogue
box prompts the user to sign in

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.510
and shows the value
proposition of accessing

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.740
the game on all devices.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.020
Adding automatic sign in upon
finishing the game tutorial

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.020
is another effective way to
ensure high sign in rates.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.660
This is the best
for developers who

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.020
want their users to immerse
themselves in game tutorial

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.310
before asking them to sign in.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.040
This is a trade
off between letting

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.730
the player get enticed
by the game early

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.910
and locking sign in thereafter.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.500
A great example of this
is "Wonderball Heroes".

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.460
The last way to
implement sign in

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.370
is to have a
prominently placed sign

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.960
in button on the primary splash
page upon opening the game.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.260
Definitely avoid placing the
login button behind a settings

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.090
menu or buried
elsewhere in your UI.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.600
Here's a few examples of
how best to display the sign

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.040
in buttons within a game.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.100
"Turbo Dismount" by Secret
Exit and "Top Eleven

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.100
Be a Soccer Manager"
by Nordeus are examples

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.040
of good implementations.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.790
Let's check these out.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.730
No matter what sign
in flow you choose

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.240
you should always attempt
a silent sign in whenever

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.580
the user starts up the app.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.900
This will make sure that if a
user has signed into your game

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.990
previously they will be
automatically signed in again

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.130
as soon as they start your
game, no dialogue or button

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.150
clicking required.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.860
A good example is "BombSquad"
by Eric Froemling.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.090
Also, if you're going with
the automatic sign in flow,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.450
you should track and
store whether or not

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.260
the user has declined
to sign in previously.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.380
If that's the case,
then you shouldn't

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.570
try to automatically sign them
in upon opening the game again.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.760
You should still, however,
add a sign in button

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.840
because you want to give
them an opportunity to change

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.130
their minds at a later time.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.820
Branding guidelines for
Google Play Game Services

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.920
iconography can be found here.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.360
In summary, there's
three recommendations

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.079
we have for sign
in best practices.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.754
First, adding an automatic
sign in upon game launch

00:04:21.754 --> 00:04:25.320
is our preferred method and one
that will provide the highest

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.900
sign in rates.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.300
Second, add an automatic sign
in upon finishing the game

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.440
tutorial.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.970
This will immerse
users in the tutorial

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.510
before asking them to login.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.390
Third, feature a sign
in button prominently

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.500
upon launching
your game and avoid

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.430
burying it behind menu screens.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.450
Now that you're armed with
our Sign-in Best Practices

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.500
go out there and get
your user signed in.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.850
