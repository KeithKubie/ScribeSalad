Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay Moron. Addition to key ins in particular. Today we're talking about Cyclo addition, addition to make rings. So we'll talk some more about epoxides then owes analysis and how asset towels play a role in ozone analysis. And then we'll get on, I hope to transition metal catalin assists hydrogenation and polymers polymerization. So we're talking and remember it reaction without canes, the reagents are called electrophilic, but their nuclear fillic as well. And we've talked about these and at the end last time we were talking about epoxidation, which we'll continue with now and then about ozone analysis and about things attached to metals, hydrogen attached to metals and Al groups attached to metals. Okay. So this is where we were last time to remember. There were a whole bunch of arrows we drew happening all at the same time, although not in perfect synchrony. Some were a little more established at the transition state than others.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Now, after class, uh, I was asked, wouldn't it have been simpler to abbreviate arrows is in textbooks. So you don't draw quite as many arrows. Uh, I didn't point this out, but there was a reason I drew so many arrows. You might imagine that you could abbreviate it this way, right? Which shows, uh, the electrons here forming a bond, the electrons here going to here to make a double bond. This double bond coming down here to make a single bond. And this bond coming over here, that accounts for all the electron pairs, but it doesn't account for them properly. And the reason it doesn't is some of them are pie and some of them are sigma. So it can't be the same electron pair that's being both pie in the plane of the ring and sigma or sigma in the plane of the ring and pie out of the plane of the ring.

Speaker 1:          01:51          So I accounted for the electrons differently and drawing those, uh, in drawing those arrows as to which kind was doing what. Okay. So at the very end, last time we were talking about ethylene oxide, how it was a big item of commerce, 20 million tons a year and $20 billion because of the importance of ethylene glycol. And then we were going to see how you get ethylene glycol from, from either base or acid. Catallo assists with water, uh, on ethylene oxide. So let's start with base catallo assists. Where's it going to attack Bowie? What do you say? Where will ooh minus attack, uh, ethylene oxide. What kind of reaction is going to happen?

Speaker 2:          02:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:40          Okay, so you want to take off a proton, is that right?

Speaker 2:          02:43          Huh?

Speaker 1:          02:44          To attack a hydrogen so as to remove a proton attack. Sigma Star C h does that with the idea. Now, the problem with that is that the ANA and you get is not at all a good an ion, right? It's a carbon and iron. The makes it better than most carbon and ions, but not that much better. My guess is it's PKA is someplace in the forties, right? Whereas the PKA of o h minus is, is, or of a water to give. O h minus is, is, uh, is 16, right? 15 and a half. So that there's a, a, whatever that is, that 25 powers of 10 different. So it's going to be very hard to pull off a proton. Even though hydroxide, you're right. Is A, is a strong base, better as a base than what you'd expect for its nuclear Felicity. So how about another possibility if it's not going to be ch Sigma Star, what will at attack? Oh, of course. Ethylene oxide is an ether, right? And ethers don't usually undergo displacement because it's a bad leaving group. Right? Oh, minus is not a great leaving group. Aurel minus. But this is a special case. Can you see why anybody else got an idea? Yeah. Orphaned high strain, right? We'll, we'll make that bod week. So in fact it is a backside attack, an sn two reaction on the CEO Sigma Star, right? Which opens the ring because of the ring strain

Speaker 1:          04:22          to give that. And now that of course picks up a proton from water. The PKS are essentially the same for an alcohol and water and generates ethylene glycol. The item of commerce we were interested in making. Now suppose we're going to do it with h plus Ketalysis who's got an idea for that one? Rahul, you've got an idea how, how's h plus

Speaker 2:          04:50          [inaudible]?

Speaker 1:          04:54          What about

Speaker 2:          04:55          the oxygen,

Speaker 1:          04:57          right? The lone pair on the oxygen. Okay, so it'll come down, tack the lone pair on the oxygen to get this. And now what do you expect for the reactivity of this thing? Rahul will keep us going, right? There's still ringing strain and you've got a much better leaving group now. Oh. Plus rather than, oh going to become oh minus. Right? So now even water can do, it doesn't have to be hydroxide. So we've got a great leaving group. Water comes in and does the trick and again, we get it. So either acid or base catallo assists with water. We'll convert a ethylene oxide into ethylene glycol. But there's another possibility for a nucleophile in this system, right? Which is this old minus,

Speaker 2:          05:42          right?

Speaker 1:          05:43          So you could imagine it coming down there and doing the trick and now you get another o minus that can attack again, another o minus that could attack again. So you can get a whole bunch of these ch two ch, two o ch, two ch two o's strung. So you can get up poly ether, there can be, you know, as few as three to call it poly. Uh, although often you'd call that Alango meaning a few, but up to 20,000 units or more can be strung together that way. And these things are big items in commerce as solvents among other things. There are also used in toothpaste and in a paint ball and lots of different applications. Okay. And here's another application. So you can take the trimmer, right? That's three of the ch two O is put together. Okay. And it's been treated with potassium hydroxide to make the salt. Right. And you could treat another one of the alcohols with uh, one of the agents to convert Oah and to cl like thigh and chloride. Right. And get a dichloride. Can you see what I'm after here?

Speaker 1:          06:52          What kind of reactions I want to do Alan, right. Sn Two. It's a Williamson ethers synthesis, right? R O minus reacting with RCL to make a cc by or Osi bond. And what's the product going to be? Right. That's how he teen crown six has made. And in fact, this is what's called an org sin crap. Org Sin is organic syntheses there. Uh, every year they put out one of these volumes, I'll pass around so you can look at them, which have various interesting preparations that have been, uh, tested by, um, by, uh, Kemp proposed by competent chemists and tested by them, right? To make sure they work right. Here's another thing, send it back the other way. Okay. So you can see each of these has the order of 20 really good, uh, uh, careful descriptions with lots of information about exactly how you do it, where you get the, where you get the, uh, starting materials and lots and lots of footnotes.

Speaker 1:          08:05          So textbooks don't have time to do this, right? And, and original publications in the paper often haven't been carefully checked, but if you want to see how our reaction is really carried out, this is a very good source and it tells you exactly what faithful yields are, not ones that have been exaggerated. Okay. So then one of the orgs didn't, perhaps is of a 18 crown six. It's interesting and you might think about that, that they used the potassium salt, right? The potassium hydroxide was the one they made the dye and ion with. You might think why that might be. Oh, actually, incidentally, here I have the, uh, if you click on that, you will get a, this, uh, which is the description of how to make 18 crown six on the web from org sin. Okay? So that's how, that's how we open ethylene glycol.

Speaker 1:          09:02          Now, uh, notice that if the, if the epoxide is unsymmetrical substituted on one side and not the other, then there are two different ways of attacking. For example, in the textbook, uh, it shows that you could attack the less substituted or the more substituted and it says it acid, the nucleophile generally becomes attached to the more substituted carbon in base. The nucleophile generally becomes attached to the less substituted carbon. So this is obviously a generality and one would be interested in seeing precise data to see just how selective it is. All right, so here's an example from the book where they used a sodium amid. So in three minuses, the nucleophile and indeed here with the anti and attacking it attacks the less substituted as you would expect that an sn two and gives a 41% yield of the product from attacking the less substituted carbon. Now do you find that then convincing in terms of uh, what in acid you attack one and then base you attack the other? No. What he say, why?

Speaker 1:          10:16          Yeah. Now of course you've been in lab and I wouldn't be surprised if from time to time you've been happy with a 41% yield, right? So if you really do get 41%, remember we've talked about one synthesis where 5% was plenty. So from a point of view of preparative being able to make this stuff 41% sounds pretty good, but if you're interested, does it really support that generalization that with base Catalin sis that is anti and attacking you attack the less substituted when you'd want to know what the other 59% is, if the other 59% were attacking the other carbon, that would be bad news for this generalization. Right? So, uh, so one has to be careful in reading textbooks because often references aren't given right about that 41% so here's, here's a, a generalization. It says that, here's, here's the, the other example with acid catalin [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          11:12          So it says that when you attack with acid, indeed the chloride goes more on the more substituted carbon. That's what the generalization was. But notice that the, that the product ratio is 55% to 45%. It's not 99 to one. Right? And then explains it by saying charge is the charges on the more substituted carbon. That is when you protonate the, Oh, that bridge is unsymmetrical. We've talked about that with more charge on the more substituted carbon. So that's the one that gets attacked. That's where the nucleophile ads is. It says, but notice that this is a tough thing to generalize or not a very, a reliable example to generalize with the 55 to 45 because that ratio is 10 to the 0.09. Right? Which means that the difference in activation energy for going one way and going the other is, uh, at room temperature is 0.12 kilocalories per mole.

Speaker 1:          12:15          And you're a sophisticated enough by now to know that that's nothing, you know, that's, that's only what, uh, uh, 25th as big as a hydrogen bond. Right? So it's true that it gives more of the more substituted one in this particular case, but you wouldn't feel very confident in, in interpreting that. Okay. So you might do a calculation to see what the minimum energy geometry is for such a protonated at Parkside. This is not a really high quality a calculation and it's in the gas phase. And of course we're solving is, could make a lot more difference than 0.12 kilocalories per mole. But anyhow, you could look and see where positive things would like to be or negative things would like to be on the Vanderwall surface of this molecule. So if you look up here at the top, remarkably enough, if when you drew this structure, you'd draw it.

Speaker 1:          13:08          Oh, plus, right? It's a trivalent oxygen. It's been the o of the three member during has been protonated. So you'd draw Oh plus, but notice that this is the energy of Proton would have on the surface of that, right? It's high near the oxygen, but it's 120 kilocalories higher near the hydrogen. That's the worst place to put a positive charge. So it's not what you would draw if you just put a plus charge on the oxygen. Right? So that's the worst place for hope for h plus it would be the best place for a negatively charged nucleophile. So the best thing would be to pull the proton back off again. Right? On the other hand, you could, if you turn the molecule upside down from the top right and look at the bottom of it, you see the two carbons that could be attacked and at that place, the energy for the Proton would be plus 140 there.

Speaker 1:          14:02          It would be plus 141.5 so it doesn't really, it's true that it's a little bit more positive near the central part near the more substituted carbon, but not very much. And of course it's sterically hindered there. So it seems to be very touchy to try to interpret this. But still there are many examples where it is more dramatic than that. Uh, here for example, uh, is our, our cases were from the textbook where the, uh, uh, carbon nucleophile does the attack. Now you notice that when the fennel, uh, attached to copper attacks, so that, so the polarization is such as the fennel is mostly plus a, pardon me, mostly minus. So it's the nucleophile although it's really more complicated cause the coppers around at the same time, but notice it, it attacks backside and it gives a 98% yield. So that's the kind of thing when you see it in the book that you can say, Aha, that's really something 55 45 is not the basis for confident interpretation.

Speaker 1:          15:07          98% is more like it. Okay. Or in this other example where it's 85 to eight attack at one comp at one position versus the other with base Catalin [inaudible] attacking is the generalization had said at the more sub at the less substituted carpet to give the 85% product. So there are plenty of examples that support this generalization, but it's not always reliable and it's important to be critical in looking at the evidence that people provide to support their generalizations. Okay. So that one shows stereo specificity. The other one shows Riggio specif specificity and much more impressive than that. 55, 45 example, 85 to eight, much more practical for synthesis purposes and much more convincing for interpretation purposes. Okay. So that, that much for the epoxides uh, now on to Ozu analysis, which takes us into other examples of, of Cyclo audition. Of course, forming the UPPP oxide is a three member of drinks. So it is a cyclo audition at forums a ring. But ozone is more interesting because it's three atoms, right? So we can imagine this shift of electron payers,

Speaker 3:          16:24          right?

Speaker 1:          16:25          Perhaps happening all at the same time to make a five membered ring. Right. And on the left is the train, the arrangement of those atoms in the transition state as calculated by quantum mechanics.

Speaker 3:          16:39          All right,

Speaker 1:          16:41          so we could look at the, at the, uh, uh, at the motion along the reaction. Coordinate both face on here. Uh, the side view as I said, and also the end view and noticed that the o three is bent so that the central oxygen is not as near the, at carbon's being attacked as the terminal oxygens are. Okay. So now watch and we'll watch it move. So the oxygen's moved down, the carbons move up and formed the bond. We'll reverse it and go back and forth several times. So you can see it's another one of these cases where it looks like the attacking group is rotating down toward the carbon is the carbon moves up.

Speaker 3:          17:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:21          Okay. So notice everything is happening at the same time. It's not that you form one bond and then the other bond.

Speaker 3:          17:28          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:29          Okay. So let's look at the orbitals that are involved in making two new bonds at the same time. So there must be two electron pairs that are involved. Okay, so there we have the Lumo on o three and the Homo on, uh, on ethylene. And you see, remember that that central carbon decentral oxygen up on top is getting into the act. It's back behind the screen. So you'll see the two reds of the lube oil on top or in position to make good overlap. And then give this, this, uh, orbital at the transition stage, which is the homo, those overlapping with one another to form, to be bonding. That's one electron pair. So that would account for one bond. But by the same token, you have the Lumo of the owl keyed on the bottom right, interacting with the Homo of o three up on top, and those overlap well and give a, the homo minus one.

Speaker 1:          18:19          So another pair of electrons get stabilized as these atoms come together. So two electron pairs get stabilized to bonds are formed. Okay, now this is psycholo edition of our Lilly one three dipole to alkenes. There are other examples besides ozone. Now a one three dipole is the thing like ozone. You may remember that in the third lecture, way back at the beginning of the fall, we talked about drawing valence structures for ozone. And the fact that it's not the lowest energy structure is not a three membered ring, but an open form, right? And the interesting thing about this, when you draw a Lewis structures, you can't draw a structure that doesn't have charges or free radicals on the Adams, right? So those examples are shown there. So these things are called one, three dipoles, there three atoms that row and all of the structures you can draw or dive polar.

Speaker 1:          19:15          But those, that's not the only example. And here on the exam from several years ago, I asked a question saying heavy learned that the elderly Pi system of o three remember Al Lilies means three P orbitals overlapping in a row. That's Ella, Lily. And that's obviously the case with ozone. So having learned that Al Lilly Pi System of ozone forms to bonds at wants to, an alkene has shown bottom right, left there. One might think to try the same thing with the apparently analogous Boron compound. I've not actually confidence at that molecule exists, but it might explain in terms of the orbitals involved why this might not work. It looks like the same thing. You have a one three dipole on the right and we draw air curved arrows to make the two new bonds. We have one three dipole on the left and we draw curved arrows to make the new bonds.

Speaker 1:          20:07          But why wouldn't the one on the right work? Okay, let's try to do a theoretical analysis of that. So here's ozone viewed from the top. Now if we rotate it, the central carbon at the central oxygen at the top back to look to see the p orbitals, we see that there are three p orbitals in a row, right? An Aloe Lake system, uh, so, and the lowest energy Pi orbital. Then we'll have them all overlapping favorably with one another. That will be psy one the lowest energy Pi orbital. It has no anti-bonding node and the middle atomic orbital will be largest it. We can choose the size of the P orbitals. On this of the three, right? There's an advantage to making the one that the sum of their squares has to be one. Why do you call that condition? I remember that's normalization, right? That the PR, the electron has to be somewhere with a probability. Total probability of one. So the sum of the squares has to be one, but they don't have to be the same size. Cemetery would suggest that the two ends should be the same size. Right? But the one in the middle could be smaller or bigger. And I say that it's a little bit bigger. Why should it be bigger? Why should you, why do you get advantage by having the one in the middle? Big compared to the ones at the end. If there some, some of their squares is, his lip is fixed.

Speaker 1:          21:38          What you want to get is bonding overlap, right? So the bigger the orbitals, the more overlap. What's special about the one in the middle? Why do you want to make it bigger, Lauren? It's overlaps twice, right? Good. Okay, so then the next one has a node in the middle that doesn't surprise you. And the highest one has two nodes. Now I'm confused by this because it may, in starting with three atomic orbitals and making three molecular orbitals, you have to use up to three atomic orbitals. So they have to, if you have more in one place, there has to be less than someplace else. Obviously there's none on the middle oxygen in the, in the one that has no node, that means that the others have to have more of that and less of what's on the end. It doesn't appear that way in this picture.

Speaker 1:          22:36          It doesn't appear that the central one is big, but in fact it has to be, and I think this is a, this is some, a artifact of the particular contour that's been chosen and I, I can't really explain it, but in general, the bonding one is as the favorable inside one is, is favorable as it can be big in the middle. The, the, uh, the second one with a node in the middle is obviously 50, 50 on the two ends and the top one will be big in the middle to be as anti bonding as it can be. It's a, you know, when they were good, they were very, very good. And when they were bad, they were horrid. Okay? That's the way it works out. Okay? So those are the three or molecular herbals we're going to be dealing with, okay? Now if you take another ally league system, like C H Two B, h, c h to the one we were, uh, talking about, right?

Speaker 1:          23:33          We can look at, it's a p orbitals and there's psy one and there's side too. And there's cy three. And this one does indeed show biggest in the middle. So that's satisfying. Of course, Boron is less electronegative than carbon, right? Less nuclear charge. So you'd expect the lowest orbital not to have so much of it and the highest orbital to have a lot of the less favorable orbital. Okay? And now if we look at a third example, carbon eel oxide, which you notice is, is uh, uh, carbon eel compound, h two CEO Formaldehyde with an extra oxygen on it. And that turns out also to be a one three dipole to be bent in the structure shown. And now it's not symmetrical end to end. So we see the same orbitals but they're distorted. This one, uh, this one looks mostly like the c double bond o Pie, but a little bit of the, of the, uh, oxygen on the end, right?

Speaker 1:          24:38          That one has a node in it and that one is mostly the anti-bonding Pi Star of carbon steel with a little bit of the oxygen on the end. Now, uh, why should it be that way? We'll notice that the carbon is much closer to the central oxygen than the central oxygen is to the terminal oxygen, right? So the big interaction will be between carbon in the central oxygen. So we could, we could first look at the interaction between carbon in the central oxygen and then look at the interaction of that whatever we get from that with the terminal oxygen, because the, we'll look at the strongest interaction first and then at the weaker one. So when we, uh, uh, that says what I just said and it will make a Pi and Pi star out of that. And now we're going to mix p o the, the terminal oxygen with Pi and Pi Star.

Speaker 1:          25:34          Okay. And we see it's closer to CW to the Pi than to the Pi Star. So we'll get three new ones that look like that. Okay. There's less mixing at the top, more mixing at the bottom, a better energy match. But cy one still looks mostly like the lower energy would Pi CEO, the Pi Star looks mostly like Pi, star of CEO, and this one looks mostly like the terminal oxygen. Okay. That's just to show that the orbitals are reasonable. So that's big on Pi and a little bit of the terminal oxygen. That's that one. Then you have one that's mostly the terminal oxygen, and then you have one that's mostly Pi Star.

Speaker 1:          26:20          Good. Now let's look at how many Pi electrons we put in to these systems. So we have to count electrons. So here we have three oxygens there, sigma bonds, but also unpaired electrons that are sigma in the plane of the three o's. Right? And there are also then if we count up electrons on the terminal oxygen's, there's one more electron on each of the terminal oxygens and two on the central oxygen. So they're four electrons in the PI system, right? So in these Pi orbitals, we have to put in four electrons. Okay? So that's two payers and they go into the lowest two orbitals of course. Okay. And the, so the homo is the middle orbital, the one with the node, and the Lumo is the one with two nodes. Okay. Now suppose we're going to take ozone and react it with an alkene. Okay?

Speaker 1:          27:20          So we bring an alkene up and remember it touches the two oxygens on the end. The ones in front, not the one that's behind the screen. So that'll make a nice bond, right? Nice bonding interaction. So the, the symmetry matches and we get stabilization of one pair of electrons. But if we take the homo, uh, of the Alkene, it mixes with the Lumo of the ozone. So another pair of electrons get stabilized that we make to bonds at the same time and make the five membered ring. So that's fine. And it's, and as I said here, don't worry about the oxygen in the center. It doesn't overlap because it's behind the screen. Now let's look, um, let's go over to look at the carbon eel oxide and count its electron. So that's the sigma electrons. And in the pie there's one from carbon, uh, one from oxygen and two from the terminal oxygen.

Speaker 1:          28:17          So again, there are four electrons, which means we're going to occupy those two. And again, uh, the homo is going to be the one with one node and the Lumo, the one with two nodes. And when we bring the alkene up, it's going to do it's trick. Okay? So that's fine too. That'll form. That'll form a five membered ring. Now let's look at the other one. The one that has boron in the center. Okay, so that one made two bonds, okay? Now the one with Boron in the center has just those two Pi electrons. The Boron is not contributing anything, okay? So we have only two Pi electrons and we occupy only the lowest of these orbitals. So it's the homo and the middle one is the Lumo. And now you see when you bring alkene in, it doesn't do the same thing because the homo of the alkene looks just like this.

Speaker 1:          29:09          And they're repulsive with one another, and the Lubo of the alkene looks pretty much like this. So it's homo with Homo Lumo with Lumo to give overlap and nothing gets stabilized. It's repulsive. Okay, so that one won't do the trick, right? There is no alkene homo match with that Lumo and no alkene Lumo match with that Homo. So the ones on the end, we'll do cyclo auditions and give a five membered ring, but that one with Boron in the middle won't because of how many Pi electrons it has. So you can't make two bond simultaneously for Cyclo addition to the Alkene of that hypothetical compound.

Speaker 1:          29:52          Are there any questions about that? Let's see. Monitor ugly, complicated, then review it. Okay, so let's look at what happens then in the process of Ozu analysis. Incidentally, that name, the license part means a loosening or a breaking apart. It seems a funny name, doesn't it? For a Cyclo edition, which is clearly bringing things together, but you'll see in a second what happens. It's pretty neat. Okay, so we bring an alkene in and and make those two new bonds by shifting the orbitals as waste as we just were describing. So we get this five membered ring, but this isn't so stable. Why is it not stable? Boy Tech, you've got an idea.

Speaker 1:          30:42          Yeah, those oxygen, two oxygen in a row of peroxide is bad. Three oxygens in a row must be even worse. What? Remember what makes two oxygens in a row bad hello in pairs repelling it. In this case we've got this compound is called a Moloz denied if you have to give it a name, but it's unstable because of the mixing of these homos with one another. The unshared pairs, so that's really bad. So it breaks apart. Of course it could break apart just the way it formed, but in fact it breaks apart a different way. It, it draws these curved arrows, right? Which is the same kind of thing we formed it with, but we're breaking different bonds from the one we formed. We formed this bond and this bond and now we're breaking this bond and this bond.

Speaker 2:          31:33          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:33          So it undergoes a reverse of the previous process assess to give that. So that's an Aldehyde plus this Carbonell oxide that we saw in just the previous slide, a one three dipole. But the carbon oxide could do a cycle of addition so it could reverse this, but it wouldn't because the product would be unstable. Do you see how to reverse it and make the product more stable where you don't have three oxygens in a row?

Speaker 2:          32:03          Anybody got an idea?

Speaker 1:          32:06          How did you make the Cyclo audition? Go of the one three dipole to the double bond and not have three oxygens in a row.

Speaker 2:          32:21          Elisa [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          32:29          uh, use what you just formed instead of the three hours. I'm not quite sure what you mean.

Speaker 2:          32:34          Do reacts the Ch two, Huh? We to see

Speaker 1:          32:39          h two with, oh, in other words, you could turn that molecule over and now do the Cyclo audition and you get this for which only has two oxygens in a row. And that's what, that's the product that you actually get by reacting. Uh, oh three with, with the, uh, alkene right now, this, this, uh, [inaudible] denied as it's called. Remember that first one with three options in a row was called a mole was and I, this one's called an ohs. Denied. That's not so fantastically important, but it's what they call them. This is called this. I call here a double asset towel. Now, an asset towel is a carbon that has two oxygens on it, right to ether oxygens. So you've got that one, but you also have that one. So it's a double asset towel, right? And as you can hydro hydrolyze asset towels with acid. So we're going to go through and figure out the mechanism of that as another practice in using curved arrows. So Natalie, I want you to start us with its acid catalyzed. So what's going to be the very first step?

Speaker 2:          34:06          Okay,

Speaker 1:          34:07          Proton will attack and unshared pair on the oxygen. Good. Okay. Now what's our goal? You know, there'll be lots of different things we can do as we go along, but as we try to formulate a mechanism, it's important to remember what kind of thing we're trying to do. And the kind of thing we're aiming toward is to remove Aro and replace it with Aho. That's the goal of the first step. So you've got to start it. Well, we've take a proton, come down and attack the unshared pair and we got that. Now what's the next step? Not only can you help us some more

Speaker 2:          34:46          positive change.

Speaker 1:          34:51          Now the positive charge, remember, makes a homo makes orbitals be high in energy, but the positive charge is not, uh, is not an orbital. It's just the charge. What's the, what the, what particular electrons would be or, or what particular vacant orbital would that be? We want a low vacant orbital. The plus charge will lower orbitals. What's the low orbital that we're going for?

Speaker 2:          35:19          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          35:20          there is any Pi electrons in this? No double bonds. Sigma Star. So the Coo Sigma Star. Okay. Right. So we can do this. Have you ever seen a reaction like that before where a leaving group leaves, leaves a cad ion?

Speaker 2:          35:40          Anybody seen a reaction like that, Alex? That's right. That's right.

Speaker 1:          35:45          Sn One reaction right where the leaving group leaves. We made it a good leaving group by putting the positive charge on there.

Speaker 2:          35:52          Now, uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          35:56          that's a primary cad ion, right? That doesn't look like a very good candidate for sn one. Alex, do you see any reason why sn one might be feasible? Why that cat eye? It might be better than you would imagine. I could tell you a reason why it's bad. Oxygen is electron withdrawing, right? High nuclear charge. So it tends not to let cat I form. It pulls electrons. Right? Why is that a good cat?

Speaker 2:          36:28          Anybody else got a suggestion? Helen Jones or the Ade or part? Debbie. The electrons. The electrons.

Speaker 1:          36:38          The adjacent oxygen gets stabilized, right? The unshared pair on the oxygen get stabilized. We can draw that resident structure. So it is an unusually stable cad ion. Not because c plus a stable, but because that low vacant orbital stabilizes the oxygen electrons next door. Okay, so we have, we got that cat on and now we have it's hydrolysis, right? So water is going to get into the act form a new bond and we have this and we've done what we wanted to do here. We're move aro and replace it with oil. With with, Ooh, of course we replaced it with h two o but that's no problem. We can lose the Proton to some, uh, to another water molecule. So we've done the first step here. Hey, we have what's called a half asset towel, a hemi acid towel. Remember, an asset towel had to our own groups attached to ch two. Now we only have one. The other is Ohi, Hemi acid towel. Now what do we call what? This whole process here, if you had to give it a name, a mechanistic name, what would you call it, Alex?

Speaker 2:          37:42          Sn One.

Speaker 1:          37:44          Okay, so that's an sn one reaction. And now the second goal is to remove the second aro, then a proton from o h and then we're going to generate a double bond here. We're going to get CEO double bond.

Speaker 2:          38:02          Okay,

Speaker 1:          38:03          so again, we have acid ketalysis. Where are we going to attack for this purpose,

Speaker 2:          38:09          Roy? Right? Attack

Speaker 1:          38:14          we, that's the one we want to lose. So we protonate there, right? Next step, Roy,

Speaker 2:          38:23          right?

Speaker 1:          38:23          Lucasarts and other sn one kind of thing, right? Where we make the cad ion. And now what's the last step? If we want to lose a pro marijuana lose age too

Speaker 2:          38:35          from here, we just do it. Right. Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:42          And what would you call that process? The one that went from here to here, if you had to give it a mechanistic name, Roy.

Speaker 2:          38:51          That's evil,

Speaker 1:          38:52          right? Fort Formation of the cat. So the process is he won. Okay, so that did it. What we've done, the overall transformation is to take water plus and asset towel acid ketalysis and get a carbon eel plus to our ohs, right? The one here and the one up there. So we started with the asset towel and water and the water comes across and we get to alcohols and the Carbon Eel, right? Just by the sn one and [inaudible] mechanisms that we just worked through. Okay. So that's how he, that's how you hydrolyze an asset towel. And here's an asset towel, right? Ch Two has two o's in it, so we can hydrolyze it or we can hydrolyze that one. We can hydrolyze both the one on the right and the one on the left and you see then what we've done. Now you see the license part, the breaking apart. What, what was the starting material? What, where, where were these carbons in the starting material? The very early before we added ozone,

Speaker 1:          39:56          the CC an Alkene, the CC double bond. What we've done is break the CC double bond and make two c o double bonds. So that's the license part. The breaking apart. We change a CC, double bonded to two c o double bonds. But notice that a biproduct is one of the byproducts is water. The other one is hydrogen peroxide, which is an oxidizing agent, right? So it gives two carbon EEOC compounds and hydrogen peroxide. But it turns out that hydrogen peroxide oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic acids, right? So this is a problem. So you don't just get the two carbon heals. You also have something that can react with the Aldehyde the carbon eel. So now as the book points out, you can add any of your books. We'll give this, uh, what they're there to post. Two ways you can cope with this problem. One is if you want to make the Aldehyde, put something else in that will react with the hydrogen peroxide to get rid of it.

Speaker 1:          41:03          So you use a reducing agent and we'll talk shortly about oxidizing and reducing agents, but things like uh, dimethyl sulfide or zinc, which destroys the hoh. So the book now gives examples where you see you could do this first, treat it with ozone to get the Ozo died, then treat it with water, but with zinc to there in order to reduce the hydrogen peroxide. And now you've got the Aldehyde in 93% that's the kind of yield that's really convincing. Right? Okay. Or here's another example where this one is first Ozen ISED and then when it's hydrolyzed is treated with the sulfur to get rid of the hydrogen peroxide and it gives us 75% yield of this Aldehyde and also the, the other one ch, two o from the other side of the double bond. Okay. The other possibility is just go with the flow. If it's going to oxidize, fine, put in more oxidizing agent.

Speaker 1:          41:59          Right? So there we use the dive methyl sulfide and their zinc as reducing agents. But if you add more of more hydrogen peroxide as has done here, then you can make the carboxylic acid and reasonably good yield. Like this one, for example, 85% yield. Okay? So that's uh, uh, that, those are the two possibilities. With those analysis, you break the CC double bond, but the carbons can become either carbon steels or carboxylic acids. Now how does that happen? How does the Aldehyde react with hydrogen peroxide to give a carboxylic acid? So let's try another mechanism here. Derrick, you're going to start us in.

Speaker 1:          42:49          What's going to react with what here? What's the home? What's the little minus on the ozone homo, the minus on the, Oh, the homo and what's well this via double like a two at the same time. Uh, let's suppose we aren't that sophisticated. All right then c double bond. O was the Lumo c double bond o Pi Stars. A good example. Where would it attack? Uh, see you, the uh, take the seat TAC. Let's see. Okay, so there we go. That's going to give this. Now, can you think of a second reaction, Matt? Let's go to you. Gosh. All right, well where do we have a homeowner? You know, hold on. The had apparently. Oh, okay. So here's the homo. Where's the Lumo? Lumo would be the o six sigma star. Oh. So we could do an sn two kinds of reaction, right? Like that.

Speaker 1:          43:46          That's what you had in mind. Okay. And it's going to form a three membered ring, right? With two oxygens next to one another. That's bad. That's not so great, right? Cause the oxygen oxygen's a lot of strong bond and the three member during is going to be strained. So that was a reasonable idea. That's why I wrote it that way. But if I had written it a different way, uh, you know, this week, okay? And the three, remember green is even worse. So forget that. So I'll write a different confirmation. And now this is a neat reaction. Again, we're going to use sigma star. Oh, with Oah Levy group. It's a weak bond. Oh, whoa. Right? But now we're doing something else. We're taking the electrons from ch to be the attacking group. So it's a, it's a hydride shift. And what pushes the hydride away, what allows it to do that is the fact that this, these electrons can go in and form a very strong CEO double bond at the same time.

Speaker 1:          44:44          Okay? And this will remind you, if you think about it, a little bit of another reaction. We looked at this hydride shift reminds you of this alcaide shift here. Remember when you had B minus, it was possible for these electrons to displace the O in that. Remember that's the second step of the hydro bore ration oxidation process. Okay? So it's the same kind of reaction. Okay? So it's a rearrangement and that gives the the carboxylic acid. But of course it also generates hydroxide, which reacts with the carboxylic acid. So that's the stable product is the carboxylase and I. Okay? So that's, that's why when you add, when you have hydrogen peroxide there, the Aldehyde becomes a carboxylic acid. Now here's the problem for you to work on. Uh, try doing the same thing here. We used base Catallo Isas. Suppose it were acidic conditions and you had to do it with the Siddiq Cadalli basis. Could you draw a mechanism that gets to the same place? Of course it would be protonated if it's a city of rather than basic. But see if you can put together a mechanism that's acid catalyzed that does the same thing.

Speaker 3:          46:00          Okay.

Speaker 1:          46:02          Now we've been talking about electrify electrophilic additions to carbon carbon double bonds. We talked already last semester about nuclear Philly condition to see o double bonds, right? So nucleophile versus electro file. But remember that that the addition to the carbon carbon double bond was both electrophilic and nuclear Philly. So it wouldn't be surprising if the addition to the co double bond is both nuclear fillic and electrophilic. So let's just compare it. Uh, so the nuclear family condition of methyl lithium carbon eel group, and we'll discuss this more when we talking about the chemistry of carbon eel groups is formally quite different because you had electro files to alkenes. But this cs shows you that there's really quite a similarity. So here on top, this is the transition state for the addition of methyl lithium. So the yellow or orange thing is lithium and the ch three of course is methyl. So that's it coming down on top of Formaldehyde, right? And that's the transition state. So what's happening is we're changing partners here with these electron payers, right?

Speaker 1:          47:14          Going toward that product, right? So we start with this methyl lithium and the car and the carbon eel. And there we have a homo, which is the lithium carbon bond, mostly won't carbon. That doesn't surprise, but notice that it's well set up to interact with the Pi Star of the carbon eel. And by the same token, here's Lumo plus one, a p orbital on the lithium, a vacant orbital, which is well set up to overlap with the red part of the homo. So again, there are two electrons that do the trick homo with Lumo Lumo with Homo, and you get both things happening at once. And we'll come back and talk about that more. But I just wanted to show you that it's not a completely different thing from the addition to alkenes. Uh, and now we're ready to talk about, uh, metals. Uh, let me just do a little bit at the beginning and then we'll go on next time to talk about more.

Speaker 1:          48:12          So Osmium tetroxide or per manganese is osmium or manganese minus in the center of four oxygens. Right? And notice that that looks like this, like ozone, these three atoms in a row above the two of the [inaudible]. So you could, there's it's homo and it's well set up to interact with the outcome, uh, uh, Lumo and there's, it's Lumo, which is well set up to act with that Alkene Homo, although I've, I seem to have messed up the animation a little bit. So here we can see it happening, right? It gives this osmotic Esther right now notice it forums to bonds at the same time. It's like this one three dipole are cyclo audition and that's the osmium analog of that sick lake asset towel that we looked at before. So we can imagine water coming in and breaking it apart to give a double bond to o h groups. So the product then from that Osmania Ester of hydrolysis is the dial. So you can make a carbon carbon double bond break this Pi bond and put two o h is on. So Osmium tetroxide is a very good a reagent for giving that in high yield. In other respects, it's not such a great reagent. And we'll talk about that next time.
