[Justine] Trackpad is poppin' up!

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.600
What's up guys, welcome back.
I'm Grant Thompson, The King of Random,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.600
and I'm iJustine.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.740
And today, we're here to answer a question
from the comments

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.400
from eddieg098, who wants to know,
"Would you damage a laptop

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.200
if you spilled liquid nitrogen on
the keyboard?"

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.500
So Eddie, we're doing
this experiment today for you.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.900
This is for you, Eddie.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.200
So this is a Chromebook. It is an Acer.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.940
We got this on Amazon Prime Now

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.900
and it arrived at my place in 15 minutes
when we decided to do this...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.400
-for you guys. Yeah.
-Amazing service. Unbelievable,

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.080
and I can't believe it. I'm jealous.
I don't have internet that fast.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.400
[laughter]

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.400
But this is going to be exciting.
So we're basically going to make

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.040
a Chromebook cake in this cake pan.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.000
Yes, we found a cake pan that
is the perfect size

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.800
for our Chromebook.
It just fits very nicely.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.000
And here we got Eddie's comment
sitting down there at the bottom.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.800
And it fits perfectly
in this cake pan.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.700
And oh yeah. A random cake pan,
look at that.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.400
The dimensions are absolutely perfect.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.300
There's like, maybe a quarter inch gap,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.460
on the front and back there.
It was like it was meant to be.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.500
[Justine] It was.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.860
[Grant] Okay, I think it's "Go" time.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.460
I think so, what do we do now!?

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.700
-So let's get you over here, 
-Okay.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.540
I've got this thermos that we've already
prefilled with liquid nitrogen.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.340
We set this laptop in a cake pan
and that's so we can

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.900
keep as much of the nitrogen
around the keyboard as we can.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.400
So I thought it'd be fun, let's go ahead
and play a video of liquid nitrogen,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.860
while we pour liquid nitrogen
on the computer itself.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.920
So fitting.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.800
[Grant on the Chromebook]
-viable idea because I don't want

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.700
to waste new technology unnecessarily.--

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.860
[snaps finger]
Alright.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.800
So we got our video playing right now.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.500
We've got our thermos full
of liquid nitrogen.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.100
It's time to pour it on the keyboard
and just see exactly how it reacts.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.700
-So, you want to do the honors?
-Yeah. I don't have my gloves on, though.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.100
-Is that bad?
-Um, I don't think you need gloves.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.800
-Okay... 
-I think you're good.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.300
-Should I just pour right in the middle?
-Your hands are insured right?

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.000
Hah...
[nitrogen sizzling Chromebook]

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.500
Nicely done.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
So what we see immediately
is you see all the nitrogen skittle across

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.300
and it's kind of collected
in the bottom here and...

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500
what's happening is it's boiling off,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.060
but at the same time
it's cooling everything down.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.640
-Is the video still playing?
-Yeah.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.620
Looks like it is. Alright.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.200
Well I say, let's go ahead
and add some more.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.600
Oh yes, that's what I say.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.100
I heard some cracking.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.100
We got Leidenfrost effect happening
on the trackpad right now.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.240
It was bouncing around
like a game of pong.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.000
Try a little bit more right there.
It was kind of fun how that was...

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.440
It's like a little hockey rink.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.899
-Okay look at that right there.
-Oh!

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.540
Boing.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800
I think I saw a little flicker
on the scr--

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.000
Oh no that was you.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.000
-That's the video.
-I think, I think some of this nitrogen

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.000
is flowing down inside the keyboard

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.200
but look the screen
is actually still playing.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.800
That's kind of cool.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.300
-Shall we put some more?
-Hehe it's a video

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400
of a phone in a phone in a phone
in a phone in a phone.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.600
[Justine] In a laptop.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.600
[Grant] Phoneception.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.920
Oh! I called it.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.300
This is looking pretty frosty.
You can see how it's changing color.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.100
See how the buttons used
to be black

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.000
and now they're
looking a little bit faded.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.720
-[Grant] Oh... 
-[Justine] Wow, look at that.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.340
-[Grant] Well, let's toss in some more.
-[Justine] Yes!

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.700
Let's go ahead and fill her up.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.380
Let's submerge that thing.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.880
-Oh. Something just happened, it froze.
-Oh. I heard some things.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600
It's still going.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.980
-[Grant] Alright let's keep her running.
-[Justine] Here you go, Eddie.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.720
Right on the trackpad, maybe.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.020
-Oh baby!
-Whoa!

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.800
[Justine] Trackpad is poppin' up!

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.500
[Grant] The trackpad just busted right up
off the computer here.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.900
Look at this, it's just peeled right off.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.300
It's peeling itself off. You--

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.540
If you ever wondered
what a trackpad looks like underneath,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.200
'cause,  there it is.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.300
This is just an adhesive.
You feel that it's sticky.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.200
-Wow!
-This is like a giant sticker.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.500
So we'll just like set that off
to the side.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.400
-Yeah.
-But the video is still playing.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.620
-And...
-The mouse, it's working.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.700
-Oh it is! You're right, it's still working.
-Like yeah, the cursor's right there.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.000
Even with my gloves on.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.820
-[Justine] Wow
-[Grant] That's kind of fun. Alright, so...

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.780
Did you say we need more liquid nitrogen?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.200
-[Justine] This is-- Aww...
-[Grant] It looks to me--

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.400
-[Justine] Screen just went black.
-[Grant] Did it?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.600
[Grant] Uh oh. Can we bring it back?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.180
[Justine] I think that...

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
-might be the end of our lappy-top.
-That might be.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.800
Let's go ahead
and throw the rest of it in anyway.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.300
Let's go ahead
and freeze this thing completely solid

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.600
and then see when it warms back up,
if we can get it to restore.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.000
This looks so cool.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.400
It's completely submerged right now.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.200
-[Justine] Should I keep pouring--
-[Grant] Yeah pour it all in.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.600
[Grant] Pour it all in.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.400
That is beautiful.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.100
So here we are guys.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.600
It's been about five minutes our computer
has been sitting in the liquid nitrogen.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700
I think it lasted about
like a minute and a half?

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.100
-Yeah.
-Before the screen went off.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.100
What's really interesting
is the screen has bent,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.200
it's actually warped and gone concave.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.840
And it's so cold right now,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.000
we can't even close it.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.600
That might even be
because the screen has warped.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.900
Look at Eddie's comment.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.400
Eddie's comment
is soaked right through, look at that.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.760
You can see,
it dries off pretty quickly though.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.980
There's actually nitrogen
inside the keyboard.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.080
-Look at that.
-Wow.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.000
If I shake it, I can get it to drip out.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.280
[Justine] Yeah look,
it's all dripping right there.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.600
[Grant] And my hands are freezing,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.300
-and the buttons are falling off. Ooh.
-What was that?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.800
You know that was, uh...

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.380
-the little bottom,
-Oh, it's not important.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.400
Whatever those are,
the little support tabs?

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.500
Or support buttons? [FEET]

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.400
Those are frozen off. This is really cold.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.800
Do you want to try holding that
for a second?

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.800
-Yeah is it gonna be cold?
-Does that feel cold?

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.700
-Yeah it feels cold. 
-Yeah. Yeah, it's cold, huh?

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.200
-Oh gosh! Oh.
-Hahaha. That's amazing.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.600
That's frosty.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.760
So guys, our computer
is legitimately frozen.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.840
I mean, how cold is that?

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.300
I mean, it's frozen.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.400
It's cold enough
that we're gathering frost

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.220
-on the bottom here, can you see that?
-Yeah.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.000
This is like Elsa's laptop.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.720
Elsa's laptop.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.660
That's right, should I Iet it go?

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.400
-Let it go...
-...it's really cold, the keyboard--

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.860
-let it go...
-There you go.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.100
[Grant] What I really want to know is,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.300
at what point in time
could we turn it back on?

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.440
[Justine] Oh, do you think the laptop
turned itself off?

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.240
Or do you think it just stopped working?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.700
It's hard to say, the buttons don't work.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.800
Feel those, those are
frozen solid as well.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.100
[Justine] Yeah, liquid nitrogen is cool.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.300
[laughs]

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.440
[Grant] I see what you did there.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.700
So Eddie, an answer to your question
even at this point,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.500
would liquid nitrogen damage a laptop?

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.600
Yeah this definitely is damaged.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.000
I-I'd call this very damaged.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.500
The question now becomes, will it survive?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.380
Can we resurrect the laptop?
Can we bring it back to life?

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.960
'Cause even after five minutes now,

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.940
I can start seeing the warping
ironing itself out.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.000
I think, um, probably

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.400
we could even lay this sticker back
on the trackpad here.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.980
-Maybe?
-Hmm.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.520
Who knows. I guess
we're going to find out.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.320
We're going to give this
about 25 minutes to set

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.100
so it can warm back up
to room temperature,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.000
press the power button,
and see what happens

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.600
Guys we're back. It's been
about 25 minutes now,

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.460
and this computer looks like it's had
about enough time to thaw out.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.100
You can even see all the moisture
from the air, all that frost,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.880
is now condensed and turned into water.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.000
[Justine] Look at this.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.860
Which I think the water
is probably more dangerous

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.100
than the liquid nitrogen was.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.200
But the other thing I'm noticing

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.400
is the screen has almost
shifted back to normal. We--

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.040
We press that back into place.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.000
-Oh look at that!
-Click, click, click.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.340
And, uh, so yeah let's just
take a second now.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.200
Let's take some paper towels,
clean this all up,

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.300
and then we'll hit the power button
and see if it actually still works.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.300
I've also salvaged this little sticker
that came from the trackpad

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.200
and now that it's unfrozen,
well it's thawed out,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.000
I think we can actually
stick it back in place.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.500
So put that right on there

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.400
So...

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.600
should we plug it in?

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.400
-I don't know.
-Is it safe to plug in?

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.500
Probably not.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.900
Well...

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.260
safety is not my middle name.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.600
Okay, moment of truth.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200
Let's see if it'll turn on.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.100
Oh my goodness. Check this out.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.800
Something just popped up.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.320
Chrome...

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.500
OS system is missing or damaged.
Please insert a Recovery USB.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.200
They probably just damaged the hard drive.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.300
Hmm. Interesting.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.600
So if we ran some kind of recovery system

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.800
it looks like theoretically
this would work.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.240
The LCD screen is back.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.700
-The screen looks perfect.
-The screen looks looks great. Yeah.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.000
But see, um, now this warm up, though,
can we close it?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.100
Yeah, the hinges work.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.980
Okay, so that's thawed back out.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.500
This is pretty durable.
I'm quite impressed actually.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.700
So if we give this a few more minutes 
to thaw out, perhaps,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.400
we get this thing to boot up again.

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.500
Guys you're not going to believe this.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.300
We just downloaded,
put some information on the SD card

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.800
and reformatted the computer
and look at this.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.400
We are back in business.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.300
I mean it's kind of hard to tell right now
because the screen is black

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.700
but if we bring up a program like YouTube.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.340
Let's go back to Chrome here.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.700
You can see the mouse works.
The trackpad works perfectly.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.000
and we can bring up
my liquid nitrogen video.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.400
[Grant on Chromebook]
Got like a triple flash there,

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.480
the camera just turned off.--

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.100
[Justine] Wow!

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.300
[Grant on the Chromebook]
--camera turned itself off just because

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.400
it had a little battery warning--

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.800
So the only problem we really had
with this computer was the sticker

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.900
for the trackpad peeled off
and once it warmed up

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.460
we just glued it back together,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.300
restart the computer, reformatted it,
and everything is working perfectly.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.400
So, will liquid nitrogen
damage the computer, after all?

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.000
I think it damages it a little bit?

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.000
I mean I'm sure the internals
of this thing,

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.200
something bad has happened,
but it's still working.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.440
Alas, it's not an experiment
we want to recommend that you try

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:46.860
but it's very amazing to see how resilient
and how robust even a computer

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.360
on the price point of this one,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.500
-and how it swings back.
-Yeah, this was $170.

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:53.100
-Very crazy.
-Can you believe that?

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.100
That's less than a phone.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.600
So I think what we need to do
is give this thing away.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.900
Yeah we could sign it.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.120
We should sign it and give away.
That's a great idea!

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.800

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.700
Comment that emoji, we're going
to surf through it.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.400
We're going to pick one of you randomly

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.040
to get our liquid nitrogen frozen
Chromebook,

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.600
that apparently still works
as good as new.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.600
I can't believe it.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.100
So there you have it, guys.
You asked us to pour liquid nitrogen

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.400
on a keyboard
and that's exactly what we did.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.500
[Justine] We did. And not only did we pour 
it onto the keyboard,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.800
but an entire laptop.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And big thanks to eddieg098
for requesting this experiment.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.460
You can go ahead
and check your YouTube inbox, Eddie,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.900
I'm sending 25 bucks.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.960
Oh that's nice!
[laughs]

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.300
Oh Eddie, you get a present!
[laughter]

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.600
And huge thanks to iJustine
for letting us terrorize her

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.700
in her kitchen, today.
Thank you so much for your space.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.700
Hey thanks for giving me
some liquid nitrogen

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.660
and the courage to light myself on fire.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.800
Now we just filmed something epic
in her backyard

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.400
that you won't want to miss.
I'll put a link down in the description.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.940
That will take you over to her channel.

We'll be looking for you in the next one.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.840
-Talk to you, then.
-Bye!

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.700
Eddie's gonna go shopping...
[laughs]

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.500
I'm just like hanging out
so far away from you

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.600
'cause I'm just scared
of what's gonna happen.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.660
