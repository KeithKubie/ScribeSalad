00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:11.250
On 
October 29, 1929, on what would become known

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.939
as “Black Tuesday,” the stock market crashed.
In one terrible day, the market lost fourteen

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:24.619
billion dollars (about $188B today), signaling
the beginning of the (roughly) ten-year-long

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:30.680
Great Depression, with most of the last vestiges
of the downturn only ceasing around 1939 due

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.840
to the onset of World War II.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.300
Just as the effects of an economic downturn
spread from Wall Street to the farmers of

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.140
rural America, another major problem arose:
a severe drought struck middle America. Starting

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.550
in 1931, the drought, coupled with poor farming
practices, caused hellacious dust storms to

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.640
envelope much of America’s midwest. Through
much of the 1930s, these storms ravaged land,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.510
crops, and topsoil, making it impossible for
many crops to grow and the farmer to earn

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.510
a living.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.540
The worst of it happened on what was supposed
to be a beautiful spring Sunday. On April

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.200
14, 1935, later called “Black Sunday,”
a dust storm darkened the sky from northern

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.560
Canada to southern Texas. The next day, when
reporters wrote about the incident, they made

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.950
references to the “dust bowl,” including
this in the Associated Press, “Three little

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.570
words… rule life in the dust bowl of the
continent – ‘if it rains’.” From that

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.320
moment forward, “Dust Bowl” was used to
describe the panhandle of Texas, Oklahoma,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.840
Kansas, Colorado, and parts of New Mexico.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.229
Between the dust storms, the economic downturn,
and a belief in a better life, many farmers

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.960
and families pulled up their stakes and left
the Dust Bowl. Piling into their wagons and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.740
cars, they looked west, much like their ancestors
from a hundred years before during the California

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.509
Gold Rush, and headed to the supposedly work-paved
roads of California. With nearly 200,000 people

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.020
(about 1 in 600 in the U.S.) making their
move, it was one of the greatest mass exoduses

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.770
in American history.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.750
Many traveled via the “mother road” Route
66, the recently constructed interstate highway

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.030
that connected Chicago to Los Angeles and
everything in between. To this day, Route

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:19.140
66 remains probably the most famous road in
America. From 1931 until late 1935, dust bowl

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.810
refugees, often derogatorily called “Okies”
despite the fact that they weren’t all from

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.720
Oklahoma, poured into California, mostly into
the growing metropolis of Los Angeles, that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.500
had just a couple decades before seen a huge
boost thanks to the mass-exodus from San Francisco

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.920
after approximately 80% of the city was destroyed
after the Great San Francisco Earthquake of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.861
1906. (See: When San Francisco was Almost
Wiped Off the Map)

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:44.390
dust-bowlDuring the Dust Bowl exodus, it was
estimated at the time that nearly a thousand

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.600
people per day crossed into the city’s borders.
But Los Angeles was also struggling due to

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.840
the Depression. Jobs, thought plentiful by
the migrants, were actually not. Even native

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.420
Angelenos had a hard time finding work, much
less with a massive number of new additions

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.950
joining them. This also allowed employers
to hire the desperate workers for lower wages,

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.030
further angering locals. With these issues
reaching a head, the Jones-Redwine Bill was

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.850
proposed in the California State Assembly
in May 1935 which would, “prohibit all paupers,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.600
vagabonds, indigent persons and persons likely
to become public charges, and all persons

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.090
affected with a contagious or infectious disease
from entering California until July 1, 1939.”

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.260
It didn’t pass, but it was clear something
had to be done.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.070
In the August 24, 1935 edition of the Los
Angeles Herald Express, an article ran warning

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.180
refugees not to come to California. The first
line read,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.150
Indigent transients heading for California
today were warned by H. A. Carleton, director

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.080
of the Federal Transient Service, “to stay
away from California… California is carrying

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.160
approximately 7 percent of the entire national
relief load, one of the heaviest of any State

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.710
in the Union. A large part of this load was
occasioned by thousands of penniless families

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.240
from other States who have literally overrun
California.”

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.290
Still, the mass migration didn’t stop, that
is until someone took this task, and the law,

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.710
into their own hands.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.250
The Los Angeles police chief at the time was
James “Two-Gun” Davis, who already earned

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.670
a reputation as being no-nonsense and corrupt.
He was the man behind the “Gun Squad,”

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.560
where he allowed select officers to take down
gangsters by any means necessary, even illegally.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.990
He once said, “hold court on gunmen in the
Los Angeles streets; I want them brought in

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.180
dead, not alive and will reprimand any officer
who shows the least mercy to a criminal.”

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.430
Point being, when he wanted something done,
he did it and didn’t care at all if it was

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.780
against the law he had sworn to protect.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.620
jobless-menBeginning in November of 1935,
he sent 136 LAPD officers to 16 different

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.680
California entry points, ones that bordered
Arizona, Oregon, and Nevada with orders to

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.940
turn back any incomers with “no visible
means of support.” It was a harsh way to

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.420
deal with the crisis and one that was not
legal.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.360
Davis claimed he was simply upholding California’s
1933 Indigent Act which made it illegal for

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.870
an indigent (poor and needy) persons to enter
the state. Additionally, Davis had support

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.750
from state relief agencies, who couldn’t
deal with the influx; many public officials;

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.240
the railroads (many migrants were also entering
via train); and the Los Angeles Chamber of

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.680
Commerce, who feared that, “street beggars
were ‘a bad advertisement’ for Los Angeles.”

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.790
Even the Los Angeles Times supported Chief
Davis. They compared him to Queen Elizabeth

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.260
when she declared “a war on bums.”

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.010
By December, these officers had become known
as the “Bum Brigade.” They were given

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.980
specific orders to search all incoming cars,
wagons, and trains. Those who had “no means

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.310
of support,” no train ticket, or were under
suspicion for “vagrancy” were told to

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.540
either leave the state or face jail time.
Many choose to turn around and leave.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.090
By the middle of February, city officials
finally spoke up, including the Attorney General

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.550
of California, Ulysses S. Webb, who said that
not allowing American citizens to cross state

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.111
borders was unconstitutional. California governor
Frank Merriam didn’t disagree, but knew

00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:11.830
how powerful the city of Los Angeles was,
“I guess Los Angeles can do it, its city’s

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.080
boundaries almost go that far.”

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.510
April brought the ACLU lawsuits and the ending
of Davis’ Bum Brigade. ACLU director Ernest

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:26.419
Besig said that LAPD officers were “conspiring
to take away the civil rights of United States

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.300
citizens,” and that the policies enacted
were a “violation of the city charter and

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.210
the state and federal constitutions.” Other
officials questioned why immense city funds

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.880
were being used for this far-flung project.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.230
The officials were eventually called home
to LA, but Davis claimed victory. He stated

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.590
that over 11,000 people were turned away which
caused an “absence of a seasonal crime wave

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.260
in Los Angeles.” He estimated that over
four million dollars were saved on policing

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.380
“thieves and thugs” and paying out welfare
payments.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.480
In 1937, the Resettlement Administration (one
of FDR’s New Deal agencies) began building

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.639
migrant camps along California’s border
to temporarily house those trying to enter

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.590
the state. Eventually, the Farm Security Administration,
whose job was to combat rural poverty during

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.889
the Depression, took this over. This was,
at least, a more practical, if not slightly

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:17.540
more humane way of dealing with the migrant
problem.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.820
On December 7, 1941, the Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbor bringing America into World War II

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.870
officially and, most historians consider,
out of the Great Depression. War time production

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:58.389
immediately took hold of the country and America
began its rise into the prosperous 1950s.
