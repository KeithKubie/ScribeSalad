filamentous phage are a little unusual
 

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.720
filamentous phage are a little unusual
among phage in general in that they

among phage in general in that they
 

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.700
among phage in general in that they
don't kill the cell they in fact so the

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:52.710
don't kill the cell they in fact so the
 

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.980
don't kill the cell they in fact so the
infected cell continues to grow and

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:54.990
infected cell continues to grow and
 

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.140
