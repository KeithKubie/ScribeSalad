replacement is longevity taking a person
who needs a joint replacement and giving

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689
who needs a joint replacement and giving
 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.500
who needs a joint replacement and giving
them a replacement that will last the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510
them a replacement that will last the
 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.899
them a replacement that will last the
rest of their lives now when your

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909
rest of their lives now when your
 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.520
rest of their lives now when your
replacement first thought of being done

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530
replacement first thought of being done
 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.740
replacement first thought of being done
in the 60s or even the 70s it was

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750
in the 60s or even the 70s it was
 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.890
in the 60s or even the 70s it was
reserved for people in their 60s 70s or

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900
reserved for people in their 60s 70s or
 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.450
reserved for people in their 60s 70s or
such because there was concerned about

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460
such because there was concerned about
 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.330
such because there was concerned about
the longevity however over the last 30

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
the longevity however over the last 30
 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.580
the longevity however over the last 30
years advancements in the design the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590
years advancements in the design the
 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.200
years advancements in the design the
materials that are involved that are

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210
materials that are involved that are
 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.960
materials that are involved that are
used for joint replacement have allowed

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970
used for joint replacement have allowed
 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.270
used for joint replacement have allowed
the joint replacements to last longer

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280
the joint replacements to last longer
 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.010
the joint replacements to last longer
and longer so it's possible to take now

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020
and longer so it's possible to take now
 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.469
and longer so it's possible to take now
a 50 year old or a 40 year old replace

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479
a 50 year old or a 40 year old replace
 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:45.230
a 50 year old or a 40 year old replace
their hip or knee and anticipate that

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240
their hip or knee and anticipate that
 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.300
their hip or knee and anticipate that
they will have that replacement in place

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310
they will have that replacement in place
 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.180
they will have that replacement in place
for the rest of their lives so the rest

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190
for the rest of their lives so the rest
 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.550
for the rest of their lives so the rest
of the lives is different to find us 30

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560
of the lives is different to find us 30
 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.219
of the lives is different to find us 30
40 or 50 years as opposed to maybe 10 15

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229
40 or 50 years as opposed to maybe 10 15
 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.320
40 or 50 years as opposed to maybe 10 15
or 20 years and I think that's where the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330
or 20 years and I think that's where the
 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.790
or 20 years and I think that's where the
advancements are going to come in the

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800
advancements are going to come in the
 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.680
advancements are going to come in the
materials that are being used to a

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690
materials that are being used to a
 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.279
materials that are being used to a
certain extent the design

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:05.289
 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.480
it's interesting hip and knee

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490
it's interesting hip and knee
 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.379
it's interesting hip and knee
replacement has tended to get the

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389
replacement has tended to get the
 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.359
replacement has tended to get the
emphasis in the area of your replacement

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:12.369
emphasis in the area of your replacement
 

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:14.399
emphasis in the area of your replacement
because you know hips and knees are

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409
because you know hips and knees are
 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:16.739
because you know hips and knees are
really necessary for your mobility the

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:16.749
really necessary for your mobility the
 

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.589
really necessary for your mobility the
ability to walk work do the things that

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599
ability to walk work do the things that
 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.239
ability to walk work do the things that
you have to do each day you get out of

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:21.249
you have to do each day you get out of
 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:23.639
you have to do each day you get out of
bed and walk to the bathroom or get up

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:23.649
bed and walk to the bathroom or get up
 

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:26.100
bed and walk to the bathroom or get up
and walk around the kitchen to do all

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110
and walk around the kitchen to do all
 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.450
and walk around the kitchen to do all
the things that are considered necessary

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460
the things that are considered necessary
 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.909
the things that are considered necessary
your mobility your shoulders and elbows

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919
your mobility your shoulders and elbows
 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.549
your mobility your shoulders and elbows
have generally taken a backseat to a

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:32.559
have generally taken a backseat to a
 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:35.579
have generally taken a backseat to a
certain extent primarily because if you

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:35.589
certain extent primarily because if you
 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:37.499
certain extent primarily because if you
can't do something with one arm well you

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509
can't do something with one arm well you
 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.029
can't do something with one arm well you
can probably compensate for it with the

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039
can probably compensate for it with the
 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.040
can probably compensate for it with the
other arm so it tends to get less

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050
other arm so it tends to get less
 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.359
other arm so it tends to get less
attention in addition there's the

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:42.369
attention in addition there's the
 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:44.579
attention in addition there's the
perception that the shoulder elbow is

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:44.589
perception that the shoulder elbow is
 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:47.399
perception that the shoulder elbow is
not a weight-bearing joint like the hip

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409
not a weight-bearing joint like the hip
 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.799
not a weight-bearing joint like the hip
and the knee and that's true to a

00:05:49.799 --> 00:05:49.809
and the knee and that's true to a
 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:50.879
and the knee and that's true to a
certain extent although there are

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889
certain extent although there are
 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.199
certain extent although there are
significant forces that are generated

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:52.209
significant forces that are generated
 

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:54.389
significant forces that are generated
across the shoulder in the elbow such

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:54.399
across the shoulder in the elbow such
 

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:56.279
across the shoulder in the elbow such
that when they're arthritic they take

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289
that when they're arthritic they take
 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:00.150
that when they're arthritic they take
they can be very painful

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160
 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.210
well you know athletic injuries have

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220
well you know athletic injuries have
 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.570
well you know athletic injuries have
really increased in incidents over the

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580
really increased in incidents over the
 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.909
really increased in incidents over the
last 20 years in a very rapid rate now

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919
last 20 years in a very rapid rate now
 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.760
last 20 years in a very rapid rate now
why is that well I think that first and

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770
why is that well I think that first and
 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.890
why is that well I think that first and
foremost the reason is that more and

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900
foremost the reason is that more and
 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.200
foremost the reason is that more and
more people are involved in athletics

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210
more people are involved in athletics
 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.090
more people are involved in athletics
just bottom line you see athletics

in addition they're also involved in it
 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.320
in addition they're also involved in it
to a much greater degree in later years

it's not unheard of to have people in
 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.810
it's not unheard of to have people in
there it used to be that somebody tore

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:52.820
there it used to be that somebody tore
 

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.370
there it used to be that somebody tore
their anterior cruciate ligament which

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:54.380
their anterior cruciate ligament which
 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.529
their anterior cruciate ligament which
is a key stabilizing ligament to the

their 20s maybe the early 30s and then
 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.400
their 20s maybe the early 30s and then
you would consider replacing it now I

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410
you would consider replacing it now I
 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.890
you would consider replacing it now I
see my colleagues operating on people in

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900
see my colleagues operating on people in
 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.290
see my colleagues operating on people in
their 40s even earlier early 50s with

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300
their 40s even earlier early 50s with

anterior cruciate ligament tears who
 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.000
anterior cruciate ligament tears who
need that ligament intact to be able to

need that ligament intact to be able to
 

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.710
need that ligament intact to be able to
participate in the sports that they want

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720
participate in the sports that they want
 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.860
participate in the sports that they want
to so there's been a great growth in the

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870
to so there's been a great growth in the
 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.690
to so there's been a great growth in the
athletic participation and you add to

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:19.700
athletic participation and you add to
 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.310
athletic participation and you add to
that what's also done is it's not just

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320
that what's also done is it's not just
 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.440
that what's also done is it's not just
men that are doing it it's women women

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:23.450
men that are doing it it's women women
 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.390
men that are doing it it's women women
are actively involved in athletics so

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.400
are actively involved in athletics so
 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.089
are actively involved in athletics so
we've now seen kind of a blurring of the

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:28.099
we've now seen kind of a blurring of the
 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:30.010
we've now seen kind of a blurring of the
lines between who gets what kind of

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020
lines between who gets what kind of
 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.740
lines between who gets what kind of
injury now now it's true men are tend to

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750
injury now now it's true men are tend to
 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.650
injury now now it's true men are tend to
be much more involved in contact sports

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660
be much more involved in contact sports
 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.760
be much more involved in contact sports
so there's certain types of injuries

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:36.770
so there's certain types of injuries
 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.589
so there's certain types of injuries
there but women are more and more

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:38.599
there but women are more and more
 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.240
there but women are more and more
involved in athletics and we found that

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250
involved in athletics and we found that
 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.900
involved in athletics and we found that
certain aspects of women's anatomy

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:42.910
certain aspects of women's anatomy

women now I see osteoporosis and

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:29.350
women now I see osteoporosis and
 

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.650
women now I see osteoporosis and
osteopenia occurs in men also but to a

osteopenia occurs in men also but to a
 

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.559
osteopenia occurs in men also but to a
lesser extent now the interesting part

not suggesting obesity for anybody but

not suggesting obesity for anybody but
 

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.629
not suggesting obesity for anybody but
obese men and women right older men and

on my bones well the processes that
resorb bone that take away bone outstrip

the processes that deposit bone when
 

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.019
the processes that deposit bone when
you're up on it and when you're up and

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:16.029
you're up on it and when you're up and
 

00:16:16.029 --> 00:16:17.850
you're up on it and when you're up and
active in things the processes that

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:17.860
active in things the processes that
 

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.249
active in things the processes that
deposit bone because of the stress you

00:16:20.249 --> 00:16:20.259
deposit bone because of the stress you
 

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:23.100
deposit bone because of the stress you
know exceed those that that resorb bone

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:23.110
know exceed those that that resorb bone
 

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.439
know exceed those that that resorb bone
or take away bone but if you're not

00:16:25.439 --> 00:16:25.449
or take away bone but if you're not
 

00:16:25.449 --> 00:16:27.900
or take away bone but if you're not
doing anything in activity so you're

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:27.910
doing anything in activity so you're
 

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.150
doing anything in activity so you're
going to predispose to more osteoporosis

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160
going to predispose to more osteoporosis
 

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.160
going to predispose to more osteoporosis
so being active is important and if you

has ways that they've you know they're
 

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.750

going to pay for this and such right but
 

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.549
going to pay for this and such right but
my concern is that on paper it looks

00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559
my concern is that on paper it looks
 

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:10.100
my concern is that on paper it looks
good five years from now it may not work

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:10.110

envisioned way back when when they first
started it so I think that that's also a

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480
started it so I think that that's also a
 

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.960
started it so I think that that's also a
concern

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:21.970
 

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.190
another area that we think is

another area that we think is
 

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.039
another area that we think is
particularly important is in the area of

important one that I think right now
 

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.380
important one that I think right now
we're just missing in this

different pieces to it you can certainly

different pieces to it you can certainly
do that more more effectively and more

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480
do that more more effectively and more
 

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.270
do that more more effectively and more
efficiently the question is can you

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:52.280
efficiently the question is can you
 

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.460
efficiently the question is can you
extrapolate that or build that and to

extrapolate that or build that and to
 

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.350

dip into all different communities in

this country and that's hard to do
 

00:24:57.409 --> 00:25:02.159
this country and that's hard to do
because it's not set up that way

we should so if you look at in this
 

00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:19.080
we should so if you look at in this
current health care debate if the
