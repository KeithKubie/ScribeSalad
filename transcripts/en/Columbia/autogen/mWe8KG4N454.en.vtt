race to the top which we'll talk about a
 

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.749
race to the top which we'll talk about a
little bit too but we don't want our

00:15:42.749 --> 00:15:42.759
little bit too but we don't want our
 

00:15:42.759 --> 00:15:44.490
little bit too but we don't want our
schools to be helpless in all this that

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:44.500
schools to be helpless in all this that
 

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.030
schools to be helpless in all this that
this is done to them and add them but

the end of each year they get their
grades on the report card there ABCD or

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:24.370
grades on the report card there ABCD or
 

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:28.140
grades on the report card there ABCD or
hopefully not F we feel the need to hold

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.150
hopefully not F we feel the need to hold
 

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.049
hopefully not F we feel the need to hold
ourselves accountable as well so each

00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:31.059
ourselves accountable as well so each
 

00:17:31.059 --> 00:17:33.600
ourselves accountable as well so each
year starting in 07 the schools received

school here got their ultimate grade of

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:43.900
school here got their ultimate grade of
 

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.380
school here got their ultimate grade of
a but there are subcategories that we

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:46.390
a but there are subcategories that we
 

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.180
a but there are subcategories that we
look at to help determine what that

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:48.190
look at to help determine what that
 

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.640
look at to help determine what that
ultimate score will be and so on the

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:50.650
ultimate score will be and so on the
 

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:52.140
ultimate score will be and so on the
next slide i'm going to take a bit of a

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:52.150
next slide i'm going to take a bit of a
 

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:54.419
next slide i'm going to take a bit of a
deeper dive into what those four sub

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:54.429
deeper dive into what those four sub
 

00:17:54.429 --> 00:17:57.090
deeper dive into what those four sub
categories are and how much weight or

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:57.100
categories are and how much weight or
 

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:04.020
categories are and how much weight or
importance we put on them okay so you've

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.030
importance we put on them okay so you've
 

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.279
importance we put on them okay so you've
seen the block at the top this is the

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:05.289
seen the block at the top this is the
 

00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:06.810
seen the block at the top this is the
overall grade you saw in the previous

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:06.820
overall grade you saw in the previous
 

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.970
overall grade you saw in the previous
slide that a that they got but we

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:08.980
slide that a that they got but we
 

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:10.889
slide that a that they got but we
realized there are a lot of factors that

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:10.899
realized there are a lot of factors that
 

00:18:10.899 --> 00:18:13.970
realized there are a lot of factors that
determine what makes a good school so

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980
determine what makes a good school so
 

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.080
determine what makes a good school so
first and foremost we have school

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.090

actual student performance do our
 

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.630
actual student performance do our
students reach a level of

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:03.640
students reach a level of
 

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:05.940

elementary and middle school so children
 

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.710
elementary and middle school so children
in grades 3 through 8 and then when we

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720
in grades 3 through 8 and then when we
 

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.240
in grades 3 through 8 and then when we
get to the high school level for

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:18.250
get to the high school level for
 

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.190

determining high school progress reports

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200
determining high school progress reports
 

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.930
determining high school progress reports
we're looking at these ultimate measures

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:21.940
we're looking at these ultimate measures
 

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:24.060
we're looking at these ultimate measures
of success that Jen mentioned earlier so

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:24.070
of success that Jen mentioned earlier so
 

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.880
of success that Jen mentioned earlier so
that's graduation rates and whether

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:26.890
that's graduation rates and whether
 

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.830
that's graduation rates and whether
they're really prepared to move on to

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840
they're really prepared to move on to
 

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.360
they're really prepared to move on to
what we hope they will move on to which

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:30.370
what we hope they will move on to which
 

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:34.830
what we hope they will move on to which
is a post-secondary institution but here

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840
is a post-secondary institution but here
 

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.330
is a post-secondary institution but here
in New York we really want to emphasize

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:36.340
in New York we really want to emphasize
 

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.330
in New York we really want to emphasize
that it's not just our our students

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:39.340
that it's not just our our students
 

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.490
that it's not just our our students
meeting this bar this level of

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:41.500
meeting this bar this level of
 

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.710
meeting this bar this level of
proficiency that the state requires us

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:43.720
proficiency that the state requires us
 

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.260
proficiency that the state requires us
to report and that's why you see in red

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:46.270
to report and that's why you see in red
 

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.410
to report and that's why you see in red
60 points are going towards progress and

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:49.420
60 points are going towards progress and
 

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.850
60 points are going towards progress and
that is where this whole name of

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:50.860
that is where this whole name of
 

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.120
that is where this whole name of
progress report really comes in here so

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.130
progress report really comes in here so
 

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.070
progress report really comes in here so
again we are looking at the state test

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080
again we are looking at the state test
 

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.350
again we are looking at the state test
scores this ela that's English language

00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360
scores this ela that's English language
 

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.780
scores this ela that's English language
arts and math but we're looking at

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:00.790
arts and math but we're looking at
 

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.350
arts and math but we're looking at
progress over time are these students

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360
progress over time are these students
 

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.330
progress over time are these students
progressing and not just progressing but

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:06.340
progressing and not just progressing but
 

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.090
progressing and not just progressing but
progressing past expectations and in the

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:09.100
progressing past expectations and in the
 

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.800
progressing past expectations and in the
next slide I'm going to go into a bit

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:10.810
next slide I'm going to go into a bit
 

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.260
next slide I'm going to go into a bit
how we determine what each school and

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.270
how we determine what each school and
 

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.920
how we determine what each school and
each student should be expected to show

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:16.930
each student should be expected to show
 

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:18.480
each student should be expected to show
gains in over the course of a year and

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:18.490
gains in over the course of a year and
 

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:19.860
gains in over the course of a year and
then how we determine whether they're

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:19.870
then how we determine whether they're
 

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:23.220
then how we determine whether they're
exceeding their expected progress also

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:23.230
exceeding their expected progress also
 

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.350
exceeding their expected progress also
just a highlight when it comes to high

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360
just a highlight when it comes to high
 

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.150
just a highlight when it comes to high
school progress reports we don't have

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:27.160
school progress reports we don't have
 

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.250
school progress reports we don't have
those state test scores but we look at

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:29.260
those state test scores but we look at
 

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.590
those state test scores but we look at
credit accumulation are these students

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600
credit accumulation are these students
 

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.870
credit accumulation are these students
on track to graduate on time in those

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:33.880
on track to graduate on time in those
 

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.180
on track to graduate on time in those
four years and we also look at whether

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:36.190
four years and we also look at whether
 

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:37.950
four years and we also look at whether
they're passing their Regents exams

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960
they're passing their Regents exams
 

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.720
they're passing their Regents exams
which is another measure of success for

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:39.730
which is another measure of success for
 

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:42.660
which is another measure of success for
high school students and then lastly you

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:42.670
high school students and then lastly you
 

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:44.400
high school students and then lastly you
see on the right there's another 15

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:44.410
see on the right there's another 15
 

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.620
see on the right there's another 15
points extra credit all the kids get

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:46.630
points extra credit all the kids get
 

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.330
points extra credit all the kids get
extra credit so why shouldn't we so

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:48.340
extra credit so why shouldn't we so
 

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.180
extra credit so why shouldn't we so
these are points that can be gained by a

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:51.190
these are points that can be gained by a
 

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.130
these are points that can be gained by a
school when they really show exemplary

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:53.140
school when they really show exemplary
 

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.610
school when they really show exemplary
performance with high needs populations

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:56.620
performance with high needs populations
 

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.900
performance with high needs populations
so there's different populations

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:57.910
so there's different populations
 

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:00.480
so there's different populations
throughout the city that notoriously are

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:00.490
throughout the city that notoriously are
 

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.190
throughout the city that notoriously are
harder to serve and so if certain

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:02.200
harder to serve and so if certain
 

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.660
harder to serve and so if certain
schools are standing out for serving

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:03.670
schools are standing out for serving
 

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.000
schools are standing out for serving
these populations really well closing

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.010
these populations really well closing
 

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.290
these populations really well closing
the achievement gap that has been

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:07.300
the achievement gap that has been
 

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.240
the achievement gap that has been
present for so long and there's extra

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.250
present for so long and there's extra
 

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.310
present for so long and there's extra
points to gain there and so when you

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320
points to gain there and so when you
 

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.800
points to gain there and so when you
take that all together it determines the

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:13.810
take that all together it determines the
 

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.230
take that all together it determines the
schools overall grade that you saw in

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240
schools overall grade that you saw in
 

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.040
schools overall grade that you saw in
the previous report

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:19.050
the previous report
 

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.960
the previous report
now there are a number of objectives

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:21.970
now there are a number of objectives
 

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.290
now there are a number of objectives
that the progress report hopes to meet

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:24.300
that the progress report hopes to meet
 

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.330
that the progress report hopes to meet
first is really just to be able to look

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:27.340
first is really just to be able to look
 

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:29.940
first is really just to be able to look
at student achievement on a broad scale

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:29.950
at student achievement on a broad scale
 

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.280
at student achievement on a broad scale
so again it's not just test scores we're

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:32.290
so again it's not just test scores we're
 

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.470
so again it's not just test scores we're
incorporating a whole range of

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480
incorporating a whole range of
 

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.200
incorporating a whole range of
information and we're getting data from

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.210
information and we're getting data from
 

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.390
information and we're getting data from
a variety of sources to really bring it

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:39.400
a variety of sources to really bring it
 

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.190
a variety of sources to really bring it
all together and see how are our kids

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200
all together and see how are our kids
 

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.160
all together and see how are our kids
doing second we want to look at outcomes

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.170
doing second we want to look at outcomes
 

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.160
doing second we want to look at outcomes
not inputs we want to evaluate our

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:47.170
not inputs we want to evaluate our
 

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:50.490
not inputs we want to evaluate our
schools based on quantifiable data and

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:50.500
schools based on quantifiable data and
 

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.750
schools based on quantifiable data and
again we want to measure their progress

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760
again we want to measure their progress
 

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.510
again we want to measure their progress
and performance so we want to measure

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:54.520
and performance so we want to measure
 

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.120
and performance so we want to measure
what the schools contribute to the

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.130
what the schools contribute to the
 

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.680
what the schools contribute to the
students and not what the students bring

00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:58.690
students and not what the students bring
 

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.440
students and not what the students bring
to the school as a school might um you

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:01.450
to the school as a school might um you
 

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.820
to the school as a school might um you
know have an advantage because they're

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:02.830
know have an advantage because they're
 

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.470
know have an advantage because they're
just getting a certain type of kid but

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480
just getting a certain type of kid but
 

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.090
just getting a certain type of kid but
that's not enough we want to show that

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:06.100
that's not enough we want to show that
 

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.700
that's not enough we want to show that
these schools are really having an

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:08.710
these schools are really having an
 

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.410
these schools are really having an
impact on these kids and letting them

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:10.420
impact on these kids and letting them
 

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.020
impact on these kids and letting them
move beyond perhaps what we expect their

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.030
move beyond perhaps what we expect their
 

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.660
move beyond perhaps what we expect their
potential to be and then lastly I want

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:15.670
potential to be and then lastly I want
 

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.910
potential to be and then lastly I want
to talk about this idea of peer and City

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:17.920
to talk about this idea of peer and City
 

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.060
to talk about this idea of peer and City
comparisons so we really focus in New

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.070
comparisons so we really focus in New
 

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.310
comparisons so we really focus in New
York on this idea of peer schools it's

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320
York on this idea of peer schools it's
 

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.920
York on this idea of peer schools it's
not enough to say that we expect two

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:25.930
not enough to say that we expect two
 

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.260
not enough to say that we expect two
middle schools in the Bronx to both

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:28.270
middle schools in the Bronx to both
 

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.410
middle schools in the Bronx to both
increase X number of degrees in a given

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:31.420
increase X number of degrees in a given
 

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.090
increase X number of degrees in a given
year that's not necessarily fair because

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:33.100
year that's not necessarily fair because
 

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.190
year that's not necessarily fair because
as we know every school has a different

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200
as we know every school has a different
 

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.160
as we know every school has a different
makeup and if you look up on the far

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:38.170
makeup and if you look up on the far
 

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.050
makeup and if you look up on the far
right you see what would happen if we

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:40.060
right you see what would happen if we
 

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.030
right you see what would happen if we
didn't control for certain factors so on

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.040
didn't control for certain factors so on
 

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.310
didn't control for certain factors so on
the x-axis what we're calling the pier

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320
the x-axis what we're calling the pier
 

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:46.380
the x-axis what we're calling the pier
index is the percent of certain

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:46.390
index is the percent of certain
 

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.230
index is the percent of certain
subpopulations in a given school so we

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240
subpopulations in a given school so we
 

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.640
subpopulations in a given school so we
have percent of english-language

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:50.650
have percent of english-language
 

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.310
have percent of english-language
learners at that school we have percent

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320
learners at that school we have percent
 

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.320
learners at that school we have percent
of students who fall under the special

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:55.330
of students who fall under the special
 

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.380
of students who fall under the special
education category we have percent title

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:58.390
education category we have percent title
 

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.540
education category we have percent title
1 and percent black and Hispanic

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:00.550
1 and percent black and Hispanic
 

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.660
1 and percent black and Hispanic
students and as you see they hire the

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:03.670
students and as you see they hire the
 

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.730
students and as you see they hire the
proportion of these students in your

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:05.740
proportion of these students in your
 

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.160
proportion of these students in your
school the lower average proficiency

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:08.170
school the lower average proficiency
 

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:11.340
school the lower average proficiency
that you see so what we have is this

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:11.350
that you see so what we have is this
 

00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:13.950
that you see so what we have is this
idea of the pier index which controls

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960
idea of the pier index which controls
 

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.110
idea of the pier index which controls
for all of these factors and then

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120
for all of these factors and then
 

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.850
for all of these factors and then
factors into your progress report grade

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:17.860
factors into your progress report grade
 

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:19.980
factors into your progress report grade
so when we're saying how much are you

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:19.990
so when we're saying how much are you
 

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.930
so when we're saying how much are you
progressing over the course of a given

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:21.940
progressing over the course of a given
 

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.390
progressing over the course of a given
year it's not uverse the city it's not

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400
year it's not uverse the city it's not
 

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.310
year it's not uverse the city it's not
your school versus all the other schools

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320
your school versus all the other schools
 

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.920
your school versus all the other schools
even in your district it's you versus

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:28.930
even in your district it's you versus
 

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.840
even in your district it's you versus
your peer school so the

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:30.850
your peer school so the
 

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.930
your peer school so the
other schools around you 20 above you 20

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:33.940
other schools around you 20 above you 20
 

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.460
other schools around you 20 above you 20
below you so every school has a

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:35.470
below you so every school has a
 

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:38.340
below you so every school has a
different peer school group how are you

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:38.350
different peer school group how are you
 

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.890
different peer school group how are you
doing relative to those schools to to

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:40.900
doing relative to those schools to to
 

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.110
doing relative to those schools to to
really level that playing field there

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120
 
 

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.630
 
okay so that is our first major tool

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640
okay so that is our first major tool
 

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.730
okay so that is our first major tool
that we use a major accountability tool

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:50.740
that we use a major accountability tool
 

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.040
that we use a major accountability tool
and as you probably gathered a lot of

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:53.050
and as you probably gathered a lot of
 

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.230
and as you probably gathered a lot of
this is quantitative data that goes into

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.240
this is quantitative data that goes into
 

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.480
this is quantitative data that goes into
this progress report we do use the

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:57.490
this progress report we do use the
 

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.490
this progress report we do use the
surveys but we also are quantifying

00:23:59.490 --> 00:23:59.500
surveys but we also are quantifying
 

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.470
surveys but we also are quantifying
what's on the surveys from the teachers

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480
what's on the surveys from the teachers
 

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.930
what's on the surveys from the teachers
and the parents and the students so we

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:03.940
and the parents and the students so we
 

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.330
and the parents and the students so we
want to acknowledge it's not not all

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:06.340
want to acknowledge it's not not all
 

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.850
want to acknowledge it's not not all
data is quantitative data you also have

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:08.860
data is quantitative data you also have
 

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.700
data is quantitative data you also have
to look at qualitative data so another

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:11.710
to look at qualitative data so another
 

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.560
to look at qualitative data so another
big tool we have here is what's known as

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:13.570
big tool we have here is what's known as
 

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.950
big tool we have here is what's known as
the Quality Review and what this is it's

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960
the Quality Review and what this is it's
 

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.890
the Quality Review and what this is it's
an on-site really in-depth two to three

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:19.900
an on-site really in-depth two to three
 

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.500
an on-site really in-depth two to three
day review of how our schools are doing

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:22.510
day review of how our schools are doing
 

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.740
day review of how our schools are doing
so we have evaluator go into the schools

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:25.750
so we have evaluator go into the schools
 

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:27.870
so we have evaluator go into the schools
meet with the administrators meet with

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880
meet with the administrators meet with
 

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.610
meet with the administrators meet with
people at the school and see how is this

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:29.620
people at the school and see how is this
 

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.940
people at the school and see how is this
school really functioning and then we

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:32.950
school really functioning and then we
 

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:34.980
school really functioning and then we
take all of the data that's gathered and

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:34.990
take all of the data that's gathered and
 

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.050
take all of the data that's gathered and
I'll show you an example of a rubric on

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:37.060
I'll show you an example of a rubric on
 

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.880
I'll show you an example of a rubric on
the next page of the different items we

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:38.890
the next page of the different items we
 

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.980
the next page of the different items we
evaluate on but we take all that

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:40.990
evaluate on but we take all that
 

00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:42.750
evaluate on but we take all that
information and give it back to the

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760
information and give it back to the
 

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.750
information and give it back to the
school and a really well laid out report

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760
school and a really well laid out report
 

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.180
school and a really well laid out report
what are you doing well where are your

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:48.190
what are you doing well where are your
 

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:51.330
what are you doing well where are your
areas for improvement and making that

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:51.340
areas for improvement and making that
 

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.970
areas for improvement and making that
data available throughout the city so

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:53.980
data available throughout the city so
 

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.560
data available throughout the city so
everyone really is being held

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:55.570
everyone really is being held
 

00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:58.440
everyone really is being held
accountable and just like on the

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:58.450
accountable and just like on the
 

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.980
accountable and just like on the
progress report you had an a b c d or f

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:00.990
progress report you had an a b c d or f
 

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.200
progress report you had an a b c d or f
for the quality review you can score as

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:04.210
for the quality review you can score as
 

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:07.170
for the quality review you can score as
well developed proficient development

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:07.180
well developed proficient development
 

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:12.030
well developed proficient development
developing or underdeveloped ok so this

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:12.040
developing or underdeveloped ok so this
 

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.790
developing or underdeveloped ok so this
next slide is it's pretty busy as you

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:14.800
next slide is it's pretty busy as you
 

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:16.140
next slide is it's pretty busy as you
can see i hope you can see it in the

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:16.150
can see i hope you can see it in the
 

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.110
can see i hope you can see it in the
back but it's an example of the the

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120
back but it's an example of the the
 

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.870
back but it's an example of the the
rubric and the fundamentals that the

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880
rubric and the fundamentals that the
 

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.940
rubric and the fundamentals that the
quality review is really based on so a

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:23.950
quality review is really based on so a
 

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.920
quality review is really based on so a
person doesn't go around the school

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:25.930
person doesn't go around the school
 

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.420
person doesn't go around the school
checking off this one rubric there are a

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:27.430
checking off this one rubric there are a
 

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.980
checking off this one rubric there are a
lot of subcategories but these are

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:28.990
lot of subcategories but these are
 

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.290
lot of subcategories but these are
really the core features of the quality

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:31.300
really the core features of the quality
 

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.470
really the core features of the quality
review so the people who go into the

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480
review so the people who go into the
 

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.420
review so the people who go into the
school and who are evaluating the school

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:36.430
school and who are evaluating the school
 

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.490
school and who are evaluating the school
are looking at the instructional and

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:38.500
are looking at the instructional and
 

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.440
are looking at the instructional and
organizational coherence of the school

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:40.450
organizational coherence of the school
 

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.810
organizational coherence of the school
and they're seeing how well the school

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:42.820
and they're seeing how well the school
 

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.280
and they're seeing how well the school
is doing it gathering and

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:44.290
is doing it gathering and
 

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.200
is doing it gathering and
analyzing their own schools data and

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:46.210
analyzing their own schools data and
 

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:48.690
analyzing their own schools data and
we'll show you that a bit later on how

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:48.700
we'll show you that a bit later on how
 

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.310
we'll show you that a bit later on how
schools can do that especially through

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320
schools can do that especially through
 

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.040
schools can do that especially through
the use of eros which gen mentioned how

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:53.050
the use of eros which gen mentioned how
 

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.960
the use of eros which gen mentioned how
well are these schools planning and

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:54.970
well are these schools planning and
 

00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.790
well are these schools planning and
setting goals for their students and for

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:56.800
setting goals for their students and for
 

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.220
setting goals for their students and for
their school as a whole how well are

00:25:59.220 --> 00:25:59.230
their school as a whole how well are
 

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.620
their school as a whole how well are
they aligning capacity building and how

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:01.630
they aligning capacity building and how
 

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.530
they aligning capacity building and how
well are they able to monitor the

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:04.540
well are they able to monitor the
 

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.780
well are they able to monitor the
progress of their school what's going on

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:06.790
progress of their school what's going on
 

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:08.160
progress of their school what's going on
in their school and then revise

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:08.170
in their school and then revise
 

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.720
in their school and then revise
accordingly if they see that things

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:09.730
accordingly if they see that things
 

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.120
accordingly if they see that things
aren't going well how are they revising

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:12.130
aren't going well how are they revising
 

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.100
aren't going well how are they revising
that to make sure it starts to go well

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:14.110
that to make sure it starts to go well
 

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:18.690
that to make sure it starts to go well
ok and then jens just you're going to

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:18.700
ok and then jens just you're going to
 

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.850
ok and then jens just you're going to
jump in here and explain to you now that

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:20.860
jump in here and explain to you now that
 

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.230
jump in here and explain to you now that
we have all these tools we have all

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240
we have all these tools we have all
 

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.330
we have all these tools we have all
these measures we graded the schools

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:24.340
these measures we graded the schools
 

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:31.590
these measures we graded the schools
what do we do with these numbers ok so

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600
what do we do with these numbers ok so
 

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.180
what do we do with these numbers ok so
here's where the second E comes in

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:33.190
here's where the second E comes in
 

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:36.660
here's where the second E comes in
within enforce and here is where the

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:36.670
within enforce and here is where the
 

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.420
within enforce and here is where the
consequences are when when schools are

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:39.430
consequences are when when schools are
 

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.550
consequences are when when schools are
not being successful for multiple years

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:41.560
not being successful for multiple years
 

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.520
not being successful for multiple years
they do face consequences and in those

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:44.530
they do face consequences and in those
 

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.060
they do face consequences and in those
cases there can be phase out decisions

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.070
cases there can be phase out decisions
 

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.110
cases there can be phase out decisions
and when we're thinking about a

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120
and when we're thinking about a
 

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:52.620
and when we're thinking about a
phase-out many many people may refer to

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:52.630
phase-out many many people may refer to
 

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.650
phase-out many many people may refer to
that distinctly as a closure as a school

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:55.660
that distinctly as a closure as a school
 

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.110
that distinctly as a closure as a school
closure we're looking at at this as the

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120
closure we're looking at at this as the
 

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.390
closure we're looking at at this as the
school has not been successful with its

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400
school has not been successful with its
 

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.880
school has not been successful with its
students for multiple years and now we

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:02.890
students for multiple years and now we
 

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.880
students for multiple years and now we
need to take steps to replace that

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:05.890
need to take steps to replace that
 

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.850
need to take steps to replace that
school and what we will do is begin to

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:08.860
school and what we will do is begin to
 

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.350
school and what we will do is begin to
phase out to school grade by grade and

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:12.360
phase out to school grade by grade and
 

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.060
phase out to school grade by grade and
allow the students who in particular in

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:15.070
allow the students who in particular in
 

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.590
allow the students who in particular in
the high schools allow those students to

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600
the high schools allow those students to
 

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.440
the high schools allow those students to
finish to finish at that phase out

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:19.450
finish to finish at that phase out
 

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:22.380
finish to finish at that phase out
school but we're going to part of our

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:22.390
school but we're going to part of our
 

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:23.970
school but we're going to part of our
strategy and again that was next door

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:23.980
strategy and again that was next door
 

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.470
strategy and again that was next door
also is about how do we build new small

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480
also is about how do we build new small
 

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.020
also is about how do we build new small
schools that can really work with

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.030
schools that can really work with
 

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.480
schools that can really work with
students on a very day-to-day very

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:33.490
students on a very day-to-day very

frequent basis and be really give that
 

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.270
frequent basis and be really give that
one-on-one that one-on-one attention

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:39.280
one-on-one that one-on-one attention
 

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.000
one-on-one that one-on-one attention
that our students need so when we're

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.010
that our students need so when we're
 

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:44.130
that our students need so when we're
looking what is what triggers a school

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:44.140
looking what is what triggers a school
 

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.800
looking what is what triggers a school
to be acknowledged as being a possible

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:46.810
to be acknowledged as being a possible
 

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:48.090
to be acknowledged as being a possible
school that we would want to identify

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:48.100
school that we would want to identify
 

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.660
school that we would want to identify
for phase out and that would be both our

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:51.670
for phase out and that would be both our
 

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:54.480
for phase out and that would be both our
progress report if we see schools that

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:04.700
of being a sea we will begin to flag
 

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.090
of being a sea we will begin to flag

that we need to now now watch more

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:09.650
that we need to now now watch more
 

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.800

underperforming score we will look at

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:25.790
underperforming score we will look at
 

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.930
underperforming score we will look at
that as well and finally New York State

also releases those schools that are

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000
also releases those schools that are
 

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.290
also releases those schools that are
persistently low achieving and those are

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:35.300
persistently low achieving and those are
 

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.330

think through this process but now let's

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:25.590
think through this process but now let's
 

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.490
think through this process but now let's
go to the more positive work that we do

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:27.500
go to the more positive work that we do
 

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.799

to be able to be very transparent with
 

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.640
to be able to be very transparent with
the information but most importantly

schools to actually work through these

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960
schools to actually work through these
 

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.990
schools to actually work through these
issues so part of our pillar around an

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000
issues so part of our pillar around an

accountability is also inquiry and we

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:50.520
accountability is also inquiry and we
 

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.190
accountability is also inquiry and we
have really built to establish

have really built to establish
 

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.730
have really built to establish
collaborative inquiry in the schools and

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:54.740
collaborative inquiry in the schools and
 

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:57.289
collaborative inquiry in the schools and
provide a real team teaching approach so

00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299
provide a real team teaching approach so
 

00:31:57.299 --> 00:31:58.669
provide a real team teaching approach so
we thought we would I'm going to jump

back to Katie she's going to talk a

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000
back to Katie she's going to talk a
 

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
back to Katie she's going to talk a
little bit about that and then showcase

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.010
little bit about that and then showcase
 

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:08.570
little bit about that and then showcase
some of the other tools okay so as Jen

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:08.580
some of the other tools okay so as Jen
 

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.950
some of the other tools okay so as Jen
mentioned we don't really want to get to

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960
mentioned we don't really want to get to
 

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.970
mentioned we don't really want to get to
the point where we're considering

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980
the point where we're considering
 

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.280
the point where we're considering
phase-out we want to use these tools I

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:13.290
phase-out we want to use these tools I
 

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.680
phase-out we want to use these tools I
talked about before to help our teachers

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:15.690
talked about before to help our teachers
 

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:17.510
talked about before to help our teachers
and administrators make really smart

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:17.520
and administrators make really smart
 

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:19.430
and administrators make really smart
decisions about their students to help

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440
decisions about their students to help
 

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.799
decisions about their students to help
move them forward so we have these

00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:21.809
move them forward so we have these
 

00:32:21.809 --> 00:32:24.310
move them forward so we have these
collaborative inquiry teams throughout

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320
collaborative inquiry teams throughout
 

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.919
collaborative inquiry teams throughout
the school system and going to go

00:32:26.919 --> 00:32:26.929
the school system and going to go
 

00:32:26.929 --> 00:32:28.269
the school system and going to go
through the four main pieces of

00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279
through the four main pieces of
 

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.590
through the four main pieces of
collaborative inquiry and then the next

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600
collaborative inquiry and then the next
 

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.060
collaborative inquiry and then the next
slide is really going to show you how

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:31.070
slide is really going to show you how
 

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:33.970
slide is really going to show you how
this is a cyclical process and how it's

00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:33.980
this is a cyclical process and how it's
 

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:36.310
this is a cyclical process and how it's
just it's really on going and how it can

00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320
just it's really on going and how it can
 

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.620
just it's really on going and how it can
really help so collaborative inquiry

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:38.630
really help so collaborative inquiry
 

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.990
really help so collaborative inquiry
it's really focused on student outcomes

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.000
it's really focused on student outcomes
 

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.230
it's really focused on student outcomes
using a systematic data approach so the

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240
using a systematic data approach so the
 

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.999
using a systematic data approach so the
thing we really need to do here is teach

00:32:45.999 --> 00:32:46.009
thing we really need to do here is teach
 

00:32:46.009 --> 00:32:49.659
thing we really need to do here is teach
our teachers how to use student data to

00:32:49.659 --> 00:32:49.669
our teachers how to use student data to
 

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:51.070
our teachers how to use student data to
drive their decision-making and then

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080
drive their decision-making and then
 

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.590
drive their decision-making and then
when we show you the tools namely eros

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600
when we show you the tools namely eros
 

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.450
when we show you the tools namely eros
it's going to really give you a better

00:32:55.450 --> 00:32:55.460
it's going to really give you a better
 

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.490
it's going to really give you a better
sense of what we're giving two teachers

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:57.500
sense of what we're giving two teachers
 

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.830
sense of what we're giving two teachers
and saying here here's how you can use

00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840
and saying here here's how you can use
 

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.869
and saying here here's how you can use
your student data now now do something

00:33:01.869 --> 00:33:01.879
your student data now now do something
 

00:33:01.879 --> 00:33:03.399
your student data now now do something
with it and we'll help you along the way

00:33:03.399 --> 00:33:03.409
with it and we'll help you along the way
 

00:33:03.409 --> 00:33:05.680
with it and we'll help you along the way
figure out what to do with it and how to

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:05.690
figure out what to do with it and how to
 

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.119
figure out what to do with it and how to
make decisions based on what you're

00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:07.129
make decisions based on what you're
 

00:33:07.129 --> 00:33:09.820
make decisions based on what you're
seeing because not necessarily is it the

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:09.830
seeing because not necessarily is it the
 

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.159
seeing because not necessarily is it the
case that every teacher in our entire

00:33:12.159 --> 00:33:12.169
case that every teacher in our entire
 

00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:14.560
case that every teacher in our entire
school system is going to know what to

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:14.570
school system is going to know what to
 

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.360
school system is going to know what to
do with a whole host of quantitative

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:16.370
do with a whole host of quantitative
 

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.669
do with a whole host of quantitative
data we're talking about student test

00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679
data we're talking about student test
 

00:33:18.679 --> 00:33:20.980
data we're talking about student test
scores on the state tests but also on

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:20.990
scores on the state tests but also on
 

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.379
scores on the state tests but also on
individual class level and all different

00:33:23.379 --> 00:33:23.389
individual class level and all different
 

00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:27.759
individual class level and all different
factors so we have teams of teachers get

00:33:27.759 --> 00:33:27.769
factors so we have teams of teachers get
 

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:31.169
factors so we have teams of teachers get
together and focus on how to handle

00:33:31.169 --> 00:33:31.179
together and focus on how to handle
 

00:33:31.179 --> 00:33:33.730
together and focus on how to handle
students who are struggling what they

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:33.740
students who are struggling what they
 

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.139
students who are struggling what they
can do but they're really doing this in

00:33:35.139 --> 00:33:35.149
can do but they're really doing this in
 

00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:37.180
can do but they're really doing this in
a team environment so no one is alone in

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:37.190
a team environment so no one is alone in
 

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.279
a team environment so no one is alone in
this process they're all sharing the

00:33:39.279 --> 00:33:39.289
this process they're all sharing the
 

00:33:39.289 --> 00:33:40.930
this process they're all sharing the
different things they've learned along

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:40.940
different things they've learned along
 

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:43.360
different things they've learned along
the way with one another and we're

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:43.370
the way with one another and we're
 

00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.730
the way with one another and we're
really trying to develop and deepen

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:45.740
really trying to develop and deepen
 

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.680
really trying to develop and deepen
really rigorous research based

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:47.690
really rigorous research based
 

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.769
really rigorous research based
instruction and we're trying to also

00:33:50.769 --> 00:33:50.779
instruction and we're trying to also
 

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.990
instruction and we're trying to also
distribute leadership so again it's not

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:53.000
distribute leadership so again it's not
 

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.970
distribute leadership so again it's not
you're not just one teacher in one

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:54.980
you're not just one teacher in one
 

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.310
you're not just one teacher in one
classroom in once you know one school

00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320
classroom in once you know one school

throughout this city there are so many

00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:58.730
throughout this city there are so many
 

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.549
throughout this city there are so many
students here people need to really all

00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559
students here people need to really all
 

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:04.090

be in this together so this next slide

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:04.100
be in this together so this next slide
 

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.669
be in this together so this next slide
is showing you what I mean by a cyclical

00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679
is showing you what I mean by a cyclical
 

00:34:06.679 --> 00:34:08.109
is showing you what I mean by a cyclical
approach and if you want to pick a

00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:08.119
approach and if you want to pick a
 

00:34:08.119 --> 00:34:09.760
approach and if you want to pick a
starting point in this circle I guess

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:09.770
starting point in this circle I guess
 

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.409
starting point in this circle I guess
perhaps the best place to start because

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:11.419
perhaps the best place to start because
 

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:13.050
perhaps the best place to start because
of what I've been talking about is

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:13.060
of what I've been talking about is
 

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:16.319
of what I've been talking about is
examining student work and data so

00:34:16.319 --> 00:34:16.329
examining student work and data so
 

00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:18.940
examining student work and data so
looking at the data and trying to get it

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:18.950
looking at the data and trying to get it
 

00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:21.309
looking at the data and trying to get it
into a format that is best suitable for

00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:21.319
into a format that is best suitable for
 

00:34:21.319 --> 00:34:23.020
into a format that is best suitable for
doing something with it for figuring out

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:23.030
doing something with it for figuring out
 

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.450
doing something with it for figuring out
patterns in the data figuring out who's

00:34:25.450 --> 00:34:25.460
patterns in the data figuring out who's
 

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.550
patterns in the data figuring out who's
struggling have I seen a pattern in

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560
struggling have I seen a pattern in
 

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:28.780
struggling have I seen a pattern in
who's struggling what were they doing

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:28.790
who's struggling what were they doing
 

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.540
who's struggling what were they doing
last year relative to this year how can

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:31.550
last year relative to this year how can
 

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.960
last year relative to this year how can
I help but it's also examining teacher

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:34.970
I help but it's also examining teacher
 

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:37.540
I help but it's also examining teacher
work so what am i doing and how

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:37.550
work so what am i doing and how
 

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:39.070
work so what am i doing and how
and I connect that to what my students

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:39.080
and I connect that to what my students
 

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.890
and I connect that to what my students
are learning and perhaps what I think

00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:41.900
are learning and perhaps what I think
 

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.750
are learning and perhaps what I think
you know maybe what I come up with as a

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760
you know maybe what I come up with as a
 

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.210
you know maybe what I come up with as a
great lesson for how to teach the area

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:46.220
great lesson for how to teach the area
 

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.800
great lesson for how to teach the area
of a triangle I think it's really great

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:47.810
of a triangle I think it's really great
 

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:49.570
of a triangle I think it's really great
but then I'm able to look at my student

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:49.580
but then I'm able to look at my student
 

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.330
but then I'm able to look at my student
data and I see only a third of the class

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:52.340
data and I see only a third of the class
 

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.300
data and I see only a third of the class
was able to pass my quiz on that so you

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:55.310
was able to pass my quiz on that so you
 

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.010
was able to pass my quiz on that so you
know can I put those two data pieces

00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:57.020
know can I put those two data pieces
 

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.740
know can I put those two data pieces
together and say what now and that

00:34:59.740 --> 00:34:59.750
together and say what now and that
 

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:01.330
together and say what now and that
brings us to the next stage in the

versions of Eros are there to help our
 

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.200
versions of Eros are there to help our
teachers so they can go in to Eros and

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:11.210
teachers so they can go in to Eros and
 

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.120

that I might not have tried before and
 

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.300
that I might not have tried before and
did it work for them maybe I'll try that

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:19.310
did it work for them maybe I'll try that
 

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.120
did it work for them maybe I'll try that
next time and incorporate that so that

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:22.130
next time and incorporate that so that

hundred percent of my kids can define
 

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.800
hundred percent of my kids can define
the area of a triangle so they're

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:35.810
the area of a triangle so they're
 

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.110
the area of a triangle so they're
setting targeted goals just like we set

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:38.120
setting targeted goals just like we set
 

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.770
setting targeted goals just like we set
targeted goals throughout the city again

Klein for a few years so we have the
 

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.190

discussion in Jerusalem is what is

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920
discussion in Jerusalem is what is
 

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.620
discussion in Jerusalem is what is
usually measured is what's fairly easy

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:13.630
usually measured is what's fairly easy
 

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:16.110
usually measured is what's fairly easy
to measure and that's graduation results

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:16.120
to measure and that's graduation results
 

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.960
to measure and that's graduation results
and results of national tests and that

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:18.970
and results of national tests and that
 

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.030
and results of national tests and that
is easy fairly easy to measure we have

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040
is easy fairly easy to measure we have
 

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.090
is easy fairly easy to measure we have
the results and we track the numbers but

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:24.100
the results and we track the numbers but
 

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.780
the results and we track the numbers but
as we learned in the morning education

and so the main discussion we have with

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:50.860
and so the main discussion we have with
 

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:53.310
and so the main discussion we have with
principals and teachers is that they are

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:53.320
principals and teachers is that they are
 

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:56.160
principals and teachers is that they are
saying look you track us for results of

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:56.170
saying look you track us for results of
 

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:59.040
saying look you track us for results of
graduations which is okay and we know

00:48:59.040 --> 00:48:59.050
graduations which is okay and we know
 

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.950
graduations which is okay and we know
that we can improve and sometimes in bed

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960
that we can improve and sometimes in bed
 

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.650

students and then our results would be

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:07.390
students and then our results would be
 

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:10.110
students and then our results would be
great because we were letting them go so

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:10.120
great because we were letting them go so
 

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.700

do you have this and part of what

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:11.710
do you have this and part of what
 

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:13.710
do you have this and part of what
we are trying to do now is asking what

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:13.720
we are trying to do now is asking what
 

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.580
we are trying to do now is asking what
can we measure beside graduation because

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:17.590
can we measure beside graduation because
 

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:20.520
can we measure beside graduation because
otherwise we are tilting the well you're

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:20.530
otherwise we are tilting the well you're
 

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:22.680
otherwise we are tilting the well you're
saying education is about graduation and

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:22.690
saying education is about graduation and

transformation then how can you measure

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.010
transformation then how can you measure
 

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.010
transformation then how can you measure
that and do you have any thoughts on the

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:35.020
that and do you have any thoughts on the
 

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:38.790
that and do you have any thoughts on the
matter so um that also is something that

on the English language arts and
mathematics scores one way too and we

00:49:59.310 --> 00:49:59.320
mathematics scores one way too and we
 

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.380
mathematics scores one way too and we
understand there is science and social

accountability system part of the
difficulty in that is that we don't have

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:10.900
difficulty in that is that we don't have
 

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.830
difficulty in that is that we don't have
annual assessments from from the state

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:13.840
annual assessments from from the state

we broaden broaden the spectrum that's

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:36.070
we broaden broaden the spectrum that's
 

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:38.700
we broaden broaden the spectrum that's
why we do have the survey the school

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:38.710
why we do have the survey the school
 

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:41.460
why we do have the survey the school
survey becomes an important an important

progress report grade because we know

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:46.210
progress report grade because we know
 

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.320

that the adults in the building have for
 

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:53.250
that the adults in the building have for
their students is very important and

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:53.260
their students is very important and
 

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:55.170
their students is very important and
becomes a factor in student achievement

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:55.180
becomes a factor in student achievement
 

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.780
becomes a factor in student achievement
at the school so we use that as one of

00:50:57.780 --> 00:50:57.790
at the school so we use that as one of
 

00:50:57.790 --> 00:50:59.970
at the school so we use that as one of
the broadening factors also the quality

00:50:59.970 --> 00:50:59.980
the broadening factors also the quality

the broadening factors also the quality
reviews are another way that we can get

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:02.830
reviews are another way that we can get
 

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:05.040
reviews are another way that we can get
to what's happening at the school what

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.050
to what's happening at the school what
 

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.870

high school level we actually have it's

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:13.780
high school level we actually have it's
 

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.720
high school level we actually have it's
a little more well-rounded because we

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:15.730
a little more well-rounded because we
 

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:17.640
a little more well-rounded because we
can look at credit accumulation from

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:17.650
can look at credit accumulation from
 

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:20.160
can look at credit accumulation from
year to year of students and when we're

year to year of students and when we're
 

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:23.160
year to year of students and when we're
looking at the examinations we can look

looking at the examinations we can look
 

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.680
looking at the examinations we can look
at we can look at a multitude of the

at we can look at a multitude of the
 

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:27.810
at we can look at a multitude of the

the high school report cards so that we

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200
the high school report cards so that we
 

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.740
the high school report cards so that we
can look at how are our schools

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:55.750
can look at how are our schools
 

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:59.070
can look at how are our schools

this one on two um I have a couple

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:12.850
this one on two um I have a couple
 

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:14.490
this one on two um I have a couple
questions so I'll try it to be fast the

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:14.500
questions so I'll try it to be fast the
 

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:17.580
questions so I'll try it to be fast the
first is the survey you discussed is

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:17.590
first is the survey you discussed is
 

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.820
first is the survey you discussed is
that internally created somewhere in the

00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:20.830
that internally created somewhere in the
 

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:23.700
that internally created somewhere in the
city department of education and what

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:23.710
city department of education and what
 

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.690
city department of education and what
sort of correlates do you see between

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:26.700
sort of correlates do you see between
 

00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:29.370
sort of correlates do you see between
survey results and test score results in

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:29.380
survey results and test score results in
 

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.860
survey results and test score results in
your other growth measures if any and

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:31.870
your other growth measures if any and
 

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:34.770
your other growth measures if any and
then also what are your growth measures

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:34.780
then also what are your growth measures
 

00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:37.770
then also what are your growth measures
you said compared to median growth is

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:37.780
you said compared to median growth is
 

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.900
you said compared to median growth is
this a cohort that you're looking at are

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:39.910
this a cohort that you're looking at are
 

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:41.280
this a cohort that you're looking at are
you just looking at the increase in

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:41.290
you just looking at the increase in
 

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.470
you just looking at the increase in
percentage of kids proficient per year

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:43.480
percentage of kids proficient per year
 

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.390
percentage of kids proficient per year
what was that growth measure that you're

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400
what was that growth measure that you're
 

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:49.230
what was that growth measure that you're
using sure so um now it lost the first

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:49.240
using sure so um now it lost the first
 

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.370
using sure so um now it lost the first
question because I was focused on the

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:50.380
question because I was focused on the
 

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:54.510
question because I was focused on the
same oh the survey got it ok so the

00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:54.520
same oh the survey got it ok so the
 

00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:57.990
same oh the survey got it ok so the
surveys were initially done by an

00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000
surveys were initially done by an
 

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.290
surveys were initially done by an
outside company but now we have for the

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:01.300
outside company but now we have for the
 

00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:03.330
outside company but now we have for the
most part brought those indicators in

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:03.340
most part brought those indicators in
 

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:05.010
most part brought those indicators in
house but we created the survey both

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:05.020
house but we created the survey both
 

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:07.770
house but we created the survey both
with educators and researchers across

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:07.780
with educators and researchers across
 

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:10.140
with educators and researchers across
the city and across the country to help

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:10.150
the city and across the country to help
 

00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:13.950
the city and across the country to help
inform the questions and the pieces we

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960
inform the questions and the pieces we
 

00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:15.600
inform the questions and the pieces we
looked at the university of chicago in

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:15.610
looked at the university of chicago in
 

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:19.320
looked at the university of chicago in
particular who who had already a similar

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:19.330
particular who who had already a similar
 

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.320
particular who who had already a similar
a similar survey implemented but they

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:22.330
a similar survey implemented but they
 

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.120
a similar survey implemented but they
again sample and we wanted to make sure

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:24.130
again sample and we wanted to make sure
 

00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:26.070
again sample and we wanted to make sure
that everybody had the opportunity to

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:26.080
that everybody had the opportunity to
 

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.460
that everybody had the opportunity to
respond from from families and also we

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:29.470
respond from from families and also we
 

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.430
respond from from families and also we
have teachers responding to when we look

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440
have teachers responding to when we look
 

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:35.040
have teachers responding to when we look
at the correlates the school those

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.050
at the correlates the school those
 

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:37.650
at the correlates the school those
things do correlate with our indicators

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:37.660
things do correlate with our indicators
 

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.440
things do correlate with our indicators
of progress and such one thing that we

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:40.450
of progress and such one thing that we
 

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:42.240
of progress and such one thing that we
would like to look at which we would

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:42.250
would like to look at which we would
 

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:44.610
would like to look at which we would
want to think about is does that change

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:44.620
want to think about is does that change
 

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.560
want to think about is does that change
over time depending on the status of

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:46.570
over time depending on the status of
 

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:48.180
over time depending on the status of
your school and i think that that's

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:48.190
your school and i think that that's
 

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:51.210
your school and i think that that's
something that we want to explore going

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:51.220
something that we want to explore going
 

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.590
something that we want to explore going
forward and we're also looking at

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:52.600
forward and we're also looking at
 

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:54.630
forward and we're also looking at
different studies about whether or not

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640
different studies about whether or not
 

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.570
different studies about whether or not
we can build a real climate index out of

00:53:57.570 --> 00:53:57.580
we can build a real climate index out of
 

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:58.620
we can build a real climate index out of
and i think that's where you are going

00:53:58.620 --> 00:53:58.630
and i think that's where you are going
 

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:01.700
and i think that's where you are going
for out of out of the survey measures

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:01.710
for out of out of the survey measures
 

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:04.980
for out of out of the survey measures
right and then on i think we want to

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:04.990
right and then on i think we want to
 

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:07.590
right and then on i think we want to
just talk about our proficiency ratings

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:07.600
just talk about our proficiency ratings
 

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.090
just talk about our proficiency ratings
Katie do you want to answer that a

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:09.100
Katie do you want to answer that a
 

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.069
Katie do you want to answer that a
little bit sure

00:54:11.069 --> 00:54:11.079
little bit sure
 

00:54:11.079 --> 00:54:13.739
little bit sure
so I'm not sure if this one hundred

00:54:13.739 --> 00:54:13.749
so I'm not sure if this one hundred
 

00:54:13.749 --> 00:54:16.140
so I'm not sure if this one hundred
percent answers your question but in

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:16.150
percent answers your question but in
 

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:18.029
percent answers your question but in
terms of what our outcome measures are

00:54:18.029 --> 00:54:18.039
terms of what our outcome measures are
 

00:54:18.039 --> 00:54:20.940
terms of what our outcome measures are
it really focuses around this idea of

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:20.950
it really focuses around this idea of
 

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:24.029
it really focuses around this idea of
the pier index and making sure that we

00:54:24.029 --> 00:54:24.039
the pier index and making sure that we
 

00:54:24.039 --> 00:54:27.839
the pier index and making sure that we
are only comparing our schools any given

00:54:27.839 --> 00:54:27.849
are only comparing our schools any given
 

00:54:27.849 --> 00:54:30.870
are only comparing our schools any given
school to the schools that are really in

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880
school to the schools that are really in
 

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.209
school to the schools that are really in
its peer group and so this will change

00:54:33.209 --> 00:54:33.219
its peer group and so this will change
 

00:54:33.219 --> 00:54:35.670
its peer group and so this will change
from year at here it'll change school to

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680
from year at here it'll change school to
 

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.380
from year at here it'll change school to
school there is no one school that has

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:37.390
school there is no one school that has
 

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:40.589
school there is no one school that has
the same exact peer group as the other

00:54:40.589 --> 00:54:40.599
the same exact peer group as the other
 

00:54:40.599 --> 00:54:42.690
the same exact peer group as the other
because purposefully we make sure that

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:42.700
because purposefully we make sure that
 

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:47.640
because purposefully we make sure that
that schools scores are the median for

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:47.650
that schools scores are the median for
 

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:49.650
that schools scores are the median for
their peer group at the starting point

00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:49.660
their peer group at the starting point
 

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.599
their peer group at the starting point
and then we're able to track how they're

00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:51.609
and then we're able to track how they're
 

00:54:51.609 --> 00:54:53.759
and then we're able to track how they're
doing relative to the rest of the

00:54:53.759 --> 00:54:53.769
doing relative to the rest of the
 

00:54:53.769 --> 00:54:55.979
doing relative to the rest of the
schools in their group both the 20

00:54:55.979 --> 00:54:55.989
schools in their group both the 20
 

00:54:55.989 --> 00:54:58.380
schools in their group both the 20
schools that are above them and the 20

00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:58.390
schools that are above them and the 20
 

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:00.390
schools that are above them and the 20
schools that are below them at their

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400
schools that are below them at their
 

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.920
schools that are below them at their
base line in the baseline of course

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:01.930
base line in the baseline of course
 

00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:06.390
base line in the baseline of course
changes from year to year I think I

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400
changes from year to year I think I
 

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.949
changes from year to year I think I
think part of the question was also

00:55:07.949 --> 00:55:07.959
think part of the question was also
 

00:55:07.959 --> 00:55:10.589
think part of the question was also
whether it's scale scores or proficiency

00:55:10.589 --> 00:55:10.599
whether it's scale scores or proficiency
 

00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:13.859
whether it's scale scores or proficiency
levels they are they are we call them

00:55:13.859 --> 00:55:13.869
levels they are they are we call them
 

00:55:13.869 --> 00:55:19.219
levels they are they are we call them
proficiency um I'm well so I don't know

00:55:19.219 --> 00:55:19.229
proficiency um I'm well so I don't know
 

00:55:19.229 --> 00:55:21.839
proficiency um I'm well so I don't know
how familiar everyone is with this but

00:55:21.839 --> 00:55:21.849
how familiar everyone is with this but
 

00:55:21.849 --> 00:55:23.670
how familiar everyone is with this but
when we talk about whether a student

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680
when we talk about whether a student
 

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.499
when we talk about whether a student
meets proficiency on our state test

00:55:25.499 --> 00:55:25.509
meets proficiency on our state test
 

00:55:25.509 --> 00:55:27.749
meets proficiency on our state test
scores that's do they reach a level

00:55:27.749 --> 00:55:27.759
scores that's do they reach a level
 

00:55:27.759 --> 00:55:30.569
scores that's do they reach a level
three so there's level 1 level 2 level 3

00:55:30.569 --> 00:55:30.579
three so there's level 1 level 2 level 3
 

00:55:30.579 --> 00:55:32.849
three so there's level 1 level 2 level 3
and level 4 and that's the ultimate cut

00:55:32.849 --> 00:55:32.859
and level 4 and that's the ultimate cut
 

00:55:32.859 --> 00:55:35.430
and level 4 and that's the ultimate cut
off however we like to take that a step

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440
off however we like to take that a step
 

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.829
off however we like to take that a step
further because grouping our students

00:55:37.829 --> 00:55:37.839
further because grouping our students
 

00:55:37.839 --> 00:55:39.390
further because grouping our students
our million students into four buckets

00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400
our million students into four buckets
 

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.729
our million students into four buckets
doesn't necessarily seem the you know

00:55:41.729 --> 00:55:41.739
doesn't necessarily seem the you know
 

00:55:41.739 --> 00:55:42.959
doesn't necessarily seem the you know
the most straightforward way to do

00:55:42.959 --> 00:55:42.969
the most straightforward way to do
 

00:55:42.969 --> 00:55:45.689
the most straightforward way to do
things so we have a range ranging from

00:55:45.689 --> 00:55:45.699
things so we have a range ranging from
 

00:55:45.699 --> 00:55:48.930
things so we have a range ranging from
one to four point five on a hundredth of

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:48.940
one to four point five on a hundredth of
 

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:52.049
one to four point five on a hundredth of
a point scale and so a student in any

00:55:52.049 --> 00:55:52.059
a point scale and so a student in any
 

00:55:52.059 --> 00:55:54.870
a point scale and so a student in any
given class could get if he or she is a

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880
given class could get if he or she is a
 

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:58.349
given class could get if he or she is a
two she could be a two point zero one or

00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359
two she could be a two point zero one or
 

00:55:58.359 --> 00:56:00.509
two she could be a two point zero one or
two point nine nine and so when we're

00:56:00.509 --> 00:56:00.519
two point nine nine and so when we're
 

00:56:00.519 --> 00:56:02.430
two point nine nine and so when we're
developing what our peer schools are

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:02.440
developing what our peer schools are
 

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.859
developing what our peer schools are
it's not just what proportion of

00:56:04.859 --> 00:56:04.869
it's not just what proportion of
 

00:56:04.869 --> 00:56:06.539
it's not just what proportion of
students in that school are reaching

00:56:06.539 --> 00:56:06.549
students in that school are reaching
 

00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:08.430
students in that school are reaching
proficient meaning reaching a level 3 or

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.440
proficient meaning reaching a level 3 or
 

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.009
proficient meaning reaching a level 3 or
higher we look at their exact average

00:56:11.009 --> 00:56:11.019
higher we look at their exact average
 

00:56:11.019 --> 00:56:15.120
higher we look at their exact average
peer proficiency index rating so a

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:15.130
peer proficiency index rating so a
 

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:16.979
peer proficiency index rating so a
school might have an average of two

00:56:16.979 --> 00:56:16.989
school might have an average of two
 

00:56:16.989 --> 00:56:19.650
school might have an average of two
point six seven 3.45 but that's

00:56:19.650 --> 00:56:19.660
point six seven 3.45 but that's
 

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.269
point six seven 3.45 but that's
basically a transformation from our

00:56:21.269 --> 00:56:21.279
basically a transformation from our
 

00:56:21.279 --> 00:56:22.559
basically a transformation from our
scale scores that's where I got tripped

00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:22.569
scale scores that's where I got tripped
 

00:56:22.569 --> 00:56:23.970
scale scores that's where I got tripped
up on my words

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:23.980
up on my words
 

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.880
up on my words
so it's a test are made up of scale

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:26.890
so it's a test are made up of scale
 

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.849
so it's a test are made up of scale
scores and performance levels and scale

00:56:29.849 --> 00:56:29.859
scores and performance levels and scale
 

00:56:29.859 --> 00:56:31.590

standard scores kind of feel like that

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:34.990
standard scores kind of feel like that
 

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:37.290

awful black box that nobody understands
 

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.780
awful black box that nobody understands
and how does it work so what we did is

00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:39.790
and how does it work so what we did is
 

00:56:39.790 --> 00:56:42.240
and how does it work so what we did is
we transform those scale scores into

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:42.250
we transform those scale scores into
 

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.000
we transform those scale scores into
proficiency ratings which just really

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:45.010
proficiency ratings which just really
 

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:47.490
proficiency ratings which just really
said your level one you could be a level

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:47.500
said your level one you could be a level
 

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.040
said your level one you could be a level
one point one the level 1 point 2 etc so

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:50.050
one point one the level 1 point 2 etc so
 

00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:51.900
one point one the level 1 point 2 etc so
it just made made them more real but it

00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:51.910
it just made made them more real but it
 

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:54.300
it just made made them more real but it
translates to the scale scores and then

00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:54.310
translates to the scale scores and then
 

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.730
translates to the scale scores and then
we look at the students for this year

00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:56.740
we look at the students for this year
 

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.690
we look at the students for this year
and we looked at their percentile rank

00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700
and we looked at their percentile rank
 

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.400
and we looked at their percentile rank
among all of the scale score so we could

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:02.410
among all of the scale score so we could
 

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:04.290
among all of the scale score so we could
look at movement from year to year and

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:04.300
look at movement from year to year and
 

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:07.680
look at movement from year to year and
that enabled us to stabilize stabilize

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:07.690
that enabled us to stabilize stabilize
 

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.960
that enabled us to stabilize stabilize
the system because there was a lot of

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:09.970
the system because there was a lot of
 

00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:12.750
the system because there was a lot of
movement around the state tests so if we

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760
movement around the state tests so if we
 

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.609
movement around the state tests so if we
saw the percentile rank from one year

00:57:14.609 --> 00:57:14.619
saw the percentile rank from one year
 

00:57:14.619 --> 00:57:16.590
saw the percentile rank from one year
compared to the percentile rank of the

00:57:16.590 --> 00:57:16.600
compared to the percentile rank of the
 

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.870
compared to the percentile rank of the
next year of a student we could we could

00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880
next year of a student we could we could
 

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.840
next year of a student we could we could
normalize some of the bounce in the test

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:21.850
normalize some of the bounce in the test

lot of immigrant students and we have a
 

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:02.460

out of schools I have two questions

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.140
out of schools I have two questions
 

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.590
out of schools I have two questions
first is how long does it take to phase

00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:40.600
first is how long does it take to phase
 

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.170
first is how long does it take to phase
out of school once you're going through

out of school once you're going through
 

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:47.390
out of school once you're going through
and second is you replace it I

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400
and second is you replace it I
 

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.890
and second is you replace it I
frequently hear that you replace it by

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:49.900
frequently hear that you replace it by
 

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:52.380
frequently hear that you replace it by
smaller schools don't you have a

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:52.390
smaller schools don't you have a
 

00:59:52.390 --> 01:00:01.020
smaller schools don't you have a
capacity problem not yet Anthony Anthony

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:01.030
capacity problem not yet Anthony Anthony
 

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:05.130
capacity problem not yet Anthony Anthony
a chair it's very interesting to replace

01:00:05.130 --> 01:00:05.140
a chair it's very interesting to replace
 

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:08.250
a chair it's very interesting to replace
it by a new school and drastic but it's

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:08.260
it by a new school and drastic but it's
 

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.700
it by a new school and drastic but it's
very efficient i think but to replace it

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:11.710
very efficient i think but to replace it
 

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:13.740
very efficient i think but to replace it
by a smaller school it's kind of a

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:13.750
by a smaller school it's kind of a
 

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:18.720
by a smaller school it's kind of a
structural approach but in in my city

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:18.730
structural approach but in in my city
 

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:21.300
structural approach but in in my city
where we're struggling with a capacity

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:21.310
where we're struggling with a capacity
 

01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:24.540
where we're struggling with a capacity
problem for all schools we need to build

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:24.550
problem for all schools we need to build
 

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:28.440
problem for all schools we need to build
new schools new schools and so so so i

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:28.450
new schools new schools and so so so i
 

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:29.940
new schools new schools and so so so i
think one thing that we should talk

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:29.950
think one thing that we should talk
 

01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:31.620
think one thing that we should talk
about is that when we are opening and

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:31.630
about is that when we are opening and
 

01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:33.870
about is that when we are opening and
closing schools we're not really talking

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:33.880
closing schools we're not really talking
 

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.120
closing schools we're not really talking
about brick and mortar so we're not

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:36.130
about brick and mortar so we're not
 

01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:38.220
about brick and mortar so we're not
building uh you know we're not building

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:38.230
building uh you know we're not building
 

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:40.170
building uh you know we're not building
something here and then you know taking

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:40.180
something here and then you know taking
 

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:43.440
something here and then you know taking
down a building what in New York City

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:43.450
down a building what in New York City
 

01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:44.970
down a building what in New York City
what existed in many

01:00:44.970 --> 01:00:44.980
what existed in many
 

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.640
what existed in many
of in other places as well is that our

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:47.650
of in other places as well is that our
 

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:50.340
of in other places as well is that our
schools were rather large and they were

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:50.350
schools were rather large and they were
 

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:54.300
schools were rather large and they were
upwards of 1,500 students and sometimes

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:54.310
upwards of 1,500 students and sometimes
 

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:58.620
upwards of 1,500 students and sometimes
2,000 3,000 students in many of those

01:00:58.620 --> 01:00:58.630
2,000 3,000 students in many of those
 

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:00.570
2,000 3,000 students in many of those
cases those are very very large

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:00.580
cases those are very very large
 

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:04.260
cases those are very very large
buildings so the schools when we go to

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:04.270
buildings so the schools when we go to
 

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:05.640
buildings so the schools when we go to
do a phase out and I'll get you a

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:05.650
do a phase out and I'll get you a
 

01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:07.050
do a phase out and I'll get you a
question about how that phase out works

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:07.060
question about how that phase out works
 

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:11.160
question about how that phase out works
we're able to to begin a school where

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:11.170
we're able to to begin a school where
 

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:16.050
we're able to to begin a school where
one large one once once belonged what

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:16.060
one large one once once belonged what
 

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:19.710
one large one once once belonged what
we're doing is able to have a school

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:19.720
we're doing is able to have a school
 

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:22.200
we're doing is able to have a school
smaller schools coexist and there was a

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:22.210
smaller schools coexist and there was a
 

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:25.349
smaller schools coexist and there was a
very large national study done on our on

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:25.359
very large national study done on our on
 

01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:29.580
very large national study done on our on
our small school movement from MDRC that

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:29.590
our small school movement from MDRC that
 

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:33.240
our small school movement from MDRC that
really showed the the success of these

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:33.250
really showed the the success of these
 

01:01:33.250 --> 01:01:36.240
really showed the the success of these
first cohorts of our small schools and I

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:36.250
first cohorts of our small schools and I
 

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:38.609
first cohorts of our small schools and I
would invite you to take a look at that

01:01:38.609 --> 01:01:38.619
would invite you to take a look at that
 

01:01:38.619 --> 01:01:41.490
would invite you to take a look at that
but that's how that's how that works so

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:41.500
but that's how that's how that works so
 

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:44.700
but that's how that's how that works so
we're actually not oh not not physically

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:44.710
we're actually not oh not not physically
 

01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:47.460
we're actually not oh not not physically
building something but really working

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:47.470
building something but really working
 

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:50.730
building something but really working
and breaking up a often times larger

01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:50.740
and breaking up a often times larger
 

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.430
and breaking up a often times larger
schools in too many more into smaller

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440
schools in too many more into smaller
 

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.140
schools in too many more into smaller
schools within that building that can

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:55.150
schools within that building that can
 

01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:58.070
schools within that building that can
coexist and just like any family

01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:58.080
coexist and just like any family
 

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.570
coexist and just like any family
sometimes the coexistence works better

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:00.580
sometimes the coexistence works better
 

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.240
sometimes the coexistence works better
than others but we have worked through

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:02.250
than others but we have worked through
 

01:02:02.250 --> 01:02:05.010
than others but we have worked through
ways to enable those schools to be

01:02:05.010 --> 01:02:05.020
ways to enable those schools to be
 

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:09.150
ways to enable those schools to be
successful and share and share many of

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:09.160
successful and share and share many of
 

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.490
successful and share and share many of
the resources within that school around

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:11.500
the resources within that school around
 

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.740
the resources within that school around
the phase-out once it's decided as a

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:13.750
the phase-out once it's decided as a
 

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:16.800
the phase-out once it's decided as a
community that that the end by the

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:16.810
community that that the end by the
 

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:18.390
community that that the end by the
Chancellor that the school will indeed

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400
Chancellor that the school will indeed
 

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.730
Chancellor that the school will indeed
be phased out what that means is that

01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:20.740
be phased out what that means is that
 

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.250
be phased out what that means is that
the school no longer take incoming

01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:23.260
the school no longer take incoming
 

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:26.640
the school no longer take incoming
students into that school and phasing

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:26.650
students into that school and phasing
 

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:29.430
students into that school and phasing
out means that they will allow allow

01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440
out means that they will allow allow
 

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:31.500
out means that they will allow allow
those students who are still in the

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:31.510
those students who are still in the
 

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:34.410
those students who are still in the
building to finish up until their grade

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:34.420
building to finish up until their grade
 

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.540
building to finish up until their grade
level is no longer it's usually

01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:36.550
level is no longer it's usually
 

01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:38.130
level is no longer it's usually
typically in the high schools where

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:38.140
typically in the high schools where
 

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:40.200
typically in the high schools where
where I can use the best example where

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:40.210
where I can use the best example where
 

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:42.780
where I can use the best example where
we have a nine through twelve ninth

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:42.790
we have a nine through twelve ninth
 

01:02:42.790 --> 01:02:44.730
we have a nine through twelve ninth
grade through twelfth grade school and

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:44.740
grade through twelfth grade school and
 

01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:47.010
grade through twelfth grade school and
so once it's decided that that school

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:47.020
so once it's decided that that school
 

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:49.320
so once it's decided that that school
will indeed phase out they won't take

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:49.330
will indeed phase out they won't take
 

01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:51.120
will indeed phase out they won't take
any more ninth graders so now there'll

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:51.130
any more ninth graders so now there'll
 

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:53.490
any more ninth graders so now there'll
be a 10th 11th and 12th grade the

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:53.500
be a 10th 11th and 12th grade the
 

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.080
be a 10th 11th and 12th grade the
following year they'll be in eleventh

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:55.090
following year they'll be in eleventh
 

01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:56.640
following year they'll be in eleventh
and twelfth grade then there'll be a

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:56.650
and twelfth grade then there'll be a
 

01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:58.140
and twelfth grade then there'll be a
twelfth grade and

01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:58.150
twelfth grade and
 

01:02:58.150 --> 01:03:00.029
twelfth grade and
then until they are completely phased

01:03:00.029 --> 01:03:00.039
then until they are completely phased
 

01:03:00.039 --> 01:03:02.809
then until they are completely phased
out so it's a multi-pronged approach

01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:02.819
out so it's a multi-pronged approach
 

01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:05.970
out so it's a multi-pronged approach
similarly that's how we phase in our new

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:05.980
similarly that's how we phase in our new
 

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:08.039
similarly that's how we phase in our new
small schools we first take an incoming

01:03:08.039 --> 01:03:08.049
small schools we first take an incoming
 

01:03:08.049 --> 01:03:10.019
small schools we first take an incoming
ninth grade then it goes 10th grade and

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:10.029
ninth grade then it goes 10th grade and
 

01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:12.720
ninth grade then it goes 10th grade and
that helps to build a capacity of that

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:12.730
that helps to build a capacity of that
 

01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:20.069
that helps to build a capacity of that
new smaller school as well oh come this

01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079
new smaller school as well oh come this
 

01:03:20.079 --> 01:03:23.069
new smaller school as well oh come this
will be our last question comment I mean

01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:23.079
will be our last question comment I mean
 

01:03:23.079 --> 01:03:25.109
will be our last question comment I mean
I'm actually in a new school in a phase

01:03:25.109 --> 01:03:25.119
I'm actually in a new school in a phase
 

01:03:25.119 --> 01:03:27.690
I'm actually in a new school in a phase
out my school my phase out closed down

01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:27.700
out my school my phase out closed down
 

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:29.819
out my school my phase out closed down
two years ago for failure because the

01:03:29.819 --> 01:03:29.829
two years ago for failure because the
 

01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:32.370
two years ago for failure because the
progress report was consistently addy

01:03:32.370 --> 01:03:32.380
progress report was consistently addy
 

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.579
progress report was consistently addy
your time and time again and the

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:35.589
your time and time again and the
 

01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:37.380
your time and time again and the
learning environment survey was very low

01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:37.390
learning environment survey was very low
 

01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:39.359
learning environment survey was very low
the parents were not happy with what was

01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:39.369
the parents were not happy with what was
 

01:03:39.369 --> 01:03:41.819
the parents were not happy with what was
going on in the school so I proposed a

01:03:41.819 --> 01:03:41.829
going on in the school so I proposed a
 

01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:44.220
going on in the school so I proposed a
new school and we are it was AK 28

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:44.230
new school and we are it was AK 28
 

01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:46.049
new school and we are it was AK 28
school in the Rockaways that was closed

01:03:46.049 --> 01:03:46.059
school in the Rockaways that was closed
 

01:03:46.059 --> 01:03:47.789
school in the Rockaways that was closed
down and I'm the elementary school and

01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799
down and I'm the elementary school and
 

01:03:47.799 --> 01:03:49.799
down and I'm the elementary school and
right now last year we started pre-k to

01:03:49.799 --> 01:03:49.809
