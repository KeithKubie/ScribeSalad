00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.060
[Brady:] Professor, I couldn't interview the famous Cédric Villani and not ask about the spider

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.600
[Prof. Villani:] Huh

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.540
[Brady:] Can I ask about the spider?

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.440
Anyone who's seen photos of you will see this spider...

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.000
...you wear it very often

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.300
Do you talk about where it comes from?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.760
You have a few different ones, don't you?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.140
Why do you wear a spider?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.700
[Prof. Villani:] I've a lot of them but I never explain why

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.800
Let me, for Numberphile, show you some of my best specimens

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.980
[Brady:] Oh they even have special cases

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.400
[Prof. Villani:] Yeah I've to protect them

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.200
This is from Niger...

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.880
... was made by a Tuareg artist

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.580
This is a carnelian .. the stone

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.840
This I bought from a Bulgarian seller

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.900
This one comes from Uruguay

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.780
This one... that one... they were made for me

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.520
This one also was made for me

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.260
It's from Morocco ... it is Berber art

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
This one is from Eastern Europe... amber

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.060
Here are some sick ones that we have to take to operation

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.920
[Prof. Villani:] This one... [Brady:] That's your hospital, is it? [Prof. Villani:] It's a hospital

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.680
That one from Macedonia

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.680
That one from Argentina

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.220
They will go into... surgery

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.920
[Brady:] But the reason for the spider is ... this is an unanswered question

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.340
I'm not going to get an answer

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.420
This is the mystery of Cédric Villani

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.020
[Prof. Villani:] I think you will not get your answer

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.440
[Brady:] How many times are you asked about it?

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.360
[Prof. Villani:] About everyday

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:45.800
So... since I started wearing it ... ten years ago, it's been a lot of times...several thousand times

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.860
[Brady:] How many people know the answer?

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.900
[Prof. Villani:] Oh ... a..

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.120
...less than that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.460
[More Villani on Numberphile:] See how much it folds and folds on itself.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.850
[More Villani on Numberphile:] Also it remains in organic form, you know like ... some kind of salad

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.160
[Brady:] Alright but you know a thousand people are going to write comments under the video about what they think ... (laughs)
