00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.702
Mario Torrey.

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:03.870
Atlanta based.
- Mhm.

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:05.438
- What part of Atlanta?
- Decatur.

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:06.305
Decatur.

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:07.340
Oh.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.541
Are you safe
everywhere in Decatur?

00:00:08.574 --> 00:00:09.742
- Yeah.
- OK.

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:10.843
I don't like how you
thought about it.

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.378
At my own house.

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:14.480
My house is the
most dangerous spot.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:16.549
Why do you say your house
is the most dangerous spot?

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:17.650
My kids and the dog.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:18.618
It's horribly unsafe.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:19.919
That's kind of the worst--

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:21.220
that's the worst of both words.
- Unsafe.

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:22.355
- What kind of dog do you have?
- Doberman.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:23.423
- I've got a doberman.
- Get the--

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.390
I got a dobie!

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:25.792
Are you serious?
- Shut the front door.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:26.692
The best breed of
dogs you can buy.

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:27.427
But they'll kill you.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.094
You see?

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:29.662
This is a real comic--

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:30.997
I didn't even
know you had one.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.864
I'll stop the interview.
You got a doberman?

00:00:31.897 --> 00:00:32.732
Yeah!

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.333
I got a doberman.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.836
Look, if we weren't here, I'd
scroll through pictures, man.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:38.704
That's me and Roxie when
she first came home.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:39.605
Right!

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:40.840
[interposing voices]

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:42.642
Aw, look at Dobo when we was--

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:43.509
So you got a boy?

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:44.710
Got a boy.

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:45.812
Do you feel like
he-- has he adapted

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:46.913
your personality in your house?

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.147
- No.
- No.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.515
- He's scared [bleep] of me.
- Really?

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:50.216
Well, you [inaudible].

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:51.451
I have to threaten him.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:52.485
It's your voice.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:53.553
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:54.454
- Sit down.
- No, it's deeper than that.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.054
Sit down.

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:56.222
Sit your ass down.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:56.923
[laughter]

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:57.824
You gotta-- yeah.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:58.991
What about your girl?

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:00.226
My fiancee, man.
Just got engaged.

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:01.394
- [applause]
- Yeah.

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:02.395
Congratulations.

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:03.463
She's-- she's in
the service, man.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.397
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.531
So it's very
organized at my house.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:06.399
OK.

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:07.433
Yeah, I got a--

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.735
you know, it's army,
a dog, three kids.

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:10.903
Oh, you got--

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:12.171
[inaudible] you
walking on the line.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:13.005
Huh?

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:13.906
Walking on the straight line.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.274
I'm telling you.

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:16.242
So comedy is an outlet.
Is it safe to say that?

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.610
- What?
- An outlet.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.946
Oh my god, I be waiting to
leave the house [bleep].

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.981
It's like, you just
don't understand.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:23.816
But, you know, that's
what keeps me going.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.384
You know, it's a motivation.
- OK.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:27.019
You've got a family
that depends on you.

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:28.488
So I keep going, man.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:29.755
I love that, man.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.858
You know, I like the fact
that you dig into your life.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.825
Is anything off limits?

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:33.726
No, no, no.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.894
I think it's over, man.

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:36.429
Reality is a funny--

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:39.732
[inaudible] basically dig into
who you are, then why do it?

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:40.900
Pretty much.
- Right.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.135
Exactly.
- And you're doing it, man.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.669
You're figuring it out.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.171
Brother, it's time for you to
get to the next level, man.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.439
Walk on that stage and
do what you do best.

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:48.938
- Let's go.
- I'll see you later, man.
