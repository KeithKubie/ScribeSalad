00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.290
The buzzer sounds.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.410
The teammates’ hands link and raise up in
victory.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.349
The heads of the other team dip in defeat.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.410
The orange basketball is flung up in celebration.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.430
Young student-athletes dance around, releasing
a year’s worth of pent up stress due to

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.300
basketball and (in theory) school-work.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.090
Another men’s basketball NCAA championship
has been won.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.490
The winning team gathers, exchanging high-fives
and hugs, as ladders are brought out to the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.070
court and positioned underneath the baskets.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.070
With a pair of scissors in hand, each member
of the team, from the players to coaches to

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.140
the training staff, are given a chance to
climb the ladder and snip a tangible piece

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.500
of this memory for themselves.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.850
By doing this, they are engaging in the tradition
known as the “cutting of the nets.”

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.990
The basketball net, the very same one that
had shot after shot swish through pushing

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.300
this team to victory, has now become a piece
of sports memorabilia.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.989
This custom of “cutting the nets” began
where many other basketball traditions had

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.840
their beginnings — in the state of Indiana.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.530
When asked by his Indiana high school yearbook
what he believed his future occupation would

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.260
be, Everett Case answered “basketball coach.”

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.560
And this was in 1919 — before the NCAA,
before the NBA, and before basketball held

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.009
the American sporting conscious like it does
today.

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.560
For an 18 year old high school graduate to
answer that question with an occupation that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.740
was, well, not really an occupation at the
time, showed his undying passion for the game.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.870
Upon graduation, Case attended the University
of Wisconsin-Green Bay.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.810
Afterwards, he went to the University of Illinois
to study the finer points of the game under

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.270
the great Ralph Jones, considered by many
to be the father of Indiana high school basketball.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.950
At the age of 22, Case was selected over 18
other applicants to become Frankfort High’s

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.350
basketball and track coach.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.490
Within three years, Case had led the small
central Indiana high school to the state championship.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.300
Over his 16 season tenure at Frankfort, Case’s
teams would win the state championship three

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.590
more times.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.240
After each championship, Case would remind
his boys to always cherish the memory and,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.180
perhaps, to take a little something that would
help them with that task.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.540
Often, that little something were the basketball
nets.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.340
In 1941, and at the age of 41, Everett Case
gave up being a high school basketball coach

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.870
to join the Navy.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.279
It was said that Case, ever enthusiastic and
patriotic, joined in such a haste that he

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:22.430
left his desk at the school fully stocked
and didn’t retrieve his belongings until

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.920
he returned five years later.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.650
While in the Navy, Case was commissioned as
a senior-grade lieutenant and trained in Chicago

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.750
and California.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.930
But his real talents were coaching and organizing
young men to play basketball.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.260
He was appointed the Navy’s assistant athletic
director and director of basketball.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.019
After the war, Case returned to the state
of Indiana to retrieve his belongings from

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.379
his desk, but he did not stay long.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.140
Upon leaving the Navy, he took his coaching
expertise south and became the head coach

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.569
at North Carolina State University.

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.239
Case had immediate success at NC State, leading
them to the 1946 Southern Conference title.

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.629
In 1947, NC State again won the conference
title.

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.930
Upon victory, Everett Case, excited, proud,
and wanting to cherish the memory, harked

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.500
back to his days at Frankfort High in Indiana.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.989
Remembering his players snipping the net,
he asked arena workers for a ladder.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.639
Unfortunately, there was no ladder to be found.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.239
Case, undeterred, had his players hoist him
up on their shoulders for him to grab his

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.440
twine memento.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.540
The Hoosier tradition had found its way to
the national stage.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.049
Case would go on to become a coaching legend,
establishing NC State as a college basketball

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.079
powerhouse.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.590
They would win four more Southern Conference
titles before moving to the Atlantic Coast

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.680
Conference (the ACC) and winning four more.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.809
He was named the ACC Coach of the Year three
times.

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:41.569
Case is credited in turning North Carolina,
always football country, into a basketball-crazed

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:42.569
state (for evidence, watch a Duke or UNC basketball
game).

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.239
He popularized the postseason tournament,
convincing the ACC to put on their conference

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.120
tournament in his home arena and the NCAA
to award the winner of the conference tournament

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.010
automatic entrance into the NCAA championship
tournament.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.040
He is still the winningest coach in NC State
history and was enshrined into the Basketball

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.019
Hall of Fame in 1982.

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.469
In 1964, Case was diagnosed with multiple
melanoma, a cancer of plasma cells.

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.229
The disease is incredibly painful as it slowly
eats away at the bone marrow in one’s body.

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.950
Case had to retire only two games into the
season.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.329
During that year’s ACC tournament, Case
was not on the sideline, but rather sat courtside

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.220
and confided to a wheelchair.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.560
He watched as his NC State Wolfpack upset
the top-ranked – and interstate rival – Duke

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.950
Blue Devils.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.371
When the final buzzer sounded, the players
walked over to Case and helped him out of

00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:30.371
his wheelchair.

00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:34.660
They placed their beloved coach on their shoulders
and watched as Case snipped his final net.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.290
Eighteen months later, Everett Case would
pass away, but the tradition of preserving

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:51.500
lifelong college basketball memories with
a snipe of twine still persists to

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:01.110
this day.
