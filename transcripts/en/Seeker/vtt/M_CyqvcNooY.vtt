00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.490
New research shows that by looking at a person’s
face, you can tell what they do for a living.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:11.160
Be honest - you always knew I was a GQ model.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.680
Hey people who have faces, this is DNews and
I am Trace face.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.710
We're taught not to judge a book by its cover,
but when you look at a face, you make an assessment

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.939
about its owner’s personality, character,
and inner qualities.

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.199
This process is called physiognomy from a
Greek word meaning "the art of judging someone’s

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.669
character from their appearance."

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.669
Everybody does it.

00:00:33.669 --> 00:00:38.890
Our brains take cognitive shortcuts all the
time, using past (or assumed) knowledge to

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.890
make determinations in the present.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.300
And according to a new study, we're pretty
good at guessing correctly.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.310
The study, published in Leadership Quarterly,
found that a person’s job could be accurately

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.470
identified just by looking at their face.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.600
Out of 325 CEOs, 64 US Army Generals, 66 state
governors, and 43 American football coaches

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.510
-- all unknowns -- the participants were able
to accurately match face to occupations at

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.229
a better rate than pure "chance.”

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:24.990
A study in Science Magazine found that when
Swiss children as young as five years old

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.210
were shown pictures of French leaders running
for Parliament, they could predict who would

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.670
win the election with scary accuracy.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.200
Another study found in only 100 milliseconds,
people could judge and predict, in advance,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.329
the winners of around 70 percent of U.S. gubernatorial
and Senate races, with no prior knowledge

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.329
of the candidates!

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.470
In fact, studies show we'll judge faces first
based on sex or gender, age, and ethnicity.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.270
After that, we'll take into account facial
symmetry, height-to-width ratio, and "baby-faceness."

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.280
From that we can pretty accurately judge a
number of traits: mainly trustworthiness and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.280
dominance.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.369
From these we determine attractiveness, responsibility,
aggressiveness and threat, and even intelligence

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.369
and morality!

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.160
A 2016 study in Cogent Psychology found older
voters tend to look for older, more attractive

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.930
faces, while younger voters were less influenced
by attractiveness.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.950
The implication here is that if we judging
faces implicitly, we're doing the same in

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.060
the voting booth.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.010
Essentially, scientists are saying we may
not be voting based on any policy or job-related

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.440
information, but just these implicit judgements.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.130
In fact, there's a whole area of the brain
dedicated to facial recog within the temporal

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.900
lobe called the fusiform gyrus.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.050
When we determine something is a face, then
ostensibly, the fusiform gyrus will process

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.500
that face while higher brain areas make a
judgement about it.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.519
The Cognitive Miser theory says whenever it
can, our brain will take the shortcut of using

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.430
an easy-to-evaluate characteristic instead
of taking the time to make a more accurate,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.000
but time consuming judgement.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.459
And back to that first Leadership Quarterly
study?

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.510
They found we're actually really bad at knowing
this is happening.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.690
We do it subconsciously...

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.540
Which is pretty scary to think about.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.239
So when you're looking at your candidates
this year, maybe stop looking at them and

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.140
listen to what they say, read their platforms,
and talk with others about their ideas.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:16.599
Don’t forget, you’re literally deciding
the face 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:35.030
of 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.900
the future.
