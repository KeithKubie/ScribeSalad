Hey, it's me Destin, from Smarter Every Day.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.020
Welcome to the No Dumb Questions podcast.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.460
This is not Smarter Every Day.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.180
When I create videos for Smarter Every Day,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.960
I'm usually thinking by myself.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.120
Think of it like a creative work of mine.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.540
It's an effort to express myself and my view of the world around me in a creative, intelligent way.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.480
It's not unlike music, but it's mostly just my own thoughts

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.980
and trying to figure out what exactly it is I'm trying to do.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.460
There's this guy I like to talk to you, and he sees the world from a little different angle than what I do I.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.680

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.850
I like to look at the world through the lens of an engineer.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.860
I like to figure things out using the scientific method.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.260
My friend Matt on the other hand is a humanities guy from the wild west out in Wyoming.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.220
He left Academia back in the day and decided to become a pastor.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.940
Something I discovered over the last few years is that there's a lot of noise.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.860
People are making sounds, but they're not really listening to each other.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.560
What we hope to do with this podcast,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.560
is to start to make music together, and play off of each other in order to get better.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.660
There's this cool thing that happens when you start to ask questions,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.960
and actually hear the other person.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.760
If you start to listen to each other and play off of each other,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.040
the whole becomes more than the sum of the parts.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.460
You start to get better together.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.940
So here's the deal. We're making a podcast.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.440
And I think it's going to be really cool, because if you like Smarter Every Day,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.770
I think it's going to be really good

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.280
and I would love for you to get in on the ground floor, and if you want to,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.640
you can do that by going to NoDumbQuestions.FM

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.000
and subscribing, or just searching for that wherever get your podcasts.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.500
I think you'll like it.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.440
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this half as much as I do because I've already been a part of these conversations for over two years,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.560
and when you get a science guy and humanities guy in the same room, really cool stuff starts to come out.

I'm Destin, and this is No Dumb Questions.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.220
I think this is going to be fun.
