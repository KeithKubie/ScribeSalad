00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:53,460
Black with the side pipes
as for 27 try carb. Right.

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,770
That's a beautiful one that sent me to
that. So that's all generation three,

15
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:03,060
right? Yeah. My, my, my, uh, my
neighbors hate me. That fucker is loud.

16
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,860
I bags. The gap year is amazing.
Those, those are gorgeous cars, man.

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,870
And compared to what you can, but you
know, I like it, man. I loved them.

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,060
I love Corvettes. I like the new
ones too. I like all of them. Yeah.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,180
Well you got something else besides
a corvette too? I heard about,

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,420
but I haven't seen, I seen the
corvette, but what else? Um,

21
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,940
I have a 69 Nova that they're
building right now. I did something,

22
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,610
I think I did. Yeah. And you,

23
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,330
everything's like super new. It's, yeah.

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,410
Yeah.
I don't like old shit.

25
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,780
Fucked up suspensions. We
can't go around corners. Yeah.

26
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:47,040
I'm not interested in dying.
Not like that. Oh yeah.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,300
I like what they call [inaudible].
[inaudible] that's yours. Oh No, no. Well,

28
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,183
yeah.
Um,

29
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,490
the yellow one I got from a guy who's
a plastic surgeon and that was like his

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,760
bottom of the line car,
but he did everything to it.

31
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:06,510
It's got the suspension and everything
and that's a big difference. Yeah, yeah,

32
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,690
yeah. I could try that
thing anywhere. But the, uh,

33
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:13,590
the black one for 27 try carb.
It's old school,

34
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,790
old school all the way and breaks.
No, no, it's got this spray. Yeah.

35
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,270
That's where you gotta draw
the line. Yeah. Yeah. Got
It. I gotta be able to stop.

36
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,660
Gotta be able to stop it. That
fucker is. And actually I like,

37
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,770
I like shit like that. I, I
wouldn't mind the restaurant,

38
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,580
but I liked the, I like,
Oh shit man. I just,

39
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:36,940
I like old houses and I'm like,
oh, cars. I collect old bikes.

40
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,880
Yeah. Just old shit. I just,
shit man. I do too. Yeah.

41
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,610
I think this character to old things.
Yep.

42
00:02:44,611 --> 00:02:48,030
It's like either you like it or you don't
like some people just like everything

43
00:02:48,031 --> 00:02:52,080
new and modern and shiny.
Like when I started making money,

44
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,550
I started buying older cars.

45
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,200
I like older shit does have a
different feel to them. Totally.

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,400
Totally. Totally. I have a, uh,
yeah. Yes. Is to trade his truck,

47
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,610
man. What did I get this? I got that. Uh,

48
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,660
probably six months ago.
[inaudible]

49
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,260
see I liked it motherfucker. Man.
I look at all the Patina on that.

50
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,680
It's a crew cab or for 61 crew cab.

51
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,880
Find those creek and it came from
the factory. A crew cab. Man,

52
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,670
that truck looks like me.
Bashed in windows.

53
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,510
Shit's cars. I love it. I love you.

54
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:35,320
Tried that around that motherfucker.
You know what? I'm waiting there.

55
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,920
I am going to get the body work done on
that motherfucking because it's got some

56
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,370
holes in it. Oh, it's pretty
beat up. Yeah, it's pretty.

57
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,980
I got to get the body though.
There's something to that.

58
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,960
When you look at those old cars,

59
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,370
you realize that they don't make
anything like this anymore. No Man,

60
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,150
they didn't fit the style. Uh,
they really put a lot into style.

61
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:57,910
Carson 50s and 60s.
Man do now,

62
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:02,560
but it just doesn't seem the same
look good. Like a new core Vat,

63
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:06,520
like a 2019 corvette. It's a beautiful
car. But you look at that old truck,

64
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,520
it does not have what that truck has.
It's like you put it,

65
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,030
it'll put a smile on your
face. Just driving it, man.

66
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,060
One of my biggest joys is it sitting
behind the wheel at one of those old cars.

67
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,140
Man.
It just makes me,

68
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,970
I feel like a young mother fucking when
I'm sitting here like a kid. Yeah, yeah.

69
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:29,740
Oh, like a ride. Like you drive it around
the ride. It is, yeah. It's so much.

70
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,340
You pull up to a stoplight, some
mother fucking in the, the chronic,

71
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,740
some guys give me a thumbs up and I
be cheesing from ear to ear when that

72
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:43,150
happens. And you don't even have to drive
those fast. No. Yeah. Even that corvette,

73
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,100
you don't have to. Every once in a while
it's fun, you know, break them loose.

74
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,810
It's a little funny to break them with,
but yeah, you don't have to drive.

75
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,250
Well for a power lifted though,

76
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:58,090
it's almost like mandatory for you to
have some sort of a muscle car. Yeah,

77
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,170
I guess so. It's like, it
goes with the territory,

78
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,510
doesn't like a big block
engine. There's, you know,

79
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:07,570
somebody got a video of you
driving by. Yeah. That's hilarious.
