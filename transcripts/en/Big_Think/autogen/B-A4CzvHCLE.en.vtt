which is aware of the prefrontal cortex
and that diminishes the depression and

recover and then they get depressed
 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.160
recover and then they get depressed
again so with that group they use

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170
again so with that group they use
 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.740

mindfulness based cognitive therapy they

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750
mindfulness based cognitive therapy they
 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.440
mindfulness based cognitive therapy they
found that it cut the rate of relapse of

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
found that it cut the rate of relapse of
 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.040

having depression again by 50% if this

were a drug some pharmaceutical company

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930
were a drug some pharmaceutical company
 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.920
were a drug some pharmaceutical company
would be making billions of dollars but

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930
would be making billions of dollars but
 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.710
would be making billions of dollars but
it's not a drug it's it's free basically

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720
it's not a drug it's it's free basically
 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.750
it's not a drug it's it's free basically
so mindfulness based cognitive therapy

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760
so mindfulness based cognitive therapy
 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.199
so mindfulness based cognitive therapy
works very well for depression better

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209
works very well for depression better
 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.300
works very well for depression better
design studies afterwards show that it

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310
design studies afterwards show that it
 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.900
design studies afterwards show that it
was 50% but still the impact is palpable

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910
was 50% but still the impact is palpable
 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.840
was 50% but still the impact is palpable
and it turns out that mindfulness and

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850
and it turns out that mindfulness and
 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.820
and it turns out that mindfulness and
other meditations particularly combined

other meditations particularly combined
 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.550
other meditations particularly combined
with cognitive therapy work just as well

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560
