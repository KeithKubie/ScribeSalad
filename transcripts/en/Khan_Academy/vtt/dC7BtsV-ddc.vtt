00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:01.254
- [Voiceover] Hello David.

00:00:01.254 --> 00:00:02.545
- [Voiceover] Hello Kim.

00:00:02.545 --> 00:00:03.378
- [Voiceover] So I brought you here

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:04.406
to talk about the Gilded Age,

00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:06.634
which is one of my favorite eras

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:08.016
of American history.

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:08.933
- [Voiceover] Because everything was great

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:09.955
and covered in gold?

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:11.998
- [Voiceover] No, because
it is the only era

00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:13.716
of American history I can think of

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:15.818
that has a sarcastic name.

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:16.909
(laughter)

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.011
- [Voiceover] What's
to be sarcastic about?

00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:20.450
What's happening between,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.155
so I see it's from 1865 to 1898

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.547
which is the end of the Civil War,

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:27.230
and then what happens in 1898?

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.868
- [Voiceover] It's
basically everyone woke up

00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:29.796
one morning and were like

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:30.934
"oh we're done with the Gilded Age,

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.397
now it's time for the Progressive Era".

00:00:32.397 --> 00:00:34.278
- [Voiceover] Hooray,
Spanish-American wartimes!

00:00:34.278 --> 00:00:35.111
- [Voiceover] More first the

00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:36.251
Spanish-American War.

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:38.597
So the Gilded Age is kind of this period

00:00:38.597 --> 00:00:41.818
of really intense industrialization

00:00:41.818 --> 00:00:45.860
and kind of focusing on
America's development

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.268
as an industrial and business power.

00:00:48.268 --> 00:00:49.394
It's very inward looking,

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:51.635
whereas after the Spanish-American war

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:53.492
the United States takes a bigger role

00:00:53.492 --> 00:00:54.816
on the world's stage.

00:00:54.816 --> 00:00:57.739
The sarcastic part of the Gilded Age

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.729
is that this was a term coined

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.029
by Mark Twain

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:02.196
of all people,

00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:04.096
in 1890.

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:08.862
And he wrote a book
called "The Gilded Age",

00:01:08.862 --> 00:01:10.732
and what Twain was trying to say

00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:13.030
was that the United States in this period

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.780
wasn't experiencing a golden age,

00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:20.310
an era of prosperity and happiness,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.144
but rather a Gilded Age.

00:01:22.144 --> 00:01:23.526
- [Voiceover] Oh so just like a thin layer

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:24.726
of gold on top,

00:01:24.726 --> 00:01:26.951
disguising the cheap tin beneath?

00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:27.784
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:01:27.784 --> 00:01:29.061
- [Voiceover] Oh snap, Mark Twain.

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:30.477
(laughter)

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:31.722
So what's going on in this era

00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:33.441
that earns this nickname?

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.524
What is the appearance of

00:01:36.648 --> 00:01:37.809
fancy,

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:38.642
lovely gold

00:01:38.642 --> 00:01:39.841
that just turns out

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:41.160
to be tacky and miserable?

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.365
- [Voiceover] Well I think what people

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:44.009
are talking about under the title

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.109
of Gilded Age is that

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.525
it's this time when immense wealth

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:52.025
is accumulated by a number of individuals.

00:01:53.564 --> 00:01:54.841
Many of whom still have

00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:57.407
their names on things today.

00:01:57.407 --> 00:01:59.648
Like Andrew Carnegie,

00:01:59.648 --> 00:02:02.306
of Carnegie Mellon University,

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:04.141
or Carnegie Hall.

00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:05.141
J.P. Morgan,

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:09.896
who was a banking magnet.

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.300
We still have J.P. Morgan

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.437
as a financial institution today.

00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:17.094
And I would say John D.
Rockefeller is another.

00:02:17.094 --> 00:02:20.019
He was a founder of standard oil,

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.993
so he was an oil baron.

00:02:21.993 --> 00:02:24.292
Of Rockefeller Center, right.

00:02:24.292 --> 00:02:25.476
So these are the individuals

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:27.113
who got enormously wealthy

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:28.518
in the Gilded Age.

00:02:28.518 --> 00:02:31.014
And they got wealthy by being the captians

00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:33.643
of these new expanding industries.

00:02:33.643 --> 00:02:34.811
- [Voiceover] Titans of industry.

00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:36.357
- [Voiceover] The titans of industry.

00:02:36.357 --> 00:02:37.190
So steel,

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:39.703
and banking,

00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:42.731
and oil.

00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:44.984
But they got rich partly

00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:47.539
through political corruption.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:49.848
So one of the less than savory parts

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:51.346
of the Gilded Age is that.

00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:52.844
A lot of this was done through

00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:54.992
political kickbacks,

00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:57.128
bribing of officials,

00:02:57.128 --> 00:02:58.892
bribing of the vice president

00:02:58.892 --> 00:02:59.903
of the United States.

00:02:59.903 --> 00:03:01.331
- [Voiceover] Woah woah woah, what?

00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.261
They bribed the vice president?

00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:03.661
(laughter)

00:03:03.661 --> 00:03:05.382
- [Voiceover] That was a scandal that

00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:07.925
dogged the presidency of

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:09.005
Ulysses S. Grant

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:09.968
- [Voiceover] Oh man.

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:11.907
- [Voiceover] Credit Mobilier

00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:13.035
was a construction company

00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:15.535
that had less than savory ties

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.349
to some people very high up in government.

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.822
So these fortunes of people

00:03:21.822 --> 00:03:23.285
like Carnegie and Morgan

00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:26.543
were built partly on political corruption,

00:03:26.543 --> 00:03:28.460
and partly on the backs

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:31.319
of waves

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.683
of immigrant laborers.

00:03:33.683 --> 00:03:36.401
- [Voiceover] Like my ancestors.

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.219
- [Voiceover] Like my ancestors.

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.700
And so during this time period

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.336
in the eastern part of Europe,

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:44.775
in the southern part of Europe,

00:03:44.775 --> 00:03:47.870
there were political eruptions,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.302
there were just general poverty

00:03:50.302 --> 00:03:51.987
especially in Italy.

00:03:51.987 --> 00:03:54.717
In Russia there were a number of pogroms,

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:57.743
which sent Russian Jews out of Russia

00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:00.774
and they came to the United States.

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:03.560
And they came from very bad situations,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.278
so what they came to
was a little bit better

00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:06.776
but it wasn't much better.

00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:07.914
- [Voiceover] Which is
how they all ended up

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.261
living in this one apartment

00:04:09.261 --> 00:04:10.782
in lower Manhattan,

00:04:10.782 --> 00:04:11.896
as you've detailed

00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:13.614
in this Jacob Riis photograph.

00:04:13.614 --> 00:04:14.578
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:04:14.578 --> 00:04:17.179
Okay so, Jacob Riss was

00:04:17.179 --> 00:04:20.244
a photographer in the 1890's.

00:04:20.244 --> 00:04:23.634
And he went around the lower east side

00:04:23.634 --> 00:04:25.282
of Manhattan,

00:04:25.282 --> 00:04:27.082
basically just photographing

00:04:27.082 --> 00:04:30.656
what he called "How the Other Half Lives".

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:33.863
By the other half he meant immigrants,

00:04:33.863 --> 00:04:35.673
the poor who were living in the

00:04:35.673 --> 00:04:37.368
lower east side of Manhattan.

00:04:37.368 --> 00:04:38.971
Which, at that time,

00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:40.445
was the most dense

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:42.862
section of humanity on Earth.

00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:45.157
And you can see here that

00:04:45.157 --> 00:04:47.495
this is a photograph from a tenement

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.211
that he took a picture of.

00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.886
- [Voiceover] And what is a tenement?

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:53.170
- [Voiceover] So tenements were these

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.833
apartment dwellings

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.219
which kind of sprang up,

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.763
often in the backyards

00:04:57.763 --> 00:05:00.170
of other normal buildings.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.347
But they were sort of hastily constructed,

00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:05.160
they had many rooms in them,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.497
they weren't up to fire code.

00:05:06.497 --> 00:05:09.433
I'm not even sure there was a fire code.

00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:12.516
Most of the rooms didn't have windows

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.624
or electric lighting,

00:05:15.624 --> 00:05:16.823
or ventilation.

00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:18.544
- [Voiceover] Sounds like
a great place to live.

00:05:18.544 --> 00:05:19.810
(laughter)

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.678
But does it have curb appeal, Kim?

00:05:21.678 --> 00:05:22.642
(laughter)

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:24.091
- [Voiceover] There is some pictures

00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:25.393
that can show you no,

00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:26.502
most of them were next

00:05:26.502 --> 00:05:28.174
to giant rotting heaps of garbage.

00:05:28.174 --> 00:05:29.126
- [Voiceover] Oh boy.

00:05:29.126 --> 00:05:31.183
- [Voiceover] One of my favorite things

00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:32.016
about the story of Jacob Riis

00:05:32.016 --> 00:05:33.902
is that he was a pioneer

00:05:33.902 --> 00:05:35.418
in the field of photography

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:38.283
because he used flash photography.

00:05:38.283 --> 00:05:39.258
So you know,

00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:40.374
you've seen in old movies

00:05:40.374 --> 00:05:42.912
those flashbulbs that go off, right?

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:44.254
Cause that was the only way

00:05:44.254 --> 00:05:45.846
he could get these apartments

00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:47.054
- [Voiceover] Cause there was

00:05:47.054 --> 00:05:47.887
no lighting in them.

00:05:47.887 --> 00:05:49.087
- [Voiceover] There was
no lighting in them.

00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:50.035
so you couldn't take a picture

00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:51.069
of them without light.

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.549
So he brought his flash camera

00:05:53.549 --> 00:05:55.783
and he regularly set things on fire.

00:05:55.783 --> 00:05:56.616
- [Voiceover] Oh no.

00:05:56.616 --> 00:05:57.449
(laughter)

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:58.432
- [Voiceover] In these apartments

00:05:58.432 --> 00:05:59.265
as he was trying to document

00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:00.098
what life was like.

00:06:00.098 --> 00:06:00.931
- [Voiceover] Oh that's awful.

00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:03.793
- [Voiceover] So this
is a photograph by Riis

00:06:03.793 --> 00:06:06.553
called "Five Cents a Spot",

00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:08.855
and so you paid five cents a night

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:09.688
to live in this apartment.

00:06:09.688 --> 00:06:12.206
And so if you count here,

00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.039
there's one,

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.072
two,

00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:16.305
three,

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:17.686
four,

00:06:17.686 --> 00:06:18.708
five,

00:06:18.708 --> 00:06:19.541
six,

00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:21.343
I think this is somebody else's legs,

00:06:21.343 --> 00:06:23.593
seven, did I get everybody?

00:06:24.443 --> 00:06:26.266
There might be somebody
else hiding over here.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:28.707
Seven men sharing this room,

00:06:28.707 --> 00:06:31.267
and they're just doing the best they can.

00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:32.856
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:06:32.856 --> 00:06:34.841
- [Voiceover] And you
compare that with this,

00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:38.480
which is John D. Rockefeller's mansion

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.931
in New York.

00:06:39.931 --> 00:06:41.081
It's called

00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:42.404
and I'm gonna butcher this

00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:43.237
"Kykuit".

00:06:45.632 --> 00:06:49.301
So the real question of the Gilded Age

00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:50.566
is how is it

00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:53.233
that some people get so wealthy,

00:06:54.246 --> 00:06:56.568
while some people are incredibly poor?

00:06:56.568 --> 00:06:57.648
- [Voiceover] Sure.

00:06:57.648 --> 00:07:00.318
- [Voiceover] And whose
responsibility is that?

00:07:00.318 --> 00:07:01.814
At one point,

00:07:01.814 --> 00:07:04.868
J.P. Morgan decides he is going

00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:07.551
to buy out Andrew Carnegie.

00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:09.002
He buys him out for more than

00:07:09.002 --> 00:07:11.301
four hundred million dollars,

00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:14.122
he loans money to the U.S. government.

00:07:14.122 --> 00:07:16.688
So he is the single biggest creditor

00:07:16.688 --> 00:07:18.407
to the U.S. government.

00:07:18.407 --> 00:07:20.171
At that point who has more power,

00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:21.309
the federal government,

00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:22.239
or J.P. Morgan?

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:23.530
- [Voiceover] So we're really talking

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.028
about the clash of two

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:29.434
great and terrible energies, right?

00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:31.341
Like this immense wealth,

00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.184
and this immense deprivation.

00:07:33.184 --> 00:07:34.176
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:07:34.176 --> 00:07:35.555
- [Voiceover] How do they play out?

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:36.991
- [Voiceover] We'll get to that

00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:37.824
in some more videos.
