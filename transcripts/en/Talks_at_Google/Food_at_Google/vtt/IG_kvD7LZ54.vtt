[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.722 --> 00:00:06.930
JASON ANDREAS: Well, thanks,
you guys, for coming in.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.430
We appreciate it.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.550
It's awesome to have you jump
across town here and join us.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.280
Super excited to have
you guys in town.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.780
Excuse me.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.710
Not just in Detroit,
but in town as well.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.320
You guys have been getting
a lot of fantastic press

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.946
around Detroit.

00:00:19.946 --> 00:00:22.070
And we'd love to hear a
little bit more about that.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.180
Before we jump in and
talk about Prime + Proper,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.337
we want to talk
about the sourcing

00:00:26.337 --> 00:00:27.420
of the meat you guys have.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.920
We've got Walter here to
talk about that, which

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.409
I think is going to be awesome.

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.200
We had a phone call a
couple of months ago.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.650
And I can tell you would
love to talk about it.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.550
Because he's a
very talkative guy.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.440
And he dug it.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.570
I grew up on a farm.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.270
I don't know if you
remember me saying that?

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.500
WALTER APFELBAUM: Yeah, I
remember you saying that.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.310
JASON ANDREAS: I
grew up on a farm.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.560
So I was all ears.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.950
So I'm excited to dig into
that a little bit more.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.630
But before we do that,
we have chefs in.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.360
We have restaurateurs in.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.130
We'd love to kind
of get a, where

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.430
did you start, where did you
kind of catch the bug at,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.850
and how did that turn into
where you guys are at now.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.870
Just kind of lay the
foundation for all of us

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.736
so we understand where
you guys came from

00:01:02.736 --> 00:01:04.860
and how you got to the
point that you guys are both

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.620
working together as
partners at Prime + Proper.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.070
RYAN PRENTISS: Well, like
pretty much any great chef--

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.310
the vast majority of them--

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.726
I think both of
us started kind of

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:17.630
on the bottom, a little
bit different realms.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.710
I started washing dishes when
I was 15-years old at Coney

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.810
Island in Baltimore,
Michigan-- so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.280
a little bit of a
Northeaster here.

00:01:27.692 --> 00:01:29.150
Worked there for
a couple of years.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.600
Went and worked with my
uncle, who's also a chef--

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.700
my uncle Mike.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.060
Worked for him for
probably six years or so.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.629
He taught me a
whole lot of things.

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:42.920
I started off kind of washing
dishes at his restaurant,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.180
and then kind of
worked my way up.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.980
And by the time I
left working with him,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.715
I was kind of managing
the kitchen with him.

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:50.840
I went to culinary school
right out of high school.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.200
Never worked in
any other business

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.381
a single day in my
life, which is sometimes

00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:57.380
kind of unnerving to me.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.060
But it's like, it's what I do.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.580
So I'm OK with it.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.030
But yeah, I just worked through
several different, great

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.040
kitchens in this area.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.745
I learned a lot from
a lot of good chefs

00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:11.120
that have kind of since moved
on and went different ways.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.670
I started working for Townhouse
Birmingham in 2014, I think.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.700
And jumped on board with
that restaurant group.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.640
And we've since opened Townhouse
Detroit and now Prime + Proper,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.550
which I got to
meet this big guy.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.420
So it's been a fun ride.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.670
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.794
And what about you, Walter?

00:02:33.794 --> 00:02:37.640
What's the origin story behind
how you came to Detroit?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.920
WALTER APFELBAUM: Well, I'm
a born and raised Jersey boy,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.020
right on the Jersey Shore.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.000
And as you see, I don't
sound like those people

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.280
from the "Jersey Shore"
even though I grew up right

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.740
where they filmed all that.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.500
I grew up in an
all-German household.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.140
And it was, we don't
go to grocery stores.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.310
You go to butcher shops.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.720
And you go to the fishmonger.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.220
You go to the bread guy
for bread and cheese--

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.870
it was like an all-day
excursion with my parents.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.180
Just getting to eat
like that, and seeing

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.820
all of the passion
and love for people

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.107
that do what they do
best, and just growing up

00:03:12.107 --> 00:03:13.940
with the butcher shop
right down the corner,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.380
and spending all my time in
the shop from elementary school

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.980
up--

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.200
and literally it's the
only thing I've ever done,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.490
is just I've always
been around beef.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.670
And the guy that I was
learning from was like, here,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.362
you're going to learn
everything from the bottom up.

00:03:31.362 --> 00:03:32.820
And it was like,
here, you're going

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.360
to go help birth a
pig and birth cows.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.740
And it was like,
ah, this is gross.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.980
But it was important to
learn the entire process,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.320
from birth to raising
them to harvesting them

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.790
to breaking them
down completely,

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.740
utilizing everything.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.410
And then probably the most
important thing I learned

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.970
was how to talk to people
and trying to understand

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.120
what they were looking for.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.120
A lot of people
nowadays, it's like, oh,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.920
New York strips, and rib-eyes.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.220
I'm like, the animal's huge.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.960
There's so much more meat.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.400
So trying to understand,
what are you making?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.230
What are you going to be doing?

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.217
Maybe the rib-eye's not
the right pick for you.

00:04:14.217 --> 00:04:15.300
Maybe the chuck end isn't.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.100
And maybe an eye round
is right for you.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.230
So it was all learning how to
make people comfortable with me

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.390
so that you trusted me.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.380
You would come and see.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.530
And it was important for me
to learn old-world butchery.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.650
And that was old butchery, is
everybody trusted the butcher.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.730
You trust your fish guy.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.410
You trust your bread guy.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.710
So trust was a big thing.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.240
So he had taught me all this
and then started literally

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.579
pimping me out to all butcher
shops throughout New York,

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:44.120
all throughout the
city, Connecticut,

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.980
that whole tri-state area.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.694
And then one day, finally
my buddy was like, hey,

00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:49.860
I need help in a restaurant.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.810
And I'm like, sure.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.360
And I worked a day in a
restaurant in the butcher shop.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.710
And I was like,
are you kidding me?

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.840
This is awesome.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.170
And it was.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.346
And then probably a
year or two after that,

00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:01.970
then I moved right
into the restaurants

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.400
and haven't looked back.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.130
I don't like to say I'm a
restaurant guy because I'm not.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.090
I've not worked a day
in my life on the line.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.400
I'm the guy that's going to
be a tool in his toolbox.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.450
So that's what I've told all
the chefs, is, use me as a tool.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.130
I'm here to make
your job easier,

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.670
make your job better,
to help the brand shine,

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.800
help the chef shine.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.780
I'm not really one
for the spotlight.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.630
I'd rather give the spotlight
to this guy or the brand

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.060
by providing the best.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.310
RYAN PRENTISS: I've heard
you talk about your--

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.560
I like that you referred to
it as an origin story too.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.580
It's kind of funny.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.150
I've heard you talk about all
of your experiences before.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.720
But you just managed to roll
birthing cattle and being

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.540
pimped out into
your origin story.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.459
I love it.

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:49.250
JASON ANDREAS: See.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.990
Once you get him
going, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.869
WALTER APFELBAUM: I'm
not even going yet.

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:54.410
I'm like, I got to
feel you guys out.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.570
I got to see where you're at
before you get all of Walter.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.167
It's a lot.

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:02.000
But I mean, pretty much,
that's where I was.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.140
And it was important.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.389
The guy was like, make sure
you go to culinary school.

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.900
So CIA in upstate New
York, I got a chance

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.130
to go work overseas
for several years--

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.010
which was awesome-- out
at Hamburg, Germany,

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.130
and just get to see
a lot of Africa,

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.060
a lot of the Middle East,
a lot of Eastern Europe,

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.590
northern Europe.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.400
And it was great.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.350
It was a lot of fun.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.370
And I just butchered.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.290
That's all I did.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.744
It was a lot of butchery,
a lot of fishmongering.

00:06:27.744 --> 00:06:30.160
I got to actually spend a lot
of time making cheese, which

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.640
was pretty cool.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.620
I got to step away from
meat for about a year

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.870
and just make cheese,
which was really cool.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.282
But it was still being
part of the dairy program

00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:40.990
and getting the dairy
to make the cheese,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.781
and getting to see the
dairy cows in Italy.

00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:44.170
So it was awesome.

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.390
It was a lot of fun.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.050
And now I'm here with this guy.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.756
RYAN PRENTISS: Walter,
I want to pause

00:06:49.756 --> 00:06:51.130
for a second on
a point you made.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.115
So you went to the Culinary
Institute of America.

00:06:54.115 --> 00:06:55.990
And you also mentioned
something before that,

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.090
that you're not really
a restaurant guy.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.800
When you think of the CIA--

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.660
not the CIA, the Culinary
Institute of America--

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.820
you think more chefs,
folks are actually

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.330
going into the
restaurant business.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.680
I think I read that you
were the only butcher

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.736
in your class at the CIA.

00:07:12.736 --> 00:07:14.110
WALTER APFELBAUM:
That I knew of.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.770
And it was horrible, man.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.309
Mike, the guy that I learned
how to cook from, he was like,

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:19.600
oh, this is where you're going.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.280
Little did I know
that when we got

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.020
into meat ID and
meat fabrication,

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.840
that they knew each other.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.750
I had no idea.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.120
So he's like, listen,
you're going to go.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.930
And you're going to go blind.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:29.710
You're just going to learn.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:30.502
And I'm like, sure.

00:07:30.502 --> 00:07:31.960
So I'm in the back
of the classroom

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.070
and he's just like,
oh, Walter will

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.236
come show us how to do this.

00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:35.510
And I'm like, whoa, what?

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.430
I'm like, how do
you know I what?

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.820
So it was interesting.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.839
So I spent a lot of my time just
being part of the meat class.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:44.380
Even when we were
done with meat fab,

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.800
I was always there
helping teach kids.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.390
But it was also great to learn
with young guys, like Ryan--

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.959
getting to see these kids,
and this is the future

00:07:54.959 --> 00:07:55.750
that they're going.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.909
And it's like, get to
see their minds work.

00:07:57.909 --> 00:07:59.950
And it's like, OK, this
is where they want to go.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.760
And what can I do to help that?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.760
And it was awesome to get
to spend a lot of time

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.942
with some young chefs,
god, back in the 90s.

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:09.400
I've been refrigerated
all my life.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.200
So I've kept my youthful look.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.830
I'm going to be 44 in a month.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:15.310
JASON ANDREAS:
That's the secret,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.630
is spending time
in a refrigerator?

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.588
WALTER APFELBAUM: Yeah.

00:08:17.588 --> 00:08:20.557
No sunlight, just refrigeration.

00:08:20.557 --> 00:08:22.640
JASON ANDREAS: The Walter
Apfelbaum beauty regimen

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.040
right here.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.440
WALTER APFELBAUM: Exactly.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.030
JASON ANDREAS: Trademark
that before it gets out.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.710
WALTER APFELBAUM: Just
spend time with me.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:27.390
RYAN PRENTISS: Lamb fat.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.430
Lamb fat all over yourself.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.513
WALTER APFELBAUM: Oh, man.

00:08:29.513 --> 00:08:31.730
Lamb fat is the key to life.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.849
I tell everybody that.

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:34.390
You literally look
at the ingredients

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.280
for hand moisturizers,
skin lotions.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.150
And the number one ingredient
is lanolin and lamb fat.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.740
Most of it is lanolin.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.020
So when everybody's
like, they shake my hand,

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.480
they're like, oh, my god,
Walter, your hands are so soft.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.896
And they're like,
what do you use?

00:08:50.896 --> 00:08:53.370
And I'm like, lanolin.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:54.177
And it's awesome.

00:08:54.177 --> 00:08:54.760
And it's good.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.343
I mean, I put on my
lips a little bit.

00:08:56.343 --> 00:08:57.760
It makes them soft.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.289
My wife hates it.

00:08:59.289 --> 00:09:00.580
She'll come and give me a kiss.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.710
And she's like, oh,
my god, what is that?

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.350
She's like, stop, it's gross.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.760
And I'm like, it's lamb fat.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.139
Don't worry about it.

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:08.680
It's healthy.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.846
JASON ANDREAS: It's natural.

00:09:09.846 --> 00:09:11.086
WALTER APFELBAUM: Yeah.

00:09:11.086 --> 00:09:12.460
JASON ANDREAS:
What took you then

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:18.980
from, again, the Jersey Shore,
the CIA, all over Europe,

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.830
Africa, Middle East, et cetera?

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.010
I know you were in
Florida most recently.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.360
What brought you to Detroit?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.850
And then what was the
story of how both of you

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.854
connected to kind of come
together at Prime + Proper?

00:09:31.854 --> 00:09:33.520
WALTER APFELBAUM: I
actually got hired--

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.180
the Seminole Tribe of Florida
I was working for in Florida

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.560
before I started work with them.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.280
They were in a partnership
with the Steinbrenners

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.600
that owned the Yankees.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.380
And all the Yankees do all their
training in Tampa, Florida.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:48.830
So they all lived in Tampa.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:52.215
So they were working on their
steakhouse in Tampa, Council

00:09:52.215 --> 00:09:52.870
Oak.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.030
And they were also working
with the Steinbrenners

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.075
to be building NYY
Steak in Yankee Stadium.

00:09:58.075 --> 00:09:59.950
And they were like,
listen, we got these guys

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.710
that don't know what they're
doing in the butcher shop

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.639
at Council Oak in Tampa.

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:05.680
We need to find somebody.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.150
And it was the coolest
thing, that all of a sudden

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.070
here come the Seminole
Tribe leaders knocking

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.530
on my door going,
hey, come to Florida.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.780
And I'm like, it's too hot.

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.180
But I wound up in
Florida for nine years

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.610
doing all their Council
Oak's in Tampa, Hollywood,

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.491
and then NYY Steak in Coconut
Creek Midtown Manhattan, Yankee

00:10:22.491 --> 00:10:22.990
Stadium.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.100
So I did all theirs.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.550
And the next thing I know,
our owner Jeremy Sassoon

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.750
reached out via Instagram.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.750
And I'm just like, I don't
know who this guy is.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:32.791
I get all these messages.

00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:34.566
Some weird creepo
guy is messaging me.

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:35.690
And I'm like, I don't know.

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.450
What is this guy doing?

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:38.830
So I finally answered him.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.510
And then we talked.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.460
And he's just like,
yeah, you should come up.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.690
And I'm like, well,
where are you at?

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.970
This is such a great idea.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.420
I love your concept,
everything about it.

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:48.670
And he's like, I'm in Detroit.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.730
And I'm like, no.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.940
Outside of Detroit, they
don't talk about this.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.280
And I'm like, man, I don't know.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.822
It's Detroit.

00:10:57.822 --> 00:10:59.654
There's no way I'm going
to convince my wife

00:10:59.654 --> 00:11:00.490
to move to Detroit.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.870
My father is going to murder me.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.030
You're not going to
see me ever again.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:05.740
And then he's like,
no, let's fly up.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.790
So he flew me up here.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.060
And literally, he brought
me right downtown.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.290
And I was like, flashbacks
of 1980s New York.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.730
And I'm like, this is amazing.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.450
I was like, this is New
York all over again for me,

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.940
being a child and watching New
York grow to what it is now,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.600
like Brooklyn.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.140
Good luck buying anything in
Brooklyn, Manhattan, downtown.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.880
It's amazing.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.540
The street life, the whole
vibe of New York is incredible.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.310
And I remember when it wasn't.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.020
I remember when
it was just like,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:36.060
hurry up, get in, get out.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.780
And it was not the
best place to be.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.940
And I remember watching
just New York come up

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:42.880
to where it is now.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.796
So when I got here, I
was like, holy mackerel,

00:11:44.796 --> 00:11:47.670
this is New York.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.520
This is New York in the 80s.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.882
And I was like, this is amazing.

00:11:51.882 --> 00:11:53.340
I couldn't believe
the construction

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.690
and the people, the whole vibe.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.920
And then I told him that night,
I'm like, I'm totally down.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.510
Where do I sign?

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:01.650
I'm down.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.110
Literally, my words
to Jeremy was,

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.229
you're building Peter Lugars.

00:12:06.229 --> 00:12:07.770
I was like, that's
what you're doing.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:09.840
You're building an
institution that you

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.420
can't put a price tag on.

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.060
I would love to be the guy that
goes, I opened Peter Lugars.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.260
I opened Keynes.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.000
I opened Delmonico's.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.800
I can't.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.960
But Prime + Proper?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.460
Yeah.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.060
In Detroit?

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.740
Yeah.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:22.520
This is amazing.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.730
It's great to be part of
Detroit's up and coming,

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.710
and being where it needs to be.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.050
Putting it right back on
that pedestal of just being

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:35.310
an amazing city to be part of.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.300
JASON ANDREAS: And
Jeremy on that first trip

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.460
took you to Eastern
Market, as I understand.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.460
So that's the tie-in to--

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.575
you mentioned the early
days in the Jersey Shore

00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:48.200
going to the fishmonger, and the
butcher, and things like that.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.255
So a nice tie-in to
bring that full circle.

00:12:50.255 --> 00:12:51.880
WALTER APFELBAUM:
Bring the pizza, man.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.697
He brought me to Supino's.

00:12:53.697 --> 00:12:55.030
That was the first thing we had.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.630
We had Supino's.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.880
He's like, you're from Jersey.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.830
And I'm like, yeah.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:01.180
And we went into Supino's.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.710
And I was like, holy crap.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.910
I'm like, OK, this
is Detroit pizza?

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.410
Yep.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.140
I'm down.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.547
Get some good pizza, get
some good beers, I'm down.

00:13:09.547 --> 00:13:10.630
JASON ANDREAS: Absolutely.

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.970
So with Prime +
Proper, you guys have

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.920
stated that kind of
part of your mission

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.290
is to bring back the
classic American steakhouse,

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.920
but to update it
with modern features.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.630
Can you talk a little bit about
how you guys came together,

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.150
where that concept
came from, and really

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.370
what that actually means?

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.370
What can folks expect if they
haven't been to Prime + Proper

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:32.870
yet?

00:13:35.087 --> 00:13:36.670
RYAN PRENTISS: Like
Walter can kind of

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.150
speak about, like
Keynes, Peter Lugars--

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:44.680
these are meccas of
kind of steakhouses.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:49.180
And there's not a lot of places
like that that still exist

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.980
or that are continuing
to kind of open.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:01.670
Jeremy and I had met a
bunch of times with Walter.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.920
We had the concept in line.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.836
And we kind of convinced
him to come on board.

00:14:04.836 --> 00:14:09.190
And as we got the ball
rolling for the whole concept,

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:14.170
it just became more
and more extravagant.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.120
Like Walter said, trying to
become kind of an institution.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.970
There's a lot of
places that open up.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.490
A lot of great restaurants
downtown that maybe open.

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:28.780
And their concept is a little
more trendy, a little more

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.510
kind of of-the-minute.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.010
We kind of went the
other direction.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:38.320
Let's take creamed spinach
or something like that,

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.840
or let's take a
classic steakhouse dish

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.750
and make it up to
date, and make it

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.730
on par with those
kind of restaurants,

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:51.840
and really put our thought into
it as chefs and as butchers,

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:57.312
and bring it into 2018
and so on from there.

00:14:57.312 --> 00:14:58.270
WALTER APFELBAUM: Yeah.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.476
JASON ANDREAS: And you
guys mentioned you're not

00:15:00.476 --> 00:15:01.600
in the restaurant business.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.020
You're in the
experience business.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:07.600
So you take this concept of
a more classic steakhouse.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.930
What's the experience you guys
are going for then within kind

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.480
of the bookend of
a Peter Lugars,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.350
or a Keynes, or
something like that.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:18.820
RYAN PRENTISS: So kind of like
Walt was saying about tailoring

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.537
the experience to each person,
you go to talk to the butcher

00:15:21.537 --> 00:15:23.620
and you say that you like
a certain type of steak,

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.590
but maybe as the
butcher talks to you

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.840
and finds out different
things about what you actually

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:32.665
enjoy to eat, he might point
you in a different direction.

00:15:32.665 --> 00:15:34.540
When we say we're in
the experience business,

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.990
we're not in it to make just
great food, or great drinks,

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.860
or have great service.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.850
It's all those sort
of and then some--

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.980
trying to bring it all together.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.050
And you don't necessarily
think of, well,

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.029
I had a great meal
at Prime + Proper.

00:15:49.029 --> 00:15:50.320
WALTER APFELBAUM: Great memory.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.660
RYAN PRENTISS: Yeah,
I had a great memory.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.260
WALTER APFELBAUM: It's something
that we want you to remember.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.570
It's not like going into
a place and going, yeah,

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:56.900
I'm going to have the fillet.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.640
It's like, oh, OK.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.280
Well, a fillet.

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.940
Really?

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:03.110
It's like, well,
come talk to me.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.520
And it's about trying
to educate people

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.670
without letting them know
that you're educating them.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.860
You don't want to make
people feel uncomfortable.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.800
I'm trying to educate you.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.350
But I'm also trying
to figure you out.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.490
I'm trying to read you
to see where you're at.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.930
Because so many people
are like, fillet.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.050
I'm comfortable.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.600
And it's like, OK,
great, a fillet.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.900
But let me see what else.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.590
Talk to me.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:31.526
How do you like
your steaks cooked?

00:16:31.526 --> 00:16:32.900
What flavors are
you looking for?

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.712
What textures are
you looking for?

00:16:34.712 --> 00:16:36.670
Because I'm not just
about to sell you a steak.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:38.836
I want to make sure I'm
selling you that experience,

00:16:38.836 --> 00:16:40.030
I'm selling you a memory.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.610
And I want to make sure
that it's everything.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:42.430
It's just not my steak.

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:43.990
It's going to be
what Ryan's making.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.854
It's what's going along with it.

00:16:46.854 --> 00:16:48.520
You're talking about
a fillet, something

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.000
that's dime a dozen compared
to what's in my case.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And you look in my case.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.140
And you're looking at USDA prime
beef that's dry-aged in-house.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.370
It's 1 and 1/2 percent of
the beef in the nation.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:00.670
So do you really
want dime a dozen

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.890
or do you want 1 and 1/2 percent
of the beef in the nation?

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:05.361
So it's an experience.

00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:06.819
And I get people
that want fillets.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:10.560
And if that's what you want,
then that's what you want.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.300
It's hopefully next
time you come in

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.300
that you take my advice.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.312
And it's like, have
that New York strip.

00:17:16.312 --> 00:17:17.770
And the next time
you come in, have

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.980
the bone in your New York strip,
and just work your way up.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.579
I don't expect someone to go
from well-done to rare in one

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:25.150
sitting.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.560
I want baby steps.

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.072
I want to create
a family with you.

00:17:31.072 --> 00:17:32.530
I want you to be
part of my family.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.100
And I want you to understand.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.180
I want you to believe in me.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.494
I want you to believe in the
chef, believe in our staff.

00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:42.410
We're going to make sure
that we're giving you

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.937
the best of the best.

00:17:45.937 --> 00:17:47.770
JASON ANDREAS: You led
me perfectly, Walter.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.942
Because I have a question
about some of the values

00:17:50.942 --> 00:17:52.150
that your restaurant runs on.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.050
And I think it's
really interesting,

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.060
because we're sitting in
a company like Google.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.490
We have some friends
here from Olympia.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.370
Again, this concept of,
you are a restaurant,

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:02.410
but you're more about
experiences and memories,

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.600
and also you talk a lot about
customer experiences as well.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.046
So on your website, you've
got five prime values.

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:10.420
And I'm going to read them
out just so everyone has them.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:13.900
So consistently care about
the smallest details,

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.920
love all people with enlightened
hospitality, own it with pride,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.930
willingness to learn
and teach, and believe

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.460
in everything you say and do.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.918
I think this is
really interesting.

00:18:22.918 --> 00:18:26.140
I've never seen on a
restaurant's web site

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.600
the values that they
kind of command by.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.830
Where did these come from?

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.770
And how do you guys apply
those to kind of this concept

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:34.540
that you've already
talked about?

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.000
WALTER APFELBAUM:
Well, we live it.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.370
When Jeremy sat down--

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.050
we all sat in a room
with the core people

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.330
that we opened up with.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:49.330
Jeremy pretty much took
our personal beliefs

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.854
and just was like, here, boom.

00:18:52.854 --> 00:18:54.020
This is what you believe in.

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:55.103
This is what I believe in.

00:18:55.103 --> 00:18:58.090
And we're going
to make it happen.

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:02.740
When you bring people like
Ryan, and myself, and Liz,

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.110
and Sharon, our pastry chef--

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:12.100
these are all people that
exude enlightened hospitality.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.330
I want to teach you.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.500
I want to learn from you.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.570
I'm always like,
what's going on?

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.190
What can I learn?

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.666
It's amazing what I can
learn and what I can teach.

00:19:22.666 --> 00:19:23.290
I'll sit there.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.272
And I'll just hover
over Ryan where

00:19:26.272 --> 00:19:27.730
I'll piss him off
because I'll just

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.770
be like, hey, we need to get
this, hey, we need to get this.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.334
And I'll bother him for a month.

00:19:31.334 --> 00:19:32.750
Be like, hey, we
need to get this.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:33.160
And then he does.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.150
And he's just like, oh, yeah.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.470
And I'm like, yeah, you see.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:36.740
And then he'll do
the same thing to me.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.352
And I'm like, oh,
yeah, look at that.

00:19:38.352 --> 00:19:39.310
I never even knew that.

00:19:42.628 --> 00:19:44.590
It's something that
we wake up with, man.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.210
We go to sleep with,
we wake up with.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:51.040
And it's who we are as people.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.950
RYAN PRENTISS: That's how we've
built the team that we have.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:58.054
We don't necessarily hire
just solely on experience.

00:19:58.054 --> 00:19:59.720
I mean, yeah, it plays
a big part of it.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.880
But the vast majority
of why we hire people

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.530
is if they fit those values.

00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.210
10 times out of
10, I'd rather take

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.070
somebody that may not
have as much experience,

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.280
but that really has
that drive to learn

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.320
and just wants to come
into the restaurant.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.549
And we've got people that
work in our kitchen that

00:20:19.549 --> 00:20:22.090
have been executive chefs, that
have been sous chefs, chef de

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:23.140
cuisines.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.360
And then we have people that
have worked their way up

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.580
from dishwasher position.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.750
And they're this great mix.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.080
And the reason that they
all work so well together,

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:33.880
and that we're able to
leave the restaurant

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.030
and come and do something like
this, and someone's experience

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.530
is going to be just
as great tonight

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.826
if we were in the building,
because these people all

00:20:41.826 --> 00:20:42.700
collaborate together.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.000
And they're all willing
to learn from each other.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.590
| the executive chef
might learn something

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.032
from somebody that was a steward
at somewhere else-- that maybe

00:20:51.032 --> 00:20:52.990
he's been doing something
one way for 10 years.

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.531
And all of a sudden,
he turns around.

00:20:54.531 --> 00:20:57.520
And the steward is doing
something that completely

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.332
flipped the script
on what he thought

00:20:59.332 --> 00:21:00.540
had to be done a certain way.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.373
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:21:01.373 --> 00:21:03.850
I love that concept
in terms of what

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.370
you mentioned
around hiring around

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.880
fit and culture versus kind
of the old-school methodology,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.340
which has existed
and still exists

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:13.820
a lot more of the
restaurant world.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.278
In the business
world, when we talk

00:21:15.278 --> 00:21:17.800
about a company like Google,
we switched a long time ago,

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.290
where instead of looking
at where somebody graduated

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.120
or what their experience was,
we were looking more about

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.200
whether they were a fit, right?

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.810
And you have folks who come in
from all different backgrounds,

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:28.760
and study different things in
undergrad and graduate school

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.710
that have nothing to do
what we do at Google.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.251
But they're the
right type of person.

00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:35.022
And that makes a huge difference
versus just looking at a resume

00:21:35.022 --> 00:21:37.480
and saying, they've got 20
years experience, but they might

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.270
be a jerk, or they might
be conceited, or cocky,

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.270
or whatever it might be.

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:43.686
WALTER APFELBAUM: When you're
open, and you want to learn,

00:21:43.686 --> 00:21:48.170
and you want to help teach,
and change doesn't scare you,

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.410
I mean, that's what it's about.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:55.300
I mean, if change scared me, I
would have never left Jersey.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.040
I wouldn't be here.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.292
I love change.

00:21:58.292 --> 00:21:59.500
I'm about to be 44-years old.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.050
And I'm just like,
give me something new.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.570
Let's go.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:05.520
I can learn something?

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:05.800
Sure.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.340
Let's go.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.120
I want to do it.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.060
I literally talked to Jeremy
the other day about going back

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.884
to school for meat science.

00:22:11.884 --> 00:22:13.300
He was just like,
are you serious?

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.560
I'm like, yeah, let's go.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.060
I'm down.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:16.886
AUDIENCE: Can I
audit that class?

00:22:16.886 --> 00:22:17.430
WALTER APFELBAUM: What?

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:18.840
AUDIENCE: Can I
audit that class?

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.070
[CHUCKLING]

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.194
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, right.

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.464
WALTER APFELBAUM: It's awesome.

00:22:25.464 --> 00:22:27.130
JASON ANDREAS: In
this kind of ecosystem

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.630
that we've been talking about
for the past 20 minutes or so,

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.577
what's the relationship then
between an executive chef

00:22:32.577 --> 00:22:33.160
and a butcher?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.870
How do you guys work together?

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.050
And let me also throw a side
question in specifically

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.430
for Walter.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:43.630
So in 2017, Ryan was named
one of "People" magazine's

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:44.320
sexiest chef.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:44.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.695
RYAN PRENTISS: You're
going to bring this up?

00:22:46.695 --> 00:22:48.150
This is the worst PR ever.

00:22:49.698 --> 00:22:52.031
JASON ANDREAS: I sent him a
list of questions yesterday.

00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:52.400
And I left that one off.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.320
WALTER APFELBAUM: He told me
not to say anything about that.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.070
And I was like, hmm,
where can I work this in?

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.490
JASON ANDREAS: So I'm
going to sneak that in.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.823
RYAN PRENTISS: I had people
harassing me in the dining--

00:22:58.823 --> 00:23:00.720
because our kitchen
is very open.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.175
There's a meat display case.

00:23:02.175 --> 00:23:02.970
JASON ANDREAS:
Whistling, cat-calling.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.160
RYAN PRENTISS: Oh, yeah.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.020
JASON ANDREAS: I
want to know, did you

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.410
notice a difference in him after
that article came out as well?

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.660
The dynamic between you
two, and then did it change?

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:12.340
WALTER APFELBAUM: He
stands a lot taller.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.640
He stands a lot taller.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.169
He's like, you see me?

00:23:16.169 --> 00:23:17.210
You know who I am, right?

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.500
[LAUGHS]

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.145
RYAN PRENTISS: You
screwed me all up.

00:23:24.145 --> 00:23:24.810
You're asking me questions.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.490
And I was just like--

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.820
WALTER APFELBAUM: Yeah,
we're totally off track now.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.140
RYAN PRENTISS: --all right,
yeah, no, I got this one.

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:28.223
We got a great answer now.

00:23:28.223 --> 00:23:32.450
JASON ANDREAS: So the dynamic
between a butcher and a chef,

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.072
kind of the concept of Prime
+ Proper, and also the culture

00:23:35.072 --> 00:23:36.530
that you guys talked
about as well?

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.940
Sorry to throw things off there.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.260
I had to throw that in there.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:39.900
RYAN PRENTISS: I'm
going home now.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.400
I'm done.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.790
[CHUCKLING]

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:42.650
No.

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:48.040
It's the same as any other of
the aspects of our kitchen.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.760
I'm very much not the person--

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.480
I've worked for chefs that,
this is how I want it done.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.600
This is my kitchen.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.730
This is my so and so.

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.500
This is my dish or whatever.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.040
None of that applies
where we are.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.990
It's a collaborative
effort between chefs

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:07.250
to make a great
experience for our guests.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.471
Walter and I just happen to have
experiences that align fairly

00:24:10.471 --> 00:24:10.970
well.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:15.230
And it's a constant
kind of back and forth.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:20.360
We are gearing up to actually
start running this week,

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.780
starting Wednesday,
this really cool--

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.150
imagine a porterhouse
or a T bone steak.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.335
So it's got the
filet on one side.

00:24:28.335 --> 00:24:29.960
But then instead of
having the New York

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:31.460
strip on the other
side, we actually

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.780
have a 1-pound lobster tail
that we butter poach, and then

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.400
slice, and then laid it out.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.482
So it looks like the section
of the New York strip.

00:24:41.482 --> 00:24:43.190
This is one of those
things that Walter's

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.900
kind of been like bugging
me about, and bugging me

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.750
about, and bugging me about.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.416
And finally, he just
called our fish guy

00:24:47.416 --> 00:24:49.670
and was like, give me one
of these lobster tails.

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:50.540
And he put it up.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.310
And we're like,
all right, great.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.904
And then one of our
sous chefs looked at it.

00:24:54.904 --> 00:24:57.320
He's been working on this
really cool caviar beurre blanc.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.029
And he said, hey, why
don't we put this--

00:24:59.029 --> 00:25:01.069
because this caviar beurre
blanc has a little bit

00:25:01.069 --> 00:25:02.120
of lobster in the base.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.310
Let's put some here.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.400
Everybody just kind
of builds on top.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.610
Walter and myself-- yeah, we're
the final call on everything.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:16.430
But everybody in the
restaurant kind of has a voice.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.920
Whether it's our prep
team, service staff,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.490
back-of-house
management, we all kind

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.380
of just bounce ideas off
of each other constantly.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.790
And a lot of them start
with jokes, oddly enough.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.250
I like to think about
food as, it's all good.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:40.220
There's no like, oh, well,
this isn't the right fit

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.950
at Prime + Proper, we can't use
that here, that's out the door.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.800
I didn't grew up eating the
type of food that we serve.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.350
So I have this weird
background of just eating

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:53.060
normal, blue-collar
kind of stuff.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.961
So I always try and sneak
those kind of things in.

00:25:56.961 --> 00:25:58.460
Perfect example--
our Mac and cheese

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.362
is made with evaporated milk
and velveeta as the base.

00:26:02.362 --> 00:26:04.820
And then we fold all these
other great ingredients into it,

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.970
and use a really
great pasta, and then

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.230
level it up kind of that way.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:13.520
But like I said, a lot of
things will start off as a joke.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.640
But then all of a sudden, Walker
shows up with a 1-pound lobster

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.175
tail and we're pouring caviar
beurre blanc on top of it.

00:26:20.175 --> 00:26:21.800
WALTER APFELBAUM:
And it looks so good.

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.160
RYAN PRENTISS: It does.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:22.910
It looks really cool.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:23.330
Yeah.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.455
WALTER APFELBAUM: If you
go on to our social media,

00:26:25.455 --> 00:26:27.600
you'll see the picture of it.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.520
Oh, man, it's awesome.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.791
And it's so good too.

00:26:29.791 --> 00:26:31.040
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.414
Walter, can you
talk a little bit

00:26:32.414 --> 00:26:36.520
about going back to kind
of the meat side of things.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.270
Talk about the process
of sourcing, right?

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:40.280
You talked about where
some of your inspiration

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.120
comes from growing up around
butchers, and cheese mongers,

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.080
and things like that.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.100
What is your process
here now in Detroit?

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.950
You take a lot of pride in the
type of meat that you bring in.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.350
From start to finish, what
does that look like for you,

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.210
from sourcing to bringing in?

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.180
WALTER APFELBAUM: Sourcing
is so important, especially

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.330
when you're talking about
fine dining and what I do.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.490
And it's all about
relationships.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.650
And I've had the
same relationship

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:09.590
with the gentleman I
buy beef from now--

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:12.440
we've known each
other 20-plus years.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.690
And I've been buying from
him probably the same amount

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:15.470
of time.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.240
And he's one of the largest beef
buyers there is in the nation.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.820
So when you have that much
pull in the beef business,

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:27.580
you get first pick
of everything.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:33.670
And it's so important that I'm
getting the same quality 52

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.660
weeks of the year.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.770
It's so important.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.320
Consistency for me is key.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.230
It's key for what
we're building here.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.250
You want consistency.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:45.880
You want something that's going
to last 30 years, 40 years, 50

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.630
years--

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:49.360
something that's
not going to change.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.185
You may only come eat
with us once a year.

00:27:51.185 --> 00:27:53.560
But that once a year, that
steak is going to be the same.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.290
And meat is also seasonal.

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.680
Right now is the best time to
buy beef because it's marbled.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.600
So summertime is
the hardest time

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.070
for my guy to buy beef for me.

00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:09.340
Him and his guy source all
throughout the Midwest.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.031
And they're dealing
with the best

00:28:11.031 --> 00:28:12.280
ranchers you're going to find.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:16.520
These guys are meat scientists.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.853
And you go out and you see them.

00:28:17.853 --> 00:28:19.900
And they look like cowboys.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:22.420
But these guys know
more about everything.

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.370
They know about the
genetics of the animal.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:27.340
They want to make sure
that those genetics are

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.990
the right genetics.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.642
My guy also knows that
I'm not buying angus.

00:28:31.642 --> 00:28:33.100
So it's a little
bit more difficult

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.472
when I'm not buying angus.

00:28:34.472 --> 00:28:35.680
He's looking for [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.880
He's looking for guys that
care more about those animals

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:40.750
than anything.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:44.320
So regardless if he's buying
it from Idaho, or Colorado,

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.150
or where he's
buying it from, he's

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:48.614
buying it from the right people.

00:28:48.614 --> 00:28:50.530
He's buying it from those
guys that are going,

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.730
listen, I know my
genetics, I know my feed,

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.310
I know the pastures that these
animals are being raised in,

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.320
I know everything about them.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.050
And that's so important
to me because I

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.080
need to make sure that
when you come to eat,

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.777
you're going to be
getting the best.

00:29:07.777 --> 00:29:09.610
Granted, it may not be
coming from Michigan.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.440
But maybe none of
the guys around here

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.550
are going to be able to
supply me with what I need.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:17.140
what the public needs.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.685
Because it's not really
so much about me or Ryan.

00:29:19.685 --> 00:29:20.560
It's about the brand.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.540
And we need to make sure
that that brand gets

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.730
the best possible
product that you're going

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:27.070
to find anywhere in the nation.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:30.550
And I'd rather be the guy that
gets that than someone else.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.920
I'd rather have you guys
here in Detroit be like, man,

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.490
we're getting the best
beef in the nation.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:39.460
It's all grass-fed,
pasture-raised.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.130
And there's a huge misconception
when people are like, oh,

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.286
but it's corn fed
or corn-finished.

00:29:45.286 --> 00:29:46.910
And I'm like, yeah,
it's corn-finished.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.996
But it's not what
you think it is.

00:29:48.996 --> 00:29:50.620
A lot of people have
this misconception

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.007
that these guys are just
walking with big bags of corn,

00:29:53.007 --> 00:29:55.090
and dumping them in the
troughs, and these animals

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.256
are eating big bags of corn.

00:29:56.256 --> 00:29:57.790
It's not.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.320
If you actually look at the
feed from every single feedlot,

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.470
there's more grass
in there than corn.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.970
As a matter of fact,
on my Instagram page--

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.410
or was that a year--

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.395
RYAN PRENTISS: It was
well over a year ago.

00:30:09.395 --> 00:30:09.760
Yeah.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.468
WALTER APFELBAUM:
About a year and a half

00:30:11.468 --> 00:30:14.110
ago maybe, we went to the
Tiffany Cattle Company

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.400
in Kansas.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.110
And it was great
because I was there

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.560
to actually take pictures
and see their feed operation.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.410
And you actually look at the
feed that these animals are on.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:25.360
And it's mostly grasses.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.816
It's going to be
grasses, barley.

00:30:26.816 --> 00:30:27.940
There's going to be grains.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.860
There's going to be
some corn in there.

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.410
But there's mainly grasses.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:34.330
So everybody is like,
oh, corn-fed is bad.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:35.260
No, it's not.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:36.380
Corn-fed is great.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.284
There is nothing wrong
with corn-fed beef.

00:30:39.284 --> 00:30:41.450
I get people telling me all
the time-- they're like,

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:42.430
oh, I only eat grass-fed beef.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.471
And I'm like, well, that's
great because all beef

00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:46.391
in the entire
world is grass-fed.

00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:47.890
It's like, what is
it finished then?

00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:50.690
People are like, I don't know,
what are you talking about.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:54.370
And it's like, if you've
ever had grass-finished beef,

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.700
it's very earthy.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:01.430
It's something else.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.430
So most of the time when
people are eating beef,

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.855
it's going to be
grain-finished beef.

00:31:05.855 --> 00:31:07.480
And grain-finished
beef is where you're

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.229
going to get that
sweet, beautiful flavor.

00:31:09.229 --> 00:31:12.520
You're going to get that
beautiful intramuscular fat.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.634
And the textures, the
flavors is everything.

00:31:14.634 --> 00:31:17.050
And once again, this is going
to be ranchers that actually

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:18.940
care about these animals.

00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:21.160
The more you care
about these animals,

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:23.920
the more it's going to be
worth to them in the end.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.350
So they don't want sick animals.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:28.090
They want super healthy animals.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:30.397
They want them to eat
the best food possible.

00:31:30.397 --> 00:31:32.230
Because the more yield
that they can get off

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:35.380
of these animals, the more
money they're worth to them.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.910
So hopefully that--

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.010
JASON ANDREAS: Walter's
got 66,000 Instagram

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.740
followers in case anyone's
interested in joining in.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.390
I suggest the follow.

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:44.920
You talk about
consistency, right,

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.344
with the type of
beef that you source.

00:31:47.344 --> 00:31:48.760
Could you talk a
little bit more--

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.240
and you delved into
it just a little bit--

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.100
this concept of
sustainability as well?

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.740
Because that's an important
topic when it comes to any food

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.190
sourcing, but meat in
particular right now.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:02.260
What are your thoughts
on kind of sustainability

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.670
and how that plays into what
you're looking at as well?

00:32:07.362 --> 00:32:09.070
WALTER APFELBAUM: It's
a little bit tough

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.950
because everybody's like oh,
well, you should buy local.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:12.890
And I agree.

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:15.640
I love the concept of local.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.420
But to be brutally
honest, you're

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.265
not going to find what we
need in just one or two farms.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.240
It's difficult to
answer this question.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.550
Because it has to come
from all over the Midwest.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.960
It's not coming from one farm.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.657
It's not coming from two farms.

00:32:37.657 --> 00:32:38.990
It's coming from multiple farms.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:42.140
Because maybe this
rancher only has 200 head.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:42.780
But guess what?

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.660
Out of that 200 head,
only one of them

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.940
is going to be up
to my standards.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.124
So it's going to be--

00:32:49.124 --> 00:32:52.330
man, that's tough.

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:55.940
RYAN PRENTISS: I think more
along the lines of the way

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:02.120
that we source beef
is we find the best

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.170
of the best of the best.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:09.080
And I think that as farms
transition, like Walter

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.060
was saying, they
want these cattle

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.552
to be as healthy as possible.

00:33:12.552 --> 00:33:14.510
They're not feeding them
a bunch of antibiotics

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.614
and all this crazy stuff just
because, oh, we'll raise it

00:33:17.614 --> 00:33:18.530
and then slaughter it.

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.738
They want them to be healthy.

00:33:19.738 --> 00:33:23.540
They want them to grow at a
healthy rate for that animal.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.960
And it's sustainable to--

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:30.030
as these farms become
more sustainable

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:35.130
and as the meat industry kind of
transitions in that direction,

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.820
the level of quality
may change a bit.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.780
Like he's saying, out of a farm
that has 200 head of cattle,

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.960
only one of them might
be up to our standards.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:50.570
So the level of quality
may drop a little bit

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.320
as things become
more sustainable,

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:56.844
but that's just the
nature of the beast.

00:33:56.844 --> 00:33:58.760
JASON ANDREAS: Walter,
you talked a little bit

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.530
about grass-fed versus corn-fed,
some of the misperceptions

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:04.130
there.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.960
What are some other
misperceptions

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.330
or common misperceptions
that you hear about the meat

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.427
industry as well today?

00:34:10.427 --> 00:34:11.510
WALTER APFELBAUM: Oh, man.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:15.409
I hear people like, oh, you
buy from a large packing house.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:18.199
It's like, oh, well, I only
buy from this small guy,

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:21.219
that they take the animal back
and you don't see what happens.

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:24.030
And it's like, OK, that's great.

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:28.550
In the meantime, you look at
IBP, one of the largest packing

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:30.469
houses there is.

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.110
They care so much.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.370
What's her name?

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.544
Temple-- oh, shit.

00:34:37.544 --> 00:34:38.210
What's her name?

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:39.840
Temple something.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.940
Can never remember her name.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:46.860
She's huge into the way
animals are harvested.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.850
And if you look at these
huge packing plants like IBP,

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:53.969
these animals are brought
into the finishing pens.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:58.240
And they're only
filled about 70% full.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.420
They have these misters
on so there's cold water

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.020
so it keeps the animal
super calm and relaxed.

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.010
There's no stun guns.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.520
There's no tasers.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.430
These guys walk around
with Hefty black garbage

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:14.610
bags full of air on long rods.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.560
And they just move them just
to get the animals moving.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.250
So when it's time for
them to be knocked--

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:23.250
and knocking is when the
piston is driven into the brain

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.530
to sever everything--

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.580
they're actually brought
into single file.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:28.830
And the walls are really high.

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.050
And so they don't see people.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:34.620
And they're brought
in individually.

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.690
They can't see what's
going on in front of them.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:37.981
And it's a whole comfort thing.

00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:39.990
They have no idea
what's going on.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:42.276
And then before you
know it, it's over.

00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:43.650
And you want
something like that.

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:47.010
You want that because the less
stress there is on the animal,

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.840
the better the
meat's going to be.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.566
When you're talking about a
lot of these small-time guys--

00:35:52.566 --> 00:35:53.940
and I know a lot
of the guys too.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.106
They'll get up there on
their tractor with their 22.

00:35:56.106 --> 00:35:58.320
And they're just trying
to wrangle up this animal.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.286
And he's just stressed
out because they

00:36:00.286 --> 00:36:01.410
don't know what's going on.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.690
And then the next thing you
know, there's just a boom

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:04.590
and then the animal is down.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.340
And it's like, well,
you just stressed out

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.950
this entire animal.

00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:12.390
Compared to IBP and those guys
where there's vets on premises.

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.430
They're looking at
every single animal.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.180
The USDA guys are constantly
inspecting every single animal.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.624
They're trying to
utilize everything

00:36:20.624 --> 00:36:22.290
they need to make
sure these animals are

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.720
healthiest that they can be,
the cleanest they can be.

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.150
You bruise an animal when
you harvest the animal,

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:28.530
there's a huge section of loss.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:29.940
And that's loss.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.200
And I hate to say it, but
when it comes down to it,

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.117
it's about money.

00:36:34.117 --> 00:36:35.950
They want to make as
much money as possible.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.670
So the cleaner the animals
are, the healthier the animals

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:43.170
are, the cleaner the
animals are harvested,

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:46.440
you're going to have a
much usable product, which

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.130
is going to be gain for them.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:51.330
So there's a lot of people
like, oh, you buy from IBP?

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.350
And it's like, yeah,
look at the meat.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:56.640
They trust in their company.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.890
They trust in their workers.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.120
They trust in their vets.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:03.770
They hire vets that they
don't even need to hire.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.810
You take a look at small-time
guys, a lot of them

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.440
can't afford to unfortunately.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.550
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.620
I've had plenty of
small-time farms

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.080
that produced great stuff.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:18.390
But the masses that
I need and the masses

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.850
that a lot of other
restaurants need,

00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:23.015
you won't be able to supply us.

00:37:23.015 --> 00:37:24.390
JASON ANDREAS:
Again, I mentioned

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:25.473
I grew up on a dairy farm.

00:37:25.473 --> 00:37:28.860
Talking about animal
comfort, I often

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.220
joke that they live a
pretty darn good life there.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.540
They sleep on these
nice air mattresses.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.286
They have misters year round.

00:37:36.286 --> 00:37:37.410
They've got heating units--

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:38.370
WALTER APFELBAUM: You've got
to keep them comfortable.

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.828
JASON ANDREAS:
--heated mattresses.

00:37:39.828 --> 00:37:41.070
They listen to music.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.385
These cows seem pretty
chill every time I see them.

00:37:43.385 --> 00:37:44.760
And they're pretty
delicious too.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.810
WALTER APFELBAUM: That's
a whole other thing

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.210
too with being grown
up on a dairy farm.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.040
A lot of people are
like-- they'll say,

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.050
oh, how do you feel about veal?

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.610
And I'm like, I love veal.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.620
And they're like, how
could you eat a baby?

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.720
And I'm like, OK, here we go.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.670
I'm like, it's on.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.310
I'm like, you need to
understand dairy farmers

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.980
need to keep their
cows pregnant,

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.780
keep producing milk, not meat.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:08.910
Milk.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:12.090
If they birth a male,
you're not going

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:13.680
to be able to milk a male.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.050
What else are you
going to do with it?

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.250
It's not like it's
a horrible thing.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.699
They just don't have a place
to put a male dairy cow.

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:22.240
I don't know.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.365
What were you guys raising?

00:38:23.365 --> 00:38:24.090
Jerseys?

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:24.350
JASON ANDREAS: Holstein.

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:25.680
WALTER APFELBAUM: Holstein.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.910
And there's not really a
big call for Holstein meat.

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:33.045
So it goes to a great place.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:37.740
It's just a touchy subject.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.090
A lot of people don't
like to talk about it.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:39.820
But veal is amazing.

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.530
I'm also from Jersey.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:41.488
So you grow up on veal.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:44.520
But yeah.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.950
I mean, I'm sure
you probably heard

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.360
a lot about it growing up.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.430
It's like, ooh, we don't
want to talk about this.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.846
JASON ANDREAS:
Well, we talk a lot

00:38:51.846 --> 00:38:53.580
about sustainability
in the milk industry

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:57.510
as well, because there's
a lot of alternatives that

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.710
can be good or some that lack
a lot of the health aspects

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.260
of actual real animal milk.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.760
And so you talk
about sustainability

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.010
when it comes to that as well.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.060
And the other part
of that is as folks

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.640
look towards other
alternatives to dairy

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.177
milk, a lot of
small-to-medium dairy farmers

00:39:15.177 --> 00:39:16.260
are going out of business.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.050
They're used to being--

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:17.730
WALTER APFELBAUM:
Which is a shame.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:18.630
JASON ANDREAS:
--hundreds of thousands

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:20.110
of dairy farmers around America.

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.080
Now they're in the thousands.

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:23.940
And when they all
go out of business--

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.550
if that's what it comes
to with low milk prices--

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.450
then what happens?

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.880
And there's some of the same
concerns within the meat

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.930
industry as well, I know.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:32.880
So this idea of
sustainability I think

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:34.350
is really interesting,
essentially

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:36.869
as it pertains to where
your knowledge lies.

00:39:36.869 --> 00:39:38.410
WALTER APFELBAUM:
It definitely vary.

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:45.130
I mean, also, going back to
feed, all cattle is grass-fed.

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:46.500
All of it.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.820
And right now in
Kansas, they're having

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.650
an issue with lack of rain.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.020
So they're not actually
being able to graze off

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.657
the grass because there aren't
any because of the weather.

00:39:55.657 --> 00:39:56.740
This isn't the first time.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.781
This isn't the last time.

00:39:57.781 --> 00:39:59.800
It's happened over and over.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.810
They depend on a lot of guys.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:03.660
I believe most of
them are in Idaho.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.050
And they grow alfalfa.

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:06.445
And they grow barley.

00:40:06.445 --> 00:40:07.570
They grow a bunch of stuff.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:09.430
And they actually
make pellets that

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.351
are actually sold to all
these farmers, like in Kansas

00:40:12.351 --> 00:40:12.850
right now.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.516
So you look a lot of
the cattle, they're

00:40:14.516 --> 00:40:17.330
eating all these
great natural pellets.

00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:20.140
And a lot of that is actually
going to wind up healthier

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:22.370
than just grazing
off of grasses,

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.190
which is really, really nice.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.000
JASON ANDREAS: Let's pull
things back to Detroit.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.560
We're obviously huge
fans of the city.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.320
Google just recently
moved downtown.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.140
And we're very excited
to be down here.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.520
You guys are a staple now of the
downtown dining and experience

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:40.300
industry.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.690
What do you guys see
over the next one or two

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.310
years for downtown
Detroit and how

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:48.880
you guys will fit into that?

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.970
RYAN PRENTISS: Man.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.470
One of the things-- and I know
it's kind of a thing in every

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:57.340
industry, but sort of
the skilled labor--

00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:01.030
not necessarily having
people that are really here

00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:03.010
that are dedicated
to this industry.

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.040
We're lucky because
we're staffed with people

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:08.452
that this is what they do.

00:41:08.452 --> 00:41:09.910
Nobody that works
at Prime + Proper

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:11.660
is just there because
they get a paycheck.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:15.010
They're there because
they're either a great server

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:17.860
or they're somebody that
wants to work in the kitchen

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.170
and really learn
everything they can.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.250
There's restaurants opening
every 20 minutes pretty

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.170
much downtown.

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:25.671
It's crazy.

00:41:25.671 --> 00:41:27.211
WALTER APFELBAUM:
Yeah, that's crazy.

00:41:27.211 --> 00:41:29.560
RYAN PRENTISS: I mean, it's
kind of interesting for me,

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.500
having been in this
market my entire life

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.832
and my entire career,
seeing how it's changed now.

00:41:36.832 --> 00:41:38.290
You have chefs
coming from Chicago.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.290
You have butchers
coming from Florida.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:41.950
We have--

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.408
WALTER APFELBAUM:
Not from Florida.

00:41:43.408 --> 00:41:44.500
[CHUCKLING]

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.635
JASON ANDREAS: Coming
from Jersey via Florida.

00:41:46.635 --> 00:41:47.885
WALTER APFELBAUM: Via Florida.

00:41:47.885 --> 00:41:50.410
RYAN PRENTISS: Via Jersey via
Florida via New York City.

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.285
JASON ANDREAS: Sorry to
our Florida watchers.

00:41:52.285 --> 00:41:54.530
It's a beautiful state.

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:57.310
WALTER APFELBAUM: My
wife's from Florida.

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:58.507
Too hot.

00:41:58.507 --> 00:42:00.340
RYAN PRENTISS: We have
all these people kind

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.170
of coming into the city.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.830
And just seeing the way that
not just the downtown area

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:09.170
is changing, but the culinary
scene in the city is.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.560
We've had a lot of good
people here for a long time.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.790
And now it's expanding.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:17.030
And the demand is
growing every day.

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.300
And one of the cool
things that I'm

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.356
seeing a rise in
that is supporting

00:42:22.356 --> 00:42:23.980
all of the restaurants
that are opening

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.310
is there's a lot
of great purveyors

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:31.570
that are sort of popping
up from seemingly nowhere.

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:33.670
That's kind of been
one of my gripes

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:36.190
with this market for
my whole careers,

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:39.160
is getting the level of
beef that Walter brings,

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.150
or getting the level of seafood,
or getting all these things

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:44.830
that you can get
in larger markets--

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:47.450
New York, Chicago.

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.422
And finally having people
that are like, hey,

00:42:49.422 --> 00:42:51.130
there's all these
restaurants in Detroit,

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.820
I'm going to open up
my own seafood company.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.190
I'm going to start delivering
truffles door to door.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:00.620
And you can pick and choose
the ones that you want.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.820
WALTER APFELBAUM: It's awesome
to see them coming, by the way.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:02.730
RYAN PRENTISS: Yeah.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:03.180
WALTER APFELBAUM: It's crazy.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.180
They come with a little
cooler full of truffles.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.150
I'm like, ooh.

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:09.850
JASON ANDREAS: Last year, we had
RecoveryPark Farms in as well.

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:12.070
So you've got sourcing of--

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:13.660
you've got some urban
farms and things

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.210
like that in the area that
have been around for a while,

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:18.487
but that are also
sourcing very locally

00:43:18.487 --> 00:43:20.320
as well in terms of
vegetables, and produce,

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:20.710
and things like that.

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:21.370
WALTER APFELBAUM: Oh, yeah.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.270
I mean, we deal with
a good friend of mine,

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:26.080
who I actually met
via Instagram, Eric--

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.024
I wish I knew how to
say his last name.

00:43:28.024 --> 00:43:29.690
RYAN PRENTISS:
[INAUDIBLE] or something.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:32.150
WALTER APFELBAUM: Yeah.

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.070
He's a good dude.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.930
He's actually from here,
moved to California.

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.980
He was in California
for God knows how long.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.960
He worked really close
with Thomas Keller,

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.480
developed poultry for Thomas
Keller in the French Laundry.

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.240
And I didn't know
that he was from here.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.590
And then he sent me a message.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.636
And he's like, holy shit,
Walter, you're in Detroit?

00:43:50.636 --> 00:43:51.760
I'm moving back to Detroit.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.440
And I'm like, what
do you mean "back?"

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.750
And then he's like,
I'm from the area.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:57.850
And the next thing we know,
he's back in the area.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.220
And he's raising--
like I told Ryan.

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.750
I'm like, listen,
this guy's here.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:03.700
And we need to talk to him.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:06.460
And he came in, and
just brought us rabbits

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.570
and brought us chickens.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.010
And now he's raising hogs.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.260
RYAN PRENTISS: Berkshire hogs.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:12.884
WALTER APFELBAUM:
Yeah, Berkshire hogs.

00:44:12.884 --> 00:44:15.880
And he's one of
those ranchers that I

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:19.590
talked about earlier
that really dives

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:22.240
super deep into everything.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.040
He's just not getting
them to raise them.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.260
He's making sure that
we're he's raising

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:28.360
them is going to be right.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.855
It's all about where
they're going to live,

00:44:30.855 --> 00:44:32.230
and what they're
going to forage,

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:34.813
what they're going to eat, what
they're going to drink, what's

00:44:34.813 --> 00:44:35.550
the weather like.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.520
And Eric really goes deep.

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:40.950
So it was great that we've dealt
with him for-- we did a rabbit

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:41.660
dinner with him.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.077
We did our Thanksgiving
chickens with him.

00:44:44.077 --> 00:44:44.910
RYAN PRENTISS: Yeah.

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.900
When we did the James
Beard dinner last August,

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.780
he gave us these really,
really nice [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.206
There was little tiny chickens.

00:44:53.206 --> 00:44:55.330
And we made these really
nice galantines with them.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.760
And the flavor on them was
just absolutely incredible.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.870
But that's kind of like--

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.870
WALTER APFELBAUM: Dealing
with the right people.

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:01.703
RYAN PRENTISS: Yeah.

00:45:01.703 --> 00:45:03.870
The different farms,
and different purveyors,

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.300
and sort of sourcing locally.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:09.660
That local,
sustainable in the same

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.310
conversation as the consistency
is always a tough one,

00:45:12.310 --> 00:45:13.110
especially for us.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:13.710
JASON ANDREAS: It's
a balance, right?

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:14.543
RYAN PRENTISS: Yeah.

00:45:14.543 --> 00:45:17.340
We're talking about
a steakhouse that we

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.890
want to become an institution.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:23.670
While we have sustainability
and sourcing locally

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:26.940
in mind as much as possible,
like he was saying, if somebody

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.720
comes in once a year, we've
got to make sure that that's

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.220
hitting the nail on the head.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.955
WALTER APFELBAUM: And it's
not about a year or two years.

00:45:33.955 --> 00:45:35.610
I'm looking farther--

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:38.940
30 years, 40 years, 50 years.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:43.350
We should be that institution
that 100 years from now,

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.840
when they talk about great
steakhouses, it's like, man,

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.899
we've been talking about
this steakhouse for 90 years.

00:45:48.899 --> 00:45:50.940
And it's like, this is
someplace you need to go--

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:55.170
just like Peter Lugars,
Keynes, the big boys.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:57.450
And it's right where we're at.

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.682
I mean, we're in an amazing
city that's exploding,

00:45:59.682 --> 00:46:00.390
which is awesome.

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:02.842
I couldn't ask to
be in a better city.

00:46:02.842 --> 00:46:04.300
And I've worked
all over the world.

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.470
And this is just awesome.

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:07.720
It's amazing to be part of it.

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.910
And I want to make sure that
what standards Ryan and I set

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.920
now are going to be
the same standards

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.530
there are going to be
40 years down the road,

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:18.270
regardless if you're
buying it local here

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:22.770
or if you have to source
outside of the Michigan area.

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:28.650
While it's not right here
now, it may be right later.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.290
JASON ANDREAS: And we're happy
to have you guys in Detroit.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:33.360
There's been
steakhouses in Detroit.

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.070
But you guys have certainly
taken it to another level,

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:36.570
right?

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.730
And it's so interesting
hearing you guys talk.

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:42.690
You talk about consistency,
sustainability, culture,

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.880
all of these different things.

00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.285
You're not a restaurant
that's looking

00:46:47.285 --> 00:46:49.410
to be around for one or
two years and ride a trend.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:51.230
You guys are here for
a long time, which

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:52.480
I think is really interesting.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.563
And that's what we like
to see in Detroit as well,

00:46:54.563 --> 00:46:57.370
is folks who kind of
plant their feet, kind of

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:59.370
come up with something
interesting and something

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:00.210
a little bit different.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.834
And again, the experiential part
is really interesting as well.

00:47:02.834 --> 00:47:05.130
So we're very stoked to
have you guys around.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:06.570
I'll leave on one question.

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:09.090
I read that the
Golden State Warriors

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.610
swung through and shut
down the restaurant

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.070
about a week and a half ago.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:13.440
RYAN PRENTISS: Yeah.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.240
JASON ANDREAS: If you want to
become an institution, that's

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.210
a good way to do it, is have
visiting professional sports

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.607
teams shut the restaurant down.

00:47:19.607 --> 00:47:20.940
WALTER APFELBAUM: Oh, yeah, man.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.170
JASON ANDREAS: They
lost first of all.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:23.795
The Pistons were able
to pick them off.

00:47:23.795 --> 00:47:26.325
But what was that process
like for you guys?

00:47:26.325 --> 00:47:27.950
Any good stories you
can share with us?

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:31.350
WALTER APFELBAUM: I know
the next day I came in--

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.750
I looked at my
Japanese Miyazaki.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.430
I left, and it was this big.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:37.774
And I come back,
and it's this big.

00:47:37.774 --> 00:47:38.940
And I'm like, what happened?

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.030
And they're like, well, one of
the guys wanted a whole steak.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.930
And I'm like, what?

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.840
I'm like, first of
all, it's gross.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.040
I'm like, that's just so rich.

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:47.742
There's a lot.

00:47:47.742 --> 00:47:49.950
There's a reason why we cut
them into 3 and 6 ounces.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:51.866
And they're like, no,
he wanted a whole steak.

00:47:51.866 --> 00:47:56.040
And I'm like, are you serious,
you just cut a 21-ounce steak

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.840
of Japanese Miyazaki wagyu?

00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.100
I'm like, oh, all right, man.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.360
If that's what they
want to do, then that's

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.140
what they want to do.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:01.910
JASON ANDREAS: They
can afford it, right?

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:02.909
WALTER APFELBAUM: Yeah.

00:48:02.909 --> 00:48:04.950
I mean, that was what I
walked into the next day.

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:07.560
And I just was
like, that's a lot.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.600
I'm good for an
ounce to 2 ounces.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.220
And I'm down.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.400
RYAN PRENTISS: As much as we
talk about being consistent

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.140
and being this great
place, it's also

00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.180
we kind of wanted to
be one of those places

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:21.090
where people could just come,
and just ball out, and just

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.210
go crazy, and put
crab oscar on top

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.930
of whatever, white truffles,
and just go crazy with it.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:30.570
I mean, the last couple
of times Walter's had

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:34.740
some friends of his in, we've
made these insane meat platters

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.940
with burgers, and
dry-aged fillets, and bits

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.440
of rib-eye, and bone marrow,
like braised short ribs

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:41.970
in them.

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:47.040
And here comes this big, giant
copper platter just covered

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.410
in meat.

00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:49.910
WALTER APFELBAUM:
Meat sweat heaven.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:50.220
RYAN PRENTISS: Yeah.

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.750
JASON ANDREAS: If you
ever need a taste-tester,

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:52.860
just give me a shout.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.542
Literally, I could be at your
restaurant in about 10 minutes.

00:48:55.542 --> 00:48:57.250
WALTER APFELBAUM: You
bring bourbon, bro.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:57.930
I got plenty of meat.

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:58.125
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah,
I'll come over.

00:48:58.125 --> 00:48:58.320
Yeah.

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.653
RYAN PRENTISS: We have a lot
more than beef jerky there.

00:49:00.653 --> 00:49:01.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:02.790
JASON ANDREAS: Thank
you guys for coming in.

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:03.510
Super interesting.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:04.380
We wish you the best of luck.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.171
Like I said, we're
excited to have you guys

00:49:06.171 --> 00:49:07.167
in the city of Detroit.

00:49:07.167 --> 00:49:08.500
We love what you guys are doing.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.105
And it's awesome to kind of hear
some the story behind Prime +

00:49:11.105 --> 00:49:11.730
Proper as well.

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:12.330
So thank you, guys.

00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:13.050
Really appreciate it.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:13.336
RYAN PRENTISS: Yeah.

00:49:13.336 --> 00:49:13.480
WALTER APFELBAUM: Thank you.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:13.540
RYAN PRENTISS:
Thanks for having me.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:14.790
WALTER APFELBAUM: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.080
[APPLAUSE]
