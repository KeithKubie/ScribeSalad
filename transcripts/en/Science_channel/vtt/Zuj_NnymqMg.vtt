Adam: WE'RE STRANDED
ON A DESERTED ISLAND

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:07.133
WITH NOTHING
BUT SEVERAL MILES OF DUCT TAPE.

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.300
I'M FEELING PRETTY OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT OUR CHANCES FOR SURVIVAL.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.400
[ DING! ]

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.133
Narrator:
ADAM GRABS SOME DUCT TAPE

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.033
AND SETS OFF TO TRY TO FIND
DRINKABLE WATER.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.701
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.367
CLEARLY, THESE PLANTS
ARE ALL GETTING

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.567
THEIR WATER FROM SOMEWHERE.
I JUST NEED TO FIND IT.

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:24.400
Narrator: BY FOLLOWING
THE LUSHER VEGETATION,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.901
HE HOPES TO INCREASE HIS CHANCES
OF FINDING A WATER SOURCE,

00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:29.934
BUT IT'S STILL
NO WALK IN THE PARK.

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:31.567
I'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND
FOR A WHILE...

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:32.601
[ BREATHING HEAVILY ]

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.067
...AND I STILL HAVEN'T FOUND
ANY WATER.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.667
AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE
IS A CLASSIC CATCH-22.

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.701
[ SIGHS ]
I NEED WATER,

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:40.901
AND I'M BURNING THROUGH
A LOT OF IT

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:42.934
JUST TO TRY AND FIND WATER.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:46.200
IF I DON'T FIND IT SOON,
IT'S GONNA BE BAD.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.934
Narrator: SO, LET'S HOPE
JAMIE CAN DO BETTER.

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:51.234
Jamie: IT'S HOT OUT HERE,
AND I'M THIRSTY.

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:55.100
I GOT WATER EVERYWHERE
BUT NOT A DROP TO DRINK.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.167
EXCEPT I CAN MAKE FRESH WATER
OUT OF THIS SALT WATER

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:03.167
WITH THE SUN'S HELP
AND SOME DUCT TAPE.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:06.634
Narrator:
IT MAY SOUND AS THOUGH JAMIE'S
BEEN IN THE SUN TOO LONG...

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:08.334
Jamie:
IT'S ALREADY GETTING MOIST.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.267
Narrator:
...BUT HIS "FRESH WATER
FROM SALT WATER" IDEA

00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:13.467
IS ROOTED IN REALITY.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:15.334
I FOUND WATER!

00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:19.133
Narrator: HE'S GOING TO BUILD
A DEVICE CALLED A SOLAR STILL,

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:21.767
WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY
MORE COMPLICATED

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:25.567
THAN FINDING SALTY WATER
IN A SANDY HOLE.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:28.901
Jamie: A SOLAR STILL USES
THE SUN'S RAYS AND CONDENSATION

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:31.367
TO COLLECT WATER AND HERE'S HOW.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.334
THE HOLE I'VE DUG IS DEEP ENOUGH
THAT IT'S WET WITH SALT WATER.

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:36.634
AT THE BOTTOM,
I'LL PLACE A COLLECTION CUP

00:01:36.634 --> 00:01:38.200
THAT I'VE MADE FROM DUCT TAPE,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.567
AND ABOVE THE HOLE, I'M GONNA
PUT SOME CLEAR PLASTIC SHEETING.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.300
THE HOT SUN SHINES THROUGH THAT

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.300
AND EVAPORATES THE WATER
FROM THE SAND,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.667
LEAVING THE SALT BEHIND.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:48.367
THE WATER VAPOR THEN CONDENSES

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.734
ON THE COOL INSIDE
OF THE PLASTIC SURFACE

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:54.133
AND DRIPS DOWN INTO THE CUP
AS PURE, DRINKABLE WATER.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.367
THAT'S THE THEORY AT LEAST.

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:56.968
LET'S SEE HOW WELL IT WORKS.

00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:02.133
Narrator:
WELL, HAVING MADE HIS WELL
AND TAPED UP A COLLECTION CUP...

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.701
Jamie: WELL, THERE IT IS.
GUARANTEE IT'S WATERPROOF.

00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.801
Narrator: ...ALL THAT'S MISSING
IS THE CLEAR PLASTIC OVERSHOOT.

00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:11.734
AND FOR THAT, JAMIE
IS BENDING THE DUCT-TAPE RULES.

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:15.601
Jamie: I'M MAKING A DUCT-TAPE
SPIDER WEB AS A FRAMEWORK

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:19.901
WITH WHICH TO HOLD TOGETHER
THIS STUFF -- SHRINK-WRAP.

00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:21.367
NOW, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:23.434
IT'S NOT DUCT TAPE,
SO WHY ARE WE USING IT?

00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:25.501
WELL, IT DID COME
ON THE DUCT-TAPE PALLET.

00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:28.434
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA
USE THIS STUFF FOR,

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:31.334
BUT I BET YOU IT'S
GONNA COME IN REAL HANDY.

00:02:31.334 --> 00:02:33.267
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S SURVIVAL.

00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:35.801
WE'VE GOT TO USE
EVERYTHING AT OUR DISPOSAL.

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:38.334
THE THING IS
THAT ALL THESE LITTLE PIECES

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:40.801
DON'T REALLY HELP US SO MUCH,
BUT ONCE THEY'RE HELD TOGETHER

00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:43.033
INTO ONE BIG SHEET,
WE'RE GOLDEN.

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:44.701
THERE WE GO.

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:46.434
HOPEFULLY, I DIDN'T
USE MORE WATER MAKING IT

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:48.234
THAN IT'LL MAKE FOR ME.

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:49.501
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:50.734
Narrator: THE LAST STEP IS

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:53.467
TO CAREFULLY POSITION THE SHEET
OVER THE HOLE.

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.367
THERE WE GO. THAT'S THE TICKET.

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:59.367

AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY,
THERE ARE ENCOURAGING SIGNS.

00:02:59.367 --> 00:03:01.701
ALL THAT FOG
THAT YOU CAN ALREADY SEE

00:03:01.701 --> 00:03:03.133
FORMING ON THE UNDERSIDE
OF THE PLASTIC

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:04.701
IS WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:07.267
IT'S PICKING UP THE MOISTURE
FROM THE DAMP SAND,

00:03:07.267 --> 00:03:09.267
WHICH IS EVAPORATING,
COLLECTING ON THE PLASTIC,

00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:12.033
AND EVENTUALLY, THOSE WILL FORM
LARGER AND LARGER DROPLETS,

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:14.868
WHICH WILL RUN DOWNHILL
INTO MY COLLECTION CONTAINER.

00:03:14.868 --> 00:03:18.167
NOW WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT.

IT'S THE MOMENT OF TRUTH -- TWO
HOURS COOKING IN THE MIDDAY SUN.

00:03:24.434 --> 00:03:26.834
[ SIGHS ]
WELL, THERE IT IS.

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:31.501

BUT THAT'S LIKE 1/4 OF A CUP.

WITH LESS THAN 5%
OF THEIR DAILY WATERY NEEDS,

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:37.267
IT'S A DISAPPOINTING RESULT.

HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT?

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:42.501

NO SMALL FEAT,

AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
FOR OUR SURVIVAL.

00:03:56.901 --> 00:03:59.501
NOW I SIMPLY
HAVE TO GET IT BACK.
