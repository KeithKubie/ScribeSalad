00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
double whammy light from a supernova
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.630
double whammy light from a supernova
right near the Milky Way galaxy hitting

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640
right near the Milky Way galaxy hitting
 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.170
right near the Milky Way galaxy hitting
there at the same time as neutrinos from

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180
there at the same time as neutrinos from
 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.620

a galaxy at tens of thousands of

a galaxy at tens of thousands of
 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.350
a galaxy at tens of thousands of
light-years from the earth so here's the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360
light-years from the earth so here's the
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.749
light-years from the earth so here's the
rub why should we believe this a certain

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759
rub why should we believe this a certain
 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.920
rub why should we believe this a certain
experiment over a distance of 454 miles

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930
experiment over a distance of 454 miles
 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.749

when over a distance of tens of

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759
when over a distance of tens of
 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.320
when over a distance of tens of
thousands of light-years neutrinos and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330
thousands of light-years neutrinos and
 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.570
thousands of light-years neutrinos and
light beams hit the earth at the same

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580
light beams hit the earth at the same
 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.270

time that's why many physicists believe

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280
time that's why many physicists believe
 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.820
time that's why many physicists believe
that they must have made a systematic

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830
that they must have made a systematic
 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.820
that they must have made a systematic
error someplace and the weak link the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830
error someplace and the weak link the
 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.379
error someplace and the weak link the
weak link in this whole chain of

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389
weak link in this whole chain of
 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.649

reasoning is the GPS system and the GPS

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659
reasoning is the GPS system and the GPS
 

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.559
reasoning is the GPS system and the GPS
system itself is a relativistic system

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569
system itself is a relativistic system
 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.540
system itself is a relativistic system
so in some sense they're using

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550
so in some sense they're using
 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.510
so in some sense they're using
relativity to defeat relativity and I

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520
relativity to defeat relativity and I
 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.990
relativity to defeat relativity and I
