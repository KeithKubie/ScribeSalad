00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.980
&gt;&gt; I'm Stephanie Marcus
from the science, technology

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.940
and business division
here at the library,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.270
and I'm the coordinator along
with Sean Bryant for this series.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.730
Welcome. We're glad
to see so many of you.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.850
That's awesome.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.460 position:56%
There are, yes, there are a few more
seats, and you're welcome to stand

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.920
or sit on the stairs anyway.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.810
Today we are gathered
to stand for Venus,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.290
the forgotten, mysterious planet.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.550
Venus has been overlooked
for far too long.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.190 position:56%
The U.S. sent a probe there in 1962,
and that was the first probe sent

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.930
to Venus, and the Soviets followed
with the first landing in 1970,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.970
and there have been a few things
and some things as recent as 2010,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.220
the Japanese seemed to have gotten
in on it, but nothing in the U.S.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.990
So today's speaker is
hoping to change all that.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.860
We have Dr. Lori Glaze here, and
she's the principal investigator

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.190
for the mission called DAVINCI.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.950
She can tell you what that stands
for, but DAVINCI is very cool.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.770
So Lori has come from
Texas originally.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.540 position:56%
She got her BA and her MS in physics

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.170
at the University of
Texas Arlington.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.850 position:56%
And way back in high school, she met
her husband, who's in the back row

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.340
with the long hair, and he's a rock
musician, which is really awesome

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.300
that he said he would
not sing, I'm your Venus.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.200
So sorry, maybe afterwards.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.760
And Lori went to the UK to get
her Ph.D. and followed the guy

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.240
who was a specialist in
what she was interested in,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.690
which was originally volcanoes
on Earth, and she got her Ph.D.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.770
at Lancaster University
there in the UK.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.510
So without further ado,
we will hear from Lori.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.200
[ Applause ]

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.500
&gt;&gt; This is great.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.240
I'm so excited to see
this many people here

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.420
that have an interest
in hearing about Venus.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.590
You don't know how
excited that makes me.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.780 position:56%
I want to thank Stephanie and the
library for inviting me to come here

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.290
and talk today about Venus
and share with you some

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.860
of the reasons why I find Venus
so interesting and so fascinating.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.630
You know, in recent years,
there's been so much emphasis

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.790
on exploring Mars and
looking for environments

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.890
that could potentially
have head life in the past.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.880
And even more recently, there's
been new emphasis on going

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.500
to the ocean worlds, Europa
and Enceladus and Titan,

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.320
looking for potentially actually
finding life in our Solar System.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.360
But when we're so focused on
Mars and the ocean worlds,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.690 position:56%
we tend to forget about how
important it is to really understand

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:28.750
that full breadth of planetary
evolution that's here right

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.470
in our own neighborhood, right
here in our own Solar System.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.190
Venus is a natural laboratory right
next door to Earth, very close by,

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.670
that provides a great opportunity
for understanding how a planet

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.040
that maybe once was habitable,
shown here on the left,

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.970
back about 4 billion years
ago when we think Venus used

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.720
to be a host, a home
for vast oceans.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.320
How does a planet go from
this environment that was wet

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.880
and comfortable and perhaps
habitable, how does that evolve

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.070
over time into this dry, hot,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.680
inhospitable Venus
that we know today?

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.030
So that's what I'm going to talk
about here today a little bit.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.200
Fascination, man's
fascination with Venus has been

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.750
around for millennia, right?

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.210 position:56%
I mean, the earliest astronomers
were absolutely fascinated by Venus,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.760
by all of the planets,
because they tended to wander

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.350
around the night sky, not
like the stars that seem

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.950
to be relatively fixed and
move in a predictable fashion.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.020
But Venus seemed to wander
around like the others.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.350
And in addition to that, it
was also the brightest object

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.930 position:56%
in the night sky other than the
Moon, which caused some fascination.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.800
And it was unique in the way that
it would jump back and forth.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.470
First it was the evening star,
and then it's the morning star.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.330
And then it's the evening star
and then it's the morning star.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.020
And it does that because
it's inside of Earth's orbit.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.980
And so we can only see it as
we're looking towards the Sun.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.680
So we see it just after
sunset or just before sunrise.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:08.680
In fact, it has a unique kind
of synched up orbit was Earth.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.350
This is an unusual fact that
you can impress your friends

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.660
and colleagues with.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.090
Venus, it actually is almost
exactly linked with a 13-year cycle

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.180
for Venus with an 8-year
cycle from Earth going

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.520
around the Sun, almost
to the second.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.120
So every eight years on Earth,
we see exactly the same pattern

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.690
in where we see Venus
in the night sky.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.510
If you're interested
in seeing Venus,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.710
now is a good time to see Venus.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.130
She's actually visiting us
in the morning sky right now.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.890
In fact, today I believe is
the highest point in the sky.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.730 position:56%
You'll see her right before sunrise.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.670
As we move forward in the next
coming weeks, Venus so going

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.890
to keep rising a lit later
and later in the morning,

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.670
so it gets a little lower in the
sky by the time the Sun comes up.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.180
And then in about December,
Venus is going

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.970 position:56%
to disappear from our vantage point.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.160
Venus is going to go
around behind the Sun.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.520 position:56%
So we won't see it for a few months.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.420 position:56%
And then in about February, Venus is
going to reappear in the evening sky

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.750
and go through this
whole cycle all again.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.600
There's, I think, well,
there's no more places to sit.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.550
I guess it's the floor or nothing.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.850
Sorry about that.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.770
But again, I'm really
excited to see you all here.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.280
A few more fun Venus facts.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.510
Do you want to give up your seat?

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.090
[ Inaudible ]

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.080
Yeah, if there's someone
that needs a seat,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.050
let's make sure we get them one.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.350
A few more fun facts about Venus.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.870
As a starting point, Venus is
almost the same size as Earth.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.080
This is one of the reasons
why we find it so fascinating

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.090
because it starts out, you think,
well, it's about 85% the size

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.390
of Earth, it's about 90% of it's
mass, about 90% of it's gravity,

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.410
but right there is about where the
similarities end and things start

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.310 position:56%
to be a little different from Earth.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.510
Another fun fact, the Venus day
is longer than the Venus year.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.120
What that means is that when Venus
rotates on its axis one time,

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.130
it takes longer for it to
rotate on its axis than it takes

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.710 position:56%
to go all the way around the Sun, to
make that whole trip around the Sun.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:29.700
And because Venus rotates so
slowly, it's almost spherical.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.240
It's different from Earth and Mars,
which rotate, in a relative sense,

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.550
faster than Venus anyway.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:36.850
And they're most oblate.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.670
They're kind of squashed
because they spin so fast

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.520 position:56%
that they spread out at the equator.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.820
Well, Venus doesn't do that.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.030
It's almost exactly spherical.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.150
It also rotates backwards.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.300
It rotates retrograde.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.690
Why? We don't know.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.520
It could be, some people
have suggested

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.750
that maybe Venus rotates backwards,
because maybe it was hit sometime

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.960
in its early history by a giant
asteroid, a giant impacter,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.810
and that caused Venus to slow down

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.770
and perhaps begin rotating
backwards.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.960
But there's also other
hypotheses, other suggestions

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.990
that maybe there's just some
probability of 10 to 20%

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.100
that you're going to
get 1 in 8 or 9 planets

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.890
that rotates the other direction.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.240
So we don't really know the
answer to that question.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.040
It's a pretty important outstanding
question about how planets form

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.560
and how they spin up in
their original state.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.020
Venus also has its axis
pointing straight up and down.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.800
You know how Earth were on a tilt?

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.510
And as we travel around the
Sun, because we're on that tilt,

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.560
that's why we have seasons,
different temperatures

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.190
and different climates in
different parties of the year.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.360
Well, at Venus, that axis, that
spin axis, is straight up and down.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.560
And so there's no seasons on Venus.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.770
In addition to not having
seasons, the atmosphere

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.920
on Venus is incredibly
thick and dense.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.690
So you almost have no
difference between day and night,

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:01.810
as far as what it's like on
the surface of the planet,

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.980
other than the amount of
lighting that's available.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.610
But even that's not much different.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:12.620
The atmosphere on Venus is
about 96 1/2% carbon dioxide,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.310
which has set up what's sometimes
called greenhouse gone wild

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.440
on Venus, okay?

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.970
And what that means
is that that thick,

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:26.010
dense carbon dioxide
atmosphere is driving

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.810
like a pressure cooker
environment down on the surface.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.840
So the surface temperatures are
about 860 degrees Farenheit.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.960
Let that sink in for just a second.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.820
That is hot enough to melt lead.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.410
It pretty much melts
anything except for titanium.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.240
It's incredibly hot.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.960
It also has air pressures,
about 92%,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.210 position:56%
92 times what we feel here on Earth.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.440
So imagine when you're about
half a mile underwater,

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.290
that weight of the column of water
on top of you, that's what it feels

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.030
like on the surface of Venus,
what it would feel like.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.970
At the top of the atmosphere, there
are hurricane force winds blowing

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:10.970
around the planet about 250 miles
per hour, 100 meters per second

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:13.080
at the top of the clouds.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.630
We don't really understand
what drives those winds.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.070
Why do they super rotate?

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.240
Why do they rotate so fast?

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.570
Remember, the planet, the surface

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.610
of the planet is rotating
really slowly.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.120
So those winds are moving
about 60 times faster

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.270
than the planet itself is rotating.

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.390
Why? How do you do that?

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.720
How do you describe,
if you're into physics,

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.990
how do you describe the
momentum transfer that happens

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.150
between the surface and the
atmosphere when they're behaving

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.340
and moving so differently?

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.630
We don't really know the
answer to that question.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.150
Down at the surface, as you
go down near the surface,

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.900
those winds that are
racing at 250 miles per hour

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.270
at the top are almost non-existent.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.190
Maybe two miles an hour, maybe.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.490
We don't really know.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.790
We don't have good data down low.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.090
But we know they're really low.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:59.720
There's not a lot of wind
on the surface at all.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.100
And that surface down there is this
carbon dioxide super critical fluid

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.790
which doesn't really behave like
water or like a liquid or a gas.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.530
But you can imagine things on
the surface, it's more like being

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.830
on the bottom of the ocean.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.860
The air would just move more or
less like a very low moving current

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.460
on the bottom of the ocean.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.780
To add to all of this fun and
excitement at Venus, if being hot

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.890
and high pressure wasn't enough, to
get to the surface, you have to go

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:32.410
through a 15-mile thick
layer of sulfuric acid.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.420
That's always fun.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:39.020
So that sulfuric acid
layer blocks most

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.510
of the sunlight that
arrives at Venus.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.480 position:56%
So Venus is closer to the Sun than
Earth, so it gets a lot of sunlight.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.540
But 90% of that sunlight gets
absorbed as it passes through all

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:51.370
of those clouds and this thick
carbon dioxide atmosphere.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.670
So by the time you get down
to the surface, only about 10%

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.120
of the light gets through.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.000
This has been important when we're
thinking about designing missions

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.700
that will come back later
because you can't use the Sun

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.230
as your power source, right?

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.850
Because there's just not
enough Sun down there.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.150
It's not pitch dark.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.330
It's like being outside on a
really cloudy, overcast day.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.630
You can see.

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.940
I'll show you a picture later from
the Viera [phonetic] spacecrafts

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.140
from the Soviet Union,
that they were able

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.660
to see down on the surface.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.960
But it's pretty low lighting.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.760
So when we start thinking
about Venus, again,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.710
they started out the same.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.240
They're almost the same size.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.580
They formed in the same
part of the Solar System.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.660
Similar masses, presumably similar
composition when they first started

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.070
out in the early Solar System.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.860
And yet somehow Earth
and Venus took very,

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.970
very different paths
in their evolution.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.560
Why? When did that happen?

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.870
Why did it happen?

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.170
These are the big questions.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.890
We don't know the answers to.

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.380
We don't know.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.850
And we need to know.

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.740 position:56%
And the reason I would argue that we
need to understand Venus better is

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.180
because we are now in
this really exciting era

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.380
where we're discovering new planets
around other stars every day.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:12.330
Exoplanets, planets
around other stars.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.100
Just last week, I had to put
the date on here because it's

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.850
over 3,500, but it's
probably more than that today.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.150
It changes every day.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.120
Every time I give this talk,
I have to update my slide

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.050
because it increases by
another 500 or 1,000 planets.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.770
I mean, it's just insane
how fast we're confirming,

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.490
not just think we identify,

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:33.970
but confirming these other
planets around other stars.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.750
And as we're looking at all of
these other planets out there

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:42.810
around these stars, hundreds
of those 3,500 planets,

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.790
hundreds of them are in a
size range that's similar

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.500
to Earth and Venus and Mars.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.380
And that's just the
ones we know about.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:53.850
There's smaller ones we haven't
even been able to detect yet.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.030
But there's hundreds of
them in this size range.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.630
And some of those, dozens of
those, are in a range near enough

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.980
to their star that could
be in a habitable zone,

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.570
that could be habitable by
life as we think we know it.

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:11.770 position:56%
But if we don't know the difference,

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.350
if we can't tell why Earth
evolved the way it did

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:20.130
and Venus evolved the way it
did, how would we ever be able

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.020 position:56%
to tell the difference between Earth

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.240
at any point along its
evolutionary path, what did it look

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.910
like 4 billion years
ago, 3 billion years?

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.030
What's it going to look
like in the future?

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.600
If we can't tell the
difference between that and Venus

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.860
and what it looked like 4
billion years ago and now

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.860
and into the future, how are we
going to decide, as we look at all

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.890 position:56%
of these vast exoplanets, how are we
going to decide where we want to go

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:47.460
and where we really want to look
for another Earth-like planet?

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.930
It's my bet that most of those
planets we're finding are going

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.720
to be more like Venus
than more like the Earth.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.240
So we really need to understand why
Venus turned out the way it did.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.790
So a very brief description
of expiration of Venus,

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:04.520
Stephanie said there has been
some early exploration of Venus,

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.210
she mentioned the early
Mariner, which was great.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:12.090
The Mariner mission that flew by
Venus that was the first mission

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.270
to go by Venus, I didn't
include that here

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.370
because it was pretty minimal as
far as the results we got back.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.980
But we did get an important
result back from Mariner,

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:22.780
which was that we knew
the surface was not going

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.040
to be a lovely place
for humans to inhabit.

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.180
We learned that it was
going to be very, very hot.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.620
Up until that time, there
was a lot of science fiction

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.570
that said it was going
to be very tropical,

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.990
and there were all these
Venusians down there, you know,

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:37.180
having a great day in the shade.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:42.020
But then all of that went
out the window with Mariner.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.960
But Venus really was
a popular destination

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.620 position:56%
for very early exploration in space.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.570
Partly because Venus is right
next door, it's easy to get to,

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.500
only takes a few months,
four or five months

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.560
to get there in a spacecraft.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:16:00.000
So the Soviet Union really
had a lot of success at Venus.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.840
And the main reason they
had a lot of success is

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.210
that they had a brute
force way of doing things.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.050
They would build two spacecraft,
they'll build two landers,

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.660
and they'd throw them at Venus.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.260
And if they didn't work, they'd
learn from that experience

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.430
and they'd throw two more and
then they'd throw two more.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.700
Every time, they'd
launch two and send them

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.570
out there and see what happened.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:20.870
And we learned a lot.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.260
We learned there's
really high pressure,

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.570
we learned it was really hot,
we learned it was corrosive,

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.380
and they learned they had to beef
these things up in order to survive

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.150
and make it to the surface.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:34.190
But between 1961 and 1983,
they sent a whole slew

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:35.490
of these things to Venus.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.130
And about four or five of them
did really well and lasted

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.260 position:56%
for at least an hour on the surface.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.030 position:56%
One of them lasted almost two hours.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.800
And we were able to get some
really basic information

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.980
about what the rocks were
made of in the big planes

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.530
where the landers landed.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:57.750
In 1978, the United States decided
to join the game and try Venus.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:01.750
We first sent this pioneer
mission included two parts.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.150
The first part was an orbiter.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.760
And the orbiter went into orbit
at Venus in 1978 and it lasted

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.990
until 1992, taking
measurements mainly

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.990
of composition in the
upper atmosphere.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.330
Also, along with that mission,
we dropped off four probes

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.910
into the Venus atmosphere.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.310
One was a bigger probe,
the Large Probe,

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.340
and it carried instrumentation
that let us try to measure some

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.100
of the composition as we
descended down through the clouds.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.930
There were also three
smaller probes that went

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.010
down that didn't have the
same kind of instrumentation.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.890
They mainly were getting
after temperature and pressure

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.990
as they went down through the
atmosphere to the surface.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.960
The Large Probe was a good
mission, but it had some issues.

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.230
I'll talk a little bit more
about that in a minute.

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:52.530
In 1985, the Soviet Union
decided to go back to Venus.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.430 position:56%
They partnered with the Europeans
to send another one of their landers

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.820
and a couple of balloons.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.820
The balloons lasted for a couple
of days in the atmosphere,

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.900
floating in the cloud layer, in
that sulfuric acid cloud layer,

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.430
which you can imagine, remember,
sulfuric acid, so it's corrosive,

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:11.310
so it's going to pretty quickly
eat through your balloon material,

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:14.010
plus when the balloon goes around
on the back side, it's kind of hard

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:15.480 position:56%
for it to communicate back to Earth.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.870
So they lost the balloons
after a couple days.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:22.100
But again, some good
information about the cloud layer.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.560
In 1989, the United States
sent the Magellan mission.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.970
This was a great mission, carried
a radar system that was able to see

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:34.340
through the clouds and map
the whole surface of Venus.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.640
It's a great map.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.640
It's the only map we have of Venus,
so we are very glad to have it.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:44.040
But I'll remind you, you know, we
get so spoiled in this modern age,

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.670
we look at the kind of images
we get from Mars with, you know,

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:48.710
resolutions that are,
you know, like this.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.960
You can see individual pebbles
and rocks on the surface.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.600
The Magellan images are the
type of resolution similar to,

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.620
if you go back and look at Viking
images of Mars from the 1970s,

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.410 position:56%
that's what we have for Venus, okay?

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.900
So it's very hard to answer
some of the kinds of questions

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.440
that we now address on Mars

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.430
about actual geologic
processes and geophysics.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.120
It's hard to answer those
questions with these old data.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.420
So they're good.

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.720
We're glad to have them.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.920
But we certainly need
more new data there.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.960
More recently, the
Europeans have been there,

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.740
been to Venus, with Venus Express.

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.940 position:56%
They had a mission that lasted
about eight years, over eight years,

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.510
that mapped and looked at chemistry
and dynamics in the cloud layers

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.260
and in the upper atmosphere.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.760
And then as Stephanie mentioned,

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.870
right now is a Japanese
mission called Akatsuki.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.700
And it was launched in 2010.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.130
It missed orbit the first time.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.570
Finally got into orbit in 2015.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.670
It's a great success
story of perseverance.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.960 position:56%
They used their little tiny thruster
engines in order to get into orbit.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.320
And so they're there.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.350 position:56%
And again, making pictures and
taking data of the upper atmosphere,

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:56.730
looking at cloud dynamics.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.710
But what I want to draw your
attention to here is to think

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:06.750
about the last time the United
States went to Venus was 1990ish.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:11.390
Again, with instrumentation that
was probably 1970s technology.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:12.710
So that's where we are with that

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.830
with the U.S. The last time anyone
went into the atmosphere or down

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:22.250
to the surface of Venus was in
1985, again, with old technology

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.530
and the kinds of questions
that we need to answer.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.500
We just don't have the
data available for Venus.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.800
But what did we learn?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.100
So we learned a lot.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.120
We did get some answers, but we
also got a lot more new questions.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.360
But I'll tell you some of
the things we did learn.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.710
One thing we learned, of
course, is that the surface

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.380
of Venus appears to
be very volcanic.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.860
Most of the surface is covered
in volcanic flows and volcanoes

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.530
and the volcanoes on Venus look
more or less similar to the types

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.830
of things we have on Earth.

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.030
They look like volcanoes that
we understand with lava rocks

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.310
that come out, just
like they do on Earth.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:57.430
But the main difference is,
this is Venus here on the left,

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:02.230
and this is the Magellan
figure showing topography.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.680
So the blues are not water.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.910
They're actually very
low-lying areas.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.330
And the pinks and whites
up here are the high levels

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.600
and the mountains and
things on Venus.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.230
But what we see on Venus is
that there's no evidence at all

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.550
for plate tectonics
like we have on Earth.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:17.850
We have plate tectonics.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.490
Our plates are all moving around,

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.750
subducting under each other,
riding over each other.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.560
And that's where most of our
volcanism happens on Earth,

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.140
is at those plate boundaries.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.790
We don't see those plates on Venus.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.090
We see volcanoes, so they
must be popping up somehow.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:38.150
But what we don't know is why
Venus doesn't have plate tectonics

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:39.450
and Earth does.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.810
They should both be
hot on their interior.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.790
They both need to be
losing heat in some way.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:46.160
This is plate movements and
the volcanism along the plates,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.030
that's how we lose
our heat on Earth.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.350
How is Venus losing its heat?

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.650
It should still be hot.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.360
Is it still volcanically active?

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.640
And we'll come back to
that one in a minute.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.590
What does the surface look like?

00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:04.730
We have pictures from four landing
sites from over 30 years ago.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.380
This is what we have
for the surface.

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.870
This is what we know.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.170
We've got a couple of these.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.880
It looks like dried up old lava.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.220
It looks like a basaltic flow.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.390
If you went out to Hawaii
and walked around lava flows,

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:18.610
they kind of look like that.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.860
So that's what we know of
those four landing sites.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.950
But because of that
thick cloud layer, again,

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:28.230 position:56%
the only way we can see the surface
remotely from orbiter is with radar.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.750
And so that's all we have.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.280
And that radar sometimes can be
a little difficult to interpret

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.060
with our eyes that are
used to seeing things

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.360
at more optical wavelengths.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.720
Radar wavelengths are a
little more complicated.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.240
Other things we've
learned about the surface.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.060
Again, a lot of questions.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:46.030
First, again, about 80%
of the surface appears

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.450
to be covered in these lava flows.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.890
All right, I'm good so far.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.340
There appears to be lava flow.

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:53.040
That makes sense to me.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.480 position:56%
From what the Soviet landers told us
with their chemistry, we can infer,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.910 position:56%
we can guess that most of those lava
flows are something we call basalt,

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.620
which is the most primary
kind of volcanic rock.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.660
It's the kind of volcanic
rock you find in Hawaii.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.960
It's very primitive.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.000
It's the kind of rock you find
at the mid ocean ridges on Earth.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.330
So that's not terribly surprising.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.630
That's good.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:19.930
But we found fewer than a
thousand impact craters on Venus.

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.230
That's not very many.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.000
Look at the surface of Mars
and Mercury and the Moon.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.960
Thousands, hundreds of thousands
of craters of all sizes.

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.740
You go to Venus, there's less

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.350
than a thousand craters
that can be identified.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.740
Yes, it has a dense atmosphere.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.730
Yes, the smaller asteroids
are going to be destroyed.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.030
But what about the big ones?

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.330
Where's the big ones?

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:40.800
There's not even any
big basins like you see

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.970
on Mercury and the Moon and Mars.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.270
They're not there.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:45.570
We haven't seen them.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.870
We don't know.

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:48.170
They all appear fresh.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.470
There's not very many of them.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.290
And so the way this has been
interpreted is number one,

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.690
the surface is pretty young, okay?

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.150
The other thing is
those thousand craters

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:03.080 position:56%
that have been studied statistically
appear to be randomly distributed

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.820
on the whole surface of
the planet, which tells us

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:09.000
that the whole surface is
more or less the same age.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.590
That's a little weird.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.430 position:56%
I'm not sure how you do that either.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.250
So the question is, or what
the assumption has been,

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.500
that this surface is about
500 million years old,

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.550
plus or minus several
hundred million years old,

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.810
but still relatively young.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.070
And it's all about the same age.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.440
So one thing that's been
proposed is well, maybe you need

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:34.230
to constantly be resurfacing that
surface with volcanoes, right?

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:36.070
With the volcanic lava flows.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.660
And you can do that either
through constant volcanism,

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.250
which means the surface
was very, very young

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:44.210
or just turned off
500 million years ago.

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:48.360
Or you can do it through periodic
overturning events perhaps, right?

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.450
The interior gets really
hot and you've got this lid,

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.600
this stagnant lid trapping
all of that heat,

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.270 position:56%
and then maybe every 500 million or
a billion years, that heat builds up

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.540
and it just turns over and
you get this rapid resurfacing

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:02.840
of the surface.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.410 position:56%
But we don't really have enough
information to answer that question.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.390
We also had these unique
geologic features that we see.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:13.190
They're higher than most of
the rest of the topography.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.860
They're higher than
the basaltic plains.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.450
And we call them tessera.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:23.830 position:56%
Tessera is a Latin word, I believe,
that pretty much describes this kind

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.630
of aparque-like fabric, right,
this crisscrossing tectonic fabric

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.930
that we see in this region.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:34.240
And these tessera, we don't
really have any known analog

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.540
in the Solar System.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.790
We haven't really seen
this anyplace else.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.990
We don't know where and how you
can get these perpendicular faults

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:48.420
that are disrupting and
changing the morphology here.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.980
We don't know how you can do that.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:54.300
We also are even further intrigued

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.410
by these things, these
tessera regions.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.740
Again, they're higher
than everything else.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:03.720
If you look at the stratigraphy,
which is looking at the ages

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.320 position:56%
of things, we can look and we can
see that some of the lava flows look

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.270
like they've lapped up against
the edges, which tells us

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:15.020
that the tessera are older than
the lava flows that surround them.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:20.240
So these units might be older
than the basaltic plains.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.860
They also might have a
slightly different composition.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.030
They might not be basalt.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.610
We see from Venus Express,

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:28.510
I said the only way you
can see the surface is

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:31.160
with radar, and nobody flinched.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.320
Venus Express carried an infrared
camera that had one channel

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.370
at the one micron region
that could see and penetrate

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.750
through the clouds all
the way to the surface.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.370
And so in that channel, they
can measure reflectivity

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:44.670
in the infrared.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.900
And what we see over here, this
is a big region called alpha,

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.390
Alpha Regio, Alpha Tessera.

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.440
And it's a different
color in the reflectivity

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:57.890 position:56%
because it has a higher reflectivity
than the surrounding basaltic rocks.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:03.910
So on Earth, rocks that have higher
reflectivity are usually things

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.990
that have more silica in
them or more evolved rocks.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:11.450
And so those types of rocks
we typically associate

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:15.290
with the volcanoes that erupt
along our plate boundaries.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:20.440
And those volcanoes require water
in order to get those compositions.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.410
So the implication here
is that maybe, number one,

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.670
these tessera could be
older than the plains.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.690 position:56%
They may record or preserve some era

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:35.070
of history before the
current era that we know now.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.010
And they may have involved
water in their formation.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.370
But we don't know the
answer to that.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.320 position:56%
We need to go down there and
measure the chemistry of those rocks

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.010
to really understand what they are.

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:48.990
So now I'm going to step
back off of the surface.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.960
Let's think about, in
general, about Venus's origin

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.860 position:56%
and how it got to where it is today.

00:27:53.860 --> 00:27:58.100
So this is a very simple diagram
of the planets in our Solar System.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.240
We got our Mercuries, Plutos,
Mars and stuff, these are things

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.800
that are basically rocky things
that don't have any atmosphere,

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.170
or very, very little atmosphere.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.600
Then you've got your
Venus and your Earth,

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.980
which are mainly rocky planets

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.360
with substantial atmospheres,
but not huge.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.490
You've got your Neptunes
and your Uranuses.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.790
These are the icy giant.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.270
And then you've got your Jupiter
and Saturn, the big gas giants,

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:22.730 position:56%
that these have solid cores and some
rocky material maybe in the center.

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:26.050
But they're mostly gas.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.080
So Venus and Earth,
I said they're formed

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.600
in the same part of
the Solar System.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.260
What we've assumed is that
they formed from the same types

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.410
of material and kind of
started out in the same way.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.110
But the question is, is
that a good assumption?

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.520
Did they start out
with the same kind

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.510
of genetic make-up
when they started?

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:47.790
Well, the way we measure that
on Earth and Mars and Jupiter

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:50.500
and other planets in our
Solar System is by looking

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.260
at particular gases
that you can find

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.000
in the atmosphere, the noble gases.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.210
And the noble gases are inert.

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:00.190
Or what that means
is that they don't

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.240
like to combine with
any other gases.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.540
They don't want to play nice.

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.190
They don't want to get involved
in any chemical reactions.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:12.020
These are gases like the helium,
neon, argon, krypton and xenon.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.570
So what do we know for Venus?

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.080
I've got a chart over here, and
we've got Mars on the bottom,

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.170
Earth in the middle,
Venus right here.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:22.330
These first two green points are
Venus, the data that we know.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.460
And what we see is
that Venus and Earth

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.250
and Mars all kind of
have the same trend.

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:32.540
They have the same shape in their
abundance of those key gases.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.040
But Earth has more than
Mars, more abundance,

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.630
and Venus has more than Earth.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:38.930
That's okay.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.590
It's just more, but it's more or
less the same type of arrangement.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.600
So with neon and argon,
we say, okay,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.470
we're in pretty good shape
saying that Earth and Venus form

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:50.430
from the same materials, maybe more
of something or another at Venus,

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:52.090
but more or less the same.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.980
But then we get to krypton and
this story starts to fall apart.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:00.880
The neon and argon were measured
pretty well by Pioneer Venus.

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.440
Krypton was also measured by
Pioneer Venus and by Venera,

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.730
one of the Soviet spacecraft.

00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:09.110
And what we have is kind
of hard to see here,

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:12.130
but you can see a giant error
bar there for the green.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.180
And what you can see, those two
measurements, the Pioneer Venus

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:20.930
and the Venera were 15, a factor
of 15 different from each other.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:22.950
So we don't really know
how much krypton is there.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.340
And at one end of this error bar,
we're pretty good with keeping

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.010
with our story that Venus
and Earth are the same.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.950
But at the other end of that
error bar, we've got to start over

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.210
and start rewriting
how you make planets.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.990
We don't know how you do that.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:38.250
How do you end up with
that much less krypton

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:42.860
when you have these other
abundances of neon and argon?

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.160
We don't know.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.460
So we really need a better
measurement of the krypton

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.900
if we want to answer this story.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.850
And then you come out to the xenon,

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.490
and nobody has ever
measured xenon at Venus.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:52.850
It's very difficult to measure.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:56.380
It's present in really, really
small quantities, so it's hard,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.180
hard to get your hands
on what it is.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.870
But these gases are like little
molecular fossils in the atmosphere

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:06.210
that allow us to look back.

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:10.270
If we can measure these, we can
look back and see what Venus was

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.910
like 4 billion years ago.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.990 position:56%
So if we can make these measurements
and get these abundances

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.590
of the krypton and the xenon,
we'll be able to look back and see

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:24.230 position:56%
into the history and understand what
Venus was like when it first formed.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:27.280
Another major question, I think I
alluded to this at the beginning,

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:30.500
is that we think Venus was an
ocean world when it started out.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.160
It used to have vast oceans.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.920
We know that or we think we
know that based on a measurement

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.890
from Pioneer Venus that measured
the deuterium to the hydrogen.

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:43.120
Now, deuterium is just
another word for hydrogen

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.180
that has an extra neutron
in it, okay?

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.810
So it's a little heavier
than the regular hydrogen,

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:51.260
which makes it a little
less easy for the deuterium

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.890
to escape from the atmosphere.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.950
So the hydrogen escapes a little
more easily than the deuterium.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:32:00.470
If we look at both deuterium and
hydrogen and the relative amounts

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:03.490
of them there, we can
see about how much

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.420
of that hydrogen has
escaped over time.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.890
And by understanding
that, we can look back

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.740
and infer how much water must
have been present in the past.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:17.290 position:56%
If we know that number well enough,
we can also start fitting our models

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.740
to understand when that
water disappeared and how

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.720
that water disappeared over
the 4 billion year timeframe.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.020
So we're pretty sure there was
water there 4 billion years ago.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.640
We're pretty sure there
was a lot of it there.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.170
We don't know when it was lost.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.870
Originally, we all assumed it
was probably lost very early

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:35.170
on 4 billion years ago.

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:39.280
But just recently, a paper
came out, maybe a year ago now,

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.820
that said maybe, according to
these they will modeling studies,

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:46.060
there was actually water
present on Venus, liquid water,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.240
on Venus a billion years
ago, one billion years ago.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.320
That's pretty recent
in geologic time.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.040
It would also mean that if
there was really water on Venus

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:59.980 position:56%
until a billion years ago, water
would have been much more persistent

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.270
and long-lived on Venus
than it was on Mars.

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.370
Are we looking in the wrong place?

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:07.920
Just a thought.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.220
Just a thought.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.790
Just saying.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.490
All right, but what
do we need to know?

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.130
How can we better understand
how much water was there

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.440
and what happened to that water?

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.380
Well, the amount of water
that's present there is

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.680
still controversial.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.680
As I said, Pioneer Venus
did make a measurement.

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:27.070
However, Pioneer Venus
was a great mission.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.200
Loved it. It gave us
a great insight.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.930
Made wonderful measurements of
the composition of the atmosphere

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:33.840
as it descended through
the atmosphere.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.280
And then as it was going

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.100
through that wonderful
sulfuric acid cloud layer,

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.750
a sulfuric acid droplet got sucked

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.760
into the mass spectrometer
and clogged the inlet.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.470
So we got a measurement of
that one sulfuric acid droplet,

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.770
which is great.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.920
But we missed out on
a lot of other stuff

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.490
because we didn't get anything
else below that, which is too bad

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:58.660
because there's a lot of
information we need to know.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.040
But even that one measurement on
that one droplet isn't good enough

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.440
to tell us what we need to know.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.170
In part, we have other
measurements from Venus Express

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.990
that took measurements
of the D to H,

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:11.410
the deuterium to hydrogen,
above the clouds.

00:34:11.410 --> 00:34:14.870
And those measurements show
a D to H ratio that's as much

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.290
as three times more than what
we measured on Pioneer Venus.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.890
So now we're throwing our hands up,

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:22.220
I don't really know how much water
was there, I don't really know what

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.790
that D to H ratio is in the
deepest part of the atmosphere.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.560
This is a chart over here that
just says D to H for a bunch

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.170
of different places
in our Solar System.

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:32.800
And the numbers we have for Venus
are basically off the chart.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.700
But we don't really
know where Venus lies.

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.130
And that's a question we
need to answer if we want

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:41.590
to understand its water history.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:44.200
Thinking about the atmosphere,
I mentioned that the clouds

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.030
at the top are moving at 250 miles
per hour, hurricane force winds.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.380
What drives that?

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.810
How does that happen?

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.110
We can watch it.

00:34:54.110 --> 00:34:55.410
We can observe it.

00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:56.710
But we can't model it.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.010
We are not doing a very
good job of modeling it.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.140
We don't really understand
why they move so fast.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.830
And we don't understand how the
Sun interacts with the molecules

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:08.830
that are in the clouds, the types
of chemical reactions that happen

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:10.980
in the cloud layer or
within the atmosphere

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:15.450
and how the Sun plays a role in
that, we don't fully understand.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:18.870
There's also half of the
UV, the ultraviolet light,

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.070
that hits the Venus
atmosphere, that gets absorbed

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.190
in the Venus atmosphere,
that may have something to do

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.820
with this whole story of dynamics.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.920
You can see this image
over here, this dark area,

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.260
this is from Venus Express.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.560
Again, ultraviolet image.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.080
And you can see dark
areas and light areas.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.680
This ultraviolet light
is being absorbed,

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.200
but we don't know what that is.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.730
We don't know what chemical
species is doing that.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.350
If we knew that, it might help
us answer some of these questions

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:46.250
about the chemical processes
going on in Venus's atmosphere.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:48.690
But we don't know.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:51.950
Deeper down in the
atmosphere, we know even less.

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:55.710
We've had Venus Express,
we've had Akatsuki,

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:59.710
we've had Pioneer Venus orbiter
looking at the top of the clouds.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.260
But getting down below the
clouds is really challenging.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.170
It's hard.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.640
And so we don't know a whole lot.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.920
This chart on the left basically
is hard to read, I know.

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.220
It's very tiny.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.250
But this says Venus Express and
Akatsuki, which were orbiters

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:16.290
up high looking at the atmosphere,

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.000
here I've got the little Vega
balloon making its little rounds

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.270
around the planet for two days
looking in the cloud layer.

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:25.160
The Pioneer Venus probes
that were able to probe part

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.460
of the atmosphere, but then sucked

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.440
in an acid droplet
and stopped working.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.350
And then we have landers
down in the surface.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.340
But this little cloudy area
down here that's hard to see,

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.820
this part is really
virtually unexplored.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:41.160
We don't really know what's going
on in that part of the atmosphere.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.490
I've got Earth over here for
scale, and again, hard to see,

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.740
but this is an airplane, okay?

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:49.230
That basically says the
comparison here is this is 75%

00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:53.280
of Venus's atmospheric air
mass below that altitude.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.580
75% of Earth's atmospheric
air mass is below the altitude

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.880
where aircraft fly.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.570
So just imagine if we
didn't know anything

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:04.100
about Earth's atmosphere below
the height where aircraft fly.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.820
That's a pretty big important
part of our atmosphere

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.400
that we don't understand on Venus.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.680
The chart in the middle, these
are all different chemical

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.980
species' name.

00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.340
You don't have to memorize
them or know them.

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.340 position:56%
But this is OCS is carbonyl sulfide.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.840
CO is carbon monoxide.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.140
Most of us are familiar with that.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.440
H2O is water.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.400
SO2 is sulfur dioxide.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.290
What's showing here are the
amounts that we think are present

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.050
in the atmosphere of
Venus down below

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:31.670
about 30 kilometers
above the surface.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:36.020
But all of these little wires on
this diagram are guesses based

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:37.470
on models and assumptions.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.770
We don't know.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:40.240
We're guessing what we
think is down there.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.750
And we're guessing about what
those chemical processes are

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.450
that are going on in
the deep atmosphere.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:46.990
We don't really know.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:51.270
This is another attempt at trying
to understand how we came up with

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.340
that wiring diagram
on the other page.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.260
Again, you do not need
to understand this chart.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.610
This is the Venus sulfur cycle.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:59.790
And one person's idea
of how they think,

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.240
all of the different sulfur
reactions are happening

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.540
in the atmosphere.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.840
It's a very complicated process.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.600
There's lots of these trace gases

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.350
that are only present
in very small amounts.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.510
And we don't really know how
they interact with each other,

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:13.990
and we don't know how they interact
with the rocks on the surface.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:15.880
Are they chemically
weathering the rocks?

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.560
Are they pulling some of the
chemicals out of the minerals

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.330
that are present at the
surface and putting those,

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.260 position:56%
exchanging them with the atmosphere?

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:23.560
We don't know.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.890
We do know there's a lot of
sulfur in Venus's atmosphere.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.680
It drives all of those
big sulfuric acid clouds.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.700
But where does all
that sulfur come from?

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.550
Is there a supply of sulfur today?

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:35.450
Can you supply it just
by weathering the rocks?

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.150
Or do you need some
other active supply

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:40.250
of sulfur into the atmosphere?

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:45.480
We come back to is Venus
volcanically active?

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.020
I said there's all of
these unknown questions

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.930
about how does Venus lose its heat?

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:57.490
Does it still have active
volcanoes that are putting material

00:38:57.490 --> 00:38:59.860
out onto the surface
and into the atmosphere?

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.640
And if it is, could we tell?

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.270
I will tell you we've been
going to Venus now, you saw,

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:09.150
since the early 1970s, and we
have yet to see a smoking gun.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.380
We've got hints, and I'm going to
show you those in just a second,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.220
but we haven't seen anything that
we can say yes, gosh darn it,

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:17.250
Venus is volcanically active,
it's erupting right now today.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.550
We don't know.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:21.370
But again, should be hot inside,
should be losing its heat,

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.470
should be volcanically active.

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:29.980
So let's talk about some of the
evidence, circumstantial evidence

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.900
that we have that maybe
Venus is volcanically active.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.880
This chart over here
starts with a peak here.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.610
This is when Pioneer Venus
orbiter arrived at Venus in 1978.

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:42.910
And it started taking measurements

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:46.150
of sulfur dioxide above
the Venus clouds.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.170
And then you saw a spike, and
then it dropped off exponentially

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:50.700
over the lifetime of Pioneer Venus.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.610
And then we have a big gap
because nobody was at Venus.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:57.110
And then Venus Express showed up
and they saw another big spike

00:39:57.110 --> 00:40:00.370 position:56%
in sulfur dioxide and another decay,
and maybe another little spike,

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:02.930
maybe, and then more decay.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:07.180
So these spikes, what causes
spikes in sulfur dioxide

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.480
at the top of the atmosphere?

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:12.910
I mean, these are at 70
kilometers 43 miles up.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.210
That's pretty darn high.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:17.790
Well, on Earth, what causes
pulses in sulfur dioxide

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.970
at the cloud tops is volcanoes.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.890
Volcanoes emit a lot
of sulfur dioxide.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.730
Notable examples are Pinatubo
shown here on the right.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.030
This is not the big one.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.330
This is not the big eruption.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:29.630
This was the day before
the big eruption.

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.720
The actual big eruption,
they were having a typhoon,

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.960
so there's not very many
good pictures of that.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.260
And people were running away.

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.360
Not in pictures.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.490
But Pinatubo put an enormous
amount of sulfur dioxide

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.150
into the atmosphere, and
that sulfur converted

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.950
into sulfuric acid aerosols,

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.910
and it actually changed the
weather regionally for a period

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.270
of about two or three years, okay?

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:53.350
Cooled off the surface.

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.810
Warmed the stratosphere,
cooled the surface.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.680
So is this happening on Venus?

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.940
Well, on Earth, the largest
plumes, the largest volcanoes,

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:04.540
the plumes that rise in the
atmosphere go to about 20

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.140
to 25 miles in the atmosphere.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.110
And as Stephanie said, this was an
area, this was how I got into Venus

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:11.530
because I love volcanoes.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.830
That's how I started.

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:14.130
That's what I was studying.

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:16.050
And all of a sudden, I saw this
on Venus and I thought, how cool,

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:18.120
are there really active
volcanoes on Venus?

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.090
So I started modeling
volcanic plumes on Venus.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:25.130
And what I found is that
it is extremely difficult

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:30.180
to have a convecting buoyant plume
in Venus's atmosphere because it's

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.660 position:56%
so hot, the atmosphere is so hot and
so dense, it's very hard to do that.

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.560
I'm not saying it's impossible, but
it's very difficult to do on Venus,

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.960
to drive sulfur dioxide all the
way to the top of the clouds.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.510
So where we are left with, okay,
maybe it's volcanoes, maybe,

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:47.580
but there are other hypotheses.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.750
You could actually have just
random periodic overturn events

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:52.050
in the cloud layer.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:55.750
We know that beneath the sulfuric
acid, just below the clouds,

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.240
there is kind of a reservoir
of sulfur dioxide there.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.540
That's where it accumulates.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.330
And so if there were
just a random overturn,

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:03.890
you would get a little pulse
of sulfur coming up to the top.

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.450
You could have even had a meteorite
disturb it and cause that overturn.

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:08.750
So there's other hypotheses.

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:12.000
Volcanism isn't the only
answer, although very tempting

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.500
to want to go that route.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:18.140
Other possible evidence of
active volcanoes on Venus,

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.010
I mentioned that the Venus Express
instrument had an infrared camera

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:24.310
that had one channel that could
see all the way to the surface

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:28.500
and measure the reflectivity
of the surface, the emissivity.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.390
And they've seen some anomalies.

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:37.980
These are some high emissivities,
so low reflectivity over a volcano

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:42.340
in southern Venus hemisphere
that they associate with

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.430
or have interpreted it to be
associated with young volcanics,

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.530
unweathered volcanics, which
doesn't mean yesterday young,

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:50.940
it means thousands of years young.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:55.180
But basically unweathered
material that could be present

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.980
at a currently active volcano.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.560
More recently, there was a study
published where they saw one

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.690
of these emissivity
anomalies not there,

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.210
there it is, now it's not there.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:08.170
Is this a thermal signal

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.300
from an actual active
lava flow on the surface?

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:16.080
Maybe. It is associated with a
volcano, but then a lot of things

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.660
on the surface of Venus are
associated with volcanoes.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.910
And there's a lot of modeling
involved and a lot of things

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:24.540
that have to happen in order to
pull out this little tiny signal.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.840
So there's still a lot of debate.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.950
Is this really, is this
anomaly real or is it not real,

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:31.910
is it just a variability in
the clouds or what is it?

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:34.560
But it's tempting,
it's really tempting

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.100
to say we've seen active volcanism,
but as of yet, we haven't been able

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.900
to say here is a place where there
wasn't a lava flow, you know,

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.090
back when Magellan flew,
and here today is a place

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.110
where there is a new lava
flow that wasn't there before.

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:48.240
Haven't seen it yet.

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:51.340
All right, so I have
hopefully now convinced you

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:56.390 position:56%
that Venus is a fascinating place
with lots of things we need to know,

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:58.810
and that yes, there have been
some good missions to Venus,

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.690
but we're still, we've got so
many questions, and there's still

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:05.430 position:56%
so many things that we need to know,
that need to be measured at Venus.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:09.460
So let me talk a little bit about
NASA's programs and NASA's plans

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.030
and how we would go about, we here
in the U.S., would go about trying

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.670
to get a mission back to Venus,
which is near and dear to my heart.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:17.840
I've been working on this
now for about 10 years trying

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.680
to get some way back to Venus.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.680
NASA has a discovery program.

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.710
This is a program,
it's a competed program

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:29.250
for principal investigator-led
missions,

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:31.570
meaning they're led by a scientist.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.800
These missions are typically
about $500 million in cost.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:40.180
That's a small mission for NASA.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.680 position:56%
Typically, the missions that you
might know of that are in this class

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:46.950
of mission include things
like Dawn that went to,

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:48.870
most recently it's been a series,

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.360
finding some amazing things
there, also went to Vesta.

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.790
The GRAIL Mission, which
mapped out gravity at the Moon.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.720
Messenger, which went to Mercury
and had a great time there.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.460
Mars Pathfinder, the
first rover on Mars.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.690
Kepler, which is now discovering
all of these fantastic exoplanets.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:10.560 position:56%
And InSight, which is yet to launch,
is going to be a Mars mission,

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.970
going to land on the
surface of Mars.

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:17.220
And I think it launches
next year in 2018.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:21.200
So NASA holds a competition
for these every few years,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.940
for this class of mission.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.560
The last round of this
competition took place in 2015.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.940
And in that round of competition,
there were 28 incredible concepts

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.970
that went into NASA for review.

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:36.120
They could be about
anything in the Solar System.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:43.100
And of those 28 concepts, 5 were
down selected for a 9-month study.

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.620
They got a little additional
money, not a lot.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.370
A little bit from NASA to go
back and sharpen their pencils

00:45:47.370 --> 00:45:50.330
and do a little better job of
defining their mission concepts.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:54.080
Of those five, two of
them were to go to Venus.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.810
One was proposed by
my good colleague

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.330
out at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:01.240
And what she was proposing
to do was send a new radar

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.620
to Venus, which is sorely needed.

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:07.330 position:56%
A new radar mission that would remap
the surface in much greater detail

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.800
and provide topography that
would be actually useful

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:13.740
for studying geologic processes.

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:15.690
To complement that,
the mission that I led

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.780
that Stephanie mentioned
was called DAVINCI,

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.040
the Deep Atmosphere
Venus Investigation

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:22.840
of Noble Gases, Chemistry
and Imaging.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.780
I've worked on that,
practiced it many times.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:28.740
So the two missions
were very complementary.

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:32.230
DAVINCI is very focused on trying
to get back into the atmosphere

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:34.740
of Venus and make some
measurements inside the atmosphere,

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:37.640
those composition measurements
that are so sorely needed.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.390
In addition to those
two Venus missions,

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:40.930
there were three asteroid missions

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.550
that got additional
funding for study.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:47.210
And then at the end of the day,
no Venus missions were selected.

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:51.690 position:56%
Two asteroid missions were selected,
one called Lucy, which is going

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.880
to go visit five asteroids that are

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.490
in Jupiter's orbit
called trojan asteroids,

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:59.240
and a mission called Psyche,
which is also very cool.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.850
It's going to go measure a
particular asteroid named Psyche

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.290
that we think is made
all out of iron.

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:10.830
The PI, the principal investigator,
believes that this is an asteroid

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:15.810
that had all of its crust blown
off and left just the core.

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:17.110
So it's the opportunity

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:20.070
to see potentially a planetary
core up close and personal.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:21.630
So both very cool missions.

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:23.840
Not, you know, don't want to
say anything bad about them.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.190
But we still need to
get back to Venus.

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:29.910
So this is just a quick
nutshell idea

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:35.150 position:56%
of what the DAVINCI mission would be
if it gets to be reproposed again.

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.720
It's a probe, looks
something like that.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.990
It's a ball, it's a sphere about
this big, containing a bunch

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:43.850
of instruments that
would focus on measuring

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:47.090
of course those noble gases, making
sure we nailed down the krypton

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:50.550
and the xenon, trying to get
at the atmospheric composition

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:53.190
in that deepest part of the
atmosphere below the clouds,

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:55.700
understanding how the atmosphere
interacts with the rocks

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.850
on the surface and
what kinds of processes

00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.930
and chemical reactions are
going on there in this part

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.950
of the region that's unexplored,

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:07.060
trying again to understand the
interaction with the surface.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.940
And then we would take
pictures, of course.

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.980
Because if you're going to go
down, you've got to take pictures.

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:15.130
And we would go over that unique
terrain, that tessera terrain

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.870
that we don't understand, we don't
know as potential continents,

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:20.150
and try and get some pictures
that our eyeballs can relate to

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.160
and understand what's
going on there.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.050
So that's DAVINCI, not selected
yet, but don't give up hope

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.670
because there's another program
at NASA called New Frontiers.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:35.680
New Frontiers funds missions that
are about twice as much in cost.

00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:39.800
So these are the medium class
missions for planetary at NASA.

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.370
These are about a billion dollars.

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:45.320
This program was established
in 2003.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.550
And so far, there have
been three missions

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.060
in the New Frontier's category.

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.360
You've probably heard of them.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:55.080
New Horizons, which was out
at Pluto in July of 2015.

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.380
Incredible mission.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.000
Took some amazing pictures and
got some great data of Pluto.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.940
It's now heading off to
another Kuiper Belt object.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:06.300
Juno, which now in orbit
on Jupiter, and OSIRIS-REx,

00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.920
which launched last
September, is going to fly

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:10.220
to an asteroid named Bennu.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:13.390
It's going to fly around it,
orbit around the asteroid,

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.100
and better understand the asteroid.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.980
And once it's mapped it out really
good, it's going to dip down,

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.370
take a sample and bring
that sample back to Earth

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:23.930
so that we can study
it for decades to come.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:26.030
So it's a very exciting mission.

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:31.270
NASA likes to try to
compete this category,

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.730
probably about twice every decade.

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:36.940
And so there's a current
competition going on right now.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.480
It just closed at the end of April.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.470
My Intel tells me that
we think there are

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.390
about 13 proposals submitted.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:47.750
That's hearsay.

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:50.210
There's no official accounting yet.

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:52.540
But I think there are
about 13 proposed.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:58.700
And of those, again, my Intel, it's
not confirmed, so off-the-record,

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.710
3 Venus concepts out
of those 13, I believe.

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:04.980
Again, I can't talk
about the other two

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.930
that I don't know anything about.

00:50:06.930 --> 00:50:09.900
But I do know about one called
Vicky, which is actually mine.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:13.680
Again, I'm leading this one as
well as principal investigator.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:16.290
And, of course, since we
didn't win in discovery,

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:20.040
we took our DAVINCI concept
and said, what can we do to add

00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.320
to this concept and
really, you know,

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.430
make it a billion dollar
class mission?

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:29.720
And so what we did was
we took our descent probe

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.990
and we gave it some stabilizers so
that it could land on the surface.

00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:36.430
So in addition to doing all the
things that we were going to do

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:39.570
on DAVINCI which is measure all
of those gases and focus on all

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:41.770
of that science that could
be done why you're descending

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:45.560
through the atmosphere, we
would then land on the surface.

00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.430
Again, landing in one of these
really interesting tessera

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:51.510
environments to see if we
could measure the chemistry

00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:55.250
and the minerals and morphology,
which is just a fancy word

00:50:55.250 --> 00:51:00.640
for trying to understand how
geology has shaped the surface.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:04.440
Look very closely at these
on the surface of Venus.

00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.550
So that's what the Vicky
mission is, it's Venus

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:09.100
and [inaudible] composition
investigation.

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.360
So that one is in competition.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:15.300 position:56%
We should know in between October
and December will be an announcement

00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:18.950
from NASA headquarters indicating
which of those 13 or so missions

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.810
or down selected for
additional study.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:23.600
We've got our fingers
crossed that at least one

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.010
of those three Venus
missions will get selected.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:30.870
You know, I've invested a lot
in mine, and I'm very partial

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:34.110
to my mission, but I'm
also more partial to Venus.

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:37.180
And so what I really want to
see is a mission to Venus.

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.700
All of the scientists that have
proposed the Venus missions

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.000
are excellent.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.370
All the missions are good.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:44.080
We just have to get
one one of these days.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.700
We will. Outside of NASA,
what's thinking about Venus?

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.120
Who wants to go back to Venus?

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.450
Well, Europeans have had this very
successful Venus Express mission.

00:51:54.450 --> 00:51:56.710
And so they're already going
back to the drawing table.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:52:00.390 position:56%
They said, well, with Venus Express,
we focused a lot on the atmosphere

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:03.500
and understanding the chemistry
and dynamics of the atmosphere.

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.800
What's next?

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.370
And so the Europeans are also very
interested in an orbiting mission

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:10.380
with a radar, carrying a radar

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.840
that can do higher resolution
imaging and get topography.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.280
Their mission is called ENVISION,
and that is also currently

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.950
under competition in
their M class category,

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:21.910
which is their medium
class category,

00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.550
which is a little bigger
than our medium class.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:26.940
But it's a good size mission.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.240
But it's under competition.

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.580
We don't know where
that stands right now.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:34.650
And Russia is also
currently thinking

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:39.600
about a potential new mission
to Venus, a new Venera mission.

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:43.930 position:56%
It's called Venera D. And do not ask
me to pronounce the word that begins

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:45.460
with D because I cannot do it.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.110
But it means long lived, which
means hopefully will last longer

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:50.800
than one hour on the surface.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.670
It should last maybe five
hours on the surface.

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:54.970
How exciting.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:57.810
And there's no commitment
from the Russian government

00:52:57.810 --> 00:52:59.110
to fly this mission.

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:04.420
But the Russian Space Agency and
NASA are working together right now

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:08.260
to define what the science is
that this mission would do.

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:11.960 position:56%
So we are working on a joint science
definition team with the Russians

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.290
and trying to map out if
we ever could get support

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:17.360
from all the relevant governments,

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.250
could we fly another
mission led by the Russians?

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.440
This mission that they're thinking
about would include an orbiter,

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.990
a sub orbiter, a lander, and
maybe some aerial platforms,

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:30.760
which aerial platforms could
mean a balloon or an airplane

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.850
or something flying
in the cloud layer.

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:35.150
So it's a pretty aggressive
plan right now.

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:36.910
And at this point,
as I said, no funding

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:39.610
or any dollars really
associated with it.

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:43.790
But the scientific community,
there's no lack of interest

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:45.120
from the scientific community.

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.000
It's trying to get the
agencies and the governments

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.020
to put some money behind
it and make it happen.

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:53.490
So with that, I think I'm going
to wrap this up a little bit.

00:53:53.490 --> 00:53:58.110
The key things I really want you to
walk away with today, number one,

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.290
Venus is very similar to Earth.

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:01.790
It was similar to Earth.

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.050
They started out, we
think, very similar.

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.760
But somewhere along the
way, something happened.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.060
Somewhere they diverged and
they became very different

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:15.050
in their climates and in
their surfaces and in their--

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:17.030
in so many different ways.

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:22.600
We don't understand when or why
that happened, but we need to.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.540
We need to if we want to
understand how these rocky planets

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:29.430
with atmospheres, how they
form, how they evolve over time.

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:32.850
How did that work even in our own
Solar System with our little suite

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.960
of Venus, Earth and Mars?

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.700
We've got three N members there.

00:54:36.700 --> 00:54:38.000
We're missing one.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.300
We know Mars pretty well.

00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.770
We don't know Venus.

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:42.070
We need to do that.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:44.030
If we're going to understand
and interpret the exoplanets

00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:45.330
that we're discovering,

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:49.070
we're missing some important
information on Venus.

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:52.500
Another thing to walk away
with is right now, as of today,

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.970
there are no planned
Venus missions of any kind

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:58.730
by any country right now.

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:00.800
Lots of things in the works, but
there have been lots of things

00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.210
in the works for many, many years.

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:05.870
We did a count the other day
within NASA competed programs.

00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:10.850
Venus is 26 and 0, 26
proposals and 0 wins.

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:17.750
So, you know, new love for
Venus so we can get back there.

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:26.190
So my last pitch to you is that,
for me, what I think we really need

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:30.950 position:56%
to do to get back to Venus is really
get back into Venus's atmosphere.

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:34.740
The missions that have been to
Venus's atmosphere, the Veneras,

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.430
the Pioneer Venus, Large
Probe, they got us started,

00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:41.700
but they really left us with
more questions than answers.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:46.070
We've had, since 1978, I
think I wrote it down here

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:50.320
so I wouldn't forget, six orbital
missions, six orbital missions.

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:54.050
It's time to get back
into Venus's atmosphere,

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.870
make those in situ
measurements right there in place

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:59.650
in the atmosphere and
see what we can learn.

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:03.000
Not just about Venus, but about
all of the other planets out there

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.840
that are waiting to be discovered.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:06.640
So with that, thank you.

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:19.090
[ Applause ]

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:21.360
And I apologize for
going a little long,

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.290
but I will definitely stand here
and answer questions for as long

00:56:24.290 --> 00:56:27.100
as you want to stand
and ask questions.

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.580
&gt;&gt; I think we have two options
with our Venus exploration.

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:35.610
One is somebody start a petition on
change.org, get enough signatures,

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.320
maybe someone will listen.

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.120
The other is private funding.

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.830
All the billionaires
that are going to space.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:44.610
But questions, there may
be lots of questions,

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:45.910
but there are no answers, right?

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.210
&gt;&gt; Well, that's not true.

00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:48.730
That's not no answers.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:50.460
It's interesting you
mentioned the private funding

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:53.600
because there's been a lot of
interest in sending, you know,

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.650
through private funding,
sending people to Mars.

00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:58.940
There's not really-- we can't
really survive at Mars any better

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:04.020
than we can survive at Venus right
now today honestly as humans.

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:07.820 position:56%
And there have actually been some
interesting ideas for sending humans

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:13.580
to Venus just on a swing-by trip,
to swing by Venus and come back,

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:16.070
you know, kind of a geo
tours there, go out there

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:18.050
and experience it and come back.

00:57:18.050 --> 00:57:20.780
But if you want to think
about ways to get humans

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:25.440
out into the interstellar
or InterSolar environment,

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:28.090
the interplanetary environment
for an extending period of time,

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:29.390
you know, it's a possibility.

00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:31.290
We might take some
pictures along the way.

00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:32.740
Just saying.

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.040
Over here, yeah?

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:35.340
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about the dynamics

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:37.290
of the first Russian
probe that landed?

00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.270
You talked about one hour.

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:44.830 position:56%
And I assume they had to go through
some orbiter to send those pictures.

00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:48.830
If they missed that shot through
sulfuric acid atmosphere in storms

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:51.150
and everything, it
probably wouldn't get back

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:52.750
around to being able
to do their shot.

00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:55.080
Can you talk about what
happened and how they did that?

00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.540
&gt;&gt; The question here
is about the dynamics

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:00.610
of those early Soviet
landers and how they were able

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:03.520
to communicate their data back.

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.770
Someone can correct me, but
going off the top of my brain,

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:10.600
my recollection is those were
direct to Earth communication,

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.640
as was the Pioneer
Venus large procedure.

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:14.310
The Pioneer Venus probes
were direct to Earth.

00:58:14.310 --> 00:58:17.020
They did not communicate
through a satellite.

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:19.600
I believe this communicated
directly back to Earth.

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.590
Very low bandwidth.

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:25.150
And you thought your
dial-up modem was slow.

00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:26.930
It was very limited.

00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:29.750
But that's my recollection
off the top of my head.

00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:32.150
That is a very challenging
thing to do.

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:34.720
It is something that through my
mission design efforts we've looked

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:38.780
at a lot at how you can
do that with a spacecraft

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:40.660
and have the communication.

00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:42.000
One thing you can do is go

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.410
on a fly-by trajectory
as opposed to an orbit.

00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:50.150 position:56%
So that gives you an extended period
of communication time as your lander

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:51.980
or your probe falls
to the atmosphere,

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.240
and then you can continue
communicating for that hour

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:56.260
or two or three on the surface.

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.430
&gt;&gt; In the [inaudible] you
said I think five hours is

00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:00.060
where we're at now technology-wise?

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:03.090
&gt;&gt; That's where we're at now
technology-wise, as far as cooling.

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:05.090
I didn't get into a lot of
the mission design stuff.

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:07.570
I'm happy to answer those
kind of questions too.

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:12.340
Most of the thermal control, as
we're talking about the lifetimes

00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.350
of these landers on the surface,

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:16.760
a lifetime of five hours
is probably limited

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:21.530 position:56%
by how cool you can keep your lander
inside at 850 degrees outside.

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:24.520
It's hard to keep it
cool on the inside.

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:29.550
And with power limitations,
you can't continue

00:59:29.550 --> 00:59:31.460
to power a powered cooling system.

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:35.120
So most of the early missions,
or all of the early missions

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:38.570 position:56%
and everything I know of that's been
proposed to land on the surface,

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:41.300
would use a passive
cooling, which is usually

00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:45.300
like a face change material that
would go from a solid to a liquid.

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:49.260
And by doing that, it keeps the
inside of your pressure vessel

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.400
at a constant temperature, much
like ice cubes keep your glass

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.450
of water at the same temperature.

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:57.310
And so but when all of that
face change material is melted,

00:59:57.310 --> 00:59:58.610
it's gone.

00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:02.180
So really the limitation there
for five hours is how much

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:06.300
of that face change material
can you bring with you?

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:07.600
Questions?

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:08.900
I'll go here next.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:10.200
Yeah?

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My daughter-in-law is a planetary
geologist whose Ph.D. projects go

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.140
on the march.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:20.270
She's now living in Luxembourg,
and on our weekend Skype,

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:25.470
she said there's a flood of private
money coming into VSA in Luxembourg

01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:31.050
in particular for asteroid
mining [inaudible] purposes.

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:33.420
So what is the role of government

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:35.670
versus private enterprise
[inaudible]?

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:43.820
&gt;&gt; So the question here is about
private versus public funding

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.260
in things like asteroid
mining or any kind

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.630
of resource or resource mining.

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:53.420
Yeah, well, on something like
my project, like the DAVINCI,

01:00:53.420 --> 01:01:00.660
these are publicly-funded through
NASA without any private funding.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:03.910
Although that's maybe not
totally fair because we do partner

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:06.050
with industry pretty heavily.

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:10.000 position:56%
For example, the DAVINCI mission
was partnering with Lockheed Martin,

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.230
and they would bring some of their
internal resources to bear on that,

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:15.830
but not like a huge
crowdsourced funding.

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:21.320
I can't really speak to other
types of publicly-funded things

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.090
and where you draw
the line between NASA.

01:01:23.090 --> 01:01:27.410
That's kind of out of my, not only
my area of interest in experience,

01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:30.260
but also out of my
authority to speak on.

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.560
So I apologize for that.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.800
I can talk to you maybe a little
more after if you're interested.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.470
There was another question right
here, and then we'll move around.

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:49.290
&gt;&gt; If the cooling is your
issue, I suppose that's

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:53.490
because the electronics maybe
[inaudible] or whatever,

01:01:53.490 --> 01:01:57.540
is it possible to develop
high pressure electronic

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.020
like your ceramics or?

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:03.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; This is a great question about
how do we solve the thermal problem?

01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:08.570
Is it all just cooling, or can
you also develop things that work

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:10.780 position:56%
in the high temperature environment?

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.080
Great question.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.380
Yes, it could work.

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:17.020
We actually-- NASA has a funded
program right now called Hot Tech,

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.580
which is specifically
focused on trying

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:24.220
to develop high temperature
electronics, which is great.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:28.270
We already-- I know of already a
seismometer that's been developed

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:33.320
that could actually function on
the surface of Venus for a month

01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:36.020
under high temperature conditions.

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:41.210
The problem is we've got the
high temperature electronics,

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:44.650
the soldering and the
electronics work,

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:49.710
but we don't have memory systems,
we don't have transmission systems,

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:53.750
we don't have, you know, we
don't have the data storage

01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:57.330
and the communication capacity
to get the data off the surface.

01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:58.920
So there's still a lot
of investment and work

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.220
that needs to be done there.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:01.520
NASA is investing in that.

01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.820
There's others that are
investing in it as well.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:04.120
A lot of universities are
doing research in that area.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.420
And so my guess is that
somewhere along the line,

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.720
the two will meet in the middle.

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.020
We'll have things that can
survive to higher temperatures,

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.320
and we'll find better ways to
encapsulate things to keep them

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.620
in the range of temperatures
where they need to be.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.920
But it's a great question.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:13.220
It's something that
is being worked on.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:14.520
It's not ready to fly
today, but someday.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.820
I think there was another
question over here.

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.620
Yeah?

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:22.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.570
Whew. That's a great question.

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:24.870
I'm not sure I know the answer.

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:27.420
Okay, so the question is how
deep is the Venus atmosphere,

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.730
and how does that compare to Earth?

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:34.070
So the cloud tops on Venus
are at about 70 kilometers,

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:39.810
so quickly in my mind, 40
miles ish, 35, 40 miles.

01:03:39.810 --> 01:03:43.610
It's pretty big compared
to Earth's atmosphere.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.390
It's much bigger than
Earth's atmosphere.

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:51.020 position:56%
And when you-- it's pretty dense
even at higher altitudes than Earth.

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:54.690
It's pretty stable in that
density at the high altitudes.

01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:58.000
Because as they said, it gets
up, the Sun coming in on it

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.810
for hundreds and hundreds of days.

01:03:59.810 --> 01:04:01.160
So it's pretty stable.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:06.260
So then the second part
of the question had to do

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.040
with how far does the
heat radiate out?

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.340
That's a good question.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.310
And honestly, that's something
I'll have to go back and research

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:15.430
because I don't know the
answer off the top of my head.

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:19.810 position:56%
I do know that spacecraft that are
in orbit a couple hundred kilometers

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:22.920
above the surface do have to deal
with that radiation, absolutely,

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.220
that comes off the planet.

01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:25.520
It's pretty bright.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.820
The clouds are really bright.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.890
There's a lot of radiation that
comes back off the cloud tops.

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:31.690 position:56%
But I don't know the answer to that.

01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:33.250
Sorry. Another question?

01:04:33.250 --> 01:04:35.060
Right up here, and
then I'll go back.

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.910
No, go ahead.

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:42.240
&gt;&gt; I just want to know,
do you know already,

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.870
you told us that it
doesn't have any plates.

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:48.170
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:50.450
&gt;&gt; Now, if it doesn't
have any plates,

01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:54.220
how are the volcanoes created?

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:56.640
&gt;&gt; So great question.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.670
So the question is, if
there's no plates on Venus,

01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:02.680
so it doesn't have plate tectonics,
how are the volcanoes created?

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.660
Well, this is a good question.

01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:09.340
On Earth, we do have volcanoes
that are not on plate boundaries.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.640
We have a few, right?

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:12.620
We know Hawaii is a great example

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.840
of a volcano that's not
on a plate boundary.

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.390
It's actually what we
call a hot spot volcano.

01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:20.170
It's fed directly from
Earth's mantle.

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:22.670
Magma comes straight
up through the crust,

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.650
right out onto the sea
floor, and now Hawaii.

01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:29.010
&gt;&gt; But there should
be a hole somewhere.

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:31.550
&gt;&gt; Yes, there is a hole
somewhere, definitely.

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:34.000
And on Venus, there are holes.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.930
And the models that we have

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:41.230
for Venus are what we call these
heat pipe or hot spot volcanoes

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:45.060
where the heat pipes are
delivering the magma and the heat

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:49.690
from the interior, right, from this
mantle layer out to the surface.

01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:53.060
And so then there's a hole in
the volcanoes, the lava comes

01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:56.050
out from the vent at the surface.

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:57.840 position:56%
But again, these are pretty limited.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.370
If you want to look at how you can
get rid of heat from the inside

01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:03.260
of a planet, they're
pretty inefficient

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:07.390
to just lose it during these
individual heat pipes as opposed

01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:08.690
to the kind of plate boundaries

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:12.020
where we just unzip the whole
Atlantic Ocean and lava comes

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.630
out all along the whole thing.

01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:16.930
A question back here?

01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:28.480
&gt;&gt; I found it interesting that
the planet spins a lot more slowly

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.360
than its atmosphere.

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:45.300 position:56%
And I wonder if there's any evidence
of, over time, the slowing of Venus,

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:55.200
maybe because of gravitation,
because maybe all of the gravity is

01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:03.500
at the Sun and we're faster
because we have a lot of gravity

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.350
on the other side, and
whether that has any leverage

01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:11.080
for explaining maybe the newness
of the surface, maybe building

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.780
on the gentleman's question,

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:15.590
if things inside are spinning
either faster or slower over time,

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:19.690
whether sort of the hot
spots can form in that way,

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:22.430
and whether if we can
speed it up again,

01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:28.260
whether we can spin off the
atmosphere and make it happen.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.560
&gt;&gt; Hmm, speed it up.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.900
Well, that might be challenging.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.200
&gt;&gt; A lot of energy.

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.480
&gt;&gt; The question has
to do with, you know,

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:42.350
how fast the atmosphere is
rotating relative to the surface,

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:45.500
and all of the other tentacles
that hang off of that as far

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:51.390
as implications for, you know,
how these volcanoes are forming

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:56.530
and how planets in general feed
volcanism through these kind

01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:59.380
of dynamics that go
on inside the planet.

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:02.690
And the answer to the first
part of your question is

01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:07.910
that over the lifetime of the
missions we've had at Venus,

01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:13.420
decades now with Magellan and
Venus Express and Akatsuki,

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:20.720
there have been a couple
papers, and I'm going to try

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.750
to remember the details, and
I probably can't fish them

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:29.810
out right here on the spot,
but there was a potential

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:36.930
that they saw some change in
the rotation rate over time.

01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:46.080
But then there was another
paper that came out that kind

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.300
of discredited some
of that because some

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.730
of the assumptions
weren't quite right.

01:08:51.730 --> 01:08:55.990
So again, it's kind of
being debated whether

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:59.390
or not its spin rate
is changing over time.

01:08:59.390 --> 01:09:00.930
It's still kind of out
there in the debate,

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:03.520
but it's possible that
it may be changing.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.790
And honestly, I don't remember if
it's speeding up or slowing down.

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:09.360
I'd have to go back and check that.

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.760
But there's a possibility
that it is changing.

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:18.030
Whether or not you could spin
up the planet again and try

01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:22.130
and blow off the atmosphere, there
might be more effective ways to do

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:24.210
that like introducing
things that love

01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:26.130
to eat carbon dioxide
and things like that.

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:31.020
Yeah, there's a lot of different
ideas out there for terra forming

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.440
or trying to make it a
more habitable place.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:36.920
Is there another question
maybe down here?

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.220
Yeah?

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:41.380
&gt;&gt; Do you know anything
about the size of the core

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:43.640
and how it compares to Earth?

01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think, again, I
think from my recollection,

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:48.200
the core of Venus is more or
less the same size as Earth.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.140
So it's not that much
different in size.

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:53.290
What we don't know,
though, is whether

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:54.590
or not it's dynamically active.

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:58.230
So at Earth, we have
what's called a dynamo,

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:02.170
where we know that there's
convection going on, you know,

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:05.620
outside of the core and in that
deepest part of the interior.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:11.650
And that causes the magnetic
field that we have here.

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:13.970
Venus has no magnetic field,
has no magnetic field.

01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:15.470
So this is yet opening another
can of worms that I'll throw

01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:16.770
out there just for
your consideration.

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.200
At Mars, we use the fact that
Mars doesn't have a magnetic field

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.500
to explain why Mars
has no atmosphere,

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.800
that the solar wind has
stripped off Mars's atmosphere,

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.100
because it has no magnetic field.

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.400
Well, what's happening at Venus?

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.700
Venus has no magnetic field, and
it's got more atmosphere than any,

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.000
you know, than Earth
and Mars combined.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.300
So how do you do that?

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:28.600
So the core size I think
is fairly similar to Earth.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.900 position:56%
As I said, the densities, the masses
of the two planets are relatively,

01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.200
you know, on scale
with each other, right?

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.500
Scaled. But there are other
differences between them

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.800
that we don't understand.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.100
Yeah? Let's go right here.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.400
&gt;&gt; So I really liked the talk
and I found it super interesting,

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:37.700
but I'm [inaudible]
background, so I was wondering

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.000 position:56%
if you could recommend any resources
or stuff that we could look

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.300
up to sort of learn
more about this topic.

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:41.600
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.900
There is a great book, actually
written by David Grinspoon,

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.200
who used to work here at Library
of Congress as astrobiology chair.

01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:45.500
And his book, oh, Venus Unveiled

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:46.800
or Venus Revealed Very
respectfully something

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.100
like that is an excellent book

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.400
for the lay person to
really get engaged.

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.700
He talks a lot about just kind
of the mythology of Venus,

01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:52.000
and he also goes through-- it was
written after the Magellan age,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.300 position:56%
and so he talks a lot about what was
learned through the Magellan data.

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.600
It's a fascinating book.

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:55.900
He's a great writer.

01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.200
I'm giving a little plug for David.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.500
&gt;&gt; You might want to
spell his last name.

01:10:58.500 --> 01:10:59.800
&gt;&gt; Grinspoon, like grin,
G-R-I-N, spoon, like spoon,

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.100
S-P-O-O-N, Grinspoon, David.

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.400
It's a great book.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.700
Let's go back here.

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.000
Yes?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.300
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:07.600
Great question.

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.900
So the Vicky mission, which
is the current one that's

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.200
under competition, the question is,

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.450
when would we potentially
get back to Venus?

01:11:12.450 --> 01:11:13.910
At the earliest possible
opportunity,

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:15.920
if we win the current competition.

01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:26.500
The Vicky mission, if successful,
would launch in 2025, okay?

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.300
Yes?

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:56.260
[ Inaudible ]

01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:59.270
Correct. So the question is, what
kind of technology are we using

01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:01.080
on the proposed Vicky mission

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:03.710
to survive this harsh
environment near the surface?

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:05.790
If you want to land and
survive on the surface,

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:07.550
how are you going to do that?

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:12.880
So in all honesty, the technology
required is not that fancy.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.140
We have a very, a pressure vessel,
which is similar to the types

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:20.960
of bathometers and stuff
that we send under the ocean

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.600
that can withstand great
pressures on their exteriors.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.460
It's spherical in shape, which
is a good shape for trying

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.530 position:56%
to fend off lots of great pressures.

01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:33.190
We do have some more modern
ceiling technology than was used

01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:35.330
on the older ones that
should help us keep

01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:38.790
from getting any kind of leaks.

01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:41.530
But then the kind of cooling
technology is, as I've described,

01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:45.870
a passive system with a face
change material, power sources

01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:48.830
or batteries, your
typical kinds of batteries.

01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:51.130
We didn't talk about
power too much in here,

01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:55.010
but nuclear power sources
could be used on Venus,

01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:56.510
but they're not very efficient

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:58.500
because nuclear power
sources require you

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.600
to dump and dissipate heat.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.900
And trying to dissipate heat

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:05.920
into Venus's atmosphere,
not very efficient.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:11.420
So in all honesty, the technology
doesn't require that much advance.

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:15.500
We have the technology available
today to do that sort of thing.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:19.700
We are flying some very
sensitive instrumentation.

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:22.690 position:56%
A lot of the instruments we'd like
to carry to Venus, on either DAVINCI

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:25.580
or Vicky, are the same types of
instruments that are operating

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:28.260
on the surface of Mars now,
the same types of measurements

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:30.730
that are making great
discoveries every day

01:13:30.730 --> 01:13:34.150
about the Martian environment
and the curiosity landing site.

01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:35.450
Those are the same instruments

01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:38.360
that we're proposing to
carry on our mission.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.760
The biggest thing is trying
to survive the entry loads.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.530
And so there are new
technologies for trying

01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:48.630
to enter the Venus atmosphere
to keep you protected

01:13:48.630 --> 01:13:49.940 position:56%
from that atmosphere as you come in.

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.590
And that's probably where the
greatest technology development has

01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:57.480
been that allows us to come
in at low angles on the top

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:00.270
of the atmosphere to
reduce the G loads on all

01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:02.500
of those sensitive instruments.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.670
Yeah, I think Pioneer
Venus came in at

01:14:04.670 --> 01:14:06.640
like 300 G or something like that.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:12.300
I mean, it's outrageous, you
know, G shock that it got coming

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.900
into the top of the
Venus atmosphere.

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.450
And most of our instrument probably
wouldn't like that very much.

01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:20.430
So we try and keep it much,
much lower than that, yeah.

01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:21.730
More questions?

01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:23.030
Yeah.

01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:27.190
&gt;&gt; Did any of the past
missions look for radioactivity?

01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:30.350
&gt;&gt; Yes. Did some of the past
missions look for radioactivity?

01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:38.070
Yes, the Venera landers
included a gamma ray detector,

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:41.360
which detected naturally
radiating materials,

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:44.280
uranium, thorium and potassium.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.580
So we do have measurements of those
naturally radioactive elements.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.240
And by looking at those, that
was part of the data that went

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.410
into trying to help us
understand what kind

01:14:53.410 --> 01:14:55.300
of rocks are present on
the surface of Venus.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.860
So that's exactly where
those measurements came from.

01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.450
&gt;&gt; Maybe one more.

01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:02.770
&gt;&gt; I think I have one right here.

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:06.370
&gt;&gt; Have you mentioned the other
large economies in the world,

01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:11.170
like China, India, Japan or
Germany who are funding missions?

01:15:11.170 --> 01:15:13.970
Or are they on silence?

01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:17.170
&gt;&gt; Other large economies that might
possibly be thinking about missions

01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:20.630
to Venus, I mentioned the
European Space Agency,

01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:23.760
which includes a consortium
of France and Germany.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.060
They would be partnering.

01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.650
A mission of this size
would require all of them

01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:27.950
to be partnering together.

01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:30.200
So they are thinking
about it in that world.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.530
Russia is thinking about
it, as I mentioned.

01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:38.280
ISRO, in India, the Indian Space
Agency, is thinking about Venus.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.050
They've been thinking about
Venus for quite a while.

01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:43.660
They've had some recent
success at Mars.

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:45.170
They've had some success
at the Moon.

01:15:45.170 --> 01:15:47.170
And so they really are-- Venus is

01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:50.150
on their list once they get
a couple more missions off

01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:52.270
of their kind of agenda.

01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:56.830
I think it's possible that Venus
could rise up in India's interest.

01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:59.600
I have not heard of any
interest that I know

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.580
of of China thinking
about Venus yet.

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.220
Not that I know of.

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:08.160
&gt;&gt; They probably want us to
leave, so if you have a question,

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.120
you can come on down
while we close down here.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:12.420
Thank you all for coming.

01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:14.200
&gt;&gt; Thank you all so
much for your interest.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:15.570
Thank you.

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:17.630
