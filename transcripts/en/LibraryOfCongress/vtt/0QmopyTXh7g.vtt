00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.200
[ Applause ]

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.500
&gt;&gt; Gemma Lyon: Thank you, and
again, such an honor to be here

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.800
in all of your company.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.870
So, thank you very
much for having me.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.290
I'd like to talk to you today

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.840
about the Better Beginnings
Family Literacy Program.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.870
I'm the coordinator of that
program, and it's an initiative

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.840
of the State Library
of Western Australia.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.780
It was developed back
in 2004 in response

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.580
to quite critical
literacy issues

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.970
that were being faced
by W.A. families.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.990
The program is built
on a strong partnership

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.930
with the state government
of Western Australia,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.590
every local government area,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.480
and we have our corporate
partner Rio Tinto.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.660
Our collective mission is to
create generational change

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.750
for W.A. families by
supporting parents in reading

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.570
with their child, so that they
build the early literacy skills

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.220
that they need to become good
readers, and succeed at school,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520
and throughout their life.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.630
Okay. Sorry.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.080
What the program looks like,
our model draws influence

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.130
from successful and universally
proven models such as Bookstart

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.660
in the United Kingdom.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.170
And we've adapted it to
suit the unique identity

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.730
and diversity of
Western Australia.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.390
So, we have three reading
packs as part of the program.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.900
Three touch points with
families with they have a baby

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.110
at eight weeks, and then
again at two years old,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.910
and then again at four.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.500
So, the way we distribute
these is, libraries collaborate

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.840
with Child Health
nurses, and schools,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.100
and other relevant local and
trusted service providers

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.930
in their community
to reach parents.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.290
It's a flexible delivery
model and it can be one to one

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.360
with our service
providers, or in more group

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.740
and outreach-based settings.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.000
As well as through these
mainstream channels we also see

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.180
them used quite intensively
in settings

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.990
such as Migrant English
Programs and also in prisons

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.320
where the child is often the
motivation for the parent

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.930
to be learning to read.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.630
Okay. So, a little
bit of a perspective

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.990
on the state of Western
Australia.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.110
We are a huge state, this
works in our advantage a lot

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.670
of the time, but it
also creates some big --

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.400
pretty big challenges
that we have to face.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.500
So, we've got a population,
you can see there

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.930
on the western coast
of Australia,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.410
we have a population
of 2.6 million.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.890
And we cover 2.6 million
square-kilometers,

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.100
so which is over a
million square-miles

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.670
in that measurement.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.970
We also have 139 different local
governments within our state,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.390
and we have agreements with all
of them to deliver the program.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.590
So, some of the challenges
that we face is that,

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.590
a hundred of our local
governments are actually located

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.650
in regional rural areas.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.270
To support, particularly
Aboriginal families living

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.850
in remote areas, a fully
customized component

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.410
of the program was
established in 2010.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.240
This sees reading
pack supplemented

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.440
with additional resources,
including books

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.830
that are reflecting
the identity, culture,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.780
and world views of Aboriginal
families living in W.A.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.460
But what we're also trying to do
is compensate for lack of access

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.770
to public library services,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.270
which can often be a
seven-hour drive away.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.130
This aspect of the program has
proven the most challenging

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.550
for us, and we have an
evaluation in process,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.860
which is going to
involve how we work

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.160
with these communities
in the future.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.480
Oh. That's okay.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.510
So, we have resources to support
public libraries throughout

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.810
the state.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.640
So, we have a Storytime
Suitcase,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.260
which provides a fully
modeled form story time,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.130
which models best practice,
and a parent-centered approach

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.600
to delivering library
programs for the early years.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.770
And this helps us
to support libraries

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.990
that perhaps don't have a
-- any professional staff.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.160
And I'm going to race
ahead to our evaluation.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.930
So, the -- we have
two evaluations

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.510
as part of Better Beginnings.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.100
So, one is, a longitudinal study
by an independent university

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.630
that investigates how the
program is influencing book

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.970
sharing practices in families.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.270
We can show through that,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.880
that families are maintain their
book sharing practices at home

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.430
after their involvement
with the program.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.650
And they are engaging with their
library service as a result.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.490
Our most recent study
was commissioned in 2016,

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.790
and it was a Social Return

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.700
on Investment Analysis
for the program.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.820
This analysis has reiterated
the findings that we have seen

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.210
in the longitudinal study.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.910
It has also given
us a calculation

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.690
that for every one dollar
invested in our program,

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.180
a return of $5.64 is
returned in social value.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.670
This external academic
evaluation

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.320
for the program has been the key

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.750
to sustaining our funding
partnerships, and it --

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.730
the program now sits as part
of a 10-year literacy strategy

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.710
for the state, that's being
led by the state library.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.790
Our hope and our continued
mission is to contribute

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.340
to real generational
change for W.A. families,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.190
and establish life-long patterns
of patterns around reading,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.630
and our mission continues.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.940
But, thank you so much for
your time, and for having us.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.600

of the Library of Congress.
