00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Hello, I'm Erik Charas.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.880
I'm from Mozambique.
I'm a young global leader.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.430
And I'm here to state the importance on access
to information

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.720
especially inclusive -- inclusivity for the
poor.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.489
When you look at getting out of poverty, one
of the fundamental pillars

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.790
that exists, or that should be there, is that
people should be

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.420
informed, people should know what goes on
in the lives in the world,

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.750
they should be included in society rather
than excluded.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.830
And if we don't make provision that news,
general information gets to

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.250
the poor, there's very little difficulty -- very
little of -- well,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.640
there's a lot of difficulty for them to actually
become included in the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.050
general economic of society.
Well, when you look at one of the Davos questions

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.180
which is about
education and poverty, you'll find out that

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.850
most of the developing
countries, one of the things that is happening

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.649
is that very few
children actually do attend to go to school.

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.539
And those that do do not get the ability to
practice the reading, to

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:18.289
actually get informed of what goes on in the
world, to become aware of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.259
the circumstances that surround them, and
therefore be better equipped

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.079
with tools that would allow them to fight
for their own future.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:32.310
So when you address the issue of poverty and
education, it is extremely

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.619
important to consider the access to information.
And the majority of the population in the

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.729
poorer communities in the
world, do not have access to things like television,

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149
newspapers,
Internet.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.640
For example in a place like Mozambique, less
than ten percent of the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.780
population has access to electricity.
That limits their capacity to be connected

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.520
when you look at economical
ability, most of them can't afford to buy

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.999
a television, can't afford to
buy a computer or be connected to the Internet.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:07.950
When you look at for example the readership,
there's six million people

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.200
that can read, but newspapers exist in the
form of economy, less than

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.560
10,000.
So you are targeting less than .1 percent

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.760
of the population that can
actually afford to read and write.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.960
So it is supremely important that we push
on for this access to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.160
information, making it widely available.
And some information that should just be public

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.940
to allow us to become
citizens in the global economy.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.730
Okay.
That's my Davos date contribution.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.230
Thank you very much.
