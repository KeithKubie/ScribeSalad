00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.514
To explore these various input methods,
we'll use the same test bed throughout

00:00:04.514 --> 00:00:08.128
this lesson, which is based on
the screen saver we built last level.

00:00:08.128 --> 00:00:11.068
Now, instead of the ball just
moving in a straight line forever,

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:15.560
we'll control its movement with key
presses, touches, and the accelerometer.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.610
Let's explore the test bed a bit.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.020
First, our application listener
is called InputTestBed, and

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.640
it extends Game.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.940
The only thing we have to do in
this file is set the game screen,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.420
which we set to a new
instance of BallScreen.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.045
Let's check that out next.

00:00:30.045 --> 00:00:34.310
BallScreen is responsible for setting up
a place to draw, and then delegates all

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.250
the logic about what the ball actually
does to this BouncingBall class.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.150
BallScreen extends ScreenAdapter
which is a convenient implementation

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.000
of the screen interface.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.660
ScreenAdapter provides
blank implementations of

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.590
all the screens required methods,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.720
which means we can just override
the ones that we're interested in.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.544
There's a few new things here, the first
of which is this AutoShapeType.

00:00:56.544 --> 00:00:59.228
When ShapeRenderer is
in AutoShapeType mode,

00:00:59.228 --> 00:01:03.250
that means we can change shape
types in the middle of a batch.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.928
This is incredibly convenient
when you are passing

00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:08.926
your shape render into other
objects to use for drawing.

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:13.716
Note we use an extend viewport to make
the shortest access of the world equal

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:14.890
to WORLD_SIZE.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.320
Also note that every time the window
is resized, we just reset the ball.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.410
Then down here in render,
we do all the normal stuff.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.530
Applying the viewport, clearing the
screen, setting the ProjectionMatrix.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.820
Then we tell the ball to update itself,
we start a shape renderer batch, and

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.610
we tell the ball to go ahead and
draw itself using our shape renderer.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.698
Let's check out what the ball is doing.

00:01:36.698 --> 00:01:40.809
So this BouncingBall class is quite long
and I encourage you to just open up this

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:43.627
demo in the course code and
check it out for yourself.

00:01:43.627 --> 00:01:46.549
The behavior of this ball should
be pretty familiar from the screen

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.950
saver example.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.770
There are two new things, drag and

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.660
the periodic kicks that the ball
receives to show off that drag.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.610
Down here in update If its been
sufficiently long since we last gave

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.980
the ball a kick, then we go ahead and
give the ball a new kick.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.370
And here is where we apply drag.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.720
Every frame the velocity is
reduced by an amount proportional

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.365
to the current velocity.

00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:10.500
Let's see this all in action.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.128
So, we see we've got a little red
ball that occasionally gets kicked in

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:16.221
a random direction.

00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.265
Then, it slowly comes to a stop.

00:02:18.265 --> 00:02:21.631
It kind of looks like an air
hockey table, and if we resize it,

00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:24.320
it just resets itself to the middle.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.380
All right, so this is fun,
but it's not interactive yet.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.220
Well, let's fix that.
