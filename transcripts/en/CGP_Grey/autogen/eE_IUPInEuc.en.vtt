00:00:00.752 --> 00:00:02.747
 Welcome to the State of the Netherlands 

00:00:02.747 --> 00:00:03.399
 Where the lily flowers 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:04.160
 Windmills spin 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.937
 Breakfast containing chocolate 

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:05.941
 Majestic people 

00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:07.787
 The sea is trying to submerge it all 

00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:09.926
 But this is not the Netherlands 

00:00:10.097 --> 00:00:13.597
 It is time to know the difference between the Netherlands and Netherland (lowlands) and much more 

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:15.080
 The correct name for this country of lily flowers 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.254
 Windmills 

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:17.095
 Heggles (Dutch eaters) 

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:17.757
 Activity of container ships 

00:00:17.757 --> 00:00:18.787
 Ocean occupation 

00:00:18.787 --> 00:00:19.837
 The Netherlands is Nethelands 

00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:24.194
 But this confusion is expected as this region has been renamed several times 

00:00:24.194 --> 00:00:26.344
 For thousands of years: the United Republic of Low Lands 

00:00:26.344 --> 00:00:28.070
 United States of America 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.469
 And the Kingdom of the Netherlands 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:32.691
 But it is not history alone 

00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:34.982
 Netherlands is divided into 12 provinces: 

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:35.702
 Groningen 

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:36.328
 Drenthe 

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:36.902
 Overheesle 

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:37.392
 Hilderland 

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:38.010
 Lemberg 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.598
 Norte 

00:00:38.598 --> 00:00:39.092
 Norte Brabont 

00:00:39.092 --> 00:00:39.456
 Zeeland 

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.825
 Which for this reason became the name of New Zealand such as: New Zeeland 

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:43.445
 Friesland is spotted with beautiful little hearts 

00:00:44.034 --> 00:00:44.664
 Flevoland 

00:00:44.664 --> 00:00:45.255
 Utrecht 

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:48.364
 Here is the place of confusion: North Holland and South Holland 

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:51.006
 The two provinces of Tan made Netherlands called the Netherlands 

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:54.117
 Similar to the naming of Dakota states and Dakota 

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:55.933
 Which is mostly empty (free of population) and safe for Jacqueline - a kind of wild animal 

00:00:56.142 --> 00:00:58.648
 The two provinces are the most densely populated 

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:01.834
 Where the most attractive areas such as Amsterdam and KÃ¶kenhof 

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:05.689
 If you have heard of it (ie the International Court of Justice) it is also in one of the Dutch 

00:01:06.347 --> 00:01:09.304
 Even the official government website of the travel guide is www.holland.com 

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:12.395
 Because it seems more popular but informal 

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:14.737
 Maybe it's exactly what people are looking for 

00:01:14.737 --> 00:01:18.219
 The mixing continues where the Dutchmen are called Hollanders 

00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:20.763
 But also the citizens of Netherlands are called Dutch 

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:23.390
 As is the name of their language but in their language they say: 

00:01:25.962 --> 00:01:29.162
 Which they also seem to have instead of Netherlanish 

00:01:29.162 --> 00:01:30.703
 At the same time the counterpart in Germany say: 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.697
 Which they also seem to have instead of Dutch 

00:01:35.354 --> 00:01:36.900
 This linguistic confusion is the reason why the Americans 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.448
 They call it Dutch Dutch although German 

00:01:39.448 --> 00:01:40.444
 -Revision- 

00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:41.886
 This country is: Netherlands (Lowlands) 

00:01:41.886 --> 00:01:42.726
 The people of the lowlands 

00:01:42.726 --> 00:01:43.509
 Language of the people of the lowlands 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:47.606
 There is no such country as the Netherlands, but the northern and southern provinces of the Netherlands 

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:48.479
 Is it clear? 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.343
 Great, because we're getting into more complicated things 

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.677
 Netherlands are part of the kingdom that are of the same name 

00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:55.880
 The Kingdom of Netherland is called by the Royal Family 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.499
 Which contains three other countries and to identify them 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:01.379
 We must sail across the frozen North Sea towards the Caribbean 

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.218
 Where Aruba, Curacao, and St. Martin 

00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:07.276
 These new islands are self-governing within the Kingdom of Netherland 

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:10.301
 It has its own government and independent cash currency as well 

00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:11.821
 &lt;Side geographic note&gt; 

00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:15.415
 The island of Saint Martin is just the southern half of the small island 

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:17.376
 The so-called Sainte Martin is also within the Kingdom, 

00:02:17.376 --> 00:02:20.946
 While the other half (northern) is occupied by France and also called Saint Martin 

00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:23.607
 Although they are on the European map separated by the state of Beljika 

00:02:23.607 --> 00:02:26.596
 The Kingdom of Netherland and the Republic of France share the same border 

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:28.553
 On that island in the other part of the world it's something beautiful 

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:32.022
 But why did the Kingdom of Netherland arrive in the Caribbean? 

00:02:32.022 --> 00:02:33.059
 Simply put, 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.802
 - Empire - 

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:36.682
 In 1600 AD the peoples of the lowlands were always seeking to expand their trade 

00:02:36.682 --> 00:02:39.385
 And to put their hands on everything precious and accessible 

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:41.775
 For a time, the East Coast of America was called the New Netherland, a new lowland 

00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:42.764
 With its new Amsterdam capital 

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:45.815
 As well as New Zealand as mentioned earlier and nearby 

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:47.950
 The queen of the islands (Australia) was called the New Holland A New Holland 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.727
 Although the empire ended, the three Caribbean islands remained 

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:53.535
 While four countries within one kingdom are not strange 

00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:58.822
 It does not stop there because the state of Netherland has expanded its borders within the Caribbean 

00:02:58.822 --> 00:03:01.461
 Through 3 other islands: Bonaire, Saint Eustachius and Ceiba 

00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:05.413
 These islands are not one of the Kingdom's states but separate cities under the state of Netherland 

00:03:05.413 --> 00:03:10.560
 The citizens residing there are elected by the government and so on 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.346
 They do not follow any boycott and deal with the dollar instead of the euro 

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:20.725
 Somewhat on the quasi-Hawaiian that is not a state 

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:23.731
 But technically a subsidiary of the province of Colombia as well as dealing in a different currency is the yen 

00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:25.694
 These cities belong to the state of Netherland 

00:03:25.694 --> 00:03:27.996
 These are the countries of the Kingdom of Netherland 

00:03:27.996 --> 00:03:31.499
 All are known as Ditch-Caribe and its citizens are citizens of the Kingdom of Netherland 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:35.462
 Because this kingdom is a member of the European Union, that means 

00:03:35.462 --> 00:03:39.003
 These Dutch-Caribbean islands are also European, and in the end. 

00:03:39.003 --> 00:03:43.160
 There are six Caribbean islands, four states, two provinces, two Dutch, two lowlands 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.006
 And one kingdom, all of them (Dutch)
