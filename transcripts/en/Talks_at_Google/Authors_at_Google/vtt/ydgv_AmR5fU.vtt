00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.870
BORIS DEBIC: Welcome
everybody to one more Authors

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.010
at Google Talk.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:12.330
Today with us are science
fiction authors Larry Niven

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.700
and Gregory Benford.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.030
They have been here
about a year ago, when

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.630
they presented the
"Bowl of Heaven."

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.520
And today they will
talk about the sequel

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.780
to the "Bowl of
Heaven," "Shipstar."

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.350
I will try to make this
introduction short,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.515
but it's hard to make
introductions short

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:42.580
when you have such amazing
people next to you.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.078
LARRY NIVEN: You need
younger writers for that.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.520
BORIS DEBIC: I need
younger writers, yes.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.240
So, a little bit
about Larry Niven.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.570
He was born in 1938 in
Los Angeles, California.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.355
Won his first Hugo award
for the best short story

00:00:59.355 --> 00:01:03.590
for the "Neutron Star" in 1967.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.350
And he won it in 1972
for "Inconstant Moon,"

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.110
and in 1975 for "The Holeman."

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.800
In 1976 he won the Hugo
award for the best novelette,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.320
"The Borderland of Sol."

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.470
He won the Nebula Award in
1970, and the Hugo and Locus

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.480
awards in 1971 for "Ringworld."

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.930
He is famous for this.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.400
Niven has written scripts
for three science fiction

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.660
television series, and
Illogical Fantasy series.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.870
He's also the author of
"Niven's Laws for Writers."

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.310
And we may get back to
them later during the talk.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.350
Larry Niven attended Washburn
University in Topeka,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.602
California Institute of
Technology, and UCLA.

00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:55.520
He holds degrees in
mathematics and psychology.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.000
Much of Larry's writing
since the 1970s has

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.530
been in collaboration
particularly

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.890
with Jerry Pournelle,
Steven Barnes,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.180
Brenda Cooper, Edward
M. Lerner, and of course

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.979
our second guest,
Gregory Benford.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.010
Gregory Benford was born in
1941 in Mobile, Alabama--

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.010
GREGORY BENFORD: Mobile.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.690
BORIS DEBIC: Mobile.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.669
Mobile, Alabama.

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.710
GREGORY BENFORD: It's not
mobile, it stays there.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.760
BORIS DEBIC: In 1969, he began
writing a regular science

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.470
column for the magazine,
"Amazing Stories."

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.530
His time travel
novel, "Timescape"

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.325
won both the Nebula award, and
the John W. Campbell Memorial

00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:44.800
Award.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.680
Gregory has been nominated for
four Hugo awards and 12 Nebula

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.840
awards.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.970
In addition to "Timescape,"
he and Gordon Eklund

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.040
won the Nebula for the novelette
"If the Stars are Gods."

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.320
Gregory has created and written
about the first computer

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.090
virus in the late '60s.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.481
We can come back to this.

00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.486
This is the right
environment for this.

00:03:09.486 --> 00:03:10.460
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.543
BORIS DEBIC: His work in
physics at the University

00:03:12.543 --> 00:03:14.020
of California,
Irvine has focused

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.840
on theoretical and
experimental plasma physics,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.395
including studies of
extremely strong turbulence

00:03:21.395 --> 00:03:24.460
in astrophysical
context, and studies

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.730
of magnetic structures from the
galactic center to large scale

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.250
galactic jets.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.732
If you have read the
"Bowl of Heaven,"

00:03:32.732 --> 00:03:37.980
you may pieced these two
pieces of information together.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.910
He made a contribution in
understanding and addressing

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.110
global warming and
related chemical

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.480
changes in ocean water.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.160
Gregory also serves on the board
of directors of the student

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.405
committee of the Mars Society,
which is dear to my heart.

00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:55.340
And Gregory has received
a Bachelor of Science

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.990
in physics from the University
of Oklahoma in Norman,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.300
followed by a Master of
Science and Doctorate

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.660
from the University of
California, San Diego.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.720
That was the shortest
I could do it.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.130
My apologies for all
the things that I missed

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.700
in this introduction,
but I think

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.690
it would take half an hour to
get them properly introduced.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.140
Please give a warm
welcome to them.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.640
GREGORY BENFORD: So, next slide.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.630
Let me just start
with "Shipstar,"

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.370
and to tell you how
much disappointed

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.100
I was when I read
the "Bowl of Heaven."

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.840
The reason I was
disappointed was

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.700
that I did not realize that
it would have a sequel.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.950
I devoured the book in a couple
of weeks, and I get to the end

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.060
and it says, to be continued.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.735
I didn't like you
guys at that moment.

00:04:56.735 --> 00:04:59.770
But I love the time that
we have "Shipstar" now.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.100
So you want to start us off by--

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.750
LARRY NIVEN: Let me apologize
to him and about half of you.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.480
Because I made every
effort to find an ending

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.390
for the "Bowl of Heaven,"
knowing that it was the middle

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.440
a two-part novel.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.690
We always planned it
to be a two-part novel,

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.850
but I thought I could
find a break point.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.550
All we really did was give our
characters a chance to sit down

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.619
and rest for a while.

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:34.910
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah, which
they needed at that point.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.660
And so did we.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.280
We started this project thinking
we could do it in one volume.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.120
And then it became
impossible because we

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.686
don't like door stop novels.

00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:46.060
LARRY NIVEN: It
became impossible

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.530
because he kept finding
new implications.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.980
GREGORY BENFORD: Oh yeah,
it's always me, isn't it?

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.720
No we just-- you
know, it's a big idea.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.345
In fact, we're already
getting pressure

00:05:56.345 --> 00:05:59.809
from people saying, hey, you've
got to go further, and tie up

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:01.100
this thing and then that thing.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.641
And so forth.

00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:05.330
And we might do it in an
anthology or something

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.830
like that.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.660
I'm not sure.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.950
But it's a big object.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.960
And how many "Ring World"
novels are there now?

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.307
Five, isn't it?

00:06:13.307 --> 00:06:14.390
LARRY NIVEN: No it's four.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.645
GREGORY BENFORD: Four.

00:06:14.645 --> 00:06:15.311
Seems like five.

00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:17.420
LARRY NIVEN: Unless
you count "Protector."

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.830
GREGORY BENFORD: Well I do.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.140
LARRY NIVEN: Because the
"Ringworld" did not appear.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.470
GREGORY BENFORD: True.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.890
So this is the
way you do things.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.400
When you're trying to
figure out a big object,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.260
as you saw from our
previous appearance here,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.290
we went out and even
commissioned art,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.170
so we could see what
the thing looked like.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.190
And I'll review some
of that in the slides

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.240
here, and then show
you some new stuff

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.880
that we developed for the
book, the second book,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.940
the "Shipstar."

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.440
LARRY NIVEN: Having
finished a book,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.360
you keep on thinking about it.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.062
It's always true.

00:06:50.062 --> 00:06:51.020
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.240
I mean, you can see why
Shakespeare killed everybody

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.620
at the end of Hamlet, because
at least there's no sequel.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.314
It was already long.

00:07:01.314 --> 00:07:02.480
This will be a quick review.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.040
This is Ringworld,
ancient history now.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.970
And next.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.770
And then this is-- what is this?

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.850
Oh yeah, that's the-- right.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:13.540
That's--

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.770
LARRY NIVEN: We're
going to have to keep

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.311
peering over our
shoulder, aren't we?

00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.140
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.500
The scale is solar
system, and so,

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.210
and we got all the visual
thinking about this

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.830
was done by Freeman Dyson,
about Dyson spheres.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.830
And there is a program
at Link Observatory,

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.890
To look for Dyson's
spheres right now.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.300
And the WISE experiment
is still being

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:45.230
mined, that was an infrared
scope FDL 2 point, which

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.240
is still being mined to look
for Dyson spheres, which

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:56.160
are tiny, fairly faint infrared
sources where there's no star.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.810
LARRY NIVEN: It wouldn't be
that faint, though, would they?

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.294
it's still the output of a star.

00:08:00.294 --> 00:08:01.210
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.918
LARRY NIVEN: It's just
being reduced down

00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:04.570
to the temperature
of warm water.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:05.760
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah right.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.050
Next.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:07.800
What is that?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.390
And so these ideas about
building up structures--

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.980
this is one that came
around in the 1970s--

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.890
is that, how would you
build a Dyson sphere?

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.060
You'd build it out
of these belts, which

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.010
begin to look suspiciously
like Ringworlds.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.300
And next.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:24.830
And then you go on to
other formations like this.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.620
This is not going to
be stable, but remember

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.710
this is on the scale
of the solar system.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.197
And then next.

00:08:31.197 --> 00:08:32.280
LARRY NIVEN: There we are.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.890
GREGORY BENFORD: Oh this is
about the Link Observatory

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.510
program, which Geoff
Marcy is running

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.820
right now to look
for Dyson spheres.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.130
Next.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.660
And this is kind of the general
philosophy of the subject.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.490
You see, there's a term in the
genre dubbed Big Dumb Objects.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.180
So when I began
thinking about this,

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.590
and talked to Larry
about it, I always

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.740
objected to the dumb part.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.260
Because the Ringworld is
actually not passively stable.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.850
You have to readjust for
every time somebody slammed

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:03.450
their foot down
in the Ringworld.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.050
It's inherently unstable.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.407
It will slide sideways
right into the stars.

00:09:08.407 --> 00:09:10.490
So you have to have corrector
jets the whole time.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.080
So it's really not
that dumb an object.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.852
Next.

00:09:14.852 --> 00:09:16.060
LARRY NIVEN: It started dumb.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.435
GREGORY BENFORD:
It started dumb.

00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:19.740
LARRY NIVEN: And
the Big Dumb Object

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.626
is far easier to write about
if you're a storyteller.

00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:27.000
BORIS DEBIC: It's probably
self-assembled as well, right?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.280
LARRY NIVEN: The thing
isn't doing anything.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.180
It's there to be explored.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.610
All your action comes
from the characters

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.970
in a Big Dumb Objects story.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.700
GREGORY BENFORD: There are
no maintenance chapters

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.990
in a Big Dumb Object story.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.020
Next.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.700
This is a view of the old ideas.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.575
This is from the th O'Neill
colony era in the 1970s.

00:09:51.575 --> 00:09:52.950
Certainly it looked
like you want

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.870
to live in space in a
stressed object, which

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.240
is spinning at the same time.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:58.980
That's the point.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.480
Everything we're
going to talk about

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.720
is under very, very
high tensile stress,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.830
because it's like an
inverted swimming pool.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.870
Right?

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.720
Next.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.260
And so, Art C. Clark did this
in "Rendezvous with Rama,"

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:17.360
variable big long solar area
enters the solar system.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.460
What's it doing here?

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.120
It's only just cruising
by and doing a delta-v.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.150
It's on its way out already.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.290
Next.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.900
And so we devised this guy.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.740
This is the size of
the solar system,

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.220
and that little bright
object in there is its star.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.830
And the jet is propelling
the bowl of heaven forward.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.770
So this is a habitat that's
moving through the galaxy.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.890
So you get to stay
at home and go

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.800
for a nice long journey
on cruise control,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.060
more or less, except
it's inherently unstable.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.950
Right?

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.410
And if you turn the jet
off, the shell, the bowl,

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.130
falls into the star.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.240
Big problem.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.550
But of course, walking around
on two legs is unstable too.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.650
It requires a command
and control system

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.410
which most animals don't have.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.020
I mean, part of the whole
thing about human intelligence

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.680
is that we're on an
already unstable platform.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.000
It's not like you're a
smart animal with four legs.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.850
You've got only two.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.670
So smart creatures will
make unstable structures.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.490
That's kind of a lesson.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.430
Next.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.820
And this is how it
looks from the side.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.430
The discovery moment is when the
starship halts just above this,

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.960
it can look back and see
that it's a bowl and a star.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.080
Because from behind,
unless you notice the jet,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.720
you can't even see the star.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.150
So it's a big sudden revelation
when you overhaul it.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.990
And that's the opening
of "Bowl of Heaven."

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.240
Next.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.860
And this is the star,
a very troubled star,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.120
which produces the jet,
which is on the other side.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.170
And the entire star
is magnetically

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.300
manipulated to make the
jet, because it's not

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.871
a naturally occurring object.

00:12:00.871 --> 00:12:01.370
Next.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:04.810
Yeah.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.705
And this is only
part of the diagram,

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:08.240
but it shows you
that the object is

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.520
spinning to give
centrifugal gravity.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.410
And it depends on where
you are in the bowl,

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.040
I'll show you the acceleration
plots a little later.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.430
The point is, you're up near
the axis, there's no gravity.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.660
There's no centrifugal
gravity to match anything.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.510
Down here on the Great Plain,
you get about-- what is it?

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.190
0.8 earth scrap.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.080
So it's not exactly hours,
it's a little bit lighter.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.030
And the beings who
live there are bigger,

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.120
as you would expect.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:41.340
It turns out the first ones
you meet are giant birds.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.030
Smart birds.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.110
So all this goes
into the design.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.560
Next.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.470
This is the view from the Great
Plain, looking at the star.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:54.910
By the way, the star is
moved into the field of view.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.990
Don Davis had the
dimensions wrong,

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.540
but I like this shot, because
it shows you the star too.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.730
But that's actually
further to the right.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.340
So this is what it
looks like if you

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:06.000
stand on the Great Plain
looking up into the sky.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.090
This is a very, very clear day.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:14.099
But on a clear day you can see
across the entire structure.

00:13:14.099 --> 00:13:15.640
And you're aware of
the fact that you

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.506
live in a non-planetary
environment.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:20.640
Next.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.470
So this, by the way, is the
acceleration as you can read.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.380
It's the centrifugal
gravity versus angle.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.220
And there's no
gravity when you're

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.950
close to the axis,
which is called,

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.410
by the way, the knothole.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.890
And that's how we
fly into this object.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:41.360
And gravity's maximum
out on the Great Plain.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.549
But notice that it's
curved, locally curved.

00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:46.590
And therefore there's an
acceleration of gravity,

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:52.120
next, parallel to
the ground also.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:56.662
And as you get near the
axis, it's pushing you away.

00:13:56.662 --> 00:13:58.370
And it was designed
that way because they

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.950
don't want the inhabitants
to go near the axis,

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.100
because that's where
all the magic occurs.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:07.130
And you have to steer the
jet through the knothole.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.730
And that's where
the elite lives.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.540
It's like Manhattan.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.880
You don't want people coming.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.250
And so there's a
push against people

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.280
who are trying to walk
their way to the axis.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.790
Which is, remember, on the
scale of 100 billion kilometers

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.050
away, so it's going
to take a while.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:26.940
So almost all the
transport of this thing

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.380
is, we learn in both novels,
is by very fast maglev trains.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.610
Because they don't
have any fossil fuels.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.170
Right?

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.960
You can't fly around in the
air burning high value fossil

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.630
fuels.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:43.540
So you use trains,
but not entirely.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.580
Next.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.780
This is what it
looks like as you're

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.440
zooming around far about.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:52.667
There's, by the way, a confined
atmosphere with a thin mono

00:14:52.667 --> 00:14:54.000
layer to keep all this stuff in.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.860
But on the right there
are these enormous storms.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.640
There are always storms
out on the great seas.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.790
But on the left,
those are the mirrors

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.700
that reflect sunlight back
to the base of the jet,

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.612
and create the
energy for the jet.

00:15:08.612 --> 00:15:10.070
And then that's
magnetically shaped

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.970
into a jet that blows
through the knothole.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.840
So you see, it's propelling
itself using the energy

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.490
from the star in
more ways than one.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.150
It reflects the
sunlight back, and then

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.080
the sub blows the
plasma off, and that

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:27.420
pushes the whole contraption
through the galaxy.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.140
Next.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:31.110
And this is the
view of the clouds

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:35.150
as you descend toward the top
of the layered atmosphere.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.190
You can see some light
effects, and refraction,

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.036
and spectral
break-up, and so on.

00:15:41.036 --> 00:15:42.160
It's kind of a pretty view.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.030
Of course, this
isn't painted, this

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:47.797
is actually a view of
a cloud on the earth.

00:15:47.797 --> 00:15:48.880
Giving away a secret here.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.760
This is not actually
from another planet,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.510
it's from this planet.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.950
Next.

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.400
And this is how they got in.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.400
This is the frontispiece on
"Bowl of Heaven" in full color.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.610
This is how the Starship
flies into the knothole,

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.824
against the jet, to
get into the object.

00:16:07.824 --> 00:16:10.240
They figure it's the closest
and it's the safest approach.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.490
Rather than flying up in
front of somebody in the sky,

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.710
you come at them from behind.

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.080
So they loop around the bowl
and come up against the jet,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.580
swimming upstream.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.940
Next.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.930
And this is-- ah good.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.810
And this is close up
of the foreground.

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.310
Notice way over on
the left, there's

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.070
some human beings
walking around,

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:30.820
trying to figure out
how this thing works.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.130
Over here is what is
called zigzag tree.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.650
A local common formation
of a kind of tree.

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.190
Which--

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:38.731
LARRY NIVEN: We
didn't describe that.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:41.680
Don Davis, the
artist, interpreted

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.132
our minor description.

00:16:44.132 --> 00:16:45.090
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.340
Notice that it secures
itself against high winds

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.630
by having roots come
out of the limbs.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.780
So it's really pinned down,
and therefore lasts longer.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.210
And then over here,
there's this funny thing

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:01.360
which you'll see up close, which
is another method of transport

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.510
on the bowl.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:03.690
Next.

00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:10.329
It is an enormous
living dirigible,

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.683
which makes its
own hydrogen, which

00:17:12.683 --> 00:17:14.099
is by the way a
convenient weapon.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:20.390
And it's called a
skyfish, unoriginally.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.079
And there's a whole lot of
this in both books, what

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.319
it's like to be in the skyfish
and to fight a skyfish.

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:29.260
GREGORY BENFORD: We do have some
neat life forms in these books.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.059
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:30.850
That was the point.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.980
Strange interesting aliens.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:36.095
So we spent a lot of time
just dreaming up new aliens.

00:17:36.095 --> 00:17:37.365
BORIS DEBIC: And social order.

00:17:37.365 --> 00:17:39.240
GREGORY BENFORD: And
the social order, right.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.100
And this is where the
skyfish moors itself.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.970
Again, this isn't
a painting, this

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.820
is actually a prominent
mountain on the planet.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.640
Anybody know what it is?

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.119
Notice it looks just like
it has a base on the top.

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.160
BORIS DEBIC: Kilimanjaro.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.830
GREGORY BENFORD:
Yes, you're right.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:56.600
You're cheating.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.580
Yes, Kilimanjaro.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.810
This is how Kilimanjaro
actually looks.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:04.170
It's an extinct volcano
in the middle of Africa.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.610
Very close to the equator too.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.410
Next.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:12.750
And so this is some comment
on-- these kinds of structures

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.280
are inherently
conservative, right?

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:18.570
Because it's too easy
to make a mistake.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.500
And so there are lots of
rules-- you can read this,

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:27.550
I won't read it
to you-- that say,

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:30.220
no sudden movements,
basically, is the order.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:34.960
And you have to have
a good clear hierarchy

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.130
so things don't get out
of control, literally.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:43.010
You're living in an
inherently unstable system.

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.510
You see?

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:48.350
We live on-- the Earth is
actually a Big Dumb Object.

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:52.780
LARRY NIVEN: Not quite so dumb
as we would like to believe.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:57.580
We used to think that continents
don't move, for instance.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.560
Drifting continents
is a newish concept.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.150
The more we learn
about the Earth,

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:09.460
the more we become tempted
to try to do things about it.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.889
Weather control.

00:19:10.889 --> 00:19:12.680
GREGORY BENFORD: Which
is certainly coming,

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.821
or climate control, actually.

00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:15.570
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:17.569
GREGORY BENFORD:
Geo-engineering, as it's known.

00:19:17.569 --> 00:19:20.472
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah, weather
control is probably impossible.

00:19:20.472 --> 00:19:21.430
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.280
Right.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.560
There'll be an app
for it eventually.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.060
Next.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.268
BORIS DEBIC: Big bust events.

00:19:27.268 --> 00:19:29.280
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah, exactly.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.590
Smart means vigilant.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.084
So as I said here, I used
to work on shrimp boats

00:19:33.084 --> 00:19:34.000
on the Gulf of Mexico.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.680
I'm from southern Alabama.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:43.170
And a boat, as my grandfather
remarked to me once,

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.170
is just looking for
a chance to sink.

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.410
Something's always
got to go wrong.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:54.480
And it does in, particularly in
the second novel, "Shipstar."

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.801
Next.

00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:57.300
LARRY NIVEN: You
wouldn't respect us

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:58.540
if things didn't go wrong.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:19:59.498
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:01.180
Yes.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.220
So this is the thing.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:03.720
Whoops!

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.720
I mean, if you drill
through the bowl,

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.920
in some places it's only a few
millimeters thick, than what's

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.270
on the outside?

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.480
High vacuum, and you are
spinning with respect

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.630
to the surroundings, at
thousands of kilometers

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.210
a second.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.390
So it's a great way
to launch spacecraft.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.330
You can just pitch them off
the back porch, so to speak.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.170
And they have a
very high velocity.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.630
And that's how you explore
planets as you go by them,

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.064
or solar systems as you come by.

00:20:34.064 --> 00:20:36.230
You don't want to get too
close to the solar system,

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:41.360
because this object will disturb
the orbits in a close flyby.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.240
So you stay well out, and
you throw these craft out

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.830
at thousands of kilometers a
second, and they go exploring,

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.860
and they come back.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.570
That's it, OK good.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:57.900
That's the end of
the show and tell.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.920
So, we end up with-- the
strategy of the books

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.870
is, we introduced
you to this place.

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.860
The humans in the
drama make a number

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.995
of assumptions,
so do the readers.

00:21:08.995 --> 00:21:13.340
And we deliberately didn't talk
about certain aspects of it,

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.920
so that in the second book,
we didn't pull the rug out

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.900
from under your assumptions.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.050
And what seemed to be true
turns out to be not true.

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.360
And the tales about how
the whole system works

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.065
reveal who actually
manages the place.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.220
When you walk into
Google, you don't

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.410
meet Sergey Brin when
you're signing in.

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:40.514
Well, when you come onto
an object like this,

00:21:40.514 --> 00:21:42.180
the people who intercept
you when you're

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.670
trying to board--
after all, you're

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:50.630
boarding a ship-- are
not the captain, or even

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.350
the same species as the captain.

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.150
So there's a real
hierarchy, and you

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.110
have to understand it if you're
going to live in this society.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.080
LARRY NIVEN: Remember guys,
this is an old object.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:08.610
We made it 100 million years
old, or something like it.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.900
They've been accepting
boarders, expecting boarders,

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.704
for nearly that long.

00:22:14.704 --> 00:22:15.620
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.050
LARRY NIVEN: They know
what to do about visitors.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.394
Even armed visitors.

00:22:20.394 --> 00:22:21.310
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.260
And they have some
interesting weapons too.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:30.100
But on the ground, the
weapons are very constrained

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.050
because you can't
make a weapon that's

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:35.100
big enough to blow a
hole in the structure.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.500
That's a very bad idea.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.255
LARRY NIVEN: Yes.

00:22:37.255 --> 00:22:39.682
BORIS DEBIC: It's a
very fragile world.

00:22:39.682 --> 00:22:40.390
LARRY NIVEN: Yes.

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.040
BORIS DEBIC: Going
back to writing.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.800
So "Niven's Laws for Writers."

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.290
Larry, how did you come
up with these laws?

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.240
LARRY NIVEN: I
wrote Niven's Laws

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.350
because I'd come
up with a few, what

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.280
I considered to be basic truths.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.060
They're not all for
writers, just a few of them.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.950
Never fire a laser at a mirror.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:11.390
From a 1964 Democratic
Convention in Chicago,

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:16.100
I got never throw
shit at an armed man.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.410
And never stand
next to somebody who

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:23.810
is throwing shit
at an armed man.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:30.440
But one of my own principles,
never let a waiter escape.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.470
Your waiter is
holding you prisoner,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.767
whether he realizes
it or not, and he

00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:35.850
doesn't have to come back.

00:23:37.805 --> 00:23:39.305
BORIS DEBIC: In the
ones for writers

00:23:39.305 --> 00:23:41.910
though, you have
one that says, it

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.010
is a sin to waste
the reader's time.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:47.240
LARRY NIVEN: Yes.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:52.050
Cutting your manuscript
is always a good idea.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.660
You gradually-- ha ha!

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.450
Bob Weison taught me this.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.794
And he taught me and
Jerry Pournelle too.

00:24:03.552 --> 00:24:08.700
We cut the bejesus out
of "Emoting God's Eye,"

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:13.670
Jerry and I, with Bob's help.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.330
We come to "Lucifer's
Hammer," and we've

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.990
turned it in at 250,000 words.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:24.120
Bob, the editor, looks
at this and then thinks,

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.840
we can't raise the
price high enough,

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.720
we won't sell any copies.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.260
We have to split this in two.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.930
Everybody looked at Hammer and
found no place for it to split.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:45.320
So Bob looks at "Lucifer's
Hammer," with intent to cut it,

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.320
and he couldn't spare a word.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:53.180
We'd already done our cutting
according to all his tenets.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.130
Eventually they raised the
price to something unreasonable,

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.454
and you guys all paid it.

00:25:00.712 --> 00:25:02.420
GREGORY BENFORD: That
was when I realized

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:06.140
that there should
be software called,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.070
for example, Anti-adjective.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.270
You take a given text,
it goes through it,

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.930
takes out all the adjectives.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:13.550
Right?

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:18.124
And then the obvious second
product is Anti-adverb.

00:25:18.124 --> 00:25:19.790
LARRY NIVEN: I remember
a story in which

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:23.320
it was sort of a
magical salt shaker.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.344
You'd hold it like that, and
the adjectives would all go.

00:25:28.344 --> 00:25:29.760
You want it in a
woman's magazine,

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.792
you hold it like this, and
the adjectives all come back.

00:25:32.792 --> 00:25:33.750
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.250
Right.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:36.050
Well, if you're a
romance novelist,

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.160
you just write the bare text,
and then Adjective Adder

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.930
comes in and makes the
right selections for you.

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:47.470
And Adverb Adder, saves all
that typing, and thinking.

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.250
Because it's a romance novel.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:51.980
LARRY NIVEN: What else
did I say about writers?

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.690
BORIS DEBIC: What else
did you say about writers.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:58.135
Writers who write for other
writers should write letters.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.690
Never be embarrassed or
ashamed about anything

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:06.400
you choose to write.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.710
Think of this before
you send it to market.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.505
Stories to end all
stories in a given topic.

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:14.005
Don't.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:21.380
If you have nothing to say,
say it anyway you like.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.630
Stylistic innovations,
contorted story lines, or none,

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.170
exotic or genderless pronouns,
internal inconsistencies,

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:33.560
the recipe for preparing your
lover as a cannibal banquet,

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.005
feel free.

00:26:35.005 --> 00:26:38.330
If what you have to say
is important and difficult

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.210
to follow, use the
simplest language possible.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:45.134
If the reader doesn't get it
then, let it not be your fault.

00:26:45.134 --> 00:26:46.050
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.810
That's a very good rule.

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:51.130
There's another one that
I kind of feel about,

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:56.420
and that is that you should
not use unreliable narrators

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.870
in science fiction,
because it's already

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:02.530
straining credulity
of most of the public.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:05.780
But if you want to have the
point-of-view character lying

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:10.420
to the reader, you're
really taking huge risks.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.120
I mean, the first
time you find out

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.290
that the narrative voice
tells you something

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:18.070
that it knew was a lie,
there's a powerful tendency

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.644
to throw it against the wall
and see if the spine will crack.

00:27:21.644 --> 00:27:23.185
And if you're strong
enough, it will.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.505
BORIS DEBIC: And last rule,
everybody talks first draft.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.420
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.870
What you're hearing
here, if it gets quoted,

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.620
it'll embarrass us
the rest of our lives.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.410
Keep that in mind.

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.340
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah, life
is lived in first draft.

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.840
BORIS DEBIC: Why
don't we open it up

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.405
for some questions
from the audience?

00:27:46.405 --> 00:27:48.280
AUDIENCE: Basically, so
science fiction often

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.950
results, as the books you
were just talking about do,

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.390
around introducing
new technologies,

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.800
and seeing how the people in the
societies interact with that.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.800
Something that I think a
lot of people at Google

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.480
might find interesting, but a
lot of people don't know about,

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.700
and if you're comfortable
talking about it,

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.390
is SIGMA, the group where
you guys were proposing

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:09.896
interesting ideas and thoughts,
as a bit of a think tank.

00:28:09.896 --> 00:28:11.270
Are there any
interesting stories

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.490
you can share about
that, or thoughts you

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:18.374
have on that group, and the
things that came out of it?

00:28:18.374 --> 00:28:19.790
GREGORY BENFORD:
It's about SIGMA,

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:22.160
which is a group
of SF writers who

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.650
will think for spare change.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:30.840
And we advise people, like
Department of Defense.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.300
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah, there
are science fiction writers

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.210
who won't work with
the government,

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:36.930
because that's their attitude.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.270
There are some who will.

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:42.400
And a lot of us
have joined SIGMA.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:49.270
SIGMA will work with anybody,
will work with the government.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:51.365
They don't work with terrorists.

00:28:51.365 --> 00:28:52.240
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.760
And we named it that because
you know, in mathematics,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:57.350
sigma stands for sum.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.670
We sum it up.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:02.510
People who want you
to think forward

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.680
on a scale of say,
10 years, 20 years.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.854
It's what we're used to doing in
bureaucracies, largely or not.

00:29:09.854 --> 00:29:11.770
And it leads to many
interesting interactions.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.350
I'll never forget-- you were
there, I think, at this.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.680
At one of the CIA
hotels in the DC area,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:24.820
we had a sealed room,
electronically isolated.

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.440
Because it was a bunch
of classified stuff.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:29.420
And the FBI and the
CIA were present,

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:31.150
and I'd never realized
until that moment

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.750
how much they hated each other.

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:37.680
I mean the room was
alive with tension.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.050
And I'm glad nobody
could communicate out,

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:44.870
because it was
disturbing, really, to see

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.370
how they contested everything.

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.550
That's one of the things
they didn't mean to reveal,

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:52.110
but we picked up
on it right away.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.420
LARRY NIVEN: And I never
noticed any of that.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.410
I got some blind spots.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.880
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.720
You learn some things
from this interaction,

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.350
particularly that
the government really

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:08.890
does not take long
views of some subjects,

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.550
because it's hard to do.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.500
You know this at Google, you're
thinking long on all kinds

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.690
of axes that other people don't.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.570
And that's why they
call in consultants

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.970
who they can believe or not.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.210
AUDIENCE: As you're working
through this project,

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.630
do you have any other ideas
in the back of your mind

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:32.400
that you'd be interested in
exploring with future stories?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.920
LARRY NIVEN: Not then.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.420
Whatever we had, we use.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.590
It took us about three
years once we got going,

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.100
but we had several
years ahead of that

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.220
to play with these notions.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.720
Whatever came up,
we worked it in.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.730
But since we
published the books,

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:59.680
since we turned in "Shipstar,"
we've been thinking.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.890
There are avenues available,
and we don't want to write them.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:06.950
We want to persuade other
people to write them.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.820
We'd like to put
together an anthology

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.469
of "Shipstar" stories,
"Bowl of Heaven" stories.

00:31:13.469 --> 00:31:16.010
GREGORY BENFORD: There are a
lot of things we left unexplored

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:20.210
just because there's
so many implications.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:24.910
For example, who's sending
the gravitational waves

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.360
which apparently have
messages in them,

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.590
from the target star,
which we call Glory?

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:33.840
I mean, what's that about?

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.530
We actually don't deal with
that a lot in the book,

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.380
and so it's an open door.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.810
People can walk through it.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:45.240
But there are many other
things that are puzzles.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:48.162
Like, how do all these
species interact?

00:31:48.162 --> 00:31:51.200
There are a lot of
intelligent alien species,

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.900
and they tend to be
specialized in what they do.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.190
So how does that society work?

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:04.350
What was the basic idea of
the "Bowl of Heaven" anyway?

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.160
To build an enormous
contraption and then sail around

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.980
the galaxy.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.720
It's like an
enormous cruise ship.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.290
But who thinks on a time
scale of millions of years?

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:17.430
I mean, in a way, it's a way
of thinking about ourselves.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.720
Because this society,
this civilization

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.700
is 10,000 or so years old.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.360
What happens when you're
millions of years old?

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.120
What kind of structure
does that require, in order

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.740
to not collapse and dissolve,
as so many of our civilizations

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:34.560
have?

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.770
And so, what about
a galaxy, which

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.280
has been around a long
time, 10 billion years.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.530
And we're the latest arrivals.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:46.340
Most of the stars in the
galaxy are older than we are.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:50.710
What kind of society does
it take to last a long time?

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.490
Because we should
think about that,

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.940
because we got the same problem.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.320
LARRY NIVEN: As
slow as the Bowl is,

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:03.020
it has not explored
very much of the galaxy.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:08.570
We are likely to find faster,
older aliens somewhere out

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.145
there.

00:33:09.145 --> 00:33:10.061
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:33:10.061 --> 00:33:12.875
LARRY NIVEN: We'll toss that
into the list of questions

00:33:12.875 --> 00:33:14.724
available to other authors.

00:33:14.724 --> 00:33:16.140
GREGORY BENFORD:
And that comes up

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.600
in "Shipstar," that there
are other such societies.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.150
And they're cruising around too.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:26.210
They may not be built this
way, but they're there

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:30.290
to exchange really long term
information, about what's

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:34.490
going on in the galaxy,
about possible problems,

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:38.320
or newly emergent species
that have to be dealt with,

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.675
things like that.

00:33:39.675 --> 00:33:41.050
LARRY NIVEN: Greg
and I have both

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:46.310
been working with alien
communications and aliens

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.830
for a long time.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:54.340
Greg's got a library buildup
of aliens who can't travel,

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.980
but who can send information.

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.190
I've got the Dracula
tavern, which

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.000
is aliens gathering on Earth,
in slower than light ships.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.250
GREGORY BENFORD: Pardon, what?

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.929
AUDIENCE: The galaxy itself
is a Big Dumb Object.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.179
GREGORY BENFORD: Well the
galaxy is a Big Dumb Object.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:12.690
Yeah.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:16.531
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah,
OK I'll buy that.

00:34:16.531 --> 00:34:18.280
GREGORY BENFORD: I
mean bad things happen.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.060
Supernovae go off, destroy
whole civilizations.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.560
Yeah.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.020
LARRY NIVEN: In hundreds
of billions of years,

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.010
we may find that Big Dumb
Object is an artifact.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:36.250
The galaxy's been reshaped.

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.739
It'll probably
still be ship stable

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:42.159
because you don't want
to ship it unstable.

00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:43.960
AUDIENCE: So Mr.
Niven, I grew up

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.440
loving and devouring your books.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.969
And you've both been
writing for quite awhile.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.480
And over that time,
technology has advanced a lot.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.210
But you're writing about things
that are so far in the future,

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.460
that today's differences
in technology

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.260
don't make much difference.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.360
I'm curious how you feel your
writing process is different

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.315
now that there's
so much advances

00:35:05.315 --> 00:35:06.481
in technology we know about.

00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:09.120
LARRY NIVEN: I've
been using one rule.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.960
Actually, I've been
using a lot of rules.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.310
Here's one for free.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:22.260
You look at what humankind
or any intelligent being

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:26.750
will want and need, and you try
to guess what it'll look like.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.970
There are ultimates.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.450
You want instant communication.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.490
You probably can't
exceed light speed,

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:39.430
but instant communication,
we've already got.

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.360
We want instant learning.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.600
That's a tough one.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.640
It's got some drawbacks.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.220
That we can play with.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.405
We've always wanted
to drive faster.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:57.480
The better your
vehicle is, the quicker

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.700
you can get to
where you're going.

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.770
Try to guess what the
ultimates will be,

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.845
and you've got a story.

00:36:08.845 --> 00:36:10.720
BORIS DEBIC: That's the
advice of technology.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:16.250
But what, for example, of
the speeding up of evolution?

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.190
And how do you
speed up evolution

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:22.300
if you-- let's say your
cortex material grows up

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.430
in complexity?

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:24.250
Can you do that?

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:30.620
Or are there different paths
of evolution in 10 million

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.880
or billions of
years in the future?

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:40.120
GREGORY BENFORD: Well remember,
we got this astonishingly smart

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.200
cerebral cortex for some
kind of evolutionary reason,

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.430
and many biologists
are rather puzzled

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.310
by why we're so
good at things that

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.970
don't seem to have
any real application

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:52.420
way back there in
the plains of Africa.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.770
And it is kind of mysterious.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:57.880
I mean, it's hard to believe
that all of mathematics

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.280
was opened up by our ability
to essentially understand

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:06.369
plane geometry and the
trajectory of thrown spears.

00:37:06.369 --> 00:37:08.160
It's a big leap from
saying, well you know,

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.800
I want to hit this thing.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.470
Once upon a time,
there was a primate

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.040
that threw a rock after
something it wanted to kill.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.850
And it saw it as a kind
of a complicated process.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.540
Those genes aren't
with us anymore.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:25.060
The primate that said, hey
that's a beautiful parabola.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.900
We got those genes.

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.100
So we got some
kind of selection,

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.315
and that's what leads to the
aesthetic sense of mathematics.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:40.960
Dirac, who invented the electron
positron idea, and all that.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.220
Great mathematical
physicist, said that,

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.700
to be a convincing
physical law, it

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.580
must be capable of
beautiful expression.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.100
And if it's beautiful,
it will be true.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.330
And he was a guided by that.

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:55.694
I asked him, if it
really was important.

00:37:55.694 --> 00:37:56.860
And he said, yeah of course.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:57.990
I mean what other
guide do we have?

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.120
There are many choices.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.940
But choose the beautiful.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.560
That's deeply embedded
in the genome.

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.660
And it got that way by something
that happened a long time ago.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.570
And it's still at work.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.650
I mean, the species is still
getting lots better at things.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:17.330
And it is kind of a puzzle,
why we're so good at this.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.010
And yet we can't communicate
with the dolphins and whales

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.890
very well.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.460
LARRY NIVEN: I would
go with machines.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.310
The next stages of
evolution, we'll

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:31.480
be building machines to do
our thinking for us better.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:40.930
I can't see that our brains
are going to get much better.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:43.100
There's no room in there.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.290
No room in the skull.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:46.300
No room in a woman's womb.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:54.670
I see no end to being
able to build machines

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:58.670
to do our thinking for us, and
help us with our own thinking.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:04.330
We may wind up as a combination
of human and machine.

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:06.175
We may wind up with
just the machine.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.750
Stories point in all directions.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:13.700
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:14.650
Yeah, that's true.

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:15.610
Machine intelligence.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.770
But remember, when they did
the autopsy on Einstein,

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.900
and preserved his
brain by the way,

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.800
they found that the brain
had enormous corrugation

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.660
in the cerebral cortex,
much more than most people.

00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:31.860
And that's related somehow to
the complexity of the wiring

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:32.880
diagram.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.240
So that's the way
we've been proceeding.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.300
We're not getting
bigger brains, but we're

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.500
getting better somehow.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:45.440
The only way to really increase
intelligence in a species

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.050
is to-- and speedily--
is to do it artificially.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.010
But we're doing
that all the time.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.680
There was a study
of the children

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:55.330
of the people in the New
Mexico town of Los Alamos that

00:39:55.330 --> 00:40:00.870
found first, that indeed, about
50 percent of intelligence

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:01.810
is inheritable.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:03.850
I'm an identical twin,
and the other part

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:08.380
of the research that shows that
is also from identical twins.

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:12.050
The trick is to see
that, so far there's

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:13.990
this reversion to the mean.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:17.620
You got two really
smart parents,

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.430
the average intelligence
of their children

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:24.860
will be closer to the
lower intelligent parent

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.990
than to the upper.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:28.010
There's a return to the mean.

00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:30.750
But that emerges from the fact
that it's a complex property,

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.990
and you change some things,
and for the most part

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.170
it'll help you.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:39.850
But there's always this
convergent toward the average,

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.570
because it's a complex system.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:44.400
Nonetheless, you can still
get a lot of smart people

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.750
in places like say, Palo Alto.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.870
Or Mountain View.

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.410
Flattering a local crowd.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.910
LARRY NIVEN: You guys didn't
happen here by accident,

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.290
you were gathered.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.730
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:41:01.182
LARRY NIVEN: You can fight the
odds by intelligent design.

00:41:01.182 --> 00:41:02.140
GREGORY BENFORD: Right.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:03.390
Social selection.

00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:05.280
So you're going
to mate together,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.490
with foreseeable consequences.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.750
And that's how you get
differences in society,

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:13.600
is the simple self selection
of courtship, for example.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.710
So you put a lot of
smart people in a room,

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.800
you're going to get
some smart descendants.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.720
And so now you understand
the secret purpose of Google.

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.430
That's right.

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.650
It's all about
just getting laid.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:30.180
AUDIENCE: But one thing always
bothered me a little bit.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.690
And it was, I think in "The
Ringworld" and other stories,

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:37.195
these productive
lotteries, in which

00:41:37.195 --> 00:41:42.350
you suggest the human race
was breeding for luck.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.780
And that seemed a rather
unscientific concept to me.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:49.230
So I was wondering how
you justify mixing it

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:52.240
with strongly
scientific concepts.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.680
LARRY NIVEN: You
had to be there.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:42:00.290
That is, if you're my age,
then during the Golden Age,

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:03.010
you were reading stories
about psychic powers.

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:06.980
"Analog" was full of stories
about psychic powers,

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.147
probably because
Campbell was a believer.

00:42:10.147 --> 00:42:10.980
Campbell the editor.

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.700
I had been inundated with
stories of psychic powers.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:25.760
I read a few myself, trying
to use the assumptions

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.370
for hard fantasy stories.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:35.260
Gil the Arm, for instance,
with his imaginary arm

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:43.840
that's TK and ESP, but
limited by his imagination.

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:53.060
Then I finally got to thinking
that the ultimate psychic power

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.230
would be pure author control.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:00.950
Teela Brown is pure
author control.

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:03.300
I called it luck.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.790
To Louie Wu, of
course, it is luck.

00:43:05.790 --> 00:43:07.700
But you know the difference.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:09.910
And as soon as I
was able to expose

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:13.184
that that was what was going
on, I got her off stage fast.

00:43:13.184 --> 00:43:14.100
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:15.930
Right.

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:19.800
Actually there's
maybe a new rule here.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.280
Something like, if you
don't know how it works,

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:24.950
it always looks like magic.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:27.360
As soon as you explain
it, it ceases to be.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.430
LARRY NIVEN: Yes.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:31.590
So I've blown the
whole thing for you.

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:32.760
Sorry about that.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.300
GREGORY BENFORD: Well it kind
of intersects Clark's law.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:40.030
Any sufficiently advanced
technology looks like magic.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:43.820
I did a reversal
of that by the way,

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.890
when I was visiting
Arthur in Sri Lanka.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:52.660
And it says, any technology
that does not appear magical

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:53.930
is insufficiently advanced.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.410
Actually that could be the
motto of Google, really.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:08.400
AUDIENCE: So as
science fiction authors

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.900
who've been writing
for a long time,

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.025
you've seen some of the
assumptions of your stories

00:44:12.025 --> 00:44:16.220
broken, either by scientific
discoveries or MIT physics

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:16.950
students.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.240
So has that affected
how you write?

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.740
GREGORY BENFORD:
Things have changed

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.360
in physics and other sciences.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:26.640
And so some of our stories may
be obsolete now, or mistaken.

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.520
So has that changed
the way we write?

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.170
No.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:30.920
Because we're actually
not any better

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.650
at predicting the
future than most people.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:34.200
But--

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:37.460
LARRY NIVEN: After all, we
took this chance deliberately.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.300
When we decided to write science
fiction rather than fantasy,

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.590
when we decided to
predict a future,

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.800
we knew we could be
obsolete rapidly.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:55.190
The fastest a story of
mine ever became obsolete

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.395
was my first one.

00:44:56.395 --> 00:44:58.840
Where they looked
into Mercury and found

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:03.450
that it wasn't geosynchronous.

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:08.242
It was spinning one and a half
times as fast as its year.

00:45:08.242 --> 00:45:10.840
BORIS DEBIC: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:15.640
LARRY NIVEN: Nearly the fastest
was "Lucifer's Hammer," where

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:21.660
you're looking at a 1975
future in which the Earth gets

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:25.820
hit with a comet, and a big one.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.670
We knew that was
going to be obsolete.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:32.240
We hoped we were writing a best
seller that would sell hundreds

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:37.310
of millions of copies
before it became obsolete.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:39.830
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah,
and before the comet hits.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:44.260
LARRY NIVEN: It is just amazing
how well "Lucifer's Hammer"

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.090
is selling now, given
it's 40 years in the past.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:49.040
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:54.937
LARRY NIVEN: It's a
historical disaster novel.

00:45:54.937 --> 00:45:56.520
AUDIENCE: So a lot
of us here actually

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.260
end up having to write
those maintenance chapters.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.710
Any advice on those pieces
that you skipped out on?

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.660
How should we be-- we're kind
of trying to take smart objects

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.700
and make them look
dumb to people,

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.280
so they can have the fun
parts of it happen to them.

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.980
How do we go about
maintaining these?

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.790
Have you thought of fun
failure cases of like,

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:19.830
it's invisible to the
people in the environment,

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.455
but the designers
probably have to deal

00:46:21.455 --> 00:46:23.576
with this whole
other mess of stuff.

00:46:23.576 --> 00:46:24.810
What do we do?

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:26.360
GREGORY BENFORD:
You know, stories

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:31.070
are about people under stress.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:33.060
People who don't
have any problems

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:34.610
don't get written about.

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:35.660
Because they're boring.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.560
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.530
GREGORY BENFORD:
So the clue to how

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:45.050
to construct a narrative
about some technological idea,

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:48.930
or a new invention,
or change in society

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:52.770
is to say, who does this hurt?

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:54.350
Who's going to be
worried by this,

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:57.560
or bothered, or defeated by it?

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.260
That person should be
the center of your story,

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.750
and then this person has
to understand the problem

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:04.100
and get through it.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.350
That gives you the plot arc.

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:08.230
I learned that long
ago from James Blish,

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:10.680
as a matter of
fact, who said, look

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.530
for the person who
has the most at risk.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:18.260
And that'll take you right
to the center of the story.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:22.580
And from my point
of view, your goal

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:25.530
should always be to
write a sentence that

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.930
makes it impossible to not
read the next sentence.

00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:31.444
Put that sentence first.

00:47:31.444 --> 00:47:33.610
Try to make it work all the
way through a paragraph.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:38.090
If you can get a reader
to read a whole paragraph,

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.170
and still want to read
the second paragraph,

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.250
then you're on your way.

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:47.300
And the reader will give
up the voyage to you

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.630
and then you're in charge.

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.225
But you've got to
hook them first.

00:47:50.225 --> 00:47:51.600
And the hook had
better be sharp.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:57.590
LARRY NIVEN: This matter of the
protagonist being the one who

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:00.540
gets hurt, I learned if
from Theodore Sturgeon,

00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.810
and I used it to
write "Flash Crowd."

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:04.600
I had lists.

00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:08.670
One, what do I expect to be
the result of teleportation

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.930
being invented about now.

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.210
And two, who gets hurt?

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.170
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.480
LARRY NIVEN: And
it was all either

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.630
Jerryberry Jansen, or his
father, who guessed wrong

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:23.980
and lost it all on
the stock exchanges.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.490
GREGORY BENFORD:
Yeah, and that's

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:27.070
a very good example
of a prediction,

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:29.560
because Larry wrote that
about teleportation,

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:30.940
and invented technology.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:33.950
But what the era of
cell phones has done,

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:36.870
is to allow people say
in China, particularly,

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:38.046
to create flash crowds.

00:48:38.046 --> 00:48:40.420
Everybody agrees they're going
to be there, they show up,

00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:42.770
they do a protest, they
disperse, they're gone.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:45.300
Didn't take teleportation,
it took cell phones.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:49.190
But the flash crowd is a
known political phenomena

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:50.200
everywhere now.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.430
But it's particularly being
used by revolutionary groups.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:55.770
It was a big role
in the Arab Spring.

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:57.540
And it was all there
in a science fiction

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.137
story all along.

00:48:59.137 --> 00:49:00.470
LARRY NIVEN: Cleverly disguised.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.449
GREGORY BENFORD: Yes.

00:49:01.449 --> 00:49:02.990
AUDIENCE: The older
I get, the more I

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:07.180
tend to reflect on how the
world has changed around me,

00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.930
and how I feel
about those changes.

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:13.860
As people who imagine
what technology

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.530
will look like in
the future, I'm

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:19.750
curious if you have any
thoughts about how technology

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:24.370
has evolved over your career,
whether you're disappointed,

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:30.130
inspired, bored, and how humans
interact with technology.

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:33.660
LARRY NIVEN: Every so often
I find myself saying, welcome

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:36.750
to the future.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:40.530
Every so often, it just
hits me in the face.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:42.700
Things didn't used
to be this way.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:43.616
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:49:43.616 --> 00:49:48.040
You know the most qualitative
thing I could speak on

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.560
is, that when I was growing up,
and having my gee whiz moments,

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.319
it was about space
travel and transport.

00:49:54.319 --> 00:49:56.360
And that was sort of the
theme of science fiction

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.230
in the first half
of the 20th century.

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:01.570
But in the second half,
it's been about information,

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:02.370
more and more.

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:04.870
Your industry.

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:07.040
We've kind of reached
the limit on how fast you

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.710
can go in the atmosphere,
for awhile anyway.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:13.750
But the flight of information
is speed of light.

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:18.110
And so it's hard to get
the feel of a phase shift

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:21.170
in technologies, from analog
to digital, for example.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:23.792
And from hardware to software.

00:50:23.792 --> 00:50:26.250
And so you always wonder what's
going to be the next thing.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:31.550
And I actually published a cover
story in the magazine "Reason"

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:35.350
in 1997 called, "The
Biological Century" saying

00:50:35.350 --> 00:50:37.230
the biggest motivating
stuff that's

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:39.880
going to make the world look
different in the 21st century

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.350
is going to come from
biology, not physics.

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:46.170
And it's going to be biological
engineering of the kinds that

00:50:46.170 --> 00:50:48.940
are kind of hard to anticipate.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.820
I expect they will
mostly center around

00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.330
human reproduction at first.

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:55.910
I mean, what are the boundaries
on designer children,

00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:58.510
for example.

00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:59.990
I was at a conference
just recently

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.980
at Arizona State University
about what the century's going

00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:06.110
to look like, and I said
there's an argument about,

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:10.380
should you be able to select
for blue eyes, or blond hair,

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:11.510
or something like that?

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:12.380
Well maybe.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:16.710
But what about the
editing out of qualities?

00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:18.862
I mean, there's a bell
curve in intelligence.

00:51:18.862 --> 00:51:21.070
And everybody talks about,
let's make smarter people.

00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:23.610
Let's work on the upper
end of the bell curve.

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:25.186
What about the lower end?

00:51:25.186 --> 00:51:27.510
Do you want to edit
out the people who

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.710
were born with very,
very low intelligence?

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:32.760
Because they-- we know from
research they typically

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.240
don't have particularly
happy lives.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.345
Do you want to edit them out?

00:51:37.345 --> 00:51:40.740
Do you want to tinker with the
bell curve on the other side?

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.140
That's an interesting question.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.500
I don't have a belief about it.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.400
But it's going to
come up, because we're

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.550
going to figure some things out.

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:51.590
LARRY NIVEN: Making
the dumb humans smarter

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:56.240
might be easier than making
the smart ones smarter.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.360
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:02.210
LARRY NIVEN: We
could change the vote

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:06.080
in this country
within a generation

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:11.330
if every voter would
do his homework.

00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:14.630
I do not know what
the result would be.

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:17.285
People who make this
prediction are generally wrong.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:24.140
BORIS DEBIC: Making people
smarter is what good books do.

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.430
Let me just remind the audience.

00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:28.250
GREGORY BENFORD:
That could be true.

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:31.210
You know, as far as
voters go, isn't it easier

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:34.630
to persuade your
enemies to not vote?

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:35.690
LARRY NIVEN: Yeah.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:37.648
GREGORY BENFORD: Yeah,
give them something else

00:52:37.648 --> 00:52:42.144
to do like, say,
"Game of Thrones."

00:52:42.144 --> 00:52:44.645
Well that was catty,
because Railroad Martin's

00:52:44.645 --> 00:52:46.020
an old friend of
ours, but still.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:50.890
BORIS DEBIC: Let me get back
to the book a little bit.

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:57.050
So, as I said earlier, this is
the sequel to "Bowl of Heaven."

00:52:57.050 --> 00:53:02.230
And if you think that
science fiction is looking

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:05.790
for life on Mars,
or on Europa, you

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:09.440
may be wrong, because
this is science fiction.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.280
This is millions of
years into the future.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:16.970
And really strange
possibilities so to speak.

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:23.650
So going back to "Shipstar,"
which I haven't read yet,

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:27.110
can you tell me what are
the few points that you're

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:32.900
really proud of
exploring in the sequel?

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:37.340
LARRY NIVEN: They weren't
my-- well, they were.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:42.360
The coal mines that
came from the comets,

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.830
you're going to find them living
on the backside of the Bowl.

00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:47.640
Greg put them there.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:57.590
I have explored helium
2-flavored aliens

00:53:57.590 --> 00:53:59.490
since a long time ago.

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:07.040
Greg came up exactly
with the plasma creatures

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.105
living in the sun itself.

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:13.930
Guiding the flare.

00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:20.850
I'm reluctant to keep
exposing secrets to you,

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:23.740
but in fact, I think
you'll enjoy the book even

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.320
if you see something coming.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.290
GREGORY BENFORD:
Yeah, one hopes.

00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:30.947
I mean, part of this
whole strategy was to say,

00:54:30.947 --> 00:54:32.030
here's this object, right?

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:33.821
You can see all this,
and you can see that.

00:54:33.821 --> 00:54:36.760
But lots of it is not explained.

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.780
And so we just let it sit there.

00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:41.690
I mean, and the slide's showing
you the whole configuration.

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:44.090
There are all kinds
of puzzles there.

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:47.110
But most people would look
at it and sort of accept it.

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:50.170
But our job was to try to
figure out how it worked.

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:51.870
Post facto, as a matter of fact.

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:54.500
I mean, we didn't have these
ideas when we started out.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.530
We just invented them as
ways to make it plausible.

00:54:57.530 --> 00:55:02.460
Like, hey, half the surface area
of the bowl is on the outside.

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.490
What are you going
to do with it?

00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:06.360
BORIS DEBIC: Well
with that, I would

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.090
like to thank our guests today.

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:10.070
Larry Niven and Gregory Benford.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:12.170
Please give them a hand.

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:15.820
[APPLAUSE]
