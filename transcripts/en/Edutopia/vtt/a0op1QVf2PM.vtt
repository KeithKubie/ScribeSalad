00:00:00.471 --> 00:00:03.387
(students talking)

00:00:03.387 --> 00:00:05.045
- I got you there.

00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:07.962
(students talking)

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.629
(student laughs)

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.270
- We use a social context
to learn about the world.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.960
We learn from others by watching
what they're interested in,

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.060
and we learn by collaborating with them

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.030
and discovering their ideas.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.700
When I went to school, all
the desks faced forward,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.080
theater seating, and the
teacher was at the front.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.440
And learning was thought
of as a one-way street

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.740
between the teacher and the
vessels, we were the vessels.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.630
Pour in the information, and
everything's gonna be good.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.990
But not we realize that learning
has to be more interactive,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.400
and this notion that interactivity comes

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.220
from a social context.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.900
So what does that say about classrooms?

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.450
It says that kids ought
to face one another,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.180
that circles, or U-shaped,
or anything that gets kids

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.830
looking at one another,
interacting with one another.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.100
Also, classrooms that allow
kids to move and regroup,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.930
that they come together in
larger groups facing each other.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.150
They come together in small
groups facing each other.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.730
They work one on one.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.180
Anytime in which students
have access to one another

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.260
and are allowed and
encouraged to move and act

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.640
on the knowledge, and create
together, co-create, co-design,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.380
that's the classroom that
will be more successful

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.490
than the face-forward,
one-way street that many

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.490
of us experienced when we were children.
