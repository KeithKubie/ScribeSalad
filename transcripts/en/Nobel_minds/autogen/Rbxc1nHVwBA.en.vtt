00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 align:start position:0%
think there are jobs that are
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
think there are jobs that are
stereotypically<00:00:14.910><c> women</c><00:00:15.210><c> jobs</c><00:00:15.450><c> and</c><00:00:15.690><c> I</c><00:00:15.750><c> don't</c>

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 align:start position:0%
stereotypically women jobs and I don't
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.150 align:start position:0%
stereotypically women jobs and I don't
see<00:00:16.049><c> any</c><00:00:16.170><c> reason</c><00:00:16.410><c> that</c><00:00:16.500><c> men</c><00:00:16.710><c> shouldn't</c><00:00:16.949><c> do</c>

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
see any reason that men shouldn't do
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.769 align:start position:0%
see any reason that men shouldn't do
those<00:00:17.400><c> I</c><00:00:17.640><c> don't</c><00:00:17.699><c> think</c><00:00:18.090><c> women</c><00:00:18.300><c> are</c><00:00:18.539><c> more</c>

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 align:start position:0%
those I don't think women are more
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
those I don't think women are more
caring<00:00:19.199><c> than</c><00:00:19.230><c> men</c><00:00:19.560><c> and</c><00:00:19.740><c> yet</c><00:00:19.920><c> we</c><00:00:20.070><c> hear</c><00:00:20.430><c> you</c><00:00:20.939><c> know</c>

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 align:start position:0%
caring than men and yet we hear you know
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.870 align:start position:0%
caring than men and yet we hear you know
so<00:00:21.539><c> many</c><00:00:21.720><c> jobs</c><00:00:22.380><c> are</c><00:00:22.560><c> for</c><00:00:22.740><c> women</c><00:00:23.580><c> because</c>

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
so many jobs are for women because
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.340 align:start position:0%
so many jobs are for women because
they're<00:00:24.060><c> the</c><00:00:24.180><c> more</c><00:00:24.330><c> nurturing</c><00:00:24.570><c> I</c><00:00:24.930><c> think</c>

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 align:start position:0%
they're the more nurturing I think
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.140 align:start position:0%
they're the more nurturing I think
that's<00:00:25.529><c> just</c><00:00:26.220><c> as</c><00:00:26.340><c> wrong</c><00:00:26.490><c> on</c><00:00:26.670><c> the</c><00:00:26.760><c> other</c><00:00:26.789><c> side</c>

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 align:start position:0%
that's just as wrong on the other side
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.859 align:start position:0%
that's just as wrong on the other side
so<00:00:27.720><c> I</c><00:00:27.750><c> think</c><00:00:27.990><c> every</c><00:00:28.650><c> person</c><00:00:28.890><c> should</c><00:00:29.519><c> be</c>

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 align:start position:0%
so I think every person should be
 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.260 align:start position:0%
so I think every person should be
exposed<00:00:30.869><c> to</c><00:00:31.560><c> every</c><00:00:32.070><c> type</c><00:00:32.279><c> of</c><00:00:32.309><c> field</c><00:00:32.700><c> and</c><00:00:32.969><c> find</c>

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 align:start position:0%
exposed to every type of field and find
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.490 align:start position:0%
exposed to every type of field and find
out<00:00:33.420><c> what</c><00:00:33.540><c> they're</c><00:00:33.660><c> good</c><00:00:33.809><c> at</c><00:00:33.840><c> and</c><00:00:34.200><c> everybody</c>

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
out what they're good at and everybody
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
out what they're good at and everybody
should<00:00:34.800><c> get</c><00:00:34.860><c> to</c><00:00:35.010><c> do</c><00:00:35.130><c> with</c><00:00:35.250><c> their</c><00:00:35.460><c> they're</c><00:00:35.910><c> good</c>

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 align:start position:0%
should get to do with their they're good
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.210 align:start position:0%
should get to do with their they're good
at<00:00:36.210><c> on</c><00:00:36.300><c> what</c><00:00:36.420><c> they</c><00:00:36.510><c> love</c><00:00:36.690><c> to</c><00:00:36.719><c> do</c>
