00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.365
Now we can work on the triple
integral part of our problem

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.600
or our proof, this
right over here.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.760
And so I can rewrite that.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.880
So this is the triple integral
over our region, which

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.491
we're assuming is a type I
region, of the partial of R

00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:19.490
with respect to Z, which
we can write like this.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.410
It doesn't matter.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.570
Partial of r with
respect to do z.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.080
And I'll dV.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.840
And we can rewrite
this as-- we can

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.840
assume we're going to integrate
with respect to Z first.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.657
So I'm going to integrate
with respect to Z.

00:00:34.657 --> 00:00:35.990
Let me do that in another color.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.670
I'm going integrate
with respect to Z first.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.890
The lower bound on Z in our
type I region, the lower bound

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.880
is f1.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.260
The upper bound is f2.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.084
So we're going to integrate
from f1 of x, y to f2 of x, y.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.030
And I'm going to integrate the
partial of R with respect to Z.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.000
So let me do that in
that same yellow color--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.430
partial of R with respect to Z.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.270
And then I have
dZ, and then I'll

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.020
have to integrate with respect
to y and x or with respect

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.770
to x and y.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.940
So it's dx dy or dy dz.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.084
I can just write that as dA.

00:01:18.084 --> 00:01:19.500
So what you could
think of it-- we

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.650
can evaluate the yellow part.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.858
And then we're just going
to take the double integral

00:01:22.858 --> 00:01:25.070
over the x, y domain.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.270
So this is just going to
be over the x, y domain.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.680
Let me put some
brackets here just

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.130
to make it clear what
we're going to do.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.800
So all we're doing is we're
integrating with respect to Z

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.529
first, and we have
the bounds there.

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:39.070
Well, this is pretty
straightforward.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.980
This is all going to
be equal to-- I'll

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.790
write the outside first--
the double integral

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.570
over the domain.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.750
And I have the dA
right over here.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.490
Actually, let me give myself
some real estate-- dA.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.425
Well, what's the
antiderivative of this?

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:57.676
This is just R, and this
is just R, or R of x, y,

00:01:57.676 --> 00:02:01.870
z evaluated when Z is
f1-- or when Z is f2.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.890
And from that, we
evaluate when Z is f1.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.104
So this is just going
to be R of x, y and z,

00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:08.770
and we evaluate when
Z is equal to that.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.430
And from that, we subtract
when Z is equal to that.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.185
So that's going to be
equal to-- so R of x, y

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:24.660
z evaluated when Z is equal to
that is R of x, y, f2 of x, y.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.480
And from that, we
need to subtract R

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.540
when Z is this-- minus
R of x, y f1 of x, y,

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.825
and then make sure that
we got our parentheses.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.480
Now, this is exactly what
we saw in the last video.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.850
It is exactly that, which shows
that this is exactly this.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.080
So when we assumed it
was a type I region,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.760
we got that this is
exactly equal to this.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.630
You do the exact same argument
with the type II region

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.950
to show that this is equal
to this, type III region

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.020
to show this is equal
to that, and you

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.710
have your divergence
theorem proved.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.590
And we can consider
ourselves done.
