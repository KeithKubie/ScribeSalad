00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.373
 - A hood pass is permission to
 move in and around the hood.

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:10.276
I feel like I sorta got
one, but not a full one,

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.414 align:start position:0%
  so today is all about
  getting a full hood pass.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.682
 So I bring my boy BDot
 from North Carolina,

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:19.552
 and then I got my boy Martini,
 pretty boy model from Jersey.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.588 size:88% position:44%
 We hitted up one of my most
 hoodest friends, Stevie J.

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.823 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Hey why you (beep)s
 all huddled up

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.958 align:start size:88% position:13%
 on the couch, touching
 thighs and (beep)?

00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.661
 - I mean, I just didn't know
 what the seat arrangement was,

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.531 size:88% position:44%
  I didn't know if another
  homie was in the bathroom,

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.199
 or gonna come out or
 anything like that.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:37.437
 But listen, listen, break down
 to them what a hood pass is.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.738 size:88% position:44%
 - A hood pass is like this:

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:41.741
(beep) I'm vouching for
you (beep), you feel me?

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.811
 Anything you do is a
 representation of me.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.580 size:88% position:44%
  Don't do no weird (beep),
  don't do no buster (beep),

00:00:47.613 --> 00:00:50.349
don't do no hook (beep),
and you'll be straight.

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:51.951 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - How much is an
 eighth around here?

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:53.186
- Man--

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.153 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You'll get your
 ass whooped for that.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:55.555
- That's real specific.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:56.823 size:84% position:42%
  - What's your name again?

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.091
- B Dot.

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.625
 - B Dot, and you got
 chained that fast.

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:00.827
 Bro, the B Dot, (beep) that
 (beep) can get you shot, bro.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.762
 (all talking over each other)

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:03.596
 - What's your governed name?

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.597
 - Brian, Brian is my--

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.166 size:84% position:42%
  (talking over each other)

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:08.734 align:start position:0%
 - What about Martini,
 though, that's cool, right?

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:09.902
 That name Martini bro?

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:11.971 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - So you like getting
 drunk and shit?

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:13.873
 - I smoke, I'm not a drinker.

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:15.141 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Why the (beep)
 you're named Martini?

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:16.676
 - So your new name is Zig Zag.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.211 size:88% position:44%
  - Zig Zag.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.814
 - Take that weak ass bandana
 off your mother (beep) hat.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.983
- He did say something.

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:25.518 size:88% position:44%
 - What's your name,
 what is your name?

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.452 size:88% position:44%
  - Zig Zag.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:27.820
- No, no, no, what is your name?

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:29.789
- Oh, my name is Shawn.

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:33.192
 - Zig Zag, you gotta
 say Zig Zag correctly.

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:36.162
 You gotta be able to answer
 it under pressure and duress.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:39.031
 - My name is Baseball,
 anytime you say this

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:41.734 align:start position:0%
 it's like a code word,
 everything just kinda settles

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.437
 like "oh, he know
 the hummy, he cool."

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.473 size:88% position:44%
  But if you're in the area,
  and you say the nickname,

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.675 size:84% position:42%
  and that nickname
  doesn't register,

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:51.410 size:88% position:44%
 it can agitate some things.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:53.246 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What if somebody
else has your nickname?

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.814
 - Nobody else has my nickname.

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:56.782 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - In all of the
 hoods of Los Angeles?

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.651
 - Because that's my nickname.

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:01.287 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - So in a way, the
 nickname is the pass.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.023
Guys, I feel like we've
done put in our time,

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:06.759 align:start position:0%
 we've heard y'all out,
 we've digested it mentally,

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:10.130
 we deserve our hood
 passes, y'all agree?

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:13.299
 That's a yes, perfect.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:15.635
So now we've got Stevie
J and the hood pass.

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.571 size:88% position:44%
  We're doing everything I
  dreamed of as an adjacent,

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:20.473 align:start size:88% position:13%
  but now I'm having
  my hood moment.

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:22.842 size:88% position:44%
 (rap music)

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:28.948
 Mother (beep)ing donut
 shop, Slauson Donuts.

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:31.884 size:88% position:44%
 (rap music)

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:34.954 align:start position:0%
  Eating here, man, check
  it out, what's up, my man?

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:36.889 size:88% position:44%
 - Can I get a glazed donut?

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:41.094 align:start position:0%
 - Nah, you gotta be like,
 what that glazed hitting for?

00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:43.262
- That was good, James.

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:45.031 align:start size:88% position:13%
- What that glazed donut
hitting for, homie?

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:46.465 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Zig Zag, bring
 your ass over here.

00:02:46.498 --> 00:02:49.002
 - Let me get a twist, a twist.

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:54.073
- And hey, guess what,
guess what, guess what,

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:56.075 size:84% position:42%
  guess what, guess
  what, guess what.

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:57.210
- Don't do that, don't do that.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.477
- Okay.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.512 size:84% position:42%
  - Let me get two
  swisters, a black

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:01.080 size:88% position:44%
 and mild, you got lighters?

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:03.182
- You want some noodles?

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:04.617
 - Hey, blow it for me.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.455 align:start position:0%
 Never blow another man's
 noodles, man, what the (beep)?

00:03:09.488 --> 00:03:10.723
You're trying to
blow my noodles,

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:13.025 size:88% position:44%
 y'all see him tring
 to blow my noodles?

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:15.761 size:88% position:44%
 (rap music)

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:17.263
 - Don't touch my dice,
 don't touch my dice.

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.165 size:84% position:42%
  - That's a violation that
  could get you shot, bro.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.666 size:88% position:44%
  - That should get me shot.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:21.934 size:88% position:44%
  - That's the eighth time
  you'd have got shot today.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:24.904 size:88% position:44%
 (rap music)

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:25.871
 - What does this mean?

00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:28.408
 - It don't matter, just do it.

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:31.811
 - Do I get a do-over?

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.779 size:88% position:44%
 (rap music)

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:35.314
- We pull up to the Liquor Bank.

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.250
 - Y'all hood now, we're here.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:40.219
 If you look around, everybody
 here hood, including y'all.

00:03:40.252 --> 00:03:41.554
He good, what's up, bro?

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:43.289 size:88% position:44%
 - The hood showed
 up, and checked us.

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:45.725
Some random dudes just
start walking up to us.

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:48.160 align:start size:88% position:13%
 He literally walked
 into the scene,

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:49.595
 and was like "Who are y'all?"

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.298
and that's when I knew, sketcho.

00:03:53.465 --> 00:03:57.503 size:84% position:42%
  (talking over each other)

00:03:57.536 --> 00:03:58.838
 I had to literally just become

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.240 align:start size:88% position:13%
 a black male talking
 to a black male.

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:03.109
"Hey bro, (beep) Donald
Trump, I know, I know."

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.610
You know, we just had
to make a common ground

00:04:04.643 --> 00:04:06.979 align:start size:88% position:13%
 happening real
 fast because I knew

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:09.582
 that if I didn't say
 the right things,

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:11.450
I might have to catch this fade.

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:12.818 align:start size:88% position:13%
 For those who don't
 know, that means

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:16.522 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 get knocked the (beep) out.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.963
He gave us a hood pass earlier,

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
  and a part of his hood
  pass tour was coming here,

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.067
which we was doing comedically.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.068 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That brother looked
 mad, but then

00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:30.903
 Stevie J had all the answers,

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
 all the homeboys to
 reference, all the streets.

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:35.741 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I'm Baseball
 from (street name).

00:04:35.774 --> 00:04:37.176 size:84% position:42%
  - Okay, for sure.

00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:45.284 align:start position:0%
 - If you're down, can you
 just give my show a hood pass?

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:49.255 size:84% position:42%
  - Hey, it's your boy Mr.
  YBMF, also known as King.

00:04:49.288 --> 00:04:52.491
 We don't crush on a stocker at
 the world famous Liquor Bank.

00:04:52.524 --> 00:04:56.562 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Y'all already know
 what it is, hood pass.

00:04:56.595 --> 00:04:58.764 size:84% position:42%
  - I'm very much adjacent.

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.900
 For a couple of hours,
 I thought I was hood.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:02.501 align:start size:88% position:13%
But then all that
happened, and I was like

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:05.338
 "you know what, James, you're
 adjacent as a mother (beep)."

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:08.374 size:88% position:44%
 (audience applause)
