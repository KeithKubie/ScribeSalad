00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.830
In modular exponentiation there is a
very nice property of quotient function

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.010
from number theory.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.160
That is,
if you raise x to the power of y mod n,

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.980
the result is the same as x raised
to the power y mod quotient n.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.640
Given this property,
if y equal to one mod quotient n then

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.440
if you raise x to power y mod n,
the result is the same as x mod n.
