00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.360
And just when do you think things can't get any worse

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
Camp Rock Goddamn 2!

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.020
if you saw my first review of Camp Rock, you know I thought it was a real piece of shit,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.880
But it was kind of "so bad it's good" and

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.680
*gives up* It was just a piece of shit.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.540
But you know what? It made me laugh how bad it was.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.900
This one is definitely on the same level if not more.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.540
But what little shred of naivete the first film had is totally erased here.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.640
And it's parading around like it has the most soul and humanity and it has none of that!

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.420
Absolutely none of that!

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.620
You feel every manipulative, bullshit, cookie-cutter moment for what it is. It put me in a bad mood

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.980
I'm here to bitch about it.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.540
Okay, so once again, Mitchie is returning to Camp Rock.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.940
She's surprised to find out though that Camp Rock is now... a musical!

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.800
Yeah, not like they sit around and sing songs or perform on stage like in the first one.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.400
No, literally, everybody has a dance number ready!

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.180
If someone just says, "Hey, I wanna sing about something,"

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.700
Suddenly the whole camp joins in and they're all synchronized and it's like High School Musical!

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.360
*confusion*

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.420
The first film wasn't like that, so why is this suddenly like that?!

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.680
It's like it's suddenly in the Spider-Man movies it turns into a musical-

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.120
okay, that did kind of happen, but people hated that too!

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.520
But the guy who runs the camp is kind of bummed out

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.580
because, it just so happens, ANOTHER rock camp opened right across from them!

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.600
Camp Star, run by his ex band member that he threw out because he just didn't make it about the Music Man!

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.840
And now he's vowing to destroy Camp Rock at all costs.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.500
How do I know this? Because he literally announces it to the entire camp!

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.620
Australian guy: Camp Star: founded not-so-coincidentally by my out-to-destroy-me former bandmate, Axel Turner.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.180
Who does that?!

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.200
Who's frigging awkward enough to tell their entire camp this?

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.060
But to literally sweeten the deal, they parachute s'mores on the crowd leading to probably my favorite line:

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.940
"Graham crackers!

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.900
*on the edge* Why does that make me laugh so much?

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.840
It's just so clueless and lifeless! Graham crackers.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.340
"Graham crackers!

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.000
That's everybody's bland performance in one uninterested line!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.540
"Graham crackers!"

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.020
Camp Star invites Camp Rock over to a bonfire

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.760
Which I swear to God is run by the brother of the guy who ran Cobra Kai!

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.440
And randomly asks someone if they want to perform!

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.280
Mitchie says yes, does one of many planned songs, and big shock

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.620
They show them up with all these expensive dance numbers

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.500
And- hey! Offers the Camp Rock counselors on the spot to join their team to which of course

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.860
To which of course, they all go over.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:48.640
Bandmate guy: "If there are any Camp Rock counselors or staff who'd like to make the switch, I'd be more than willing to double your salary."

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.900
Yeah, it's this kind of movie guys!

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.060
Even the blonde girl who's the villain in the first one that they became friends with at the end!

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.440
She goes over there!

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.900
Christ, didn't I call it?

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.740
When there's no repercussions this shit just repeats itself!

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.100
This means oh, no camp rock has to be cancelled because they have no counselors.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.260
But of course, Mitchie, her friends, and naturally the Jonas Brothers, all come together to be counselors.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.480
But, uh oh! being a counsellor is hard as they all contribute their one personality trait of being clumsy.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.120
Yeah, nobody else has any other personality traits. It's just clumsiness.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.820
Ooh, I relate to them now!

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.300
But when Camp Rock goes over to challenge Camp Star, Master Cobra Kai says, "Why don't we televise the whole thing?"

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.960
*flabbergasted*

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.580
What!?

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.658
Just like that he has connections to broadcast this to millions of people!

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.760
They of course agree which pisses off the guy who owns Camp Rock because he's like, "Oh no, Camp Rock will close forever!"

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.120
What are you talking about? Millions of people are gonna see you!

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.340
Even if you lose, the phone will ring off the hook! You'll get all this free attention!

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.900
But nope! He thinks this is gonna be the end which forces Mitchie to work even harder

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.000
But, oh no! Is she losing the soul of the music? Is she losing the fun of camp?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.930
Camp Star has the money and moves,

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.240
But do they have the love? Do they have the genuine human spirit?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.580
No and neither do you, you corporate piece of shit!

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:16.080
I'm sorry, this really pisses me off when Disney and the Jonas Brothers are saying you gotta be more authentic.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.040
You gotta be more real.

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.540
And they just go into this bullshit song sequence with all the auto-tuning and nothing about it feels authentic!

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.840
It feels manipulative and bullshitty! Is that even a word? I don't care, I'm making it a word! It's bullshitty!

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.900
Even Michie! In the first film, I said I could see her actually kind of being a good actress.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.960
She had kind of this awkward smile that looked a little geeky, but it was still kind of charming.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.000
Here, that smile never goes away! If anything, they like perfected it and it's on her face 24/7!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.860
I just want to rip that little smile off I see it so much!

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.900
She seems like a robot! They all seem like robots! None of them seem like actual people!

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.480
But we should listen because this is the authentic side that has the heart and soul, oh shut the hell up!

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.600
If anything I actually side with Camp Star! They say they're there to make people stars

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.420
And they say it has a lot of sacrifice and giving things up and they're right!

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.380
Anyone that knows anything about the entertainment industry will tell you this!

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.580
If Camp Rock just wants to be a little fun camp where you play some songs and sit around a fire, that's fine.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.389
But why the hell do you have celebrities there? The Jonas Brothers are at your camp!

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.320
As soon as you do that, it's not gonna be about just sitting around singing songs and having fun!

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.380
And maybe it would come across better if the people seem like real people, but not one iota of them ever does!

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.560
The only actress who sometimes seems genuine is the daughter of Cobra Kai.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.520
Yeah, they do a stupid Romeo and Juliet thing with star-crossed lovers on each camp

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.320
and to her credit, when she talks she sounds like an actual human being!

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.160
You don't see metaphorical charts and graphs all around her saying,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.839
"Hey, this'll hit a certain demographic" or "you gotta have this funny thing happened because numbers indicate

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.240
This is where this stuff happens." She sells it like an actual person!

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.039
Everyone else sounds bland, forced, and forgettable! Even the songs!

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.520
This is a musical and like 90% of them are entirely pointless! You could have cut them and not miss a thing!

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.800
I don't know why this movie pissed me off more than the last one,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.979
I mean the last one was really bad too, but something about this one

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.960
Just saying that it understands like real art, real poetry, the real human condition

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.920
and it's so clearly doesn't! I feel like naive kids are gonna look at this and say,

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.400
"I understand what it means to be an artist" "I understand being a musician"

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.800
"I understand the sacrifice and being real"

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.200
No you don't. and neither does this movie.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.840
It doesn't even get a hint of it.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.680
Both art and entertainment should be taken seriously and if you're saying you're a movie that understands both

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.040
and this is your understanding of it, then you're clearly showing your corporate strings being pulled.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.220
*frustration*

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.220
Said enough. this movie sucks. Bye!

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.080
"Graham crackers!"
