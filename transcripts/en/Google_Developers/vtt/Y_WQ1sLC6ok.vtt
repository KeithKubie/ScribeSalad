00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:06.100
man: So hi, Brian.
Welcome.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.667
And maybe you could
talk a little bit

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:10.767
about what application
you're presenting

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:12.467
here at Google I/O.

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:13.767
McRae: Uh, yeah.

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:15.434
Well, my name's Brian McRae.

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:16.934
I'm the founder, creator,
director

00:00:16.934 --> 00:00:19.167
of Crazy Pixel Productions.

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:21.501
We are a game developer

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:24.734
based in Orange County,
California.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:29.200
We created the Island demo
for Google back in,

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.100
I believe it was February,
right?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.267
We were, like,
one of the first

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:33.901
to really kind of
push the graphics there.

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:34.934
man: Yeah.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.534
McRae: And currently
we are working

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:39.167
on a couple of other
demo projects,

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:41.934
one being a tower defense game
that we're really excited about.

00:00:41.934 --> 00:00:43.567
man: So could you tell us--

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:45.400
tell us a little more
about the tower defense game.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.300
Where is that headed
and what's it like?

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.567
McRae: Well, why don't I start
with where we were

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:53.467
and then where we're going.

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:55.133
So the first thing
we had to do

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.901
was, you know,
design the characters

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.133
and towers
and all that kinda thing.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:00.501
And that was fun, you know.

00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.834
The concept artists had
a really good time doing that.

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:05.834
Then it was--you know,
we needed to build

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:07.767
a sort of a model viewer

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.501
so that we could take
our 3-D assets,

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:13.067
put 'em into, you know,
the O3D canvas

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:14.534
and see what we're getting
material-wise

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:15.868
and all that kinda thing.

00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:17.667
So that's the first thing
that we did.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:22.100
Using a lot of the API demos
and whatnot,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.534
we pieced it all together.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:26.067
It just took like
two or three days.

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:28.100
And we were able to--
you know, just started going

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.200
through the iterative process
of building our objects,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.000
exporting them out of
3D Studio MAX,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.968
bringing them into O3D,

00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:37.033
and, you know,
testing the materials,

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.334
the mesh, how it looked,

00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:41.133
you know, against
the O3D light.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.067
And even, you know,
bringing in objects

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:44.734
that had animation on them,

00:01:44.734 --> 00:01:46.267
so the characters
and everything.

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:47.701
And we were able to load,
you know, characters

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:50.801
that have our own kind of
custom, you know, rigging

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:52.868
and bone system
and everything.

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:55.868
And found it to be
very sort of forgiving.

00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:57.267
man: Awesome.

00:01:57.267 --> 00:01:59.133
So I'm curious,
you came to Google I/O

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.667
to present your application.

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:03.501
But I'm wondering how have
you liked Google I/O in general

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.267
and have you learned
about any new technologies

00:02:06.267 --> 00:02:10.033
or things that you're thinking
about using in the future?

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.367
McRae: You know,
I think there's a lot

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:18.701
of, you know, avenues
that the O3D could go.

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:23.467
We've done some work with
a web developing company

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:25.467
that does a lot
of product renders

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:28.100
and that kind of thing,
you know, shopping carts.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.634
And so we've done, you know,
high-end product renders

00:02:31.634 --> 00:02:34.534
for, you know,
various companies.

00:02:34.534 --> 00:02:38.334
And we always wind up
having the camera, you know,

00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:39.834
pointed at it and render
all the way around,

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:41.767
and then use Flash
to kind of get, like,

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.701
a 360 degree view, you know,
as real-time as possible

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:46.400
in the viewport using Flash.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.200
And I think
with something like this,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.567
it'd be really interesting
to, you know,

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.167
have those, you know,
crazy next gen shaders

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.767
showing everything off
as realistic as possible

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:58.734
using photo source
as the textures and everything,

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:01.834
get really realistic
results in these products

00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:04.334
as they're being shown in 3-D,

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:06.100
so the consumers could
really kind of see

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.834
exactly, you know,
what it looks like

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:10.534
just as they would
if they were in a store,

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:12.467
you know, 'cause you could
pick up the item

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:14.767
and look around at it
and everything.

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:17.601
You know, other than that,
we're a game studio.

00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:19.501
So we love
to entertain people.

00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:21.167
I think there's
a lot of opportunity there

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:26.133
to, you know, create sort of
engaging experiences,

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:27.968
you know, traveling through,
you know,

00:03:27.968 --> 00:03:29.634
through 3-D space,

00:03:29.634 --> 00:03:31.901
interacting with other people,
you know.

00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:34.167
I don't know,
maybe even an MMO,

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.534
something crazy like that.

00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:37.100
man: That would be
awesome to see.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.968
Yeah, we look forward
to seeing more content

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.434
from you guys.

00:03:40.434 --> 00:03:43.434
And I'm wondering, you know,
as people have passed by

00:03:43.434 --> 00:03:46.334
and looked at the awesome stuff
that you guys have created,

00:03:46.334 --> 00:03:48.934
what's the general response
that people have had?

00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:51.367
And any particularly
interesting comments

00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:52.801
you've gotten from people?

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.534
McRae: Right, well,
with the Island demo,

00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:56.133
because we wanted
to push the graphics

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:58.667
as far as we did--
and you helped us out

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:00.467
with the shaders
and everything there--

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:02.367
the response has been,
you know--

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.801
We were at the Developers'
Sandbox yesterday showing it,

00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:07.801
and a lot of people just
looking up at it.

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:09.133
man: Nice.

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:11.200
McRae: And that to me
is a really great compliment,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.167
when people just see
an environment

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:15.534
and become mesmerized by it

00:04:15.534 --> 00:04:17.934
and just, you know,
engaged into it.

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:20.267
So I'm really excited
about, you know,

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:22.434
just seeing how far
we could push things,

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:25.601
'cause that was just
the first attempt.

00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:28.334
You know, usually,
you know,

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:30.334
from a game developer's
standpoint, you know,

00:04:30.334 --> 00:04:32.367
for like Xbox
or Xbox 360,

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:33.968
when you get to the end
of the cycle,

00:04:33.968 --> 00:04:36.267
that's when you really start
finding out what's possible.

00:04:36.267 --> 00:04:38.033
We're just in the beginning
right now.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.000
So I think once we start
adding in fog,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.801
ambient occlusion, you know,
all these other, like,

00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:44.701
next gen graphical gizmos,

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.400
we could really see
where this thing is going.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.567
man: Awesome.

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:50.067
Well, thanks a lot, Brian.

00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:51.701
And we look forward
to seeing what's next

00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:53.501
with the tower defense game.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:54.968
McRae: Sure, yeah,
it was a pleasure to be here.

00:04:54.968 --> 00:04:57.934
I think we're also going to be
involved in a blog

00:04:57.934 --> 00:05:00.167
so that we could share,
you know, our experiences

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.767
of O3D on there.

00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:04.634
And we're also planning to just
have some assets available

00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:07.868
for other users,
you know, developers,

00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:10.534
to just take some assets,
put 'em together

00:05:10.534 --> 00:05:13.400
and, you know, generate
their own, you know,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.434
applications or whatever
with O3D.

00:05:15.434 --> 00:05:16.901
man: 3-D mash-ups.
McRae: Yeah.

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:18.534
man: Sounds cool.
Well, thanks.

00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:20.133
McRae: Yeah.
Thanks for having me.
