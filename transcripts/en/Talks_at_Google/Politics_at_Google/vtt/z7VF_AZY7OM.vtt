[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.390
JULIET EHIMUAN: Welcome
to Talks at Google.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.100
I'm Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.960
I'm the country manager
for Google Nigeria.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.720
And I'm very
privileged and honored

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.070
to be speaking with our guest
for today, Professor Pat Utomi.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.144
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:25.590
PAT UTOMI: Pleased to
be able to join you.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.972
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.857 --> 00:00:29.440
JULIET EHIMUAN: So
our theme for today

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.300
is leadership and
nation building.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.040
These are topics
that Professor Utomi

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.460
has been known to really
share a lot of views about

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.320
and be actively involved in.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.900
But I'll start with just
going through his profile.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.420
This is probably the shortest
introduction you'll ever

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.790
get for Professor Utomi.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.210
So Professor Utomi is a Fellow
of the Institute of Management

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.920
Consultants of Nigeria and
Founding Senior Faculty

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.370

He was Director of the
Center for Applied Economics

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.180
at the Lagos Business School.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.370
He has served in senior
positions in government

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.420
as an advisor to the
president of Nigeria,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.530
the private sector

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.630
Officer for Volkswagen of
Nigeria, and in academia.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.870
He is the author of several
management and public policy

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.240
books, including
the award-winning

Competition and Strategy

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.630
in Emerging Economies" in 1998,
and the 2006 book "Why Nations

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.440
Are Poor."

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.410
He has been a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.190
at the Harvard Business
School and the American

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.100
University in Washington DC.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.490
As leader of civil
society, he is the founder

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.540
of the Center for Values in
Leadership, the Widow Support

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.340
Centre, and the Concerned
Professionals, which

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.380
was bulwark against
military operation

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.280
among numerous other social
enterprise initiatives,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.630
and honored by so many
professional bodies

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.130
for the collection of
more than 700 plaques

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.773
that mark a life of service.

00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:11.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.478
PAT UTOMI: I'll tell you,
we're over 1,000 now.

00:02:13.478 --> 00:02:14.860
JULIET EHIMUAN: Over 1,000 now.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.682
Professor Utomi, thank
you for being here.

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:18.140
PAT UTOMI: Thank
you for having me.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.726
JULIET EHIMUAN: I said this was
the short version, didn't I?

00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:23.100
PAT UTOMI: Actually, I have
a much, much shorter version.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.450
When I introduce myself,
I say I'm a teacher.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.710
JULIET EHIMUAN: At 60, which is
the oldest person in the room

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.655
right now, what do you
know for sure about life?

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:35.280
PAT UTOMI: Well, I
know for sure that I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.140
don't know much about life.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.400
You know, every day you
learn something new.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.840
The way things were
yesterday seemed right.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.156
They are wrong today.

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:57.850
So life is pay as you go, learn
as you go, adapt as you go.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.580
But what's important
about life is

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.390
that you should be driven by
some very basic principles that

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.300
really never change, no matter
how the world around you

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.050
changes.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.274
When I was at university,
I ran into something

00:03:11.274 --> 00:03:13.440
that was chasing me from
when I was seven years old.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.337
It's called a library.

00:03:16.337 --> 00:03:17.920
And instead of going
to flying school,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.640
I went to graduate school.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.770
As a very young person,
I was significantly

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.710
shaped by a group of
American Catholic priests

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.860
in a very rural part
of Nigeria, a place

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.295
called Gusau in
today's Zamfara state.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:35.670
And John F. Kennedy
was President

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.480
of the United States of
America, first Catholic

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.950
to be elected president.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.060
And so I was the guinea pig.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.620
Everything Kennedy
said, I was made

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.820
to read by this Catholic priest.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.971
And at seven, I began
to love to read.

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:53.616
I read quite a bit
that, and literally I

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:57.300
read books [INAUDIBLE] were not
even looking at at that time.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.385
And out of a sense of duty, I
was available most of the time.

00:04:00.385 --> 00:04:02.010
And since there was
nothing else to do,

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.780
I began to read all the books
that were in the library.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.733
So that's how I changed
my mind from flying school

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:10.918
and decided to correct--
I don't want to tell you

00:04:10.918 --> 00:04:13.640
how I chose the subject
I studied at University

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.840
of Nigeria, but I should say.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.089
I just closed my eyes
and put down the pencil.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.860
I said, whatever I touch
is-- I'm just going

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.130
to spend a year or two there.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.180
So it was for play.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.650
And so what interests I had, I
had to pursue in grad school.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.180
And that's how I ended up with
titles, number of degrees.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.346
JULIET EHIMUAN: Interesting.

00:04:35.346 --> 00:04:36.380
PAT UTOMI: Nothing--

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.400
JULIET EHIMUAN: So you
said you put a pencil?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.066
PAT UTOMI: I just put
a pencil and said,

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:41.447
whatever this is, that's
what I'll fill in this form.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.280
JULIET EHIMUAN: And it
really worked out OK.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.500
PAT UTOMI: It did.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.588
It did work out OK.

00:04:45.588 --> 00:04:46.847
It did work out OK.

00:04:46.847 --> 00:04:47.930
JULIET EHIMUAN: Fantastic.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.388
And in all of this, why did
you decide to go into politics?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.790
PAT UTOMI: Because
one basic thing

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.430
has driven most
of my adult life--

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.068
how can I make the world
around me better than I met it?

00:05:03.068 --> 00:05:05.310
How can to make it
better, different?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.670
And I saw different ways of
affecting the world around me,

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.080
and that led me to the
various things that I did.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.550
At a point in time, there
was an overwhelming sense

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.045
that you make the most
difference in public life.

00:05:22.045 --> 00:05:23.670
I have a fairly
different understanding

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.390
of things right now.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.900
Sad to say, but I think that
in some developing countries--

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.790
Nigeria is a classic example--
the nature of the triumph

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.880
of politics makes political
life actually more detrimental

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.444
to progress than anything else.

00:05:39.444 --> 00:05:41.110
I believe that the
government of Nigeria

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.674
does more to prevent progress
than to make it happen,

00:05:44.674 --> 00:05:48.100
even if the goal is to
make progress happen.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.728
But the level of goal
displacement in public life

00:05:50.728 --> 00:05:53.225
is so massive that in
the end, government

00:05:53.225 --> 00:05:56.720
assaults property
rights significantly,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.305
because of the
interests of those who

00:05:58.305 --> 00:06:01.290
have gone into those positions.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.380
Government is
unable to quickly--

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.370
I just came back from
a tour of Australia,

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.860
as a guest of the
government of Australia.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.770
And part of what I was
suggesting to those that I met,

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.120
including MPs,
government ministers,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.130
you know, you could make a
greater difference by engaging

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.320
the private sector, engaging
social enterprise, in a country

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.620
like Nigeria, than engaging
the government of Nigeria.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.860
It's a sad conclusion
to come to,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.520
but that is unfortunately
the nature of the beast.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.400
But we can't stop trying.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.900
Obviously, you can make
a significant difference

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.450
if you get the right kinds
of values, the right kinds

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.540
of people, in public life.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.320
But for now, the
government is significantly

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.880
a source of holding back
progress rather than making

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.970
progress happen.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:56.460
JULIET EHIMUAN: And you went
for presidency in 2007 and 2011.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.007
What do you think it would take
for someone with your profile

00:07:00.007 --> 00:07:03.725
to be elected
president in Nigeria?

00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:05.600
PAT UTOMI: An accident,
maybe many accidents.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.210
With the power of the internet
and all of that-- I mean,

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.570
the way the Obamas of this
world emerged from what

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.080
in that political system would
have been thought impossible

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.246
a few short years before that
can also affect change here.

00:07:24.246 --> 00:07:26.162
JULIET EHIMUAN: I'm
talking about that change.

00:07:26.162 --> 00:07:29.845
So we hear an increasing
number of young people wanting

00:07:29.845 --> 00:07:31.334
to get involved.

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:34.710
And we hear-- there are
two philosophies, actually,

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.950
that we've heard about
in the political space.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.730
One is that power is
not given, it's taken.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.740
Another is that power is
not a la carte, right?

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.750
How can young people
get a seat at the table

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.490
when you have such ideologies
around-- you have to grab 100%,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.869
or it has to be
bestowed upon you.

00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:58.910
PAT UTOMI: I think that
organizing-- politics has

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.181
always been about organization.

00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:05.140
If young people organize,
you can get rid of all those

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.110
in power as they want.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.720
Because we've got a youth bulge.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.000
The majority of the
population is young.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.560
If they realize that their
future is being really put

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.590
at risk by the kinds of
people who are in power,

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.190
and they realize
it starkly enough,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.613
they can organize in a
way that can help them get

00:08:24.613 --> 00:08:26.230
rid of those kinds of people.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.440
We're talking about power,
not being served a la carte

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:32.340
or being taken.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.902
Many years ago, I
held-- I came out

00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:39.289
of an elevator at the Hilton
in Nigeria, comes out of Abjua.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.350
And a very powerful
politician, [INAUDIBLE],

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.730
who was finance minister, I
think, at the time, sees me.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.180
And he says, oh, Pat, you have
been complaining about things.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.320
Nobody gives you power.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.920
You have to take it.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.072
Force us out.

00:08:52.072 --> 00:08:53.300
And I thought, OK.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.702
He's got a point.

00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:57.992
And I've been trying very hard
to force them out since then.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.852
JULIET EHIMUAN: So looking at
the world context of Nigeria,

00:09:03.852 --> 00:09:05.726
we're talking leadership
and nation building.

00:09:05.726 --> 00:09:08.312
And a lot of us
see the greatness

00:09:08.312 --> 00:09:09.668
in our country, Nigeria.

00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:12.250
It's the country with the
seventh largest population

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.535
in the world.

00:09:13.535 --> 00:09:16.395
It's the largest
economy in Africa.

00:09:16.395 --> 00:09:19.700
We've got entrepreneurial,
resilient, and very

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.370
talented people.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.080
A high percentage of
young people, as well,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.505
and all of that energy.

00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:28.780
You have great weather,
fertile soil, and a [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.090
of natural resources.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.940
But there are some harsh
realities, as well.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.564
I mean, if you just
look out the window

00:09:34.564 --> 00:09:37.380
at the NNPC filling station,
there are long queues,

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.620
fuel scarcity.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.750
And you also
mentioned in your book

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:46.411
that our politic figures went
from 35% to 45% in 10 years,

00:09:46.411 --> 00:09:46.910
right?

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.590
How would you assess where
we are today as a nation

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.674
relative to the promise of
Nigeria at independence?

00:09:53.674 --> 00:09:55.090
PAT UTOMI: The
best way to compare

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.370
is to look at countries
that were peers.

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:04.740
As an old Nigerian politician of
great glamour, the [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.720
He's called [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.300
Any time I run into him,
he goes back to the fact

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.000
that in the '50s,
the countries that

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.970
were expected to change
the face of the world

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.770
coming out of the
developing or imagined

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.610
countries were India,
Brazil, Nigeria.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:28.590
People didn't talk much about
the South Koreas of this world

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.010
back in those days.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:32.090
Probably talk of the Malaysias.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.980
And those ones emerged as
the frontiers countries

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.810
of a world in which
underdeveloped countries were

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.230
emerging fairly quickly.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.590
Why did Nigeria, which held
so much promise in the '50s,

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.080
fall behind?

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.250
A number of factors.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:56.550
One is what I call the
unfortunate alchemy of soldiers

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:04.480
and oil-- soldiers centralizing
authority, and oil making them

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.670
not need the tax
that people pay,

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:11.900
and therefore not bothering
to be held accountable.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.810
This has worked against
Nigeria in so many ways,

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:17.990
because of the policy
choices that we've made

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.135
and are still making.

00:11:20.135 --> 00:11:27.090
I mean, if you take two or three
of the major crises of now--

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.920
Veracruz.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.490
That is as basic as common
sense can take anybody.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.910
And I'm willing to put a bet
down that if Nigeria announced

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.520
today that anybody
who can refine

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.270
petrol-- petroleum products.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.950
Anybody who wants to sell
[INAUDIBLE] from anywhere

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.200
in the world, as long as
they have certain standards,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.620
is free to come into Nigeria
and sell for whatever price.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.980
Prices will be lower than
the government official price

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.540
within the next year or so.

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.420
But it will not be done, because
people are extracting rent

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.314
from the process.

00:12:07.314 --> 00:12:08.692
This person in power.

00:12:08.692 --> 00:12:10.400
His people have finished
extracting rent.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.834
The other person comes.

00:12:11.834 --> 00:12:13.750
And it's always done in
the name of protecting

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.250
the government, who is
the victim, continuously,

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:22.146
of these dirigiste traditions.

00:12:22.146 --> 00:12:24.810
We did it with
telecommunications.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.490
I have a story-- it's
slightly long, but a story

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.270
on telecommunications.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:35.310
In 1996, you know, I spent
a year on sabbatical leave

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.360
in the Boston area, at
Harvard Business School,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.330
to write a book titled
"Managing Uncertainty"--

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.880
competition and strategy
in emerging economies.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:52.550
Rented a small house on a street
called Elm Street in Cambridge.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.832
And I wanted to get a phone.

00:12:53.832 --> 00:12:55.540
And I thought, oh
dear, how do I do that?

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.670
I need to get to the
telephone company.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.722
I went to the street
corner telephone booth,

00:13:00.722 --> 00:13:02.180
called the phone
company, and said,

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.944
I need to have your
address so that I can

00:13:04.944 --> 00:13:06.110
come in and get a telephone.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.609
They said, but you don't need
to come in to get a telephone.

00:13:08.609 --> 00:13:09.860
I said, oh, why not?

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.700
You just give us your details,
give us your last telephone

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.320
number, and if it's OK,
if it checks out OK,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.050
by tomorrow morning, if you
pick up the phone in the house,

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:23.160
you will get a dial tone, and
I will give you your number.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.450
Back in those days,
Nigeria had spent billions

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.860
of dollars trying to provide
telephones to its people,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.800
and less than 280,000
telephone lines

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.060
were working in the entire
country of more than 100

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.750
million people.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:42.150
And I thought, OK, those
guys-- I chose a long distance

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.650
provider.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.441
The following morning,
I pick up the phone,

00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:46.980
there's a dial tone all
right, and I begin to call.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.129
You know somebody who has been
denied access, every night,

00:13:50.129 --> 00:13:52.420
I've been at the phone, I
said you cannot believe this.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.359
Are the kids ready?

00:13:53.359 --> 00:13:54.400
Have they gone to school?

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.980
Blah, blah, blah.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.535
So end of the first
month, I had a big bill.

00:13:58.535 --> 00:13:59.910
Several months,
I had a big bill.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.766
Of course, I paid my
bills as they came.

00:14:01.766 --> 00:14:04.502
And then one day,
the phone is ringing.

00:14:04.502 --> 00:14:06.210
I thought, oh, what's
happening in Lagos?

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:07.320
I grabbed the phone.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.680
This is Sprint, the
long distance provider.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:10.690
I say, yeah?

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.585
Any problem?

00:14:11.585 --> 00:14:13.168
They say, yeah, we
noticed you've been

00:14:13.168 --> 00:14:15.040
making lots of phone calls.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:15.640
I said, yes.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.150
Is there any problem with that?

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.430
I thought they think this
Nigerian [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.430
He's calling Nigeria all
the time or something.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.520
They say, no, no, not at all.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.020
Because you're such
a good customer,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.490
we want to reduce
your rate to half.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.610
I said, really?

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.670
Yes, in fact, the first two
months bills that you've paid,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.816
we're going to give it
to you as a welcome gift.

00:14:35.816 --> 00:14:37.190
So we'll deduct
them from future.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.580
And I said, come, come, come.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.340
This is September.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.340
Christmas doesn't
come till December.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.840
Tell me what the trick is here?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.215
JULIET EHIMUAN:
What's the catch?

00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:45.200
PAT UTOMI: Yeah.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.540
When I dropped the phone, I said
to myself, dummy, dummy, dummy,

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.520
three times.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:52.010
You came here to write a book
on competition and strategy,

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.720
and you see it, and
you can't recognize it.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.030
And somebody is going to
get a hold of the fact

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.392
that some fellow is
making so many phone calls

00:14:59.392 --> 00:15:01.955
and call me and offer
me a better rate.

00:15:01.955 --> 00:15:07.200
And that's why the company
I was using moved first.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.950
That's what's going to
happen to this country,

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:15.480
if we-- and we did eventually
with telecoms through the GSM

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.090
process.

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.250
Now from 280,000
working phone lines.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.590
127 million.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.900
So it's not rocket science.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.566
Something with power.

00:15:25.566 --> 00:15:28.860
You know, somebody was joking
with the minister from Nigeria.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.860
I didn't know it was a
minister-- a West African

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.160
on a flight from Accra.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.460
And says to this
minister, at the time,

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.916
a friend of mine [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:37.916 --> 00:15:42.811
He says, this problem that you
have with electricity, tell me,

00:15:42.811 --> 00:15:45.060
is that you who don't know
where to sell these things?

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.920
I can introduce you to GE if
you don't know where to these

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.700
sell these turbines.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:53.550
Power will solve the problem
was solved 100 years ago.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:58.970
The reason we've spent billions
of dollars and don't have power

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:05.350
is simply because we are playing
games with extracting rent

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.532
from the system.

00:16:06.532 --> 00:16:08.680
As simple as that.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.410
And we can fix these
things very easily

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.243
if we have people who
have the right mindset

00:16:12.243 --> 00:16:15.550
and have real commitment
to the country.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.160
JULIET EHIMUAN: So you
paint-- and I really

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.610
want to touch on that in
terms of the way forward.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:22.620
You paint a very
comprehensive picture

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:24.470
in your book about
the people tell

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.350
things that have happened
since independence to get us

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:28.390
where we are.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:33.320
From things like having
30 years of military rule,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.610
and the impact on federalism,
undermining of institutions,

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:42.316
institutionalized corruption,
not effectively managing

00:16:42.316 --> 00:16:45.650
volatility in the upstream and
downstream sectors of the oil

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:49.320
industry, not
diversifying our economy,

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.360
a decline in agriculture
and things like that.

00:16:52.288 --> 00:16:54.246
And we will be able to
go into those in detail,

00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:57.400
but they're covered in a lot
of great detail in the book.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.110
Thinking about the way
forward and solutions,

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.790
you proposed a growth drivers
framework in your book

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.589
that had six things--
leadership, culture,

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:11.200
institutions, policy
choice, entrepreneurship

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.280
and human capital.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.558
See, I was paying attention!

00:17:13.558 --> 00:17:14.410
PAT UTOMI: Ah, absolutely.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:14.951
It's amazing.

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:19.270
Even I don't
remember all of them.

00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.010
JULIET EHIMUAN: So if we
start with leadership,

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.400
you've-- this is a big
area of focus for you.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.150
And I believe you've
said on occasions

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.440
that part of our problem
through the years

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.990
has been a crisis in leadership.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.770
What type of leadership,
in your opinion,

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.470
is required to take
Nigeria forward?

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:41.980
PAT UTOMI: Well, leadership
really is leadership,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.440
but the leadership styles
and approaches to leadership.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:54.500
Leadership simply is about
applying the self in a way

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:58.960
that goal direction, behavior,
through influencing others,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.700
is smoothing by the fact
that you have knowledge,

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.110
you have a sense of
service towards people,

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.810
you have a value frame that
allow the people to see

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:13.920
a shared motive in solutions
to certain kinds of problems

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.890
that face them.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.740
Some cultures make
the concepts--

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.580
the idea of the leader as a
shepherd-- more attractive.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:28.893
You know, if you look
at bible, for example,

00:18:28.893 --> 00:18:31.070
leadership emerges in the Bible.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.550
Look at the shepherd, the
steward, and the servant.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.460
The servant relation model
being essentially the one

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.220
that Jesus offered.

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.500
I advocate a model that I
call the solicitor leader.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:52.210
And, in many ways, Mahatma
Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:54.839
are closer to that
model-- people

00:18:54.839 --> 00:19:01.460
who, by the sheer force of their
conviction, and the fact that,

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.445
like solicitors, they
engage the issues.

00:19:04.445 --> 00:19:08.734
And so you have to know a great
deal to be a solicitor leader.

00:19:08.734 --> 00:19:15.740
People will buy into
[INAUDIBLE] they have vision.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.080
And therefore, there
is a lower cost

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.180
in mobilizing people
towards achieving

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.750
those broad objectives
that are set.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.230
I think that, where you have
a significantly literate

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:30.770
population, perhaps
the shepherd leader

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.760
model can be very attractive.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:40.490
We have a great number of
educated, younger people.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:45.970
The solicitor leader model
is probably more attractive.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.810
But sometimes, you get
a blend of these models.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.300
And I think that,
really, we need,

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.780
in many cases,
solicitor leaders,

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.510
in some cases, some shepherds.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.640
Unfortunately,
there is a tendency

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.110
to have this Messiah desire.

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.610
You know?

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.330
We're looking for a messiah.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:08.250
This man will come and save us.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.786
And it never quite happens like
that, for a variety of reasons.

00:20:11.786 --> 00:20:13.160
The U.S. president,
Barack Obama,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.020
on his first visit to
Africa, in his first speech

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.160
in Accra in Ghana, made
a very profound point,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:26.290
which unfortunately for me had
been speaking to for years.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.765
But nobody listened to me
until he said the same things.

00:20:28.765 --> 00:20:29.990
You know?

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:35.150
What Africa needs-- strong
institutions, not strong men.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:39.210
We are always looking for
strong man who will be messiahs.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.050
And the problem with messiahs
is that those who succeed them

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.510
always want to undo
what they have done,

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.560
because the legitimacy
of the new guy

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:54.330
will not be achieved if that
other person's legacy holds.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.585
So we get into these
recursive modes.

00:20:56.585 --> 00:20:58.210
The Nigerian economy
has been described

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.250
as a recursive economy.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.510
Two steps forwards,
four steps backwards,

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:06.590
essentially because of
this strong man role.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.100
Because when a particular
governor comes,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.100
and he backs on
all these projects,

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:14.860
his successor is sure to
abandon those projects

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:16.410
and start new projects.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.040
You don't really
build like that.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.020
JULIET EHIMUAN: Yeah.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:19.853
PAT UTOMI: You know?

00:21:19.853 --> 00:21:22.094
JULIET EHIMUAN: I agree
with you about the solicitor

00:21:22.094 --> 00:21:23.426
model versus the messiah.

00:21:23.426 --> 00:21:25.960
Because if you think about
it, responsibility should

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.780
exist at every level, right?

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.570
But it also raises the
question, from a very practical

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.590
perspective, how
do we go from-- say

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.150
there's a leader with the
best intentions, right?

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.750
There is still a need
to create that rallying

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.250
to a common vision, and also
influencing at every level,

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.780
right?

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.090
So how would we go from the
understanding of the issues,

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.310
et cetera, to actual, practical,
transformative action?

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.510
You know, I am a great admirer
of the Canadian writer Robin

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.430
Sharma, who writes about
the leader who had no title.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.830
If we are all
educated to realizing

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.960
that we are all
leaders, and that we all

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:14.150
have a responsibility for
the change that we seek,

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.110
somebody being able to
effectively articulate it

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:22.079
helps us to patterns of
socialization, agencies

00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:23.870
of socialization--
whether it's the church,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:29.130
whether it's the school
system-- into a people who

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:33.430
start by buying into a
certain vision of the world.

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.030
And I call this the
pedagogy of the determined.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.680
And not to give myself too
much credit for anything

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.740
here-- because I took it away
from a Brazilian educator

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.520
in the '60s and '70s
called Paulo Freire.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.800
Paulo Freire was famous
for a book on education

00:22:52.800 --> 00:23:02.490
that was titled "The
Pedagogy of the Oppressed."

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.050
And "The Pedagogy
of the Oppressed"

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.400
essentially looked
at the mindset

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.280
of oppressed people,
colonized people, and the kind

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.510
of education that they
get, like a piggy bank,

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:15.090
that enables them just make
itsy bitty little progress

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:19.480
within the context of the
enslavement of the world.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.460
But if people were
trained to begin,

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.360
first of all, by developing
a certain vision of society,

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.610
and then all the
knowledge they seek

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:32.530
is to move them
towards that vision.

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.930
Paulo Freire was a Marxist.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.900
I have never been
a Marxist, so I

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.280
had a basic problem with the
heavy ideological content

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.510
from the beginning.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.230
So I took an
entrepreneurship approach

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.940
to the same idea of the
pedagogy of the oppressed

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.130
and say that people
need to begin

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.680
with a vision of
the world they want

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.130
to see and
entrepreneurially craft

00:23:56.130 --> 00:24:01.340
what it is, can move their
world towards that location.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:04.250
And this is the-- and
this kind of platform

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:08.420
is easy for a leader to mobilize
these other leaders to channel

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.980
society's energies
towards a certain goal.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.452
And in some ways, you look at
what happened in South Korea,

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:14.710
you will see that happen.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.080
There's a South
Korean-born economist

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.440
at Oxford called
Ha-Joon Chang, who's

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.030
written a very interesting
book titled "Bad Samaritans."

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:31.900
And it essentially looks
at the developmental states

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.565
and tells the story of how
South Korea got to where it is.

00:24:34.565 --> 00:24:39.260
And I believe that we
need a developmental state

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.580
orientation.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.440
But you need a
different set of leaders

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.440
from the kind of people
who we find in our country,

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.100
with massive levels of goal
displacement, where [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.060
is so important.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.430
Whereas true leaders are
self-sacrificing people.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.890
Leadership behavior is
others centered behavior.

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.640
If you look in the mirror, and
what you see most of the time

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.670
is me, myself, and I,
you're not a leader.

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.170
You need to, as you
look in the mirror, ask

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:14.560
how can this person touch other
lives and make a difference?

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.630
If you think that way,
there's a pretty decent chance

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.820
that you will make a leader.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.750
So I think it's important
to bear these things in mind

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.140
in how we challenge ourselves
to how to move to where--

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.396
And young people are easy to
connect to this kind of thing.

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:32.770
And that's why
the future belongs

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.620
to how we connect
to a generation that

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.730
is-- in most of
the things they do,

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:42.300
they look for an aspirational
track that they can hook onto.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.175
We have leaders that
connect properly into that,

00:25:45.175 --> 00:25:47.350
it can drive a
generation towards

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:48.676
a different destination.

00:25:48.676 --> 00:25:50.550
JULIET EHIMUAN: I think
that's very powerful.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.925
If you look in the mirror,
and all you see is me, myself,

00:25:52.925 --> 00:25:54.305
and I, then you're not a leader.

00:25:54.305 --> 00:25:55.700
I think that's very powerful.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:55.960
OK.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.043
So we're still on the
subject of leadership, Prof.

00:25:58.043 --> 00:26:00.830
And I'd like to bring this to
a very personal level, now.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.365
You've had-- you've
been involved

00:26:02.365 --> 00:26:06.970
in leadership positions in
business and government.

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:11.150
How would you critique yourself
and your role in these sectors,

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:15.777
and what, in your opinion,
could have gone better?

00:26:15.777 --> 00:26:17.860
PAT UTOMI: You know, one
of the questions that you

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.705
get asked every
time by reporters

00:26:19.705 --> 00:26:24.430
is, would you do
anything differently?

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.310
90% of the time, I hear
people say, no, you know,

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.940
I would never do
anything differently.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.942
I would do everything
differently.

00:26:31.942 --> 00:26:35.270
Because every new day,
I find a different way

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:39.620
of doing something better than
the way I did it yesterday.

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.800
But in the various roles that
I have played, some things have

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.452
come through that I could have
done in a way that, you know,

00:26:49.452 --> 00:26:52.900
if I had a chance to do it
over-- part of the challenge is

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:58.050
in industry, of course, I
was a peculiar kind of player

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:01.520
when I was in industry.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.550
When I got to work for
Volkswagen in Nigeria,

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.510
first day, I said
if I had my way,

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.610
I would scrap the business.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.657
And everybody went,
is this guy crazy?

00:27:11.657 --> 00:27:13.990
They just hired this guy, and
he says if he has his way,

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.111
he would scrap the plant.

00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:17.980
It wasn't because I
thought we shouldn't

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.780
have business in that area.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.900
It was because I thought that
was not the most effective way

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.930
to play.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.960
Motor assembly business, where
we're not so competitive,

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.996
isn't where we
should be playing.

00:27:32.996 --> 00:27:37.254
We should probably look at where
we have comparative advantage.

00:27:37.254 --> 00:27:38.670
[INAUDIBLE]
endowments that enable

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:43.240
us to build global value chains
that we can significantly

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.130
dominate.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.490
I recall in those early days,
when I was saying these things,

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.570
and I was hammered by
the media all around,

00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.210
a professor from
Oxford, [INAUDIBLE],

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.260
came to interview me.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.910
He was curious.

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:01.460
And I said, look,
if I had my way,

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.710
I would get the
government of Nigeria

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.090
to sign agreements
with Volkswagen,

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.200
[INAUDIBLE], Peugeot,
and all the fellows

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:14.560
we were producing, or trying
to do security operations here.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.300
Take a component that is based
on some factor which we're

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:24.350
dominantly [INAUDIBLE]
rubber and become suppliers

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:29.760
into the global supply chains of
those companies for one or two

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.300
components alone, first of all,
would create many more jobs

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.424
in Nigeria.

00:28:34.424 --> 00:28:36.420
We would [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.680
In fact, at a point in
time, I was cocky enough

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.770
to suggest that we'd earn more
from the rubber value chain

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.320
if we added value, that
we're earning from crude oil.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.095
And I made a presentation at the
first Nigeria Economic Summit

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:58.415
on that in 1980-- well,
[INAUDIBLE] first year

00:28:58.415 --> 00:29:00.435
was 1993.

00:29:00.435 --> 00:29:02.860
That was the first
economic summit.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:09.440
And I should have been
more aggressive in that.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.030
I expressed it,
and I kept saying,

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.280
these guys-- at a point, I
said, OK, I've had enough.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.910
I'm walking away from this.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.840
But if I had fought
must strongly--

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:25.960
and managers are not supposed
to be head in this environment,

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.400
on these kind of issues that
are really big policy issues.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.588
Of course, I broke that
rule, but I should have even

00:29:31.588 --> 00:29:33.164
broken it more.

00:29:33.164 --> 00:29:35.580
Because if I manage to educate
enough people to understand

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:38.390
the point I was
making, then Nigeria

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:42.140
would not be as far back as
it is in manufacturing today.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:47.900
A good example is that Paul
Collier, fast forward 25 years

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:52.480
after, gets asked
by UNIDO to study

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.130
China's rapid advance
in manufacturing

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.340
and what Africa
could learn from it.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:01.180
And when Paul Collier was
done and shared his study,

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.590
one of the things that came
out was that China basically

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.381
did what [INAUDIBLE]
told me was suggesting

00:30:05.381 --> 00:30:08.100
Nigeria do 25 years earlier.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.580
And Collier gives
one example of it.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.320
As a local government in China,
and manufactures nearly 75%

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.640
of all the buttons
worn on the planet.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.960
That was the whole
idea, that if Nigeria

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.414
became the dominant supplier
of one or two rubber

00:30:24.414 --> 00:30:30.660
components in the motor car
to production worldwide,

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.610
Nigeria would be in
a different sphere.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.560
Manufacturing would have
risen dramatically in Nigeria.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.250
So in many ways, I
hold myself personally

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.950
responsible for Nigeria's
failure by not fighting harder.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:44.670
To say this is the way to go.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:49.290
Let all these people
control ideas.

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:49.920
You know?

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.760
Just wear me down,
and I walked away.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.530
That was a big error.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.600
Almost the same reason why,
but in the politics, actually--

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.850
because I was part of this
group called "The Concerned

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:01.475
Professionals."

00:31:01.475 --> 00:31:05.130
And we're professionals
who fought in the military.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.930
Who are against the annulment of
the fair elections of the 12th

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:13.780
of June in 1993, right?

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.950
And in the end, when
the military abandoned--

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:23.540
were running away after all
that struggle-- we thought,

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.880
we are professionals.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.530
We should just go
back to our business

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.350
and let politicians take over.

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.520
So big mistake.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.170
What happened was that
the original politicians--

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.160
the people who followed
[INAUDIBLE], who

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.040
followed Okpara,
Azikiwe, [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.210
were not sure that
these soldiers really

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:44.510
meant to go away.

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.930
So they held back.

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:51.650
And the bad men of the
soldiers, they are contractors,

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.880
became the new politicians.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.790
Nigeria has paid a
very dear price for it.

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:01.840
The deep corruption in our
system came from the culture

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.910
that it brought to politics.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.180
And when I realized what was
going on, it was already late.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.888
Because they came at
a time of big boom.

00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:13.220
Oil prices have
gone to over $100.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.440
It captured the state, extracted
the resources of the state,

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.540
[INAUDIBLE], and used
it to erect a barrier

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.410
into public life.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.890
Nigerian politics
became about money,

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:26.150
which they have stolen
from the Nigerian state,

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.930
and more people could not
get into political life.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:33.632
So in 2005 or so, a
group of us who said,

00:32:33.632 --> 00:32:35.715
no, we shouldn't go into
politics met and we said,

00:32:35.715 --> 00:32:37.010
we made a mistake.

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:38.780
Let's admit it to ourselves.

00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.282
That's how they
said to me, wrong.

00:32:41.282 --> 00:32:42.990
At least just use that
to begin to define

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.810
where Nigeria should be going.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:46.739
JULIET EHIMUAN: Thank
you for sharing those.

00:32:46.739 --> 00:32:48.280
And coming back to
the growth rivals,

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.730
entrepreneurship is
another one you talk about.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.810
And I personally believe that
home-grown entrepreneurship

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.170
is very key to economic
transformation.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.111
What excites you about
the entrepreneurship

00:32:59.111 --> 00:33:01.973
space in Nigeria right now?

00:33:01.973 --> 00:33:04.440
We've seen growth in the
entertainment industry,

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.100
for example, particularly the
music and Nollywood industries.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.780
We've seen virility in the
technology entrepreneurship

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.080
space.

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.550
We are very fast becoming
a helpful innovation.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.208
It's been dubbed the
Silicon Valley of Nigeria.

00:33:19.208 --> 00:33:20.640
We've seen a growth
in e-commerce.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.359
We're attracting foreign
direct investment, and so on.

00:33:24.359 --> 00:33:25.650
What's your take on this space?

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:27.320
And you've been very
involved-- you've

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.070
been quite the entrepreneur
as well, yourself.

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.740
PAT UTOMI: Well,
I guess I was so

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.060
persuaded that that
was the way to go, that

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.820
in the early days of Lagos
Business School, my colleagues

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.425
and I had long battles over
the place of entrepreneurship

00:33:44.425 --> 00:33:46.286
in our programs.

00:33:46.286 --> 00:33:48.980
The argument, which
was reasonable,

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.880
was that we were a general
management institution,

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.640
we should focus on
general management.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.060
I argued that if
Nigeria did not create

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:03.680
an entrepreneurial culture--
[INAUDIBLE] enterprise class--

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.150
we would not be what our
promise is supposed to be.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:13.601
This went on until 1996.

00:34:13.601 --> 00:34:15.440
I think it was March, 1996.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.054
A friend of mine, an African
American investment banker,

00:34:19.054 --> 00:34:21.850
Malcolm Pryor, who
was a Wharton alum

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:25.900
and was on the board of
Wharton, I was visiting with him

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.850
in Philadelphia.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:30.449
And I indicated an interest in
meeting the dean at Wharton.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:34.000
And he set it up, and we both
went to visit with the dean.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.011
And I talked about
entrepreneurship.

00:34:37.011 --> 00:34:38.469
In the course, he
said, oh, we have

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:43.040
a great center, the [INAUDIBLE]
Center of Entrepreneurship.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:47.800
And the guy who runs
it is an African,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.380
is an African
fellow at the time.

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.704
And we went to visit.

00:34:53.704 --> 00:34:57.430
And I saw cubicles
where they were

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.569
providing clinics for local
Philadelphia businessmen.

00:35:00.569 --> 00:35:02.360
It was an opportunity
for them to give back

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.700
to the community much
more than anything else.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.520
When I came back to Lagos, I--
[INAUDIBLE] on my colleagues

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.680
that they gave up.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.480
So I designed and taught the
first entrepreneurship class

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.640
at the Lagos Business School.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.920
And that's how it all started.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.900
That seed eventually became
what is called EDC today,

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.350
Enterprise Development Center
at the Lagos Business School.

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:29.710
And in many ways,
idea for trying

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:35.850
to stimulate entrepreneurship,
somehow when--

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:41.820
again, I went to a West African
Enterprise Network meeting

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:45.167
in 1993, I think it was, or so.

00:35:45.167 --> 00:35:47.000
And people from small
West African countries

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.413
had email addresses.

00:35:48.413 --> 00:35:52.220
We didn't have one in
Nigeria, because we were not

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.820
on the internet.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:57.660
And I came in and challenged
the class that I was teaching.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.360
Somebody from their class came
to me afterwards and said,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.450
you know, we could work
on something together.

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:05.800
That's how Linkserve was born.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.440
And that's how Nigeria got
on the internet, Nigeria's

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.308
first ISP.

00:36:11.308 --> 00:36:14.510
So that developed.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.470
Again, they're
sort of other ones.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:22.149
But the one that I like-- you
know, I romanticize really

00:36:22.149 --> 00:36:23.732
in my conversations--
is in Hollywood.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.730
I used to argue
that Nigeria would

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:35.000
be more competitive selling its
culture than selling crude oil.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.240
There is so much
in Nigerian culture

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.470
that could be packaged properly
and sold around the world.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.990
There was a romantic thing,
literally, to talk about.

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.600
But in Indian fashion, nobody
paid any attention to it.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:51.690
When I saw a group of
out of work men and women

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.700
pick up on old cameras and
begin to make these videos,

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.389
I got excited.

00:36:57.389 --> 00:36:58.930
And I began to
offer-- because I knew

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:00.679
they couldn't afford
it-- I began to offer

00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:02.741
free seminars for them.

00:37:02.741 --> 00:37:05.240
On Saturdays, I'll come in and
do a workshop free of charge.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.380
So this is a business.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.210
You've got to operate
yourself like a business.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:14.910
So go back 20 years,
and you see Nigeria

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.140
trying to rebuild its economy
and pointing to Nollywood.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.662
And I said, look
at these people who

00:37:19.662 --> 00:37:22.360
all laughed at me 20 years ago.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.580
But it makes one feel
good [INAUDIBLE] part

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:25.687
of the process like that.

00:37:25.687 --> 00:37:26.770
JULIET EHIMUAN: Fantastic.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.311
PAT UTOMI: The future
going forward I

00:37:28.311 --> 00:37:32.690
think is going to depend
very much-- I say this

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.630
with respect for everybody.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:39.660
I think the repats, the young
Nigerian men and women educated

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:43.570
abroad who are coming home
will be the ultimate stimulants

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.530
of the new economy.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:49.380
Because of the experience, the
exposure, where they've been.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.600
When they come back, I think
that entrepreneurial zest

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.520
will drive it.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.020
JULIET EHIMUAN: And
I agree with you

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:59.870
that industries like our
music industry and Nollywood

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:03.940
are, in many ways, exporting
aspects of Nigerian culture.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.970
And even financially,
putting that online,

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.780
talking into the export market.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:10.560
PAT UTOMI: Yeah.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.650
If I may just-- it's
not just that, you know,

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.870
as entrepreneurs they will
create wealth and all of that.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:20.770
But they are also agents of
soft power for a country.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:23.890
A couple of years ago,
some friends of mine,

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.730
Nigerian doctors
in California who

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.220
travel out every year
to some African country,

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:34.012
on some goodwill initiative to
offer free medical services,

00:38:34.012 --> 00:38:38.656
were in Congo, Democratic
Republic of Congo.

00:38:38.656 --> 00:38:42.410
And it was election time,
and all the [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:46.290
around the place was
Camilla [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.093
[INAUDIBLE] called
me and said, you're

00:38:48.093 --> 00:38:49.310
not going to believe this.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:51.780
I mean, [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.035
And all the billboards,
Camilla [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:54.035 --> 00:39:01.590
So I asked somebody, there's
a Nigerian word like that.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.180
Is any language group here
that speaks that kind of?

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:06.110
[INAUDIBLE] Nollywood.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.163
The big man in town
is [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:08.163 --> 00:39:12.600
so Camilla's campaign
was Camilla [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.828
That meant it was a [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:15.828 --> 00:39:20.320
JULIET EHIMUAN: I'll just tough
on two other growth drivers,

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:23.638
and then we can take
questions from the audience.

00:39:23.638 --> 00:39:26.482
So still on all of the
benefits of entrepreneurship

00:39:26.482 --> 00:39:29.781
[INAUDIBLE], which is a huge
challenge in Nigeria today?

00:39:29.781 --> 00:39:31.155
We know that
unemployment figures

00:39:31.155 --> 00:39:34.424
are in the double digits.

00:39:34.424 --> 00:39:36.820
From your perspective, and
based on your experience,

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.810
how do you think we can
create jobs at scale?

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:47.530
PAT UTOMI: Again, the kind
of areas of new enterprise

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:52.560
that will determine what
kinds of jobs we create.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:56.770
Nigeria is in a position
to tap into the [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:00.300
to create a
demographic dividend.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:02.940
What unfortunately
has happened to us

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.470
is that we've had a
jobless growth economy.

00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:12.250
And this is for a
variety of reasons.

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:18.370
A lot of the growth has taken
place driven sometimes by oil,

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:23.582
and has gone to a
few people in what

00:40:23.582 --> 00:40:27.090
is a significantly
divergent Gini

00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:29.180
measure, a Gini index,
a coefficient of income

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.100
distribution.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:35.180
A few people capture
most of the wealth.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.552
And because they're really
not truly entrepreneurs,

00:40:38.552 --> 00:40:41.410
the money just
leaves the country.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.972
They're essentially extracting
rent from the system.

00:40:43.972 --> 00:40:45.430
But if they were
entrepreneurs that

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.512
were trying to create
additional wealth,

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:51.660
we would make a
lot more progress.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:55.690
So if we encourage
an enterprise class

00:40:55.690 --> 00:41:01.970
that [INAUDIBLE] has done, in a
number of jobs he has created.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:05.800
But you can do that
even in tech economy.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.290
You can do that in other areas.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:09.820
If it brought the
number of people

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:15.000
were involved in enterprises
that actually create

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.720
wealth, not extract rent.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:23.480
So I think that we need to
provide certain incentives

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.234
for certain kinds of businesses
that have [INAUDIBLE] again

00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:31.460
factor endowments in which we
can create value chains that

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.290
are global.

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.090
And each part of
this country has

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.300
a certain set of endowments.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.950
Of course, you can
compete globally.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.150
Look at Central Nigeria.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:46.610
Sesame seeds grow in
the wild, literally.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.530
Imagine if you organized
people, and they have

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:51.230
plantations of sesame seeds.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.620
And they process,
and they supply

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.000
to every McDonald's
hamburger store in Europe

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.560
from out of-- and millions
and millions of dollars,

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.790
and they would create
hundreds of thousands

00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:05.860
of jobs, just on
Sesame seeds alone.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:10.570
You go to various areas.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:17.890
Nigeria has this long coast
line of oil and gas assets.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:19.510
If you just said
to everybody who

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:25.620
wanted to sell they had a
couple value chain products can

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.270
establish, export, do
whatever from there

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:32.526
and create millions of jobs only
had to cover the value chain.

00:42:32.526 --> 00:42:34.102
So it has to be focused.

00:42:34.102 --> 00:42:35.910
It has to be targeted.

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:38.920
And there have to be sets
of incentives that encourage

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.170
those kinds of
investments, and government

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.637
has to get out of the way.

00:42:43.637 --> 00:42:46.262
The more you can get government
out of the way, the more likely

00:42:46.262 --> 00:42:50.390
it is that you can create
these opportunities.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.860
JULIET EHIMUAN: So I'm
going to pause at this point

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.090
and see the questions
from the audience.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:57.747
I know a number of questions
were submitted online.

00:42:57.747 --> 00:43:00.336
Just see if anyone
in the room wants

00:43:00.336 --> 00:43:04.200
to raise a question before we
go into what we have online.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:18.520
PAT UTOMI: "Patito's Gang,"
you know, talking legacy,

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.450
maybe that will
ultimately be my legacy.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:23.890
Because I get
stopped at airports

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:28.150
as far away as Los Angeles, LAX.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:30.650
And somebody has run up to me
and say, excuse me, excuse me,

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:34.645
are you-- and then I hear
this "Patito's Gang" story.

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:37.400
You know, Nigerians who now live
around the world who say they

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.840
grew up on "Patito's Gang."

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.330
I feel good about that.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.900
It was just about creating
a marketplace of ideas.

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:49.210
Unless a nation can get good
quality conversation going,

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:52.290
it will not create the
ideas that it requires

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:54.530
to get-- that are acceptable.

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.450
Everybody owns the move forward.

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:01.600
And people don't know
the kind of sacrifice

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.060
I made to put that program up.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:07.636
When I produced--
when we started,

00:44:07.636 --> 00:44:10.770
I wanted for it to be the
best possible quality.

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:16.420
In fact, the first director was
American who lived in Nigeria.

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:18.504
And we had, in the
then director general,

00:44:18.504 --> 00:44:19.920
or immediate past
director general

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.360
of NTA engineer
[INAUDIBLE] man who

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.450
told me, after the first two
episodes, and said to me,

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.410
it's impossible to
sustain that quality.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:31.060
Because we had roof shots.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:35.310
We had all kinds of--
but wanted to do it well.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.300
And after three
episodes, I get a call

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.470
from a friend of mine,
managing director of one

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.760
of the most successful
commercial banks

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.810
in the country.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:46.650
And he says to me, oh, Pat,
what a fantastic-- he goes on

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:47.582
and on and on.

00:44:47.582 --> 00:44:49.540
When he finished, I said
to him, you know what?

00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:52.220
I'm glad you love it, because
we need commercial support

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:53.775
for that thing to be air.

00:44:53.775 --> 00:44:56.880
He said, oh, Pat, but you guys
speak the truth, you know.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.265
And truth is not--

00:44:58.265 --> 00:44:59.356
JULIET EHIMUAN: Lucrative.

00:44:59.356 --> 00:45:01.230
PAT UTOMI: You know, I
wouldn't want somebody

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:04.582
to think that I'm putting
you guys up to that speaking

00:45:04.582 --> 00:45:06.927
of the truth, you know?

00:45:06.927 --> 00:45:08.760
But the day you will
do sports, let me know.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.270
We'll pay twice as much.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.380
But that was part
of the problem.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.510
Actually, the reason
I could keep that

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.946
show running for
as long as I did--

00:45:17.946 --> 00:45:19.620
it was more than 10 years.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.200
It did come back after
a one-year break.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.930
It was on until last year,
second quarter of last year,

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:32.140
but when it first started,
it was on the NTA network.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.120
It was on channels.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.450
It was literally on
every television at work.

00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:40.570
And not only did we spend a
lot of money to produce it,

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:44.280
we paid those television
stations to air it.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.590
That's the kind of
business model we have.

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:51.580
Instead of them to pay you
for content, you paid to air.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:55.340
And the way that [INAUDIBLE]
television going was we

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.320
had-- the computer was set off.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:04.710
Had a big institutional
advertising contract

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:09.030
with a big multinational, and
something completely different

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:12.520
that was called
leadership reflections.

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.430
But they paid us so well
that the entire gain

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.560
from that, and more,
we had to fight

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.850
for-- went into that program--
was one particular year,

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:25.235
it cost me literally
100 million naira

00:46:25.235 --> 00:46:28.890
to keep "Patito's
Gang" on the air.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:31.190
Advertising revenue,
Nigerian companies

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:35.136
were scared to advertise on
a program that spoke truth

00:46:35.136 --> 00:46:37.100
to power.

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:42.280
So you see how challenging
it can be out there.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.470
So after many years, I
have become literally

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:48.560
bankrupt from trying to do
service to the Nigerian people.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.120
And I thought, I
better stop this.

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.510
And as soon as I stopped,
everybody started complaining.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.270
So we had to try and get back.

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.320
But yes, I'd be pleased
to do another one.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.700
JULIET EHIMUAN: And
probably-- because it

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.620
sounds like a great
output for the Center

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:02.550
for Values and Leadership.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:05.900
And with the digital
world today, right?

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.330
Production cost had to
be so high, et cetera.

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.900
And there's more
room for sharing,

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.795
and for people to help
amplify that voice, et cetera.

00:47:14.795 --> 00:47:17.775
So it's something that
could be working online.

00:47:17.775 --> 00:47:18.650
PAT UTOMI: Yes, yeah.

00:47:18.650 --> 00:47:19.608
JULIET EHIMUAN: Online.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:30.110
PAT UTOMI: And about
being at the table,

00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:32.091
I talked to that earlier.

00:47:32.091 --> 00:47:35.230
You see, there's
more than enough

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.836
power in the hands of
young people today.

00:47:38.836 --> 00:47:41.600
You're using social
media and all of that

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.270
to just educate each
other about the fact

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:48.256
that this is not going
to be accepted by us.

00:47:48.256 --> 00:47:49.505
Because you have the majority!

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:55.970
60% of those who will
vote in the next election

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:58.170
will be under the age of 30.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:03.240
Imagine if only 50% of
those decide that this

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.280
is the way we want to go.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.379
They can't stop you from being
at the table if you organize,

00:48:10.379 --> 00:48:11.170
about organization.

00:48:13.805 --> 00:48:23.930
A book written in 1911, I
think, on the political parties,

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.990
and political parties
is about organization.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:32.450
Organization is about
political police.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:38.770
He who says organization
essentially says oligarchy.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:42.880
The guy's name is
Robert Michaels.

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:47.150
Once political parties emerge,
they will be oligarchies.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:49.090
A few people will control them.

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:54.750
But if young people use correct
technology to build a different

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:58.630
idea base, different ideology,
they can send the nation

00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:59.870
travelling a different track.

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:11.080
PAT UTOMI: Now about the guy who
has all his money in dollars.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.580
First of all, there are so
many foolish people in Nigeria,

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.988
because I consider
it foolishness.

00:49:16.988 --> 00:49:18.710
You are developing
other economies

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:23.610
and starving your own country of
oxygen. And maybe I'm foolish,

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:28.916
but I don't have much-- I tell
people I don't have a room.

00:49:28.916 --> 00:49:30.522
Most people have several houses.

00:49:30.522 --> 00:49:31.230
I was in Nigeria.

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:33.779
I don't have a room
outside Nigeria.

00:49:33.779 --> 00:49:35.820
Almost every investment,
just about-- not almost.

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.680
Every investment I
have is in Nigeria.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:43.760
I probably can find 20,000
pounds or something that I

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.420
leave abroad just
in case I can't send

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.740
my childrens' [INAUDIBLE]
quickly enough from Nigerian

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.202
banks.

00:49:50.202 --> 00:49:51.910
But I would never
probably have much more

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.870
than that outside Nigeria.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:56.620
For people who are
not particular wise,

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:01.040
it might seem like something
prestigious, or something

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.080
that they play safe with.

00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.540
But you know what happens?

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.990
Most of them, most of them
die and leave all that money.

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:11.230
Because there are usually
not man enough to even

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.470
tell their wives that
they have such money.

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:17.495
So it is not wisdom,
it's foolishness.

00:50:23.745 --> 00:50:25.120
That is said very
often, but it's

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.620
one of those lies that the
system structures to, you know,

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:30.850
let people feed on.

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:33.410
First of all, the Senate is a
completely useless institution.

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:36.230
It has no power whatsoever,
affects nothing,

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:37.230
as far as I'm concerned.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:40.210
Except the [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:40.210 --> 00:50:43.150
If we need to
restructure government,

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:47.760
I would go to a unicameral
legislature that is very small.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.810
[INAUDIBLE], who is
currently a minister,

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:54.790
after serving in the Senate,
when I was running in 2006,

00:50:54.790 --> 00:51:00.274
said to me, you know, the
years I spent in the Senate

00:51:00.274 --> 00:51:01.690
were the biggest
waste of my life.

00:51:04.372 --> 00:51:08.910
They do very little
in terms of value add.

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:10.510
It's culture.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:13.280
It's a culture of executive.

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.620
You have the strings.

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:16.910
Because all people
are looking for

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:19.590
is the purse who can
hold the purse strings.

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:22.630
Everybody comes
bowing before you.

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:26.820
And not knowing that you can use
the instruments to do greater

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:29.370
good, they focus
on the power side.

00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:33.140
So I really don't believe
in the legislature thing.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:35.634
It can be wonderful,
legislature.

00:51:35.634 --> 00:51:37.050
But the way it's
structured today,

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:38.480
you contribute freely to it.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:44.430
If we return to a elementary
British, Westminster type

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:49.310
system, then I would
value the legislature.

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:52.410
Right now, really the
only thing that matters

00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:54.920
is the executive branch.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.040
Judiciary can be very important.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.080
They do certain things
to help the building

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:00.672
of the institutions.

00:52:00.672 --> 00:52:01.630
But you know the track.

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:05.220
There is a different track.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:09.090
The other part of
the question is

00:52:09.090 --> 00:52:16.220
about what I think of the
way things are right now.

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:18.850
I think that what has affected
the way things are right now,

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:26.490
same reason why the [INAUDIBLE]
who ran-- how did we get here?

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:30.155
Again, history often does not
get written fairly or properly.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.050
From my experience
in 2007, I was

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:41.060
convinced that if Nigeria did
not build a viable opposition,

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.070
Nigeria was not going
to get very far.

00:52:44.070 --> 00:52:48.130
If power does not go
from one group in power

00:52:48.130 --> 00:52:51.870
today to another-- their
position nobody feeds

00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:57.124
the incumbent regime,
democracy will not

00:52:57.124 --> 00:52:58.332
be different in this country.

00:52:58.332 --> 00:53:01.090
And so my commitment
from the beginning

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:05.220
was in working with
an opposition group

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.290
to build a true opposition.

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:11.160
In post-colonial Africa,
there's a concept

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:15.290
of the corporatist state, where
the state tries to incorporate

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:17.632
a strong voice of opposition.

00:53:17.632 --> 00:53:20.750
You get appointed a
minister by people

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:24.990
who don't like you so that
they can keep you quiet.

00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:26.480
[INAUDIBLE] in Africa.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:30.085
At some point in
time, [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:30.085 --> 00:53:31.460
to become an
attorney general was

00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.675
becoming president of the
Nigerian Bar Association.

00:53:33.675 --> 00:53:36.050
Because the Bar Association
used to give a lot of trouble

00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:36.730
to government.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.850
[INAUDIBLE] becoming
Minister of Health

00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.930
was President of the
Nigerian Medical Association.

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:48.826
As an example I like to
give-- [INAUDIBLE] to him--

00:53:48.826 --> 00:53:53.270
a very strong leader of
the enemy [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:56.280
became minister of health,
and the government usually

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.890
used him to destroy the enemy.

00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:01.240
And the day he was
dropped from the cabinet,

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.430
a person close to him
said he cried like a baby.

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:07.040
He had nowhere to go back
to, and nobody has ever

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.720
since heard of him.

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.705
So many times that
I've been asked

00:54:12.705 --> 00:54:17.110
to cabinet positions, questions
that I've always asked

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:18.500
is, to do what?

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.225
If you want me in a team, I
want a certain critical mass

00:54:22.225 --> 00:54:25.010
of people who
believe in something.

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:26.910
And you must believe
in a certain agenda

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:31.620
that we all agree to
before the journey starts.

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:35.730
So what you do see happening
is going on right now,

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:41.730
is that I think we have
a team that isn't even

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.444
[INAUDIBLE] the
person who's leading.

00:54:46.147 --> 00:54:47.980
I think that most
ambassadors of the cabinet

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:50.410
will tell you that they don't
agree with the policies that

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:52.212
have left these petrol queues.

00:54:52.212 --> 00:54:53.670
They will tell you
they don't agree

00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:56.090
with the policies that
have created a mess

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:57.940
in the foreign exchange market.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:03.650
They will tell you they don't
agree with the policies that

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:07.780
are affecting, very
sadly, [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:11.410
of educational system
and so on and so forth.

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.360
But everybody is
looking ineffectual,

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.980
because people haven't
developed the culture

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:23.240
of saying "I'm sorry, this is
not what we agreed, I quit."

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.020
But I think that
that is very useful,

00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:31.370
to send a signal to
people who have authority.

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:35.017
JULIET EHIMUAN: Well,
thank you very much, Prof.

00:55:35.017 --> 00:55:36.350
I know there are many questions.

00:55:36.350 --> 00:55:38.290
I do apologize.

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:40.210
I also have a lot
of questions, but we

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:44.313
can't get to them, because Prof
has a lecture this afternoon.

00:55:44.313 --> 00:55:46.830
So we have to wrap up.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:49.428
But we can continue the
conversation online.

00:55:49.428 --> 00:55:51.136
To wrap up, I'm just
going to ask, what's

00:55:51.136 --> 00:55:53.280
the next chapter for you?

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.940
What do the next
60 years look like?

00:55:55.940 --> 00:56:00.090
PAT UTOMI: Oh, this is going to
sound a little corny, because I

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.710
keep telling people--
young people,

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:04.840
and it's the truth--
from very early,

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.310
I had the good fortune of
re-instituting [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:09.040
very early in my life.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.730
And so I had a vision statement.

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:14.280
I had personal missions.

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.960
I had all of those things.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:22.150
But I tell you, it's important
to live it one day at a time.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:25.380
However, I think that, as
I keep making this point,

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:31.090
that Nigeria has a major
public life challenge, that

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:34.620
is going to take
individual effort to move

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.170
Nigeria towards its destiny.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:40.790
I'm looking to play
private roles that

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:45.830
can have transformative
impact in the economy.

00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:48.620
I look at Nigeria
at a time when,

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:53.080
given its general endowments--
human, particularly--

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:58.615
and the possibilities in Africa
seen from the era of Afro

00:56:58.615 --> 00:57:02.232
pessimism to one in which
significant progress is

00:57:02.232 --> 00:57:07.240
expected, that private capital
can come into this country

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.560
from elsewhere, if we can
manage to do enough talking

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.830
to get government out of
the way and change not just

00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:16.660
infrastructure.

00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:20.680
Look, the Chinese
have significant money

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.550
that they have put aside to
do industrial parks in Africa,

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:26.400
with success in those.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:30.130
There are infrastructure hubs
developing out of Australia,

00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:33.520
and all of the private capital
and common infrastructure.

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:35.840
Nigeria has been talking
about a second major bridge

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.055
for forever.

00:57:38.055 --> 00:57:40.305
Bangladesh, one of the poorest
countries in the world,

00:57:40.305 --> 00:57:44.590
is building several bridges,
an underground tunnel,

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:45.535
the estuary.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:52.090
We need thinking
people to engage

00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:57.550
as private,
non-government actors

00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:01.410
in the international economic
arena for our country.

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:04.550
And in some ways,
[INAUDIBLE] myself,

00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:07.940
I'm an appointed
ambassador in that area.

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:11.464
And I hope that this will
make some contribution.

00:58:11.464 --> 00:58:12.380
JULIET EHIMUAN: Right.

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.180
We could go on and on, but
we'll continue the conversation

00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:15.860
online.

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:17.360
Thank you so much, Prof.

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:24.010
[APPLAUSE]
