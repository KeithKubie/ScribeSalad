00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.270
IKY SANDORFFY: My name is Iky.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.850
I look after Google Play
business development

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.140
for Middle East and Africa.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.640
And with me today
is Hugo, who's going

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.820
to come up on stage
in a couple of minutes

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.510
to talk about Maliyo Games, a
very successful game developer

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.450
out of Lagos, Nigeria,
who develops specifically

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.784
titles for emerging markets
out of emerging markets.

00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:25.200
So today, you're going to hear
a lot of designated content

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.760
that speaks to growth
in user acquisition

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.470
and into device penetration.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.900
But with this talk,
we'd like to invite

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.897
you to think about
the next billion users

00:00:35.897 --> 00:00:37.980
and where they're going
to come from, particularly

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.020
with regards to user growth.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.030
So we've seen
astounding development

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.650
in the last couple of years.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.740
I'm sure we all have highly
capable devices in our pockets.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.890
We have high-speed data
connection that are always on.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.620
And the data you pay
for today is pretty much

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.220
a lot cheaper than it was just
two, three, or four years ago.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.130
But every now and again,
it's important to really take

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.350
a moment and reflect
what has happened

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.290
over the last couple of years
that got us to this point,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.390
and see how we can
take those learnings

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.030
to really continue and
accelerate that growth

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.800
over the next coming years.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.190
Again, particularly with
regards to user growth.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.890
So again, today
we will be talking

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.950
about building high-quality
games and apps that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.430
work effectively, not
only for the user of today

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.978
but for the users of
the next coming years.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.220
So we've seen tremendous
growth from emerging markets.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.800
And we've projected about
80% of smartphone growth

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.450
globally is going to come
from emerging markets in 2019.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.680
As more users get
access to these devices,

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.660
they get connected
for the first time.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.320
And the first time making
any experiences with the web,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.730
they will be
looking for new ways

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.940
to experience the internet, to
shop, to entertain themselves,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.930
to communicate.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.930
And that, in itself, is bringing
up a massive opportunity

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.580
for all of us in this room.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.000
So again, 80% of smartphone
growth up until 2019

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.490
will be coming from
emerging markets.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.400
So what's important
here is to then

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.740
look at the challenges
these users face,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.710
and to start designing
experiences that

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.479
will cater to these challenges.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:17.520
I'm backing this up with
numbers from Google Play

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.520
that Mark referenced in
his early keynote today.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.190
We see a tremendous increase in
accelerated growth in downloads

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.740
as well as in consumer
spend from emerging markets.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.870
And we don't see any
indication that this

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.030
is going to stop anytime soon.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.550
So if you compare emerging
markets with developed markets,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.700
we see significantly
faster growth,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.620
just about four times as fast.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.420
Well, consumer spend is double.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.100
And we expect this
to further grow.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.390
It's an exciting trend, and
it's important to realize

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.640
that this is happening.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.090
Yet, put this in context and see
where this growth is actually

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.590
coming from.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.410
So first, we all know
fast networks are awesome.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.170
We all have instant information
and instant capabilities

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.730
in our pockets today.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.000
But if you look at the reality
of today, still just about half

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.140
of mobile internet usage is
coming from a 2G connection.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.500
And I'm setting out an
open question to this room,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.260
when was the last time you
were on a 2G connection?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.930
When was the last time you
actually opened your own game

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.120
or app from a 2G connection?

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.400
If you extrapolate this
out and project what's

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.120
going to happen until 2020,
we still expect 1 in 3 users

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.420
to be-- or just about 1
in 3 users to be on 2G.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.660
And that resembles
about 1 billion users.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.120
So definitely, a
massive opportunity.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.250
But again, with
different challenges

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.150
that need to be
addressed accordingly.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.560
For example, if you look at
the variation of network speed

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.680
and the availability of
networks just across the board,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.210
you can see, for example here,
India on the center right.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.770
Average speed of Indian
usage, Indian internet usage--

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.220
pardon me-- is about a
tenth of that in the UK.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.860
While the quality and the
adoption of high-speed networks

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.680
is very low.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.580
Just about 1 in 5, or 20%
of broadband connections

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.020
are above 4
megabytes per second.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.490
So again, data availability
being very scarce

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.980
and the speeds once you
get there are very low.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.510
So these users
behave significantly

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.880
different from the users today.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.850
Finally, another one of key
challenges in emerging markets

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.019
is the data cost.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.300
Data is expensive in
a lot of these markets

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.390
and they're just about
to go down in prices.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.660
Just look at
comparative data here

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.850
that actually looks at
the comparative data cost

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.610
as relative to the gross
income of the median household

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.600
and you can see that at
a data plan in Nigeria

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.320
it's about 10 times as
much relative to the UK

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.680
so again these are super
sensitive to how data is

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.150
being consumed from your app.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.460
And being good stewards
of their data plan

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.160
is just appreciated
and good business.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.120
So with that in mind, we
want to help and drive

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.290
the engagement in those regions.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.520
And to support the
growth in these markets,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.450
we have created a framework,
which we call the next billion.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.520
And it's centered around
six key topics which

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.360
I will outline very briefly now,
and reference some resources

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.390
where you can read up
in a lot more detail

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.790
about these elements.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.280
So without further
ado, if you're

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.550
looking at the six
pillars that we

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.966
invite you to take
a look at, it's

00:05:24.966 --> 00:05:29.070
connectivity, device,
compatibility, data cost,

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.770
battery consumption,
content, and commerce.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.830
And again, I'm going to cover
everything very briefly.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.330
We're going to be
here all afternoon

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.840
if you want to speak about
any of those in more detail.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.710
So connectivity.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.520
By the way, just
wanted to outline.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.890
This by no means just the best
practice for emerging markets.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.830
These are good practices
and good principles

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.800
to implement even
for the users today.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.950
So connectivity.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.856
You want to assure smooth
loading of your content.

00:05:57.856 --> 00:05:59.730
You should prioritize
your bandwidth requests

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.410
and make sure that the top
requests are served first.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.730
That the most useful
and relevant information

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.230
is loaded at the beginning.

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.410
For example, loading text
before you're loading images.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.110
Don't duplicate your
network requests,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.170
and save files locally
where applicable.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.930
You could use the Connectivity
Manager, which is actually

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.240
a dynamic API that
gives you feedback

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.220
on what kind of connectivity you
should expect from this device,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.820
and then change your
app serving accordingly.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.910
Images are typically the biggest
perpetrators of slow load

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.550
time and slow connectivity.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.110
So I invite you to think about
the standards of the images you

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.610
load.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.610
Which formats which
resolution you actually load,

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.380
and where it becomes relevant.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.870
And make sure that you're
using the appropriate sizes

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.390
of those images.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.540
Lastly, with regards
to connectivity,

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.700
I encourage you all to look at
how your app and game performs

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.380
in an offline environment.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.440
Just go ahead, turn your
phone into airplane mode.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.420
Open up your app and
see what happens.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.430
See where it
actually finds bugs.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.770
See where it actually
gets stuck and what

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.190
experiences you need to improve
to assure a good offline

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.890
experience.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.890
Moving on to device
compatibility.

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.250
A huge range of devices with
big screens, small screens,

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.520
expandable storage, small
storage, high-density screens,

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.310
and so forth.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:31.230
I guess all of us face
the issue of developing

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.670
an app and a game
that can really

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.750
run on all of these devices.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.480
So you should look at what
capacity your app is actually

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.820
invoking, and then
optimize for that.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.280
Keep in mind that a lot of
these devices that we're

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.580
talking about are still 1
megabyte in RAM and below.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:51.000
So you should think about
how your app actually runs

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.540
in these kind of environments.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.260
And games should be
optimized to render smoothly

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.060
in those kinds of environments.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.110
Look at screen sizes.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:05.420
As I mentioned, these
devices that are coming on

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.930
are likely to be low cost.

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.250
They are likely to be
longer in their lifecycles.

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.130
And you want to make sure that
you have your exposure tested

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.620
on different screen
sizes, screen resolution,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.005
and pixel densities.

00:08:19.005 --> 00:08:23.090
[INAUDIBLE] mentioned
before that the new emulator

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.650
in Android Studio
is vastly improved.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.620
It's increased in speed and it
allows you to test very quickly

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.610
for these elements.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.820
So changing the device
resolution and the device size.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.240
Just as an example, why would
you load high-resolution image

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.909
on a low-resolution device?

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:43.785
That's just a lot of waste
in many different factors.

00:08:43.785 --> 00:08:47.104
Moving on to efficient
memory usage.

00:08:47.104 --> 00:08:48.520
Users see that
screen at all time.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.190
They can get a push
notification when

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.600
their memory is running out.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.970
And they can actually
see a sorted list

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.960
of how much memory and
how much storage your apps

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.660
are actually using.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.430
So here's the pro
tip for this one.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.070
You can use the API
call of is low RAM

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.950
and actually get
feedback in real time

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.470
to figure out if this is
a highly-capable device

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.940
or a low-capable device.

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.770
And then, change your
processes accordingly.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.590
Also, background processing.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.270
Background processing
is typically

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:23.790
what drives up a lot of the
storage on the user's device.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.240
And that's perfectly fine.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.260
Many apps may invoke
processes in the background,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.790
but you should be good stewards
of your user's device memory.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.400
And so you want to start up
your background processes,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.870
finish them, try to bundle
them into one round,

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.380
and then shut down the
process in order not

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.570
to drain the user's memory
as well as the battery.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.160
Moving on to smart storage.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.310
Think about installing or just
running this one line of code

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.660
that allows users to push
their apps onto their SD card.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.730
This can go a long
way for devices

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.950
with expandable storage.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.780
As I mentioned before,
users can actually

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.890
sort how much data is
consumed and how much space

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.590
is consumed on
your phone and can

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.040
see the list of the most
draining apps on top, which

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.200
will then drive a lot of the
uninstalls, uninstall rates up.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.250
So you want to keep your device
consumption low and make sure

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:25.710
that you are frequently clearing
the cache that you're creating.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.870
This one is a tip that
I'm sure you're not

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.730
going to hear often today.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.447
So this is the
one and only time,

00:10:32.447 --> 00:10:33.780
I guess, you will hear us today.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.720
But think about
backwards compatibility.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.370
Think about these
new users coming

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.400
online with slightly
older devices

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.740
and not necessarily always on
the latest version of Android.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:50.070
So I'd invite you to run your
apps with the minimum SDK 14,

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.750
but target SDK 23 in
order to really cater

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.450
to a wide variety of users that
are being kept with the latest

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:58.410
features.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.480
Also, think about integrating
the Google Play Services

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.450
API because it will ensure that
the users get updates on time.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.460
And we will make sure that
the users are catered to

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.170
with the features that actually
work for their devices.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.810
Moving on, and I'm
already finishing off.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.120
So Hugo, get ready.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.700
It's your time to
speak in a minute.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.260
I'm looking at data costs.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.320
As we said before, data is
expensive in these countries.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.120
And it's only very
slowly becoming cheaper.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.820
We're used to having
cheap, always-on data.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.510
But the reality is
about half of users

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.640
don't have that privilege today.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.430
Installing your app is an
actual cost to the user.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.780
And think about how sizable
your APK actually is.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.720
How much space and
how much data usage

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.730
the user's actually
going to consume

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.470
by just downloading your app.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.200
If you have a prepaid package
for 200 megabytes a month,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.330
how likely are you to
actually download a game that

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.990
is 100 megabytes on free data?

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.940
So again, think
about your APK size.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.440
And there is a great talk from
Google I/O, which I encourage

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.356
you to take a look at.

00:12:05.356 --> 00:12:07.830
It's called "Put
Your APK on a Diet."

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.610
Definitely, worth checking out.

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:13.620
The sweet spot for emerging
markets is around 10 megabytes.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.180
That's what you
should be aiming for.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.430
We see a high drop-off
with every megabyte

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.747
that you add in weight.

00:12:18.747 --> 00:12:21.330
Now, we realize for a lot of the
game developers in this room,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.000
this number is
completely unreasonable.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.757
Building a high-quality 3D game
in 10 megabytes is very tricky.

00:12:28.757 --> 00:12:30.465
And oftentimes, the
third-party libraries

00:12:30.465 --> 00:12:32.790
you're using on
their own are already

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.630
exceeding those 10 megabytes.

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.260
So if you can't make
this number work,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.510
and this number sounds
completely unreasonable to you,

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.490
consider multi-APK.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:44.640
Launching multiple APKs into
different device categories

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.400
just to make sure that you can
cater to those users as well.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.720
So again, users are
sensitive to APK sizes.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.000
Images, as we noted before,
are the biggest offenders

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.750
with this.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.860
You want to reduce
costs, and you

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.390
want to consider
multi-APK to serve this.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:03.450
Again, Android Studio
and Firebase Analytics

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.105
allows you to test and
see how much data your app

00:13:06.105 --> 00:13:07.620
is actually consuming.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.880
You can benchmark the data.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.420
And being, again, good
stewards of this data

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.750
will go a long way
with the users.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.770
Moving to battery consumption.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.980
You want to eliminate
unnecessary wake-ups.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.760
You want to batch your network
requests whenever they come in.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.611
And you want to use the
Network Manager API.

00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:28.360
Again, which can give
you feedback on what

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.920
kind of network is expected.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.450
Moving on to content.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.970
Users everywhere want
tailored content.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.070
We know this from our own data.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.480
When we're looking
at Google Play

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.810
and we optimize it for
different scenarios,

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.960
highlighting and surfacing
specific tailored content

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.020
for a local audience, we
see significant improvements

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.850
in adoption and engagement.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:53.640
So localization is important.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.710
Think about fast,
responsive of UIs.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.870
Think about the UI best
practices, which we talked

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.290
about today in material design.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:06.340
These are all best
practices to really cater

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.340
to a user in a
local environment.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.800
To make sure that
they feel at home

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.591
and that they feel that
this environment is

00:14:12.591 --> 00:14:15.230
tailored for their use.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.390
Last but not least, commerce.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.360
We all strive to make this a
business and not just a fun

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.350
exercise.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.405
So catering to those markets.

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:26.390
You want to adjust your
monetization strategy

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.680
accordingly.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.990
There's multiple different
ways of driving revenue

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.190
from these markets.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.950
Obviously, users are
more sensitive to price.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:39.380
But you want to use multiple
different monetization schemes

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.402
to really figure
out what works best.

00:14:41.402 --> 00:14:42.860
Some of which might
be best catered

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.040
to with in-app purchases while
other markets are specifically

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.270
more susceptible to ad revenue.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:52.340
So when driving
different ways, we

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.490
want to make Google Play a
commerce platform for you

00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:01.380
and enable good businesses
in those regions as well.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.984
So think about the
barrier of entry.

00:15:03.984 --> 00:15:05.150
Where do you want to charge?

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:07.640
At what levels and
what price points do

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.070
you want to charge
for your content?

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.860
And offer prices
in local currency.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.490
We've just referred to earlier
about pricing templates.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.965
I encourage you to use those.

00:15:17.965 --> 00:15:19.340
And to make sure
that your prices

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.450
are adjusted in the local
currency at the right numbers.

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.790
And in addition to that,
you should also take a look

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.770
at the Big Mac
index, the purchasing

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.590
power of a single dollar
in a single country.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.600
If you multiplied
that with the prices

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.400
you're actually charging,
you automatically

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.860
become more sensible
to that local market

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.420
because you're
charging something

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:43.400
that is actually equivalent
to what users can afford.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.200
So I'm summarizing the
points we've made earlier.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.080
And again, there's
a lot of resources

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.080
which I'll share
after Hugo's talk

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.990
on how to really look
at these best practices,

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.820
figure out which ones
are relevant for you,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.560
and then go out
and implement them.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.650
But if there's three main
pieces of information

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.280
that I would like to share today
and to encourage you to take

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.170
home with you after
this talk, it's

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.580
that 1 billion users will
still be on 2G by 2020.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.160
The average mobile data speed
in Vietnam, India, Argentina,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.030
Brazil is below 4
megabytes per second.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.120
And the relative cost of
data in emerging market

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.000
is about 10 times higher
compared to that in the UK.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.200
So think about fast apps that
are reliable and lightweight

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.530
in order to best cater for the
next billion users and leverage

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:32.320
that growth going forward.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.650
With that, I would
like to-- oh, sorry,

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.590
that was the wrong button.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:41.240
I would like to invite
Hugo Obi from Maliyo Games

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.245
to speak about his
experience developing

00:16:43.245 --> 00:16:44.120
for emerging markets.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:52.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.630
HUGO OBI: Hi.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.270
So it's a real pleasure
to be here today.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.450
As Iky said, my
name is Hugo Obi.

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.490
I'm from Maliyo Games
in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:05.440
We build locally
relevant games, primarily

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.119
for the Nigeria market.

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:09.460
Our vision is to share
the African narrative

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.680
with the world through games.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.430
Just show of hands, who has
been to the African continent

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.430
before?

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.070
Excellent.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.750
And secondly, who's
been to Nigeria before?

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:23.579
Fantastic.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.150
A few people in the room.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.089
So you would understand how
unique this part of the world

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.850
is in terms of connectivity.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.884
So I'll just run through a
little bit of a background

00:17:33.884 --> 00:17:35.800
about Africa, talk a
little bit about Nigeria,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.770
and then we're going to
go diving a little bit

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.066
into a specific
user segmentation

00:17:42.066 --> 00:17:45.010
that I think would hopefully
enable you to understand

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.530
a little bit better
about the kinds of people

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.169
that you'll be targeting if you
decide to come into a market

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:50.710
like Nigeria.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.800
So most of my time will be
spent talking about Nigeria.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:58.660
Firstly, in terms of like
Africa as a continent,

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:00.800
some people still think
it's a single country.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:05.305
But obviously, we have about
54 countries in the continent.

00:18:05.305 --> 00:18:08.050
There's quite a lot
of languages there,

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.587
but the population
is very large.

00:18:09.587 --> 00:18:11.920
But the connectivity in terms
of people who are actually

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.380
connected to the internet,
as you can see from here,

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.550
it's about 28.1% of
people who are connected.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.260
This is a mobile
first market, which

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.410
means that a lot of people
who connect to the internet

00:18:23.410 --> 00:18:24.979
actually experience
that connection

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.020
via their mobile devices.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.860
So tablets, computers
are not as prevalent

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:33.040
as mobile devices are.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.540
So in terms of
Nigeria-- and Nigeria

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.300
is a very, very large market.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.360
We're just under 200 million
people in terms of population.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.757
And we're the second largest
economy in the continent.

00:18:43.757 --> 00:18:45.340
But what is really,
really interesting

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.995
is that we have a lot of
mobile connectivity, at least

00:18:47.995 --> 00:18:49.120
compared to everybody else.

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.914
So we're just under
100 million people

00:18:50.914 --> 00:18:52.080
who connect to the internet.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.030
Mostly, via mobile devices.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:57.940
In terms of people who actually
have access to mobile phones,

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.430
or the number of like
mobile lines that we have in

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.340
the country is
about 200 million.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.540
So a lot of people have dual
devices, dual SIM cards.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.600
And people are connecting
using multiple devices.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.020
But what I'm really
excited about sharing today

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:18.070
is the user segmentation,
which I touched on earlier.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:23.230
We've been able to
identify four unique custom

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.300
segments in Nigeria.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.430
And these custom
segments are actually

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.030
defined by their connectivity.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.180
So how they actually
connect to the internet more

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.150
than anything else.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.710
But looking at Nigeria
as a broad market.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.820
What is really interesting
from a social angle

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.270
is-- I don't know if you guys
are familiar with Nollywood?

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.850
It's the third
largest movie industry

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:53.740
in the world behind Hollywood
and Bollywood, of course,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.390
from India.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.530
It's actually the second
largest contributor to our GDP

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.420
after oil and gas.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.260
So huge employer of people.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.710
And the locals are
really, really keen

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.350
on their local movies.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.489
Our music is actually
very huge exports.

00:20:10.489 --> 00:20:12.280
So there's a lot of
hip hop music coming up

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.550
from Nigeria, which is
going across different parts

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.717
of the continent in
Africa and overseas.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.300
Huge exports here
in the West as well.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.990
So when you go to clubs and
bars in most popular cities,

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:26.740
you are more likely to come
across one of our musics.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.890
Football is huge.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.240
It's second to
religion in Nigeria.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.170
We are fanatics when
it comes to football.

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.220
We love our premiership.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.410
We love our LaLiga.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.290
And you know, there was this
story about these two Nigerians

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:44.570
who got into a massive
fight over which footballer

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.320
was the best football
in the world, Lionel

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.710
Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.110
So we don't take
it very lightly.

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.550
Religion, like I
said, is-- pretty

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:59.020
much every street in
Nigeria has a church.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:03.350
So I watched a
little clip recently

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:07.030
that showed that the top 10
richest pastors, depending

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.640
on what denomination you
are, but the top 10 richest

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.210
pastors in the world, 5
of them are Nigerians.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.410
Four of whom are
actually in Nigeria.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.550
So despite the fact that we do
have huge economic challenges,

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.480
people are very generous
when it comes to church.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:24.340
And then, fashion is sort of
like becoming a modern trend.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.620
And there's huge adoption
for fashion design.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.220
People are very interested in
what they wear and are shopping

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.830
for these kind of things.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:36.785
Politically, the way
the opportunities--

00:21:36.785 --> 00:21:39.160
I mean, this is kind of like
opportunities and challenges

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:39.868
at the same time.

00:21:39.868 --> 00:21:41.440
But politically,
what the government

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.046
is really interested
in is in education.

00:21:44.046 --> 00:21:46.170
So education is a huge
challenge for the continent.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.700
So any sort of apps
that enable people

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.610
to learn on the go on
their mobile device

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.289
is actually a very huge hit.

00:21:52.289 --> 00:21:53.830
And then, anything
around empowerment

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.913
is also a very huge hit
because the government has

00:21:55.913 --> 00:21:58.780
a very large youth population.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.610
And getting these
people educated

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:02.680
and giving them
access to employment,

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.500
opportunities is actually
a huge challenge for them.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.910
On the mobile side, Nigeria has
huge infrastructure problems.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:14.800
So I actually came to
London via Cape Town.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.990
And in Cape Town,
they have-- in South,

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.000
Africa they occasionally
have something

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.580
called load shedding,
which is where

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.540
people-- for a couple of hours
in the day, the government

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.350
is distributing power
between different districts.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.230
It is possible for you
to actually lose power

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.674
for a couple of hours in a day.

00:22:33.674 --> 00:22:35.590
In Nigeria, it's a
completely different thing.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.250
I mean, there's no such
thing as load shedding.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.480
It's just power outage.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.484
And this is probably about
80%, 90% of the time.

00:22:43.484 --> 00:22:45.150
For those of you
who've been to Nigeria,

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.900
it's a huge, huge, huge problem.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.170
Which means that battery
life is actually hugely

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.940
important to mobile users.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.070
Most people have
battery power packs

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.870
that they use with
their mobile phones,

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:58.350
but that is not sufficient.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:01.480
Internet, like Iky said
earlier, is extremely expensive.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.860
And that is
something that people

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.245
are very conscious about.

00:23:04.245 --> 00:23:05.620
There's not a lot
of transparency

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.030
between the internet
service providers

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.040
and the actual end
consumers in terms of what

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.400
their data is being used for.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.620
So you can buy a data
bundle of maybe 2 gigs

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.510
and it can run out
in a couple of hours.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.587
And people don't have
a huge understanding

00:23:18.587 --> 00:23:20.170
as to how their data
is actually being

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.740
utilized for the amount
of money they're paying.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.610
Free peer-to-peer
communication tools

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:30.640
are massive because of
voice and data costs.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.490
So people adopt these
products to enable

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:36.490
them to keep in touch
with friends and family.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.470
And then, internet connectivity
is another huge challenge.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.730
And this is around the
infrastructure difficulties

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.506
for a lot of the telcos and
internet service providers

00:23:45.506 --> 00:23:46.130
in the country.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.520
I'm going to dive into the
different user segments.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.300
So earlier, I touched on
the four user segments.

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:58.319
So if you're bringing
a product into Nigeria,

00:23:58.319 --> 00:23:59.860
looking at the
Nigerian market, these

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.200
are four unique
categories of users

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.910
based on their connectivity.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:10.180
So we have what we termed
as the always-on segment.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.290
Now, these guys are pretty
much the types of people

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.034
that you would expect to
meet in any developed market.

00:24:17.034 --> 00:24:17.950
They're well-educated.

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:20.730
Most of them actually have some
level of foreign education.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.330
They're well-traveled.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.020
They earn a decent salary
by Nigeria standards.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.850
They connect to the internet
via multiple devices.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.760
What they really care about
is the connection speed more

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.050
than price.

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:38.080
They're not as price-sensitive.

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.749
They access their content
via the app stores.

00:24:41.749 --> 00:24:44.040
They have multiple payment
options, so they can update.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.498
They're very comfortable paying
with credit cards and debit

00:24:46.498 --> 00:24:50.000
cards or using payment
platforms like PayPal

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.870
because they've lived abroad
and they understand the security

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:58.680
benefits or the convenience
benefits of actually doing

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.960
transactions online.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.430
You would find them using
apps like Uber, YouTube.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:08.340
They're huge video consumers.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.350
And they play games
that require you to be

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.600
connected when you're playing.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.440
So they're not too
bothered about that.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.980
So that's the very first
group and represent about 5%

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.800
of the market.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.930
The second group is what we
tag as the mostly on group.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.752
So data cost is,
obviously, very expensive.

00:25:24.752 --> 00:25:26.460
And these are sort of
the kinds of people

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.300
who swap between being
online and offline.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:35.340
And this is kind of like trying
to manage the data that they

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.070
have access to or
they can afford.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:41.670
They usually connect using
either a phone or a tablet.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:48.870
We don't have a lot of fixed
landlines or cable connections,

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:52.490
so most people are connecting
using some kind of MyFi device

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:57.030
or some kind of router on,
obviously, the 3G connections.

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.390
Again, these guys are
reasonably educated.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.450
They are employed,
semi-employed individuals.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:06.300
They typically
purchase data bundles,

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.220
so there is some kind of
cap around what they buy.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.120
So they would do like a 4
gig plan, or a 5 gig plan,

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.960
or a 10 gig plan
valid for 30 days.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.210
So obviously, they are very
conscious of what they are

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.210
using their data to consume.

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:20.520
So they typically
use apps that enable

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.760
them some of offline access
as well as online access.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.960
They're huge users of
communication tools

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.930
and have access
to games as well.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.660
They access their games directly
from the app stores as well.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.160
Because of their
level of education,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:38.100
they understand how to use
stores like Google Play.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.880
The next group is
our on-demand group.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.610
So this group is
kind of like where

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:47.280
you start to see a lot more
people who spend more time

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.620
offline than they do online.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:53.520
They usually access the
internet using product bundles.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.380
So what product bundles
do is that there

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.430
is a basket of applications that
you can get unlimited access to

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:01.222
over a 30-day period.

00:27:01.222 --> 00:27:03.180
So that would be like
your communication tools,

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.820
your social tools,
your instant messaging

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:07.584
tools, your emailing tools.

00:27:07.584 --> 00:27:09.500
And this is what they
would typically pay for.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.580
So their access to the
internet is actually

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.380
limited in that they
might not necessarily

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.530
be able to use a browser or
access YouTube in the same way

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:21.300
that they could actually use
Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.280
Folks like this typically
have one device.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:29.280
So they usually access
connections via their phone.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.710
This is now where you start
to see a lot more people who

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:36.390
are using very low-end phones
or fairly-- secondhand phones,

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.840
actually, are also very
popular for this group.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.840
In terms of
payments, they're not

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.990
very comfortable using cards
or using any payment platforms.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:50.100
So they would do direct
carrier billing for payment.

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:53.930
They're more comfortable
paying with cash.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.880
And in terms of how they
access content for their mobile

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.100
devices, they
would typically use

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.100
file sharing share
and applications

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.787
to access pretty much
access applications offline.

00:28:05.787 --> 00:28:07.870
I don't know if you guys
are familiar with Xender,

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:12.606
but Xender is a very popular
application for this group.

00:28:12.606 --> 00:28:14.730
And then the last group
that we're going to look at

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.460
is where majority
of the population

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.340
actually falls into
from our analysis.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.755
Somewhere around about
75% of the population

00:28:22.755 --> 00:28:25.200
falls into this group.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.160
So this is like your
self-employed, your artisans.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.099
They're mostly uneducated.

00:28:31.099 --> 00:28:32.640
Again, they would
access the internet

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.690
if you had product bundles
or limited price plans.

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.370
But most of the time
they're actually offline.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:44.070
They're now using like really,
really low-end feature phones.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.260
A lot of Chinese
manufacturers are

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:50.610
entering into the market
with really basic devices

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.070
for this segment.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.144
In terms of how they
access the apps, when

00:28:55.144 --> 00:28:57.060
they go to the markets
to purchase the phones,

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:02.443
there are people in the markets
that actually install the app.

00:29:02.443 --> 00:29:05.530
So they pay to actually
have apps installed.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.680
So this group is
more likely not to be

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.560
familiar with app stores
and the sort of freedom

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.140
that they can actually
have with accessing the app

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.964
stores on their own.

00:29:14.964 --> 00:29:16.380
In terms of their
top apps, you're

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.650
more likely to see
them using browsers,

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.920
like Opera, which allows them
to actually get faster speed.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.980
Get access to the internet
without necessarily utilizing

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.680
like a huge level of bandwidth.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.530
So the last thing
I want to touch on

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.500
is this matrix of like
how all of these things

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:43.470
are connected to the design
principles for the next billion

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:44.740
users.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.724
So in terms of
connectivity, there's

00:29:47.724 --> 00:29:49.140
a lot of awareness
around the fact

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.681
that most of the
people who are going

00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:52.470
to be accessing the
internet will be

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.900
using like 2G/3G connections.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.990
A lot of people are going to
be using low-end smartphones

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.230
and feature phones
in some instances.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.077
For internet connection or
[INAUDIBLE] connectivity,

00:30:04.077 --> 00:30:06.160
it's going to be mostly
around like pay-as-you-go,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.450
some kind of pay-as-you-go
limited product bundle package

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.820
which they'll be using.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:13.410
So yeah.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.470
I mean, that's just kind of
my thoughts on the subject.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:17.910
Thank you very much.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:29.060
