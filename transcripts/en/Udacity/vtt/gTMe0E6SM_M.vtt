00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So one thing I want to stress here is that

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
you've just programmed a full particle filter.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So you got, from me, kind of a very

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
primitive and rudimentary robot simulator

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that uses landmarks as a way of doing measurements,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and it uses three-dimensional robot coordinates,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so it's a little bit better than the stuff we talked about in previous classes--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
it's not quite a Google car yet.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And you solved the estimation problem.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In fact, you solved this problem in 30 lines of code.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That is an amazing small amount of code

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for something that's amazingly powerful.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And you can reuse these 30 lines of code

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in pretty much all problems you might study

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that require particle filtering; they're very generic.

00:00:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So let me get back to the theory of particle filtering.
