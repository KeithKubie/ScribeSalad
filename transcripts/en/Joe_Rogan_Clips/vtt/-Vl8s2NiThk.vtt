WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.680
Yeah.
His voice was very unique too in that he decided to combine fiction with

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:08.730
nonfiction in a very weird blurry way.
I think it was.

3
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.990
So one thing I think of is he usually gives you a cue where what he did was he

4
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.310
dramatized,
people didn't dramatize.
Wait a minute,
man,
shit up.

5
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:20.460
He didn't just dramatize.
There's a rumor.
It's doctor,

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.300
I didn't say that there.
He did April gate.
I said there was,

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.460
this is about Ed Muskie's campaign.
Um,

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.180
I said there was a rumor in Milwaukee that he did it again.
I started that rumor.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.590
Yeah.
I mean that's what he says,

10
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:34.280
but what did he said that on the Dick Cavett show later?

11
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.170
And I think Matt Taibbi on this show talked about it.
Well,

12
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.680
where one thing is that,
um,
muskie was already out of the campaign.

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.870
When that came out,
it must be had already lost.

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.790
And so muskie had been a fucking monster and a terrible person on that campaign.

15
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.800
And so Thompson used that version of Musky and wrote,
as Toby said,

16
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.580
in a very straight way,
it began story.
And so if you had a sense of irony,

17
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:00.100
you kind of knew like you're not really thinking that this is a guy who did able

18
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:03.300
gain,
so I think there's queues in there for our listening audience,

19
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.260
but what I think is even more,
you know what?

20
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.810
I think he dramatize the way other people didn't.
He would say,
I look left,

21
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.010
I look up,
I see.

22
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.760
He came down to me and then he said people didn't write like that in journalism.

23
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.940
They didn't go step by step.
And he did.
And that was really important.

24
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.130
What I think is more important than the IV.
Again,
story.

25
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.250
So the biggest story in the background is Ed Muskie was the front runner for the

26
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.110
Democratic primary in 1972 he fucked up his campaign afterwards.

27
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.320
Thompson talked about how he had heard that there are,

28
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:33.500
there was a rumor that this candidate was doing Ibogaine,

29
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.220
which is like Iowasca or he said that,
no,
it's not like Iowasca.
It's not.

30
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.970
No,
it's very different.
So hallucinatory,
it's a self examined Tori.

31
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.070
I was the one who get off.
Get off.
Yeah.
But he said they brought in a Brazilian,

32
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.750
which doctor I've again is not even a Brazilian drug from Africa.

33
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.290
People got it.
But what I think people don't remember is before that,

34
00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.330
and this affected the election.
And um,
February of 1972 Thompson was in Florida.

35
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.190
He was on something called the sunshine special.

36
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.380
It was a whistle stop tour that Musky,

37
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:08.280
the front runner had a good chance to beat Nixon,
pull numbers wise,
um,

38
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.540
was um,

39
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.790
going all the way down the Florida peninsula on to try to win the Florida

40
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:19.260
primary.
And Thompson was like,
this is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.

41
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.110
Like at every stop Musky gave the same shit speech.

42
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.070
It's like somebody should be your president,
namely me.
And it was repeated.

43
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:28.650
The reporters were like,
fucking,
this is terrible.

44
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.680
Muskie was secluded in the back of the car.
He didn't interact with anybody.

45
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.750
They had his political operatives come out and make everybody like sing the song

46
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:40.440
like,
um,
about like Musky,
like sunshine in his hands,

47
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.150
the whole world in his hands.
It was terrible.

48
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.960
And so that night Thompson pulled into a Florida town.

49
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:47.190
It was the second to last stop.

50
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.490
And he in this young political reporter named Monte Chitty,

51
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.960
we're going to get a drink at 2:00 AM.
And this guy walks into the lobby,

52
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:59.890
he's like six,
six,
two 50 Peter Sheridan.
And he,
um,

53
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.970
he walks in and he,
um,
he says he's looking for the muskie campaign,

54
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.870
all these different things.
He ends up going out with them,

55
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.030
a hundred Thompson for a drink and a hunter.

56
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.750
Thompson finds out that Peter Sheridan had been a good friend of Jerry Garcia,

57
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.000
had um,
hung out with the hell's angels in,
um,
California.
Had,
um,

58
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.150
been to La Honda where Ken Kesey was and was actually a pretty smart guy who was

59
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.770
out of his mind in his mid twenties.

60
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.200
They stayed out and drink all night at the end of the night.
Thompson was like,

61
00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:28.090
so what are you doing tomorrow?
Where you going?
And,
um,
Peter,
Sharon was like,

62
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:30.880
well,
I'm going to Miami.
And Thompson's like,
we are too.

63
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.710
You don't have to hitchhike.
Fuck that.

64
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.820
And so there's a really good journalist outlaw,
um,
it's called outlaw,
um,

65
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.030
journalists by bill McKean,
the tea.
Another Thompson biography.

66
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.270
He talks about how Thompson took his Thompson and took his press pass,

67
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.760
put it into the um,
elevator press,
the button,

68
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.420
sent the press pass down to the ground floor.
Peter shared and got it.

69
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.320
So Peter shared and could write for free on the Sunshine Express Down to Miami

70
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:54.154
the next day.

71
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.880
So Thompson over sleeps because the fucking muskie campaign doesn't like him.

72
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:58.630
Anyways,

73
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.860
instead Peter shared and gets on the sunshine express with a Hunter Thompson

74
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.520
Press Badge and Peter Sheridan goes on to order 12 martinis and he goes,

75
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:08.980
give me like a triple gin bucks.
Hold the book.

76
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.040
And he runs up and down the car and you know,

77
00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:15.010
Musky has been a really shitty candidate at this point.

78
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:18.640
He's not been engaging people.
He got in this weird fight with his wife at a,
um,

79
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.460
a campaign event where they like put cake in each other's face.

80
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.680
It's been really weird and people aren't reporting on it.

81
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.350
Like other reporters aren't saying muskies on stable.

82
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.270
And so Musky at the end of this whistle stop,

83
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.870
he spent all his campaign money to go up and down and try to do this whistle

84
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:36.070
stop tour.
He gives a speech at the caboose and Jerry Rubin,

85
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.280
the antiwar activist who was one of the Chicago seven,
um,
and was,
um,

86
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.100
it has come to heckle him,
is in the crowd and he's saying the mosquito.

87
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.630
So why did you support the Vietnam War in 1968?
Like,
who do you think you are?

88
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.040
And so muskies yelling at Jerry Ruben,
he's,
Hey,
young man,
keep your mouth shut.

89
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.670
But neath Musky reaching up from the bottom of the caboose.

90
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.970
Peter Sheridan is holding a gin bottle and grabbing it muskies leg as a Musky

91
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:07.540
tries to give this speech.
And then Musky falls back in.
The whole thing ends.

92
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.070
Like the whole press conference is over,

93
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.780
like women's wear daily reported this and it came out that Hunter Thompson had

94
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:18.070
had 13 Martinis and run up and down the train and had interfered with it.

95
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.250
And muskie's campaign really believed that Thompson was working with Donald

96
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.050
Segretti and Nixon's.
I'm creep,
um,

97
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.080
Watergate crew to fuck up Muskie's campaign.

98
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.450
And that actually changed the course.

99
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.130
It like Thompson help expose how fucked up muskie was as a candidate at that

100
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:36.610
time.

101
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.300
And Thompson had never forgiven Musky for being on the pro Vietnam War Platform

102
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:41.920
at the 1968 convention.

103
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:44.620
And so we talk about the implicate aspect of changing the campaign,

104
00:05:44.621 --> 00:05:48.010
but that report and the way that disseminated through media,

105
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.940
the way it was picked up by other newspapers really did help change the people's

106
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:56.320
perception of Ed Muskie at big Ed Muskie as a topic called him at the time.

107
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.150
Now he,
when he wrote Hell's angels,

108
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:03.830
he hadn't really totally formulated that sort of Gonzo style of journalism,

109
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:08.831
but he did have a little bit of fiction mixed in with that and that sort of ran

110
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:14.060
him a foul of the hell hell's angels.
They were very upset by that.
Right?
Like he,

111
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:18.530
he did write some things in there that they claim or not accurate.

112
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.180
I think that when it came to hell's angels,
um,

113
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.050
what Thompson did really well,
that's what Joan Didion did really well.

114
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:32.170
He took the way the media was portraying somebody and he stripped that off and

115
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.240
said,
this is who they actually are.
This is what they're actually doing.

116
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.810
Joan Didion,
when she writes about Jim Morrison and the white album,
she's like,

117
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:39.561
Jim Morrison was like,

118
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:41.780
sex and death in his leather pants was the best thing ever.

119
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.720
Everybody loves Jim Morrison.
And then in the scene and the white album,

120
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:47.900
Joan Didion writes about how they sit at a recording studio for two hours and

121
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:51.350
nobody says anything and they eat eggs out of a paper bag and it's a fucking

122
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:54.980
nightmare.
Thompson knew that the media was sensationalizing the hell's angels.

123
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.430
He went to them,
um,
on a cold night in San Francisco.

124
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.240
I'm down by the waterfront and he said,
hey,
here's a Newsweek article.

125
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.810
Here's a time article.
Here's how everybody's running about you.

126
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.750
All I want to do is write the truth about who you are.

127
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.660
And he did and he ended up writing with them.
Um,

128
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:12.590
and he ended up spending time with them.

129
00:07:12.591 --> 00:07:16.430
I don't think they got as mad at him about the way he portrayed them.

130
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.460
I think they got mad that he began to make money or that he became famous hell's

131
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:25.430
angels.
So 500,000 paperback copies,

132
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.920
that is almost impossible to imagine today.

133
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.240
500,000 paperback copies of a Literary Book and the angels were pissed off about

134
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:35.570
that.
They felt Thompson owed him more money,
owed him something for that.

135
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.510
Did he hit him at all?
Did he give them any money?
Barker,
Cindy Berger's.

136
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.350
So ridiculous,
silly buggers said he owed us a keg and he didn't give us a cake.

137
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.470
That's it.
You know the famous story at the end of it is that that is,

138
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.290
I mean really like when they go through it,

139
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.760
he said that he said the Thompson was doing this objective version of us,

140
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:56.150
but it was at least closer than the shitty news.
We can time versions.

141
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.930
And so Thompson at the end of,
he'd finished the book,
barely made the deadline.

142
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.760
I had to go down to a hotel in Monterey,

143
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.140
lock himself in step for a hundred hours straight and write it in March of

144
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:08.920
[inaudible] 67 to finish it.
So it turns it in,
makes it as,
um,

145
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.150
advanced deadline in September.
They're like,

146
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.000
here's our author photo and it's Shitty.
And he's like,
fuck this.

147
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:15.710
So he goes to a hell's angels rally.

148
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.860
He doesn't know anybody because he hasn't been with them for six or seven
months.

149
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.570
He's taking pictures.

150
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.740
That's when he got freed up from writing about the hell's angels and he tiny his

151
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:28.640
friend who later committed suicide after Ultima after being involved in the

152
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:32.360
Altima security situation.
Tying the rolling stone one where the youngest staff,

153
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.160
yes.
Where Meredith hunter was stabbed,
but tiny.
It was a woman that got stabbed.

154
00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:39.830
The man marathoner.
Oh.
Um,
it was a man named Meredith.

155
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.430
Oh was back in the day where you can name your kid's Meredith,
right?

156
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:48.480
Like Marion,
Marion's another one.
Right.
Um,

157
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.250
Lindsey,
Lindsey,
some guys are Lindsey.

158
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.630
I can honestly give me one Jamie.
Oh yeah.
But Jamie's normal.
Well,

159
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.220
if there's a lot of Jamie's the future man scene where it's like,

160
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.720
what's his name is like,
my name's Susan in the future,
men are named Susan.

161
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.190
I know it's a girl's name and your time.
Um,

162
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.940
but here it is a weird one though.

163
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:12.090
You must hate your fucking saw on the map but lose the argument with your wife.

164
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.900
But that
lost a lot of arguments with my,

165
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.910
but that poor guy was um,

166
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.060
but Thompson was there and tiny grabbed him after he was beat up.

167
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.120
There's a guy holding a rock to drop it on.
Thompson with the hell's angels.

168
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.090
And tiny was like,
all right,
I know him,
I know the rest of you don't.

169
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.430
And he grabbed him out and tiny was um,

170
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.180
this like enormous hell's angel who had been,
you know,

171
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:38.190
Thompson was pretty good at empathetically understanding their flaws and their

172
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:40.650
perspectives.
He never,
I think made excuses for him.

173
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:44.460
He said that their inherent perspective as fascistic,
he writes that,
you know,

174
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:47.610
he says they use violence to respond to where they were in society.

175
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:51.210
Their idea of total retaliation.
The hell's angels were any offense,

176
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.150
like looking at you funny or being like,
dude,
you drink.

177
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.990
It could be met with everybody beating you up because they got determine the,

178
00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.970
they got the hell's angels,
got to determine the offense.

179
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:01.710
Like that was fascism to Thompson.

180
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.400
And he wrote beautifully about their reliance on violence cause he,

181
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.150
they felt hell's angels.
They'd been left behind by our moderated society.

182
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:11.820
Like there's technology,
there's all these new jobs.

183
00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.180
If you came back from the war in 1950 you had a chance in Oakland to have a

184
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.950
middle class life in a beautiful house,

185
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.740
in work the rest of your days and have a family that will then go on.

186
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:22.500
But by 1965,
that was no longer an option.

187
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.570
And the angels were a violent response to that.

188
00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:25.970
Very similar to what we're seeing now.

189
00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.420
So the way he wrote about the hell's angels.

190
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.260
So very similar to the way that we see violence within groups that are

191
00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:35.340
supporting Trump,
you know,
lifted in the right.
Did he ever wind up,
um,

192
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.120
resolving his differences with the hell's angels?
I think so.
Sandy Berger,

193
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.020
hell's angels got fucked.
Like rightly.
So.
The hell's angels were,
you know,

194
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.310
pursued like a mob.
Um,
like,
um,
like a mafia group.
People went to jail,

195
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:48.960
sunny barker went to jail.
Um,

196
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.520
I think they at the end appreciated his representation of them because it was

197
00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:56.860
better than any other ones.
There's no better representation of the health.

198
00:10:56.861 --> 00:10:59.310
They know more sympathetic for sure are just no more accurate,

199
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.940
no more understood.
Winked.
Yeah,
no more like,
again,
I guess the Thompsons effort,

200
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.030
if you ride for six months with somebody and you're an honest,

201
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:09.270
like putting up your hands,
you're not trying to fit what you see into a thesis,

202
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:10.170
you're doing the opposite.

203
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.710
Trying to look at the reality you have in front of you and then form an argument

204
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:17.660
out of that coherent,
that's what Thompson's gift was and very dangerous to,

205
00:11:17.661 --> 00:11:21.390
to do that.
I mean,
I mean he did get beat up taking those photographs,

206
00:11:21.391 --> 00:11:24.570
really bad motorcycle accident with his friend on the back and his friend broke

207
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:27.540
his leg like it was,
that's why he left.
He's like,

208
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:31.050
get the fuck out of San Francisco.
Yeah.
Face looks amazing.
Like it's amazing.

209
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:34.320
It's a,
it's a fire that you're putting your hand on to.
How did it crash?

210
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.020
He was coming down.
Um,
it was with the mayor of Richmond.

211
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:40.990
He was coming down as slick road and they had,
um,
hit a UN,

212
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.310
like something was wet or an oil thing and it went out the back tire.

213
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.140
So Thompson rolled and was fine,
but his friends knee hit,
um,
railroad tracks.

214
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.600
So it's friends need broke really badly.
Um,
it the mayor,
yeah,

215
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:57.420
it was the mayor of Richmond.
And that's continued riding motorcycles though.
I,

216
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.330
yeah,
he did.
He would get in accidents at Woody Creek,
but he was pretty careful,

217
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.090
like,
so I love that scene in Hell's angels.
I don't know if readers,

218
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.330
our listeners know this,
but the edge,
you know,

219
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:10.900
and that's a major part of the book where Thompson's fighting with his wife.

220
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:11.980
Thompson's finished his book,

221
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.410
but he's breaking down because he's worked so hard to do it.

222
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.120
And so he takes his BSA out and he goes,
if he knows San Francisco,

223
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:22.090
he goes out to the park,
he hits the Coast highway,

224
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.810
and he comes down it and he's like,
I'm so overwhelmed.

225
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.560
Everything is so fucking terrible.
He's going as fast as he can.

226
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.500
And he talks about how his eyes began to lose moisture.
You,
you know,

227
00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:34.300
the scene like this,
this beautiful scene,

228
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.420
he's looking for sand pits because he hit a sand pit near the zoo.

229
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:40.840
You're fucking dot.
Yeah.
And he gets all the way to Rockaway beach,
which is in,

230
00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.670
um,
like halfway down to Santa Cruz.

231
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.380
And he turns around and what he talks about is when he's at a hundred miles per

232
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.900
hour,
and I think he was near death,
he was really overwhelmed.
He says,
um,

233
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:50.951
you know,
the edge,

234
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:54.670
the only people that know it are the people that have gone over the rest,

235
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.640
the living,
don't have any understanding of that.

236
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.070
And all we can do is approach it in this way.

237
00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:02.950
And it's this beautiful and is called midnight on the coast highway.

238
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:06.550
It was a anthologized and Tom Wolfe,
you know,
and it was just beautiful.

239
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.470
So he comes back and he sits at his desk and so he had a view of the bay bridge.

240
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.560
He could see it's two flashing lights,
um,
the whole time.

241
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.590
And he had broken the window and a terrible fight with his wife like three weeks

242
00:13:17.591 --> 00:13:18.610
earlier.
Um,

243
00:13:18.611 --> 00:13:22.840
and so he sits at the broken window and he writes out that scene right away with

244
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:24.010
his eyes,
still scoured,

245
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.920
avoid using the broken window when she wouldn't give him a gun,

246
00:13:26.921 --> 00:13:29.410
cause he was on acid and he threw a shoe through the window.
There's three,

247
00:13:29.411 --> 00:13:30.370
there's three versions.

248
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.710
So I do it and then I give the three versions of the notes.

249
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.500
So I go with the three versions that I've heard,
like I heard it from,

250
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.270
I'll ask her,
you know,
she wrote,
I really respect sandy like deeply.

251
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:42.730
She wrote at the,
um,
uh,
a few years ago,
she said,

252
00:13:42.731 --> 00:13:46.600
I'm done giving interviews about honest Thompson.
That was my life.
That was then,

253
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.560
she's given so many interviews up to this point.
She says that that exist.

254
00:13:50.561 --> 00:13:54.520
And so I wanted to respect that more than anything and just use the information

255
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:57.250
that they had on,
you know,
and let the reader know,
Yo,

256
00:13:57.251 --> 00:14:01.030
here at three other versions,
here's the best version I could make.
Dramatize,

257
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.380
look left,
throw,
do this.
