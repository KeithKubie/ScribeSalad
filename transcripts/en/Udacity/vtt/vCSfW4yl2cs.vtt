00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this problem, imagine that one summer you're feeling particularly adventurous

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and you dig a hole straight through the center of the earth and by some miracle,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
you don't end up roasting yourself in the earth's core or anything like that.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You managed to dig all the way through to the other side of the earth.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And to celebrate the completion of your big summer project,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
you decide to leap dramatically into your tunnel to head towards the other side of the earth.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now, it turns out if you were to do this, you would oscillate back and forth

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
between the earth's surface on this side and the earth's surface on this side,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and lo and behold and turns out that this motion through the earth's core

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is actually simple harmonic motion.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
To see why this is simple harmonic motion,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we're going to have to investigate what gravity is like within the earth.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We know what it's like above the earth, but what's it like inside the earth.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It turns out that the force of gravity within the earth's surface is equal to g&lt;i&gt;m/re&lt;i&gt;r.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You're distance away from the center of the earth which I'm calling r here.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, it's possible to derive this equation from scratch but the derivation is quite complicated,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so I'm not going to do it here but we should discuss that on the forums.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The key thing we see about this equation is that the force grows proportionally

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
with the distance away from the center of the earth and where we had seen this before?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Well, it looks exactly like Hooke's Law which says that the force, a spring pulls on an object

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is equal to the spring constant times it's displacement away from the center.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This equation for the force of a spring looks just like this equation

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
for the force of gravity within the earth's surface except instead of x, we used r

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and instead of K, we have gm over the radius of the earth.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Okay, now that you know how gravity scales within the earth,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I want you to tell me what's the period of this simple harmonic motion.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
How long does it take for you to return to your original starting point, once you jumped in the earth

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
completing one complete cycle here and put your answer in minutes

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and for this problem you should use 10 m/secÂ² for g,

00:02:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and you should use 6400 km for the radius of the earth--good luck!
