00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.400
- I jump out of my car, and
I just had this moment where

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.534
I look at him and said, "You
can't make me go to Mexico."

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:08.951
(rock music)

00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:26.156
- Welcome to "This is Not Happening,"

00:00:26.156 --> 00:00:27.864
presents "World of Blunder."

00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:29.126
If you've never been to the show before,

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:30.708
this is a bunch of comics
telling fun stories

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:33.033
about real shit that happened.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.169
Give it up for a very funny man,

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:37.722
Mr. Trevor Moore
everybody, let him hear it.

00:00:37.722 --> 00:00:40.889
(audience applauding)

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.879
- I went down with a bunch of friends

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.046
to Comic-Con in San Diego.

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:53.519
And it was fun, I did the
first day where you just go

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.694
and you walk the floor and you
look at all the commercials

00:00:56.694 --> 00:00:58.207
for movies and stuff.

00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:00.159
But then by the second day, I was like,

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.340
"All right, I've already seen it,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.643
"I want to do something else."

00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:05.246
So I thought it'd be fun to go to Tijuana,

00:01:05.246 --> 00:01:08.263
which is about 30 miles
south of San Diego.

00:01:08.263 --> 00:01:09.483
So I started telling people,

00:01:09.483 --> 00:01:10.788
"I think this is what
I'm going to do tomorrow.

00:01:10.788 --> 00:01:11.886
"I'm just gonna take the day

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:13.881
"and go down to Tijuana for a
couple hours, and come back."

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:16.809
And everybody that was
from San Diego was like,

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:18.119
"Don't do that."

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.116
(audience laughing)

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:22.350
They were like, "Tijuana has changed a lot

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.459
"in the last 10 years, there's
a giant drug war going on."

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:28.532
And if you don't know what's happened,

00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:31.300
there's a drug cartel that
is basically completely

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.135
paid off the army.

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.723
And then there's another drug cartel

00:01:34.723 --> 00:01:36.471
that doesn't like the first drug cartel,

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.221
and they've paid off the police.

00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:40.309
So, it's just constant war.

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:42.706
And people disappear, they get kidnapped,

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:44.784
and it's a very scary place.

00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:46.406
And so everybody was telling
me that, and I was like,

00:01:46.406 --> 00:01:47.393
"Eh, whatever."

00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:51.464
And, so I got one of
my friends to be like,

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:53.293
"Yeah, I'll go down to Tijuana,
we'll go for a couple hours,

00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:54.126
"it'll be fun."

00:01:54.126 --> 00:01:54.959
And we're like, "Okay."

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:56.695
So we got in the car, we
drive down, we're excited.

00:01:56.695 --> 00:01:58.888
We park the car on the American side,

00:01:58.888 --> 00:02:01.117
and we're walking through,
and there's no line.

00:02:01.117 --> 00:02:03.367
And we're like, "Terrific."

00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:07.446
So, we're going through
and there's this big wall

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:10.209
that you can't see over, and
there's a building inside

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.935
of it, and there's where
the Mexican customs is.

00:02:12.935 --> 00:02:14.705
So we walk through, we open the door

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:16.576
to the other side, we're in Mexico,

00:02:16.576 --> 00:02:18.545
and the door shuts behind us.

00:02:18.545 --> 00:02:23.222
And the first thing we see,
is the longest goddamn line

00:02:23.222 --> 00:02:25.664
I have ever seen in my life to get back

00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:27.581
into the United States.

00:02:28.764 --> 00:02:32.347
It just, it went down a street,
came back, it went back,

00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:35.642
it was like, you couldn't
see the end of it.

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:37.962
And we're just like, "Holy
shit, did we just make

00:02:37.962 --> 00:02:40.036
"a huge mistake?

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:41.420
"Ah, what do we do?"

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.575
And then there's another line
of cars, and the cars are all

00:02:43.575 --> 00:02:45.500
standstill, no one's moving.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.084
So, we start--

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:50.014
Oh, by the way, they're
right, Tijuana is terrifying.

00:02:50.014 --> 00:02:54.886
It's like a whole town that's
like that bar in Star Wars.

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:57.248
(audience laughing)

00:02:57.248 --> 00:02:59.929
And, so like, you know,
we're just there, I try

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.017
to buy a soda, and I swear to God,

00:03:02.017 --> 00:03:03.766
the guy selling me the soda was like,

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.731
"Do you want to buy crystal?"

00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:08.984
And so is everybody, because
the only reason why people go

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:11.065
down there anymore is to do illegal stuff.

00:03:11.065 --> 00:03:12.898
So everybody is trying
to sell illegal stuff.

00:03:12.898 --> 00:03:14.766
Someone offered us guns, it was crazy.

00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:17.976
So we're trying to find a way,
we're trying to figure out

00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:19.889
what we have to do. Do we
just get back in this line?

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.845
Do we not see Tijuana at
all, just wait in this line?

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:24.570
We start talking to people,
the line to get back into

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.883
the United States is six hours.

00:03:27.883 --> 00:03:29.966
The car line is 10 hours.

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:32.973
And it's because we came through on like

00:03:32.973 --> 00:03:34.852
the last Sunday of the month,

00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:38.357
and that's when everybody does
the going over, or something.

00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:39.190
I don't know.

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.106
But they said...

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:41.445
(audience laughs)

00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:45.519
That's when everybody does the going over.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.164
And ah, but they said it's like literally

00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:50.814
the worst day we could have
picked to go, so we're like

00:03:50.814 --> 00:03:52.246
freaking out, we don't know what to do.

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:53.917
We talked to a guy who has a car,

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:55.461
and he says he's a taxi guy.

00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:56.763
And we're like, "Okay."

00:03:56.763 --> 00:03:59.373
And he speaks a little
English, and he's saying,

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.207
"Well, if you come back in a couple hours,

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:04.380
"it dies down a little bit,
so just take a taxi ride.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.710
"Go to downtown, see some
stuff, and then come back."

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.240
And we're like, "Okay, alright,
yeah maybe we'll do that."

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.768
So then we get in the
taxi, and then he leaves,

00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:14.108
and he's not the guy
that's gonna drive us,

00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:16.388
some other guy gets in,
and then he takes off.

00:04:16.388 --> 00:04:18.382
And we're like, "What's going
on, where are we going?"

00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:21.190
And we're just driving
down this line of cars,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.560
and for the first time, we're
seeing how long this line

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.685
of cars is, and it's miles.

00:04:26.685 --> 00:04:28.597
And we're like two miles
away from the border.

00:04:28.597 --> 00:04:30.628
We don't even know where
the border is anymore,

00:04:30.628 --> 00:04:32.950
because it's just a line of
cars, if you just follow that.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.131
And we're freaking out,

00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:35.679
and we're trying to get
the cab driver to stop,

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:37.513
and he doesn't speak
any English whatsoever.

00:04:37.513 --> 00:04:39.711
We're like, we don't know
how hard it is to get a cab

00:04:39.711 --> 00:04:41.585
where we're going, we don't
know where we're going.

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:43.213
So we're like, "Stop,"
and we're freaking out.

00:04:43.213 --> 00:04:47.288
And I'm trying to figure
out my high school Spanish,

00:04:47.288 --> 00:04:51.455
so, I know "coche" is "car",
and I'm saying like I think

00:04:52.378 --> 00:04:54.582
"alto" is "stop" 'cause
it sounds like alto.

00:04:54.582 --> 00:04:57.019
So I'm going like, "Alto!
Coche! Alto! Coche!"

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:58.932
I find out later, "alto" means "tall,"

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:01.903
so I sound like a crazy person to him.

00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:04.424
And eventually we land on "No."

00:05:04.424 --> 00:05:06.180
Just where it's, "No, no,
no," we're just yelling

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.187
"no no no no no" because
even "no" in Spanish is "no."

00:05:09.187 --> 00:05:11.429
(audience laughs)

00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:13.762
"No" means "no" universally.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.773
So he just stops the car,
we give him some money,

00:05:17.773 --> 00:05:20.342
and then we just start walking
back towards the border.

00:05:20.342 --> 00:05:23.318
And we're walking on
this elevated highway,

00:05:23.318 --> 00:05:25.758
with no sidewalk, and it's all these cars,

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:29.061
they're all stopped, people are
just hanging out by the cars

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:30.773
it's like one of those disaster
movies, where like the wave

00:05:30.773 --> 00:05:33.097
is gonna hit, or the
meteor hits, or something.

00:05:33.097 --> 00:05:36.435
And there's this whole
industry that's cropped up

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:38.468
that's just people selling
stuff to everyone who's

00:05:38.468 --> 00:05:39.977
stuck in this day-long line.

00:05:39.977 --> 00:05:41.439
So people are like grilling meat,

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:43.644
and there's all these little shops.

00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:47.342
There's this really weird
thing that's popular in

00:05:47.342 --> 00:05:49.741
Tijuana right now which
I don't understand,

00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:51.530
I tried to Google it,
and I still don't know.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.444
But we stop at this one guy's tent,

00:05:53.444 --> 00:05:55.596
and they all have this one thing,

00:05:55.596 --> 00:05:58.567
which is this giant framed velvet poster

00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:01.254
of Marilyn Monroe doing like that,

00:06:01.254 --> 00:06:03.549
"Oopsie, my dress is going up," pose.

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:06.318
But she's also holding a
Tommy Gun and shooting people.

00:06:06.318 --> 00:06:09.778
(audience laughs)

00:06:09.778 --> 00:06:10.611
I don't know what that is,

00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:13.596
but that's huge in Tijuana right now.

00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:16.733
So, we're walking, it
takes us about two hours

00:06:16.733 --> 00:06:20.352
to get back to the border, and
so then we get to the border

00:06:20.352 --> 00:06:22.912
and we're talking to people,
and we find out that there's

00:06:22.912 --> 00:06:26.700
a guy who has a bus, and
if you give him some money,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.323
you can get on the bus, and
there's a special VIP bus lane

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.765
to get over the border, and
that only takes two hours.

00:06:32.765 --> 00:06:34.235
So, we're like, "Okay, we
can do this whole thing

00:06:34.235 --> 00:06:36.100
"for four hours all together, fine."

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.217
We pay the guy the money, and
we get on the bus, it takes

00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:41.798
two hours, we get over the
boarder, customs gets mad at us

00:06:41.798 --> 00:06:43.504
because my friend doesn't have a passport.

00:06:43.504 --> 00:06:45.301
But they let us through.

00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:48.076
We get through, and we're
like, just before kissing

00:06:48.076 --> 00:06:51.171
the ground, kind of,
like we're that excited.

00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.222
It feels so good to be back in
the United States of America,

00:06:54.222 --> 00:06:56.623
and you know, I've complained
about this country a lot,

00:06:56.623 --> 00:06:58.166
and I have my issues with it,

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:02.273
but I've never been more
patriotic than coming back

00:07:02.273 --> 00:07:04.362
from four hours in Mexico.

00:07:04.362 --> 00:07:07.328
So we're celebrating,
and we're so excited,

00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:09.521
we get in our car, and
we're just like celebrating,

00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:10.780
we're like, "We did it, we did it!

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.574
"We're gonna go back to
San Diego, this is awesome.

00:07:12.574 --> 00:07:14.241
"We're finally out of Mexico."

00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:17.741
And my car has a really shitty GPS system,

00:07:19.653 --> 00:07:22.423
where it likes to tell you to take a turn

00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:24.702
right as you're passing the turn.

00:07:24.702 --> 00:07:27.187
So we're driving, we're
celebrating, and my car's like,

00:07:27.187 --> 00:07:29.546
"Take a left," and the
left was back there.

00:07:29.546 --> 00:07:32.273
So I'm three lanes over,
I can't get over to it,

00:07:32.273 --> 00:07:34.270
so I'm like, "Oh no, I
just missed the left,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.205
"what's gonna happen?"

00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:38.017
And then the road that I was
on went right back into Mexico.

00:07:38.017 --> 00:07:40.850
(audience laughs)

00:07:46.438 --> 00:07:49.313
And, I went from being the
happiest I've ever been

00:07:49.313 --> 00:07:51.809
to the saddest I've ever been.

00:07:51.809 --> 00:07:53.437
I immediately we started freaking out,

00:07:53.437 --> 00:07:54.616
and he was like, "What did you do?"

00:07:54.616 --> 00:07:56.614
And I was like, "I was--
My GPS, it's a bad GPS.

00:07:56.614 --> 00:07:58.323
"I don't know, it's not my fault."

00:07:58.323 --> 00:07:59.747
And we're just driving towards--

00:07:59.747 --> 00:08:01.335
and this Mexican flag
is just getting bigger

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:02.758
as we're getting toward the border,

00:08:02.758 --> 00:08:04.873
and it's six lanes of traffic, one-way,

00:08:04.873 --> 00:08:06.743
and there's cement walls on the side

00:08:06.743 --> 00:08:08.495
so you can't pull over
on the curb or anything,

00:08:08.495 --> 00:08:10.324
and we're just getting
closer to this Mexican flag,

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:12.360
we're freaking out, 'cause
now we have the car.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.398
And we can't even get, we
can't go back to the bus guy

00:08:14.398 --> 00:08:16.432
we gotta get in the 10 hour
line, and we're gonna be there

00:08:16.432 --> 00:08:18.057
til 4 in the morning,
and nothing good happens

00:08:18.057 --> 00:08:19.903
at four in the morning in Tijuana.

00:08:19.903 --> 00:08:22.018
So we're freaking out,
the sign's getting closer,

00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:23.482
I don't know what to do, so I panic.

00:08:23.482 --> 00:08:26.989
I just hit the brakes,
I jump out of my car.

00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:29.222
And the car just stops there,

00:08:29.222 --> 00:08:32.233
and the border patrol people go crazy.

00:08:32.233 --> 00:08:33.695
They don't like it when you do that.

00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:35.368
So, they're all yelling, they're like,

00:08:35.368 --> 00:08:36.347
"What is wrong with you?

00:08:36.347 --> 00:08:37.203
"Get back in your vehicle.

00:08:37.203 --> 00:08:38.096
"Get back in your vehicle."

00:08:38.096 --> 00:08:39.194
And I'm like, "I made a mistake,

00:08:39.194 --> 00:08:40.209
I don't want to go to Tijuana.

00:08:40.209 --> 00:08:41.636
"I was just there, and it's horrible,

00:08:41.636 --> 00:08:43.139
"and I don't want to go back."

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:45.133
And, they're like, "Get
back in your vehicle."

00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:46.519
And I'm like, "I can't,
I just don't want to

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:47.819
"go across the border."

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:49.730
So then they're talking
on their walkie talkies,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.930
and they're all mad, and
there's this border patrol guy

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.317
comes, and there's this metal fence

00:08:53.317 --> 00:08:54.943
that he can talk through at me,

00:08:54.943 --> 00:08:56.811
and he's like, "You have
to get back in your car,

00:08:56.811 --> 00:08:58.151
"and you have to go."

00:08:58.151 --> 00:08:59.778
And I'm like, I tell him the whole story.

00:08:59.778 --> 00:09:00.833
I'm like, "we were just there,

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:02.051
"took all these hours to get back,

00:09:02.051 --> 00:09:03.601
"we're supposed to be back in San Diego,

00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:04.739
"I made a mistake with the GPS."

00:09:04.739 --> 00:09:06.203
He's like, "I don't care,
you're past the point,

00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:08.524
"you're in the lane of
traffic, you have to go,

00:09:08.524 --> 00:09:09.989
"get in your car and go."

00:09:09.989 --> 00:09:12.436
And I just had this moment
where I looked at him, and said,

00:09:12.436 --> 00:09:14.389
"You can't make me go to Mexico."

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:18.306
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:09:21.588 --> 00:09:24.809
"I'm an American citizen,
you can't kick me

00:09:24.809 --> 00:09:26.476
"out of my country."

00:09:27.955 --> 00:09:30.031
And then he looked at me,
and then he started talking

00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.430
on his walkie talkie, and
everybody was like mad.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.099
I could see everybody
was upset about this,

00:09:34.099 --> 00:09:36.663
and then they all came out,
and they shut down six lanes

00:09:36.663 --> 00:09:39.663
of traffic to let our car go across.

00:09:41.261 --> 00:09:44.761
They shut down the whole border to Mexico.

00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:51.102
So, we got to the other
side, and they just descended

00:09:51.102 --> 00:09:54.036
on the car, and they were like
shinning lights in our eyes

00:09:54.036 --> 00:09:57.007
like, "Are you high, are you
drunk, what is wrong with you?"

00:09:57.007 --> 00:10:00.055
And I was like, "I, honestly,
we're just stupid, I'm sorry."

00:10:00.055 --> 00:10:01.521
And, they were like, "Get out of here."

00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:03.714
And we drove, and we
didn't celebrate this time,

00:10:03.714 --> 00:10:06.601
because, so I didn't want to jinx it.

00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:08.436
I thought if we like celebrated a little,

00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:09.738
the border would pop out of nowhere,

00:10:09.738 --> 00:10:11.739
and be like, "You're back in Mexico!"

00:10:11.739 --> 00:10:15.515
So, we got home, and that
was just the most traumatized

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:18.170
I've ever been in my life.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.944
And the only thing that I learned
about it is that no matter

00:10:21.944 --> 00:10:26.875
how much you fuck up, and no
matter what you do in life,

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:29.514
nobody can make you go to Mexico.

00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:32.001
(audience laughing and applauding)

00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:34.237
That's the only thing I learned.

00:10:34.237 --> 00:10:35.453
Thank you guys.

00:10:35.453 --> 00:10:38.370

00:10:40.063 --> 00:10:41.324
- Trevor Moore everybody.

00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:42.507

really good one, Pope,

00:10:51.707 --> 00:10:52.724
Check out Founding Fathers.

00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:55.373
Last week, I asked you to post
the best videos of trouble

00:10:55.373 --> 00:10:57.611
with the law, from David Tecno's story,

00:10:57.611 --> 00:10:59.117
and you guys did some awesome ones,

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.269
there were some great stories
there in the comments section.

00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:03.097
So here's one that I really liked.

00:11:03.097 --> 00:11:04.601
Next week, because of this story,

00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:07.255
When Trevor was trying to go around

00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:09.367
and everyone is yelling at him,

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:11.033
and everyone got road rage on him,

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:12.782
I want to hear your best
stories about road rage.

00:11:12.782 --> 00:11:14.045
So I want to see what you guys write.

00:11:14.045 --> 00:11:15.716
So write something awesome

00:11:15.716 --> 00:11:17.266

00:11:17.266 --> 00:11:19.342
