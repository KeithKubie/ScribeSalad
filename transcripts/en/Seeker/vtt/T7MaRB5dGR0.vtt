00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.450
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
“How We Got To Now” with Steven Johnson

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.940
- premieres Wednesday October 15 at 9/8c on
PBS.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.820
Three scientists who invented the LED were
awarded the Nobel Prize in physics this year.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.500
But what have LED lights really done for us?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.340
And more importantly, what can do they for
the rest of the world?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:29.710
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and in this
modern world, it can be easy to take for granted

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.789
just how much work and research went into
developing the things we use every day.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.180
Take LEDs, for example.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.930
The three scientists who pioneered the LED
- or light emitting diode - back in the early

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.500
90s, were just awarded the 2014 Nobel prize
in physics, which is exclusively awarded to

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.429
inventions that offer the greatest benefit
to mankind.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.850
Of course, those of us living in first-world
countries may not view LEDs as anything more

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.399
than a way to save money on lightbulbs - but
as the official press release says, “LEDs

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.499
have the potential to increase the quality
of life for over 1.5 billion people around

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.940
the world who lack access to electricity grids.”

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.040
In the same way that Thomas Edison’s filament
bulb replaced gas lighting in the 19th century,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.240
LEDs are poised to be the next big generation
of lighting technology.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.450
They’re efficient, long-lasting, and by
the year 2050 - they’re expected to completely

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.340
replace fluorescent and incandescent bulbs.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.899
Interestingly, when they first came about
in the 1980s, LEDs weren’t really all that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.010
useful because at the time, they could only
emit green and red light.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.520
It wasn’t until the 90s, when Shuji Nakamura
developed the first high-brightness blue LED,

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.420
that people realized the three of those colors
could be combined to produce white light - making

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.440
them acceptable for everyday use.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.470
Since then, the technology has advanced at
a remarkable rate.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.520
They’re roughly 15 times more efficient
than incandescent bulbs, meaning you wouldn’t

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520
even need a power grid to use them.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.119
Solar panels and small batteries would be
more than enough to power the homes of the

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.820
staggering 1.2 billion people in the world
who lack access to electricity.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.780
Most of those households are still burning
wood or gas for light - which isn’t just

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.379
inefficient, it also creates indoor air pollution
that according to the WHO, kills more people

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.430
every year than AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis
combined.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.810
Currently, the biggest hurdle is cost.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.090
If you consider their longevity, and the savings
in energy costs, then yes - LEDs are cheaper

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.370
than other types of lightbulbs.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.830
It’s the upfront costs that are higher.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.349
If you were to buy a 60W incandescent bulb
right now, it would cost you about a dollar.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.750
A single LED bulb, however, with equivalent
brightness would be about $10.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.500
So it is a big financial commitment, but it
also pays off in the long run.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.190
Plus, LED bulbs - just like any technology
- get dramatically cheaper every year.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.810
Eventually, the hope is that every household
in the world will have access to something

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.700
we here in developed nations, have had for
centuries now - the miracle of modern light.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.590
Kinda puts things into perspective, doesn’t
it?

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.890
What do you guys think?

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.269
Were these guys deserving of the Nobel Prize?

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:03.549
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:19.719
watching!
