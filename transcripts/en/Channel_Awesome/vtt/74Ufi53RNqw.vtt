00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.180
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.020
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.600
Oh, hell yeah. I fucking love Tom and Jerry.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.180
With the wanton destruction, comedic timing and hilarious sound effects,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.240
this is the original cat and mouse team that perfected the art of cartoon violence.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.780
I'm such a fucking dork that I actually went out and got the DVD collections of these cartoons,

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.200
and you know what I found out?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.600
I'm not the only one who regards them as comic legends.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.600
There's directors, historians,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.860
and even comedy stars like Whoopi Goldberg and MADTV cast members

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.240
who all see Tom and Jerry as comedic gold.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.520
With a comedy team so legendary, you'd think Hollywood would put some real time and effort into their first feature length film together.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.220
They do not.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.300
Instead, we got Tom and Jerry: The Movie,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.980
a 1992 film about, what else, Tom and Jerry.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.600
But now wait a minute, a Tom and Jerry cartoon is about 7 minutes long with just slapstick and silent humor.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.320
How can you possibly make an hour and a half movie out of this?

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.960
Well, let's take a look.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.880
In the opening credits we see Tom and Jerry doing what they do best: chasing each other.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.280
And here's our first problem: voice actors.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.560
Tom and Jerry had little to no voice actors in their cartoons.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.980
But... hey, maybe the slapstick will be funny.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.820
[sigh]

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.480
Even the slapstick is wrong.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.760
I mean, THIS is Tom's yell.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.540
Tom: AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.700
And this is the movie's.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.380
Tom: YAAAAAAOOOOOOOWW!!!

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.380
God, that's not nearly as funny.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.720
And look at this, when Tom get cut in half in the cartoon, it's humorous.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.440
When Tom gets cut in the movie...

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.660
Oh my God, that's blood!

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.420
They actually show blood in this. What are they, fucking psychos?

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.500
Yeah, and here's a real joke.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.900
"Creative Consultant: Joseph Barbera".

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.000
That means they just went up to him everyday and asked,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.340
"Is this destroying your creation? Is this nothing like your original vision?"

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.880
"Yes."

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.700
"Good!"

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.420
So the film begins with Tom's owners moving away,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.900
but Tom accidentally gets flung out of the car, and is forced to stay at home.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.160
It turns out the owners moved just in time as their house is being bulldozed to the ground.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.280
Tom and Jerry escape, but are left without a home.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.380
So the two of them have to roam the streets looking for food and shelter.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.580
These are the only good parts of the movie,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.040
where Tom and Jerry try to decide whether to help each other out or not.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.520
And all without any dialogue.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.400
There's even a cute in-joke with a restaurant called Bill and Joe's, obviously referencing Bill Hanna and Joseph Barbera, the show's creators.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.440
But it all goes downhill when they meet this singing gay dog and his obnoxious little flea named Franky.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.140
Pugsy: Instead of bein' pals, you're fightin' like a cat and a mouse.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.920
Franky: They ARE a cat and a mouse, Pugsy.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.040
Pugsy: They gotta learn to be pals or they ain't gonna make it outta here.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.480
It's like Peter Falk and George Carlin's secret love child.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.860
Except a dog.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.380
Pugsy: The name is Pugsy.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.320
What's yours?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.580
Tom: I'm Tom.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.440
Jerry: I'm Jerry.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.540
[spit-take]

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.340
WHAT THE HELL?!

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.680
DID THEY JUST TALK?

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.480
Did Tom and Jerry, one of the most famous silent duos of all time just speak to each other?

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.580
No. No, no, no no no no.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.600
It's gotta be a mistake,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.840
I gotta be hearing things.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.240
I'm gonna just go ahead and eat my customary three-pound watermelon

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.560
and drink my traditional pitcher of Sangria both at the same time,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.280
while I confirm how wrong I was about this ridiculous misunderstanding.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.640
Tom: Whaddya think I am, a dummy?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.480
Jerry: You said it.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.420
[violent spit-take]

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.420
HOLY CRAP!!

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.240
THEY TALKED!

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.580
THEY ACTUALLY TALKED!!

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.640
The apocalypse has finally begun,

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.940
pigs are learning how to fly,

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.560
Satan is skating his way to work,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.140
and I'm pretty sure that I just became a monkey's uncle.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.360
Unbelievable, I mean just unbelievable.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.080
The one rule that you never break, and they broke it in the first ten minutes.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.880
I mean, isn't that like one of the Ten Commandments or something?

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.940
Uh, thou shall not lie,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.740
thou shall not covet they neighbor's wife...

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.380
TOM AND JERRY DON'T TALK.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.480
But wait, it gets worse!

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.240
Not only can they talk, but they can also sing!

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.200
Tom: ♪We two, we're friends to the end♪

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.300
♪Ain't we, my friend?♪

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.500
Tom and Jerry: ♪You'll never find two other guys compatible, and steak and fries--♪

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.160
But wait! It gets worse!

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.020
Not only do they like to sing,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.740
they like to sing about how they don't like chasing each other and how they enjoy being friends!

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.880
Pugsy/Frankie/Tom/Jerry: ♪The greatest gift in life's a friend♪

Pugsy: Haha! Hey, you guys are the greatest! I love it!

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.080
Franky: You are terrific!

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.620
My God...

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.140
Tom and Jerry...

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.460
...are dead!

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.020
Alas, poor Tom and Jerry,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.700
I knew them, viewing audience.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.320
Two fellows of infinite jest of most excellent fancy.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.720
They hath borne me on many hilarious antics a thousand times;

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.460
and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.800
My gorge rims at it, whatever the hell that means.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.200
Here hung those lips that have been mangled I know not how oft.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.700
Where be your screams now?

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.800
Your torn limbs?

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.140
Your shattered teeth?

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.680
Your set of bowling pins that were wont to set children and adults on a roar?

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.340
Not one now, to mock your antics.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.580
Your skirt has fallen.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.220
Now, get you to Hollywood's chamber, and tell them,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.920
let them stop this douchebaggery that shocks and terrorizes those with most excellent humor,

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.720
and show them what made such great laughter so great.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.240
Make them laugh at that...

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.200
shitfuckers.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.860
Okay, so...

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.760
[sigh]

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.920
after Tom and Jerry become friends,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.440
Pugsy is taken away - thank God - by a pair of Mexican wrestler dog catchers.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.060
So Tom and Jerry set off on their own,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.340
while running into a strange gang of alley cats, who like to do nothing more than to...

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.920
Cat Gang: ♪We got no time for taste♪

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.720
Sing another song?!

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.600
Oh, come on! I already had one song cut the nuts off my childhood,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.020
I don't need another!

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.900
Look at this, it's like West Side Pussy,

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.000
I mean, how can anyone find this entertaining?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.240
It's just torture!

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.440
Cat Gang: ♪What do we care about nice?♪

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.400
♪What do we care about sweet?♪

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.780
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be humming that tune all week.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.540
[off-pitch grumble humming]

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.400
Fuck it.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.300
So after they escape the singing cat gang, -

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.060
Good God, did really I just say that?

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.080
- they come across another shadow lurking in the alleyways.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.840
Who the hell is this?

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:19.260
Robyn: I'm Robyn Sterling, I'm afraid I don't have a home anymore.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.760
I'm sorry, umm, we're trying to shoot a movie here.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.260
Is there any chance you could just kinda mosey along and, uh--

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.180
Robyn: I'm an orphan.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.280
My mother died when I was a baby.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.760
Sucks.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.640
Um, you know, we have a lot of shooting to do,

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.040
and it's actually about Tom and Jerry, I'm sure it's gonna be very funny once it comes out,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.540
but, uh, you're kind of in the way right now, so if you could just, y'know, kinda get outta the way, that'd be great.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.220
Robyn: Aunt Figg was always calling me orphan.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.860
She even stole my locket and threw it out the window, but I climbed down and found it.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.980
You're really not gonna leave until we make a movie about ya, huh?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.200
Robyn: Uh-huh.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.740
Okay, alright.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.480
Uhh, little rewrite here...

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.400
Uhhh...

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.080
All right, uhh... [ahem]

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.980
"Tom and Jerry: The Movie" is now about a little orphan who's trying to find her father, Indiana Jones,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.560
while her evil aunt and lawyer go searching for her because apparently, she's worth a lot of money.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.460
Oh, and there's a cat and mouse in there somewhere,

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.740
but that... that's not important.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.080
So yeah, you're probably thinking,

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.220
"What the hell does this have to do with Tom and Jerry?"

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.160
Well, I guess the writers felt that the story needed a little bit more conflict,

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.940
'cause, you know, Tom and Jerry didn't have any conflict whatsoever.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.020
So after talking under Exposition Bridge,

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.900
Tom, Jerry and Robyn decide to go back to her aunt's house,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.340
because they figure a bad roof over their heads is better than no roof at all.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.360
I never thought anyone could depict an actual representation of a Giant Purple People-Eater,

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.140
but if there's anything that comes close, it's Robyn's aunt, who seems to be consumed by one thing:

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.020
Lickboot: We've got to have...money!

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.140
Oh, sounds like the producers of this movie!

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.080
So they talk about what they're gonna do with Robyn and--

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.100
Oh no, please, not another one.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.460
I'll do anything,

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.140
I'll do your taxes,

00:07:59.140 --> 00:07:59.960
I'll shave your back,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.680
I'll prostitute myself for money,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.460
just PLEASE not another one!

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.440
Aunt Figg: ♪Money is such...♪

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.680
[screams in agony]
♪...a beautiful word♪

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.540
THESE FUCKING SONGS ARE HORRIBLE!

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.500
It's like Alan Menken's puke somehow mutated and started writing music!

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.160
Tom: That's disgusting.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.860
So you might be asking yourself, "Is there *any* slapstick in this movie?"

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.180
Well there's a fat dog on a skateboard who seems to pester Tom and Jerry as they try to eat.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.580
Fat Dog: Special, yeah... [laughs]

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.160
Oh yeah, and he sounds like Gollum.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.080
But again, why isn't it Tom and Jerry doing all the slapstick?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.680
I don't give a shit about the dog.

After making a mess of the place,

Robin's aunt decides to send Tom and Jerry to a person who takes care of pets named Dr. Applecheeks.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.700
By the way, have you noticed the strange names in this movie?

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.360
Dr. Applecheeks, Aunt Figg, Mr. Lickboot?

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.460
These are sounding more like abstract fetishes.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.000
So it turns out Dr. Applecheeks holds rich pets ransom,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.160
and gives them back to their owners for outrageous amounts of money.

So Tom and Jerry find Robyn,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:49.060
but unfortunately, Captain Pedophile is holding her ransom for a million dollar reward that her aunt promised.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:53.120
On top of that, Dr. Applecheeks hears about the reward and wants to get her too.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.780
But unfortunately, he was tossed out of the car he was in,

So Tom and Jerry help Robyn escape as they get on a boat which they, of course, know how to drive.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.680
This results in a wild goose chase as everyone chases after Robyn in order to get the million dollar fortune.

So let me clarify this for those of you who might've missed it.

A cat and a mouse are driving a ship, trying to save the daughter of Indiana Jones

But a lamp falls over and of course starts a fire, burning down the entire cabin.
