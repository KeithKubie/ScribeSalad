00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.780
The concept of the Superman is one of the strangest, most fascinating ideas in Philosophy.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.520
We find it coined by Friedrich Nietzsche in his book of 1883: Thus Spoke Zarathustra.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.280
On first hearing it, we can’t help but think of the action hero Superman,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.600
described by his creators as "faster than a speeding bullet",

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.060
"more powerful than a locomotive", and "able to leap tall buildings in a single bound".

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.500
These are actually very good starting points.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.580
DC Comics were asking themselves

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.020
what someone would be like who is physically far superior to all current human beings.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.400
Nietzsche is asking himself a very similar question;

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.720
only, he’s interested in psychological qualities.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.400
In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche points out that evolution cannot be assumed to have finished.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.320
Human beings have evolved from apes, but, what is ape to man? He asks.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.020
In some respects, like imagination and science, we are obviously far superior to our ancestors.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.280
So how might people of the future be superior to who we are today?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:15.100
Nietzsche’s character, Zarathustra’s, task is to speculate about what the superman - the more advanced person of tomorrow - will be like.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.600
Nietzsche wasn’t interested in massively enhanced brain power,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.600
an ability to do hugely complex sums in one’s head,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.680
or to learn a language in three days.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.840
Rather, he was developing a crucial thought experiment:

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.420
Suppose we were psychologically superior to people of today, what would we actually be like?

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.140
What is the ideal kind of human being?

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.600
And he came up with a very surprising and challenging answer -

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.820
Nietzsche's strategy for answering his own question was to identify the person he most admired,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.820
the person he thought had the best approach to life,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.440
and then hone in on the qualities that made this person the way they were.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.840
He was particularly impressed by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.420
whom he regarded as the nearest anyone had yet come to being a superman.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.840
He also took some hints from Napoleon, Montaigne, Voltaire, and Julius Cesar.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.320
He concluded that Supermen are going to have some wonderful and sometimes unexpected characteristics.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.340
They will: make their own values;

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.240
they will be very independently minded;

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.500
they won’t ask "what do other people admire?" and follow along -

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.520
they will carve their own path.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.460
Supermen accept that might need to hurt people in the name of great things.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.020
They can be selfish in strategic ways.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.640
"Greatness" for them will be about the reform of the humanity towards pagan values -

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.300
- the values of Goethe.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.340
Supermen will never be resentful of the success of others;

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.640
they will accept suffering as a necessary component of good things.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.040
They will understand that they're hard to understand,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.640
and therefore, they may often be lonely.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.460
They will be gentle to towards the weak,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.020
out of consciousness of their own great strength.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.820
They will be a little bit wicked around sex by conventional standards.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.220
They will not be humble, but rather, delight in their own abilities.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.480
They will be interested in the practical application of culture to raise the mentality of society.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.620
Nietzsche thought we would be surprised and sometimes a bit shocked by his list.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.820
He thought we would be expecting that the super humans of tomorrow would be deeply compassionate,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.440
very egalitarian, uninterested in rivalry, and perhaps have ambitions to make breakthroughs in science.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.820
But Nietzsche was arguing something else:

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.420
that maybe being great involve some qualities that were a bit disturbing;

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.020
and also, that greatness means being interested in the salvation of mankind through culture.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.040
The word superman is useful for getting us to think

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.980
about who we would like to evolve into.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.440
Each of us should, under Nietzsche’s guidance, have a sense of what we would like to be

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.620
if we could be the super version of ourselves.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.320
The idea of the Superman helps us to refine our own ambitions.
