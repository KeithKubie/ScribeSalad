00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
It's actually a wide open discussion whether randomization is actually helpful

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.630
because with  considerable analysis many randomized algorithms

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.020
can actually be turned into deterministic algorithms by using a process

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.180
called derandomization, and derandomization usually keeps fundamental properties

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.570
such as polynomial running time, all the base of the exponent.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.790
Randomized algorithms therefore might be a bit faster

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.570
but it's unclear whether this is due to luck if you will or lack of thinking.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.080
So, if you were to pit these two against each other, randomization versus determinism,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.610
it's not really clear who would win or if it's a draw.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.590
So to conclude our exploration of randomization, what might be some reasons that randomization

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.550
is actually at least a bit more powerful than determinism?

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.930
Is it that randomized algorithms are in some way harder to trick

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.990
into a worst case behavior as compared to determinism

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.010
and after all we're analyzing all of the algorithms using worst case analysis.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.460
Is it that randomized algorithm can usually be easier to analyze than deterministic algorithms

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.910
or is it that randomized algorithms actually explore solutions

00:01:05.910 --> 99:59:59.000
that their deterministic counterparts could miss.
