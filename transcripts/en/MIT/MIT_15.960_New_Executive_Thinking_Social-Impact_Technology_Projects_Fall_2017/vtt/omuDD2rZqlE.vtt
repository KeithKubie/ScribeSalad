IDOIA ORTIZ DE ARTINANO
GONI: So my name is Idoia.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.680
I've been working with
Anjali Sastry for a year now.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.950
In two independent studies,
actually, I did two.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.480
I am in the class of
the Sloan Fellows '18.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.240
I just graduated two weeks ago.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.580
So when I came here to
Sloan, I was interested,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.670
and I was super focused
on working in intersection

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.680
of government,
technology, innovation,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.540
and entrepreneurship.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.770
When I started
doing my research,

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.300
I realized that there was
a super interesting space,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.460
that it's about the
startups doing work

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.810
in selling to governments to
improve the service delivery.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.170
So my research, my
independent study,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.520
has been focused on this space.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.350
So to narrow the topic
of my independent study,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.150
the key was the work
that I did with Anjali.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.400
Actually, she helped me a lot.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.620
And when you come here
to the university,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.390
you have a lot of interests.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.752
And everything is super broad.

00:01:12.752 --> 00:01:14.960
You want to do everything,
and you can't in this kind

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.890
of independent study.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.380
So having these kind
of conversations

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.910
every week, several hours
per week, helped me a lot.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.670
So what I wanted to do
with my independent study

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.620
was a combination
of research to see

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.930
which was the academic
or these research

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.240
papers already made in the
market, in this market,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.080
or in this specific space,
but also see and take

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.010
advantage of the connections
that you have here at MIT

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.620
to see what was going
on in the market.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.580
So with Anjali, we
decided to create

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.670
what we call Public Tech
at MIT Series of speakers,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.990
that it was a good excuse
for us to go out there,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.330
say, OK, I'm doing
this research.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.150
I'm doing these
lines of research

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.704
about these, these,
and these things.

00:02:11.704 --> 00:02:13.870
But I want to know what you
are doing in this space.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.760
So please, can you
come here to MIT

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.460
and explain us
what you are doing?

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.990
And I mean, that was amazing.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.390
I don't think that no
one is coming nowhere

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.560
if you as a student go.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.750
But if you go and
you say, I'm studying

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.580
what you are doing here at MIT.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.510
They come.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.660
So with this excuse,
we had several people,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.920
super level people doing
super interesting stuff, that

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.730
came here to explain us
what they were doing.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.890
And afterwards, we had the
opportunity, of course,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.620
to take all that experience
and all that information

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.530
to put it, in my case,
in my research paper.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.630
And that was amazing.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.370
Here in Sloan, you
come, and suddenly, you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.470
have an entire
ecosystem for you.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.820
The challenge here is to
understand the ecosystem

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.240
and to know where is
your tribe of people that

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.710
are interested in
the same things

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.170
that you are
interested in and to be

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.670
super efficient with your time.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.211
Because at the end of the day,
you have so many things to do.

00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:16.860
So that combination
of good classes--

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.710
I mean like the state of
the art of many things

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.390
in these classes--

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.840
and this ecosystem on
opportunities to do

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.760
and action learning and to
have this kind of interaction

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.720
and debates and
conversations with people

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.320
that are already doing these
kind of things, it's amazing.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.370
I don't think that
you will have these

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.840
in many other universities.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.540
Well, I learned many
things during this process,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.540
especially because I was
interested in something

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.790
super, super specific and
not necessarily very common

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.320
in this school.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.180
So I was coming from
the public sector.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.650
This is a business school.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.490
But it still is a business and
administration school, right?

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.170
So in Australia, you have
also in the government.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.840
So what I had the chance
with this independent study

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.980
was like to focus on a
specifically this space

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.709
that maybe I didn't have
too many chances or too

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.070
many opportunities to
work on in other classes

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.110
or in another events or whatever
that they had in the school.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.130
So the structure, the
work, in independent study

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.990
is kind of complicated.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.370
I think that it's the
most challenging thing.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.870
Why?

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.340
Because at the end of the
day, you have a lot of classes

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.660
with a lot of a homework
and assignments due

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.610
tomorrow or yesterday.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.640
So when you have these
independent studies

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.490
that you know that you have
the whole term to do it,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.210
you are always having
other kind of priorities.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.800
So for me, it was key to create
an outline from the beginning

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.230
and create a schedule
for that outline.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.590
So at least I knew, and I
was tracking my performance

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.570
and my development.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.750
And that helped a lot.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.250
It's true that at
the end of the day

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.030
you take this last week that
you have at the end of the term

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.230
to focus or to create,
to edit, or to make

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.900
it the substantial thing
of the independent study,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.060
but I think that I
did a very good job

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.380
of doing these all these
research and everything before.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.780
I would say in the
first part of the term.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.100
Talking about the
challenges that I

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.370
had when working my
independent study,

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.370
I would say that maybe in
my second independent study

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.100
that it was about,
as I said before,

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.040
taking a case, a
real case, and use

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.280
the research and the academic
content that I was studying,

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.270
apply it, and see
what could happen.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.010
And so I started with,
let's say, with an idea,

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.130
thinking that that was
the right thing to do

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.700
and that it could work
in that specific context.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.460
For a specific example there,
I was studying in Peru.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.610
And when I went through
all the research,

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.790
I was realizing that it
was not going to work.

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.040
And that's super complicated
because it's a real case.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.920
It's real people working
with a lot of engagement

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:37.400
and a lot of ideas or are super
positive about doing something

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.000
like that.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.860
And I was seen studying
different cases,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.010
studying the research done,
studying all the information

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.010
that I could get from
the MIT, that thing

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.980
that they were doing.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:50.771
And I was studying.

00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:52.500
It was not going to work.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.980
So for me, it was kind of
struggling in the process

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.560
because I didn't want
to tell them that,

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.690
but I could not do it.

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.260
So I remember that I went
through all the process

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.280
of writing everything.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.420
And at the end of the day, at
the end of the process, I said,

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:10.670
I need to put down
my recommendations

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.930
and hard recommendations.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.630
Like saying, OK, so
there are some baselines

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.702
that you are taking from
random that are not OK--

00:07:16.702 --> 00:07:19.160
blah, blah, blah, this kind of
things that it was kind of--

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.960
And I had a
conversation with them.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.100
It was hard.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.454
But you can see
there the real value

00:07:24.454 --> 00:07:26.120
of the independent
study and the process

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.203
that you are doing, right?

00:07:27.203 --> 00:07:29.019
At least I guess that--

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:31.310
I don't think that they are
doing any more this project

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.040
because the conversation that
we had because the research

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.300
that I did.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.040
And that has value.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.742
But it was hard.
