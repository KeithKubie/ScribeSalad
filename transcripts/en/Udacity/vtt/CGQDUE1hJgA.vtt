00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.994
Hello and welcome to a tale of analysis and design, featuring

00:00:05.994 --> 00:00:10.809
Spencer Rugaber, as the librarian, and Alex Orso,

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.779
as the software engineer. [SOUND]

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:21.520
&gt;&gt; Hi! I'm here waiting for Spencer, my librarian friend. He needs some

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.470
help developing an information system for a library. So I asked him to write

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.669
down the requirements for the libra... Oh, [SOUND] that must be him.

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:30.850
&gt;&gt; Hello Alex.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.470
&gt;&gt; Hey Spencer. How's it going?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.690
&gt;&gt; Good. Did you get those requirements I emailed you?

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.890
&gt;&gt; Oh, you emailed them. Now let me check.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.780
And, by the way, get some coffee for you here.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.790
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. They're right here. Let me see. Oh, good. Oh, yeah,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.580
good. We have, what we need. So the, the way I like to do

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.500
this is. I like to start by

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.430
looking at the requirements and identifying the nouns

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.530
in the requirements, because those tell us

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.080
the kind of the relevant elements in the,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.360
in the requirements. So if you don't mind we can start looking at those and

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.070
you can tell me you know, whether the ones that I am identifying make sense or not.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.920
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.500
&gt;&gt; All right.
