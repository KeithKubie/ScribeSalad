00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.461
- Today, you will be

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:06.548
with steel harvested
from this hedgehog

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:10.009
combining it with the
1095 on your anvils

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:11.678
to form your blades--

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:14.055
the combat knife.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.183
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.184
Good luck.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.437
Your three hours starts now.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:26.735
So we've got our four veterans
scurrying about the forge

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:28.695
looking to harvest some steel.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:29.863
Do you expect that
these guys are

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.989
going to work in teams, Doug?

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.407
Absolutely.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:35.034
Even though this is an
individual competition,

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:38.163
in the military,
we work as a team.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.790
I love the idea of
doing a combat knife.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.666
Wow.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.042
This [bleep] is thick.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:47.088
Watch your feet when
that bad boy drops.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.256
You watch yours.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:48.882
I didn't listen
to my own advice.

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:54.554
WILL: Mike, you're
our only marine.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:55.805
I know.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.557
So what do you
think of when you hear

00:00:57.557 --> 00:00:59.017
fighting knife or combat knife?

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.685
- Marine Corps-- KA-BAR.
- KA-BAR.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:02.145
Exactly what I think.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:03.772
How do you plan on
forge-welding your steel?

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:06.441
I'm going to do a
.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.194
All right, brother.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.403
Damn it.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.030
WILL: Mike's
[inaudible] looks rough.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.657
Not only is it duck-lipping,
but the lips are sliding.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:15.700
Yeah, shifting.

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:21.414
[bleep] me.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:30.590
When I do Damascus I have
a 50% failure rate because

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.926
forge-welding is not my staple.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:36.971
But I learned not to
chase turds by getting

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:39.307
smacked a whole bunch
of times by the master

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.351
bladesmith I learned from.

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.185
Screw it.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.895
Rule one-- abandon.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:44.771
Chuck it.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:45.980
Done.
Start over.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.237
WILL: We are almost one
hour into this first round

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:55.490
of competition, and
Mike is starting over.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:03.414
Oh, now we're
doing the hard part--

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:05.250
waiting for it to
get up to weld temp.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.292
That sucks, man.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.962
MIKE: Oh, man, I'm way behind.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.214
Seeing where they're
at and mine is

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.174
still in the fire getting hot.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:14.133
What can I do?

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.552
Nothing.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:20.265
So I'm standing at the
forge and that sense of,

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:22.600
what's happening here?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.603
I actually start to
feel pressure in my jaw,

00:02:25.603 --> 00:02:27.605
in my left arm.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.650
It just seems to snowball on me.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.693
All right, hold on.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:32.735
The medic's on the floor.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:36.531
Perry, are you all right?

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:37.907
Is the world's spinning on you?

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:38.783
Yeah.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:39.909
Perry's just locked up.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.202
Let's go behind here.

00:02:41.202 --> 00:02:42.245
Oh.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:43.496
The world's spinning on you?

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:44.289
Yeah.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.332
He's going down.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:49.002
MEDIC: Sit down,
sit down, sit down.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.130
Perry, sit up.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.049
Here's what you got
to respect about Perry.

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.553
He worked until he
couldn't stand anymore,

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.972
and there's a lot to be said
for that kind of tenacity.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.269
30 minutes, bladesmiths.

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.314
You have 30 minutes
remaining in this round.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.025
In case you didn't notice,
Perry has been medical dropped,

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.818
but that's not a free pass.

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:18.573
Your blades still
need to be up to par.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.074
Mike is back on track.

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:21.826
Oh yeah.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:25.872
I set my weld on a second one
and everything is phenomenal.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:28.166
I am in my zone and I'm
just letting the steel

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.335
take me on a beautiful trip.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:40.595
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.221
Bladesmiths, shut
down your machines.

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.640
Drop your tools.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.016
This round is over.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.310
Just because we've
had a medical drop

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.520
doesn't mean that you
all get a free pass.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.065
You still have to fulfill
the mission parameters.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.399
John, you're up first.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:57.278
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:58.947
The steel looks good.

00:03:58.947 --> 00:04:01.658
I think the profile of your
knife's really good looking.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:04.202
Our only marine.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:08.748
Mike, please present
your blade to the judges.

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:12.794
First up, good job
knowing when to start over.

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:16.214
This looks like a very
nice slashing weapon.

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.675
Thrusting wise, with a
trailing point over there,

00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:21.344
you have to adjust, so you want
to be able to have a little bit

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:22.720
more of an angle
that comes to a point

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.223
to where I don't have to adjust.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.224
All right, Jim.

00:04:26.224 --> 00:04:28.893
You're up.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:31.104
Classic spear point.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:34.232
Great cutting, great
thrusting design.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:38.820
Big concern for me is this seam
going right down the middle

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.863
of the spine in your knife.

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:44.158
But I love the shape of it.
Nice job.

00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:44.993
Thank you, sir.

00:04:44.993 --> 00:04:46.536
OK, bladesmiths.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:48.413
The judges have completed
their deliberation

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:50.873
and they've made
a final decision.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:53.418
The judges agree that you
all have passed parameters,

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.586
and you will be moving
on to round two.

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:56.587
Congratulations.
