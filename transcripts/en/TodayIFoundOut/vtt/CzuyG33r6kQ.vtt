00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.450
Outside of wine snobs, I think we can all
agree that wine snobs are just the worst.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.620
This is not because virtually every study
ever conducted into the field of wine tasting

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.699
as a whole has concluded that it’s ridiculously
easy to convince even the top sommeliers that

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:17.210
$5 boxed white wine is the finest red wine
ever bottled.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.560
Nor is it because wines they would happily
sacrifice their first born to have a glass

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.940
of and would have otherwise raved about, when
told the glass contains a variety of some

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.670
cheap wine they are to identify, are more
than likely to claim it tastes akin to horse

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.670
piss.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.810
No, the fact that human psychology is so big
a part of the whole wine mythos (and how we

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:39.850
perceive tastes and smells) isn’t our problem
here; humans are gonna human, after all, and

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.899
everybody likes what they like, with human
psychology often playing a big role.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.960
Who are we to judge?

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.380
No, the real problem is a rather vocal subset
of wine connoisseurs who are astoundingly

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.399
snooty about the whole thing, making all the
rest of us wine lovers look bad in the process.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.320
This level of snobbishness is particularly
rich given that what some of them have spent

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.980
thousands of hours of their precious time
on Earth doing is nothing more than becoming

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.190
an expert on grape juice- you know, the stuff
(sans alcohol) that your 2 year old drinks

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.510
at $3 a gallon…

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.070
You might as well get highfalutin about your
magnificent fuzzy sock collection.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.640
(Which, to be fair, is fabulously comfy I’m
sure.)

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.150
Perhaps nothing sums all this up better than
the so-called “Judgement of Paris”- an

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.229
event that would change the wine world forever
(for the better).

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.030
Besides the more productive outcomes, the
event saw some of the top pearl-clutching

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.810
French wine snobs throw a near year-long temper
tantrum because they accidentally revealed

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.040
that in a blind taste test they not only largely
misidentified the American wine from the supposedly

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.259
far superior French wine, but that they strongly
preferred the American adult grape juice…

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.450
The origins of the Judgement of Paris can
be traced to a well meaning promoter of French

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.310
wine and owner of a wine store in Paris, Steven
Spurrier.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.189
Spurrier organized the event with the hopes
of highlighting that the quality of wine coming

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.540
from California at the time wasn’t nearly
as bad as its reputation then held.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.451
He also hoped in the process to drum up some
additional business for his Parisian wine

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:11.950
shop in highlighting the many French wines
that could be purchased there.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.510
Naturally, he, along with pretty much everyone
else in the world, assumed the French wines

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.359
would win the contest pretty handily.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.409
In organizing the event, Spurrier scouted
what he felt were the finest wines currently

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.510
produced in California and pitted them, deathmatch
style, against their closest French equivalent.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.470
To judge the competition, Spurrier tracked
down some of France’s top wine experts,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.400
including the then editor of The French Wine
Review, Odette Kahn, as well as several professional

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.620
sommeliers (the elite of the elite of wine
tasters) of the French persuasion.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.769
All in all Spurrier was able to assemble a
veritable dream team of wine-sniffing talent

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.319
consisting of nine of the best palates in
the business.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.099
To round out the numbers, Spurrier himself
took part, as did American wine connoisseur

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.620
Patricia Gallagher.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.120
Realising that accusations of bias would inevitably
be levied against him if French wines cleaned

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.519
house at the event, Spurrier opted to make
the event a blind tasting and told his fellow

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.920
judges to simply judge each wine on its own
merits, not by any specific scale.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.589
Something his judges had no problem with.

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:13.209
At first.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.769
Although Spurrier attempted to publicise the
competition as widely as he could, sending

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.409
invites to most every major media outlet he
could think of, the whole thing was seen as

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.909
being such a nonstory that only a single journalist
turned up to cover the event- TIME magazine’s

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:27.989
George M. Taber.

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.760
Taber would later state he only showed up
as a favour to Spurrier and, like most everyone

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.799
else, assumed that the French wines would
win hands down, which would likely see his

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.930
article tantamount in interest to one titled
“Water is wet”.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.079
Taber (who, unlike the judges, knew which
wines were which ahead of time) quickly changed

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.339
his mind though when he saw French restaurateur
and chef Raymond Oliver say to himself “Ah,

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.159
back to France” while sampling a Napa Valley
chardonnay…

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.559
As Taber would later recount in an interview
with NPR, “I thought, hey, maybe I got a

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:00.559
story here.”

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:05.090
And oh boy did he have a story, with the subsequent
piece he penned being called “the most significant

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.790
news story ever written about wine.”

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.790
Why?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.260
Almost every judge placed at least one American
wine above it’s French counterpart while

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.040
several, including a later mortified Kahn,
deemed an American wine, both red and white,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.400
to be the best overall.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.930
In fact, the American wines as a group absolutely
dominated the event, 1992 Olympic Basketball

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.490
Dream Team style.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.800
While this still might seem like a nonstory
today, it’s important to understand the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.800
context here.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.449
Again, at this point in history, it was generally
assumed by pretty much every wine expert that

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.199
French wine was vastly superior to all other
wines in the world for a variety of reasons,

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.479
including things like soil, weather, secret
methods passed down over the centuries known

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.479
only by French wine makers, etc.

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.080
As Taber would later comment on the results,
“It turned out to be the most important

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.090
event, because it broke the myth that only
in France could you make great wine.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.460
It opened the door for this phenomenon today
of the globalization of wine.”

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.409
Wine expert and author David White further
chimed in, “The 1976 judgment totally changed

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:07.409
the game.

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.540
[The results] gave winemakers everywhere a
reason to believe that they too could take

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.009
on the greatest wines in the world.”

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.509
Not long after this event, the creation of
new wine vineyards across the world absolutely

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:17.509
exploded.

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.370
On top of this, according to the founder of
the award winning wine brand Stag’s Leap,

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.229
Warren Winiarski, wine makers also began more
openly sharing information about their methods

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.710
with others in the field.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.479
What this all revealed was that the French
wine makers had fallen well behind the times

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.469
in a lot of areas owing to keeping to various
traditions and classical ways of doing things,

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.699
whereas newer vineyard owners had been more
open to embracing improved methods and technologies.

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.040
Thus, thanks to this event, Winiarski states,
“The wines of the world are better, the

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.220
wines of France are better.”

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.479
Going back to the Judgement of Paris, upon
hearing the results, a furious Odette Kahn

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.720
tried and failed to get her ballot back, reportedly
desperate to stop anyone from finding out

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.860
how she had ranked the wines, fearing it would
ruin her considerable reputation in the wine

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.860
world.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.319
When her efforts failed, she resorted to slandering
Spurrier and claiming that the event, judged

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.590
near exclusively by French wine experts, in
France, put on by a guy who at the time only

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.069
sold (and spent his life championing) French
wines had been rigged against French wine…

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:20.090
Kahn, and others, also saw to it that Spurrier
was temporarily ostracized from the French

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.789
wine community, initially making it difficult
for him to stock the shelves of his wine shop

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.720
as well as banning him from the prestigious
French wine tasting tour for a year.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.419
After that year he still occasionally had
trouble acquiring certain wines, such as finding

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.620
himself banned from the Domaine Ramonet-Prudhon
vineyard when he went there to make a purchase

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.620
over a year later.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.250
(Not all was lost for Spurrier, however.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.020
He would later go on to win a variety of awards
in the wine industry, including one for, ironically,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.889
“his services to French wine.”)

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:50.120
But before all this, the French media responded
by effectively burying the story of the Judgement

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.120
of Paris.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:54.639
In fact, among the scant mentions of it in
French papers from the time, some questioned

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.009
whether the event had actually happened.

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:00.719
One that did acknowledge it simply argued
that the experiment was merely an example

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:05.250
of “the silliness that can occur at blind
tastings”, which, to be fair, that’s a

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.560
valid point, though the overarching result
of the event still stood- while exact results

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.969
may vary from test to test, French wines weren’t
in a class of their own anymore.

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:17.499
That said, 30 years later Spurrier organised
yet another blind tasting very much like the

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:21.939
first to see if the results would change,
but, again, this resulted in American wines

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:23.220
winning top honors.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.819
This time, however, seemingly nobody was greatly
surprised, nor upset.

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:48.719
Turns out you can make great wine in a variety
of regions in the world, not just on France.
