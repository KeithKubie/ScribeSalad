00:00:05.417 --> 00:00:08.250
(uplifting music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.910
Bipedal, naked.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.770
Large-brained.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.570
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.790
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.720
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.690
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.550
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.040
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.110
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.380
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.540
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.180
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.530
to exchange insights on who
we are, and how we got here.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.980
An exploration made possible

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.520
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:22.078 --> 00:01:24.661
(bright music)

00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:30.198
(cheerful music)

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.670
- Good afternoon, and welcome

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.220
to this CARTA symposium on hunting.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.480
My name is Pascal Gagneux.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.410
I'm the Associate Director of CARTA.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
Among the oldest questions
humans have asked themselves are,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.680
who are we, what are we doing here,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.680
where did we come from,
how did we get here,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.590
and where are we going.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.440
Anthropogeny focuses on
two of these questions,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.090
namely, where did we come
from, and how did we get here.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.330
It brings together a
variety of disciplines,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.840
because we believe that
understanding human origins

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.880
is only possible at the intersection

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.810
between the social and
the natural sciences,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.950
with help from computing
sciences and various disciplines.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.730
It's a question that's
so big that no single

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.610
discipline will be able to answer it.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.840
This symposium is sponsored by CARTA,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.490
the Center for Academic Research

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.860
and Training in Anthropogeny.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.060
The scientific quest to
understand human origins.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.300
CARTA is a interdisciplinary enterprise

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.030
that brings together people from UCSD

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.490
and the Salk Institute,
and people across the mesa.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.170
It is co-directed by Ajit Varki,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.150
Margaret Schoeninger and Fred Gage.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.880
And I do what I can to help.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.480
We want to say very special
thanks to our major sponsor,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.150
The G. Harold and Leila Y.
Mathers Foundation of New York,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.440
that have in many ways made
everything possible we've done,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.280
and continue to help us a lot.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.310
We also would like to especially
thank Annette Merle-Smith,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.900
who is here today, for her huge help

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.790
in supporting the Graduate
Specialization in Anthropogeny.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.590
A one of a kind program
that brings together

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.620
graduate students from
different disciplines,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.200
eight different grad programs at UCSD,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.340
to try to talk to each other and navigate

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.310
this question of where do we come from,

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.040
what are human origins.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.020
And we want also to extend thanks

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.660
to the many people who have
supported the establishment

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.800
of the James Handelman Endowment

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.880
for the Exploration of Anthropogeny,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.740
in an effort to endow
CARTA, and indefinitely

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.110
to continue this symposia.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.180
We have the nagging feeling that we're not

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.250
quite done understanding human origins.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.560
Many people have stepped
forward and helped,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.790
and we hope very much that
many of you will join.

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.720
We also want to say a special thanks

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.980
to Elizabeth Lancaster and Eli Shefter,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.210
for subscribing the Closed Captioning.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.870
And all of you who have
helped us by supporting CARTA.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.870
This would not be possible
without CARTA staff.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.890
Ingrid Benirschke,
Rachel Emens, Kate Kaya,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.050
Linda Nelson, and Jesse Robie
that you will see today.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.420
Kate is not here, she
is manning the computers

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.490
and helping with the webcast.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.780
And also the UCSD-TV cast, Rich Wargo,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.600
Matt Alioto, Marci
Bretts and Jacob Parker.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.900
Finally we would like to thank
Kent Schnoeker, in the back,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.670
who is in charge of the recording

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.250
and the projection, and Michael Jeffs.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.180
And of course, I wouldn't
end without thanking

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.410
Ed Siegel for the
wonderful welcoming music.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.420
So with no further ado, I welcome you,

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.250
and I hope you will enjoy a lot

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.660
of new knowledge and insight into hunting.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.445
And I pass over to our
chair, Richard Wrangham.

00:05:16.445 --> 00:05:19.445
(audience applauds)

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.160
- Thank you, Pascal.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.280
And thank you to CARTA.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.200
It's wonderful to have a symposium here,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.580
on a problem that is a
wonderful meld of interests,

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.990
if you happen to be
someone who is interested

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.230
in both chimpanzees and in humans.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:46.230
What we're dealing with here is ultimately

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.590
a hypothesis that has been of huge impact,

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.980
in terms of anthropology
in general, actually.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.650
When Washburn and Lancaster produced this,

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.010
this notion that the intellect, interests,

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.770
emotions and basic social life

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.020
all are evolutionary products
of the hunting adaptation,

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.180
that may have been a slight exaggeration,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.000
but it nevertheless remains true today

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.546
that a tremendous amount
of the way in which

00:06:12.546 --> 00:06:17.080
our own adaptations have evolved are seen

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.060
as going on through lives
of hunters and gatherers.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.490
And of course, hunters
and gatherers very much

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.730
are thought of in terms
of the hunting adaptation.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.760
The particular time when this

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.180
received bigger stimulus than any,

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.300
perhaps, was on the occasion of the Man

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.600
the Hunter symposium in Chicago,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.160
that led to a famous book.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.540
And it's worth noting that this had

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.070
scholars all across anthropology,

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.110
from archeologists and
biological anthropologists,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.150
to social anthropologists
like Marshall Sahlins there.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.470
And even though it
sounds appallingly sexist

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.500
to think of man the hunter as being

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.400
the origin of so many of our adaptations,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.550
it's worth remembering
that out of that symposium,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.170
came for the first time the appreciation

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.850
that foraging by females might be,

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.470
well, at least as important as hunting.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.080
So that was '68, '66, and it was happening

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.890
at a time when people have
just started to realize

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.140
that thanks to Jane Goodall's work

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.000
starting in the early 1960s,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.900
that chimpanzees,
astonishingly, were hunters

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.500
in a somewhat human-like style.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.020
With the males being
more engaged in hunting,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.490
and all of these fascinating associated

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.470
features such as food sharing.

00:07:45.424 --> 00:07:50.424
And the pattern of the
development of interest in hunting

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.730
is therefore taken both chimps
and humans side by side,

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.090
and you might think
that all the interesting

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.370
questions have now been answered.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:00.940
But a few months ago,

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.640
Jim Moore and Ian Gilby
were talking together

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.090
about the fact that even such a question

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.740
as why is it that chimpanzees
in some populations

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.220
hunt a lot more than others,
had not really been answered.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.980
And out of their
conversations, they realized

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.850
there were a whole slew of problems.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:25.850
What exactly is the reason
that chimps or humans hunt?

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:28.180
And in both cases, we've got the question

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.060
is it really for nutritional benefits,

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.070
or are they showing off in some way.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.390
And by the way, if it
is nutritional benefits,

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.480
what are the nutritional benefits?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.050
And are they consistent
in different contexts?

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.270
It's still really an unresolved question.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.250
We still know rather
little about the degree

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.890
to which hunting is beneficial
at the individual level,

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.450
or how much cooperation is needed for it.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.560
Only recently has much attention

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.370
been paid to hunting by females.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.920
So this core question for anthropology

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.720
50 years ago still remains very much

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.830
unexplored, or underexplored.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.480
And of course, it ultimately relates

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.100
to the origins of human hunting.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.510
So the classic kind of
meat-eating hypothesis is this.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.710
That in the Pleiocene,
the australopithecines

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.420
were not probably eating very much meat.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.720
But, chimpanzee-like style, they did hunt.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.700
And then that gave rise
to more meat-eating,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.400
in the habilene phase.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.100
And then meat-eating
became really critical.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.720
But we can dissect that and start asking

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.470
are all of the questions
I've just been addressing

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.410
and more about why this happened,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:45.620
and ultimately, what
its consequences were.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.160
So we're not gonna be talking
today about the consequences,

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.920
we're gonna be talking more about

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.710
why it happens and how it happens.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.360
And in thinking about where we come from,

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.600
in relationship to where our
hunter-gatherer past took us,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.260
then we're gonna be taking
a third party as well,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.350
and bring chimps in, to
help us on that journey.

00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:12.662
(audience applauds)

00:10:12.662 --> 00:10:15.245
(bright music)
