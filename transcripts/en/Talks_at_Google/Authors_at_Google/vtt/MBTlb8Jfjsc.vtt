00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:01.319
Kim: Hi everybody, how are you doing, thanks
for coming.

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:08.050
So it is my great pleasure to introduce a
dear friend of mine, Gretchen Rubin who I

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.050
have known since 1996 when we worked at the
federal communications commission together.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.050
Gretchen has been an inspiration for me personally
for many years.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.050
I wrote my first novel in large part thanks
to the advice that Gretchen gave me, which

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:22.650
was – I was in a job that I hated and she
kept reminding me because I'm a flake about

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830
it, don't forget to quit.
[laughter]

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:35.359
So that was much appreciated.
She helped me launch in 1999 the year of my

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:44.620
fantasy.
So her advice has made a big difference in

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.620
my life and it will make a difference in your
life as well.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.070
Gretchen is the author of many books, one
is power, money, fame , sex -- did I get that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.070
one right?

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.070
Gretchen: Yes

00:00:49.070 --> 00:01:03.679
Kim: I always reverse the order.
She has written two wonderful biographies,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:18.890
one of Winston Churchill, and one of JFK.
Forty ways, she started a whole new genre

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.480
of biography.
So you look at the person through many different

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.710
lenses.
And you're very lucky to have her here to

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.710
talk about her research.
Gretchen is one of the smartest people I know

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.940
and really great at reading tremendous amounts
of information and then distilling it and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.000
giving you the most important and useful tidbits.
So welcome to Gretchen, thank you.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.650
Gretchen: Thank you

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.860
[Applause]

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:53.320
Gretchen: Thanks so much, I'm so happy to
be here.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.110
And it's so much fun to be back here with
Kim because we've been partners in happiness

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.490
for a very long time.
So I'm gonna talk for about 15 minutes and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.750
then and then we'll just do Q &amp; A because
that by far my favorite part, to talk about

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.970
happiness.
And I'll start by talking about how I got

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.340
the idea to have a happiness project, and
then some of the highlights of what I felt

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.110
like I learned.
The moment when I decided to have a happiness

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.360
project was a very inconspicuous moment in
my life.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.530
I was stuck on a city bus because it was pouring
rain and we were moving very slowly.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.390
And I didn't have anything to do, so I had
an opportunity for a rare moment of reflection.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.060
And I thought, what do I want from life anyway?
I thought, I want to be happy.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.310
But I realized that I didn't spend any time
thinking about whether I was happy, or how

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.380
to be happier, or even what I thought it meant
to be happy.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.350
So I thought, I should have a happiness project,
and in a flash it hit me.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.710
And I have sort of a lawyerly analytical mind,
so I instantly envisioned themes and resolutions

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.130
and charts and to-do.
And the very next day I went out and got a

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.490
huge stack of books and started to do my research.
At first I just did the happiness project

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.380
for myself, to make myself happier, or to
see if I could make myself happier.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.290
Before long I realized it would make a good
book, and that's -- I turned it into the book

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.650
that is the account of the year that I spent
test driving the wisdom of the ages, the current

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.380
scientific studies, and the lessons from popular
culture about how to be happier.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.349
I wanted to know if you really did all those
things that you hear that you should do, would

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.319
it really work?
Could you really make yourself happier?

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:30.430
[pause]

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.130
As I started going, before I even figured
out all the resolutions that I wanted to try,

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.160
I quickly realized that I needed guiding principles.
More than things like sing in the morning,

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.490
or fight right, I needed big ideas that were
gonna tell me how to act, and how to behave.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.459
And the most important one -- There were 12,
I called them my 12 personal commandments,

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.000
the first one, the most important one is to
be Gretchen.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.739
And you should feel free to substitute your
own name.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.459
But be Gretchen was this idea that I could
only build a happy life on the foundation

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.270
of my own nature.
So I really had to think about what was right

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.880
for me, what, what was gonna make me happy.
There were a lot of things that were surprising

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.000
for me as I started trying to figure this
out.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
[Pause]

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.639
One thing was that although there was something
that I was beginning to realize was very important

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.870
to my happiness, it was something that was
completely ignored by the scientists who study

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.949
happiness.
And by the positive psychology folks who talk

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.479
about happiness.
They completely ignored this area of life.

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:41.160
Yet if I would look at magazines, books, television,
there was a huge amount of interest in this

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.809
area of life.
That was the issue of clutter.

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:52.889
I realized that for me, as for many people,
outer order contributed to inner calm.

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.039
[cough]
My first month's theme was energy.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.120
Because I figured, well if I have more energy,
all those other resolutions are going to be

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.370
easier to keep.
And that's exactly what happened.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.279
So I was trying to figure out what was draining
my energy.

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:11.719
Things like not getting enough sleep.
I realized that one of the drains on my energy

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:16.279
was this feeling that there was just this
scum of clutter in my way.

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:20.580
There was things that didn't fit, things that
didn't work, things that weren't in the right

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:26.069
place, drawers that wouldn't shut, closets
that I couldn't stick another item into.

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:31.180
So I kept trying to find strategies to just
get this under control.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.430
One thing that worked for me -- and as I recalled,
Kim said that this was a major thing that

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.460
worked for her was something called the one
minute rule.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.610
This is the rules that if you can do something
in one minute, you have to do it without procrastinating.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.110
If you can read a letter and throw it away,
if you can put a dish in the dishwasher, if

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.849
you can just hang up your coat, you should
just go ahead and do it and don't wait.

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.029
And this just removes sort of that superficial
layer of clutter from you life.

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:02.800
Along the same lines I did something called
the evening tidy up.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.499
So for 10 to 15 minutes every night, I don't
clean, I just tidy up.

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:11.939
I put books on the shelves, I put magazines
away, put clothes away.

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:16.589
And then coming down in the morning, everything
is just much more serene, and you just have

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:20.469
that sense of everything being in it's place.

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:21.469
[Pause]

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:27.309
And on my blog, and in my book, and in conversations
with people, I talk about hundreds of resolutions.

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:31.289
And yet there is one resolution that comes
up over and over again when I say to people

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:33.630
"what worked for you?"
I'll say, "What have you tried?"

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.599
"What have I suggested?"
"What works for you?"

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:41.360
This resolution comes up the most.
And I don't know why, it does not seem like

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.529
the preeminent resolution for happiness.
But it is the resolution to make your bed.

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:51.069
This is the thing that people mention to me
the most often.

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.729
There's something about that little tiny accomplishment
first thing in the morning.

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:00.379
There's a very tangible difference between
a room that has a bed made, and a bed not

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.089
made.
It doesn't seem like something that should

00:07:02.089 --> 00:07:04.590
make a big difference, and yet this is the
thing that comes up.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:09.800
That was a surprise to me.
Another thing that surprised me was that when

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.961
I started, I expected that the most useful
resources were gonna be the things that were

00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:18.969
the most universal.
So, philosophical framework that applied to

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:25.270
all of human nature, or scientific studies
that were done on large populations.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.010
What I found was exactly the opposite.
The things that -- the resources that were

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:36.219
the most helpful to me were the things that
were the most idiosyncratic to other people.

00:07:36.219 --> 00:07:41.539
Now someone like Thoreau did not call his
movement to Walden Pond a happiness project.

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:47.259
But that is what I would call it.
And from those very idiosyncratic accounts,

00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:53.339
I learned the most about myself.
The person who was my best guide, who, from

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:59.610
whom I learned the most about myself was Samuel
Johnson who's a British writer, he lived 300

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.569
years ago.
Dr. Johnson wrote the English dictionary,

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:10.749
a very brilliant yet extremely eccentric man.
He and I have nothing in common.

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:15.179
But it was from Samuel Johnson that I learned
the most about myself.

00:08:15.179 --> 00:08:22.159
One thing, just a toss off comment that he
made at one point was "abstinence is as easy

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:29.909
to me as temperance would be difficult."
And when I read that I thought, that's me.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:35.529
I can give things up cold turkey, but I cannot
indulge in moderation.

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:38.729
And so that's what I call the abstainer, moderator
split.

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:44.279
Abstainers can give thing up like 100%, like
I don't eat cheese, I never order desert in

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:47.680
a restaurant.
Moderators say "I can have 2 Hershey's kisses,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.820
but not 10 Hershey's kisses."
Or "I can have desert on a special occasion."

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.720
And it's not a question of which is better
or worse, but just which one works better

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.839
for you.
And it turns out that this is a really important

00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:03.630
thing to know about yourself for a happiness
project, because resisting temptation is something

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:10.029
that comes up a lot in peoples happiness projects.
In fact the #1 resolution among Americans

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:14.940
for New Years is to lose weight.
So knowing how you need to give things up

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.730
is very very helpful.
A woman posted to my blog saying "I always

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:23.589
tried to be a moderator because I thought
that's what you should try to do, but I realized

00:09:23.589 --> 00:09:28.490
I was and abstainer."
I decided to abstain from flour and sugar.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.579
I lost 47 pounds, and it wasn't even that
hard for me.

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:36.040
So again it's not a question of which one's
better or worse, but just knowing your own

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.040
nature,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.040
[Pause]

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:44.440
But cleaning clutter and resisting temptation
are very mundane things.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.830
Mundane things it turns out are very very
important for happiness, they make a big difference

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.230
in happiness.
But I also wanted to use my happiness project

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:57.240
as an opportunity to think about more transcendent
values that I felt like got pushed to the

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.949
side in the turmoil of everyday life.
Things that I didn't have time to think about.

00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:06.709
And in particular, I really wanted to enjoy
now.

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:12.949
I wanted to stay focused on the present, to
really stay in the ordinary day and especially

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:18.690
my life with my two young daughters.
I really wanted to appreciate their childhood.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.050
I worried that there would be -- it would
be very difficult to find a way to translate

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.959
that into something very concrete and measurable
which is what I tried to do with all my resolutions.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:34.490
But it turned out it wasn't that hard.
The technique I hit upon was something called

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.220
the one sentence journal.
A lot of people have the impulse to keep a

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.100
journal, and if you're like me, you do it
for a week or two, then you abandon it because

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.879
it's too much work.
And you feel like a failure.

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:50.370
The one sentence journal, I just write one
sentence a day, or maybe cheat and write two

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.339
or three sentences.
But it turns out that one sentence is enough,

00:10:55.339 --> 00:10:59.629
and I look back on my journal from a couple
of years ago, and it really brings back the

00:10:59.629 --> 00:11:04.550
past in a way that keeps it very vivid.
This turns out to be very important to happiness

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.639
because, from the research we know that one
of the best ways to make yourself happy in

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:12.100
the present is to reflect upon happy times
in the past.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.670
And so things that keep happy memories vivid,
like mementos or scrape books, or photo albums

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:22.899
or journals are really helpful because they
keep your mind -- they keep those memories

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:23.899
vivid.

00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:25.519
[Pause]

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:30.089
And again and again all these resolutions
came back to this idea of be Gretchen.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:35.670
And the idea to be yourself is one of the
most ancient precepts of happiness.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.870
And the words "know thyself" are inscribed
at the temple of Apollo at Delphi.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.700
And we all know the Shakespeare quotation
about "to thine own self be true".

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:50.279
But it was only really started to try to be
Gratchen that I realized how far I was from

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:53.529
understanding what that meant.
Because I thought what could be more obvious

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:56.829
to me then what I find fun?
What could be more obvious to me than what

00:11:56.829 --> 00:12:01.040
I find interesting?
But when I really examined it, I realized

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.379
how far I was from really understanding who
I was.

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:09.519
But again, I could only build a happy life
on the foundation on my own nature, so I had

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:12.779
to think about things like, what kind of environment
did I need?

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:16.709
Well I needed to have an orderly environment.
How was I going to resist temptation?

00:12:16.709 --> 00:12:21.170
Well I needed to be an abstainer.
Or how was I going to put these certain – these

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.649
values into action.
I was gonna keep a one sentence journal.

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:25.649
[Pause]

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:32.019
So the last point I want to make is, having
done a happiness project myself, I really

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:36.250
think everyone could benefit from having a
happiness project.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:42.440
Because to take the time and to make the effort
for it to reflect about your own nature, and

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:48.220
to think about what's important to you.
And how to put those values into the forefront

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.449
of your ordinary life is something that's
going to make you happier.

00:12:52.449 --> 00:12:56.720
It certainly made me happier.
And now I want to do the fun part which is

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.339
the Q&amp;A.
So I'm gonna open it up for questions, and

00:13:00.339 --> 00:13:03.970
I'd be happy to hear what you have to say
about happiness.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.910
So my first question I will ask myself which
Is a question that I get a lot is

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:11.230
What do I do for people who don't – who
say you can't be happy?

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.709
That happiness doesn't exist.
I get this a lot.

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:16.959
When I was writing about Winston Churchill,
nobody denied the existence of Winston Churchill,

00:13:16.959 --> 00:13:19.430
but many, many people deny the existence of
happiness.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:22.269
So if you find yourself in that skeptical
camp, I would say this.

00:13:22.269 --> 00:13:27.209
And I had this argument with Chris Anderson
who is the editor and chief of wired, and

00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:29.449
wrote the book free.
A very smart guy.

00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:33.040
And he said he didn't really think that happiness
was a possibility.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.129
And I said well, do you think you could be
happier.

00:13:38.129 --> 00:13:43.300
Happiness can seem like a distant destination,
or sort of a vague goal or someplace that

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.160
you arrive, it's not clear what it is.
So if you can't think – if you don't want

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.100
to accept happiness, just think about whether
you could be happier.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.689
And somehow that seems more manageable, and
something that you don't have to grapple with,

00:13:56.689 --> 00:13:59.839
this philosophical issue about happiness.
So just think about being happier.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:00.959
So maybe it's a happier project.

00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:01.959
[Pause]

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:02.959
Any other questions?

00:14:02.959 --> 00:14:03.959
[Pause]

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:04.959
Yes

00:14:04.959 --> 00:14:05.959
Gretchen:Did you ever get rid of all your
clutter?

00:14:05.959 --> 00:14:14.439
Oh, so the question was did I ever get rid
of all of my clutter.

00:14:14.439 --> 00:14:20.860
Gretchen: Oh

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:27.000
Gretchen: I never got – one of the – It
turns out that clearing clutters a great way

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.999
to self medicate.
Because if you really need like a, you need

00:14:29.999 --> 00:14:34.019
to give yourself a hit of happiness, you can
clean out a drawer, or clear out your closet.

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:37.079
And I have never managed to come to the end
of my clutter.

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:41.749
I always find some new area that I can do.
But I was visitng my sister this weekend.

00:14:41.749 --> 00:14:46.310
And she's really really messy.
And I, the first thing I said was We are gonna

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.670
clean out your closet.
And I just got a huge buzz from it.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.870
It's easy – it's more fun to clean out other
peoples closets clutter because you don't

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:56.970
have the emotional issues with it.
It's just the fun of getting rid of stuff.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.410
So no, but I – even as much as I love to
clear clutter, I still always do have clutter.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.410
Yes

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you for coming.
My question is, you say be true to yourself,

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.410
but what if your true self make other people
miserable, like…

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.410
[Laughter]

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:21.009
&gt;&gt; So do you have to take that into account?

00:15:21.009 --> 00:15:22.009
&gt;&gt;Like OK, I might be happy, but everyone
around me is miserable.

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:23.059
Gretchen: Like what kind of thing?
Like what would be an example?

00:15:23.059 --> 00:15:28.139
&gt;&gt; I just know people who seem to be in this
world, and they're doing great, but everybody

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:31.420
else has to deal with them. And so I just
wonder…

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.420
Gretchen: yeah

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:39.639
&gt;&gt; In your, in your study, and in your research,
if the people around you being happy has any

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:42.280
influence on your own happiness.
Gretchen: yeah.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.959
Yes.

00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:51.319
Oh, so the question is how do, how do you,
how do – what's the relationship between

00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:54.730
other peoples happiness and your own happiness,
and can you be happy yourself, even if it

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.670
sort of destroys that happiness of the people
around you.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:00.189
And this raises a bunch of really important
question about happiness.

00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:06.519
One of them is that – how important is self
sufficiency to happiness?

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:11.410
Because it's very clear that we, that other
people contribute to our happiness.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.759
And yet it's also true that we sort of have
to be emotionally self sufficient.

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:19.430
Bob Dylan said something about one of his
wives, I forget which one, that he, one of

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.999
his favorite things about her is that she
had her own built in happiness.

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:26.649
And that she didn't need him or anyone else
to make her happy.

00:16:26.649 --> 00:16:30.579
And I think that's definitely something to
strive for, like a person who's just happy

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:32.380
themselves.
That being said, there's something called

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.480
emotional contagion, which is that people
infect each other with emotions.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.089
And unfortunately negative emotions are more
contagious than the positive emotions.

00:16:40.089 --> 00:16:43.259
So people definitely catch emotions from each
other.

00:16:43.259 --> 00:16:46.240
Which is one of the reasons that people prefer
to be around happy people.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.259
Sometime people think that people find happy
people annoying, and irksome.

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:56.319
But in fact people are attracted to happy
people because they catch that mood from them.

00:16:56.319 --> 00:16:59.499
If a person is happy, and the other people
around them are unhappy, that's probably a

00:16:59.499 --> 00:17:02.640
very bad sign about how they're living their
life.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.130
Because usually happy people, happy people
make people happy.

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:12.170
I did a funny quiz on my blog which was, it
was around Thanksgiving, and it was called

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:17.310
“Are you the difficult one?”
And it was a quiz for people to know are you

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:21.830
the one that everybody else finds difficult.
Because I suspected that a lot of difficult

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.220
people don't know that they're the difficult
one.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:29.550
They don't realize that they're the one that
everybody else is incredibly annoyed by.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:33.710
And the thing that was really sad is there
were like ten questions, and three or four

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:40.630
people posted like “Oh No, I answered yes
to almost all your questions.”

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:45.742
So they were realizing that they were the
difficult ones.

00:17:45.742 --> 00:17:50.030
So the relationship between other people's
happiness and your own happiness is really

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.850
really important.
And I think you have to think about both.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:53.850
[Pause]

00:17:53.850 --> 00:18:00.740
&gt;&gt; Through your study, can you share a couple
of like tips and tricks that are fundamental

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:08.560
to either your happiness, or to like everyone's
happiness?

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:13.390
Gretchen: Right, so what are some fundamental
tips and tricks that, for everyone's happiness?

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:18.380
Well one of the things is you can, should
always start with your body.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.190
Happiness can feel very transcendent and vague
and abstract, but like say to yourself,

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.000
Am I getting enough sleep?
Am I getting enough exercise?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.280
Am I managing pain?
Things like that.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.130
Because if you're not – If you don't have
those things, it's much much harder to feel

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.820
happy.
So that's a good place to start for everyone.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:41.310
Another thing is, scientists and philosophers
and religious leaders, everybody agree that

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.420
strong relationships with other people are
a key to happiness.

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:49.420
So whenever you're thinking about your time,
your money, your energy, a good question to

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.670
say is
Is this gonna strengthen my relationship with

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.010
other people?
So if you're thinking about whether to spend

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:59.610
money on going to your college reunion, or
buying a dining room table, you should say,

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.790
What thing is gonna strengthen my relationships
with other people?

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:06.260
Because that, those are the things that make
you, that tend to make you happier.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:12.370
Also studies show that people tend to be more
happier with experiences rather than stuff.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:16.520
And so, what happens with stuff is that you
get, you get accustomed to it.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:22.630
You adapt to it, and so at first you really
enjoy that new car, or that new, you know,

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.041
television set.
But pretty soon you're used to it and you're

00:19:25.041 --> 00:19:29.090
right back to where you started from.
With an experience, it's sort of something

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.240
that you can gain from forever.
Though, having said this, I do think that

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.450
sometimes when people discuss this, they overlook
the fact that if you make – if you spend

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.540
your money on stuff in the right way, it can
make you very happy.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:46.580
For example, if you're a big cook and you
buy an expensive wonderful set of kitchen

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:51.030
knives, that could bring you pleasure every
night for years.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:55.660
That would be a very good thing.
I have an insanely expensive blender, and

00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:01.170
I was – to the thing like I can't believe
that you could charge this much for a blender.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:04.640
And I love that blender so much.
Every time I use it, I'm like “I love my

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.640
blender.”
[Laughter]

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.060
Because I make smoothies every night, and
having a really really good blender really

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.860
gives me satisfaction.
But if you're just buying that blender because

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.260
you're like “Oh, I'll look cool if I have
this fancy blender.”

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.580
And then it's just sitting there and you never
use it, that's a really stupid way to use

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.000
your money.
Because it's not gonna give you any happiness.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.211
So, so I gu – so I guess the point there
is whenever you're making choices, think about

00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:30.191
 – again it's this idea of Be Gretchen.
What's really important to you?

00:20:30.191 --> 00:20:35.480
Because if you're just doing something because
it's what other people do, or you know it

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.330
seems like the right idea, you're not gonna
get that much satisfaction out of it.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:42.750
But when you really look at your own processes
and your own nature, then you can make decisions

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.750
that are gonna work for you.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:44.750
You were talking a little bit about how children
can bring a lot of joy, but painful joy.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:45.750
Gretchen: Yeah
[Laughter]

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.750
&gt;&gt; And so I wondered if you could talk a little
bit more about why happiness and joy inside

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:55.310
your heart are not exactly the same thing.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:21:07.140
Gretchen: This is one of the great questions
in happiness.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.170
And there's been a lot of talk about this
idea that children – if you look at peoples,

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:17.310
if you look at the research, it seems tha
children don't bring happiness.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:22.930
And, and yet when you say to people “What
make you happy?”, they, the, by far the

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:29.770
biggest answer is my children or my grandchildren.
And so, so what is it about happiness and

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.140
that way.
And I think the answer is that sometimes happiness

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.400
doesn't make you feel happy,
And things like puppies or new born babies,

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:42.880
it's very clear how they are interfering with
your sleep or your freedom, and they're expensive,

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.920
ad they're like you know, there's a million
chores to do.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.100
And spousal satisfac – like conflict between
spouses like skyrockets.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.820
And yet they bring you incredible happiness.
So sometimes the hap – things that bring

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:04.100
you happiness in ways that aren't always immediately
apparent in the short term, or even, there's

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.880
this feeling that you're living your life
the way you want to live it.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:13.450
And that brings us satisfaction that isn't
always captured I think by happiness studies.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:20.960
I mean my state, New York state scored 51,
because they counted DC as a state lowest

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.170
in happiness.
And I thought, that's just not right, like

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:27.950
how is that possible.
So I thought there's gotta be something New

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.470
York State that's not being captured by that
study.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:32.930
Because New York is fantastic.
[Laughter]

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.650
And so sometimes the studies I think don't
always capture the richness of the experience

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.980
because of the way that they do it.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:50.290
&gt;&gt; Hi, thanks for coming.
So you mentioned negative emotions and sort

00:22:50.290 --> 00:23:00.040
of how they are contagious emotions.
And so I wondered if you had any tips for

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.040
sort of self insulating.
So if there's like lots of people with negative

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040
emotions around you.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.370
Gretchen: this is a big, big question.
And it's what do you do with the people that

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.600
are really negative.
And unfortunately, the unfortunate thing about

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.580
being one of those people is that people start
wanting to pull away from you.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:16.940
And so, which then leaves them to be even
more defensive and irritable and things like

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.720
that.
A very interesting fact is that you would

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:24.080
think that lonely people would be less judgmental
and more open, and more accepting.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.990
But in fact, lonely people are more judgmental
and more defensive.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:35.610
And so again, it's like you're lonely and
so you're doing things that are going to antagonize

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.850
people.
Whereas people who are more happy and more

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:43.100
socially comfortable are more able to open
themselves up to friends.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:47.210
So this question of what do you do when you're
like trying to stay positive and stay cheery

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.300
and you're surrounded by people who are bringing
you down is a big one.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.480
And I wish I had a great answer, because I
don't.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:59.940
And on my blog I one time -- I wrote one time
about this – that there's specific prayer

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:06.480
where it's like Jesus – It's a famous prayer,
you know preserve your dying ones, heal your

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.050
sick ones and it goes on and on.
And the last line is shield your joyous ones.

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:16.550
And I thought, why pray for the joyous ones,
they're fine.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.110
[Laughter]
But then I realized you know there are these

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:25.640
joyous ones in life.
And, and everybody gets energy from that joy.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.090
And yet there's something in human nature
that people try to drag them down.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.480
And you'll see it happening, like people try
to tear them down.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.460
People try to dampen their spirits their enthusiasm.
People try to tell them that they're wrong

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:41.220
where they take a positive view.
And so I think if you're one of the – and

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.910
all these people posted like “I am a joyous
one, and I don't understand why people are

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.230
always attacking me.
And somebody said, “I had to break up with

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:53.240
my boyfriend because on the one hand he was,
he was, he was hanging on to me like a drowning

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:59.400
sailor, you know, clinging for life, and yet
he was also trying to always squash my, squash

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.800
my good cheer.
And until -- I guess I would say, if you have

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.540
one of those joyous ones, I have a joyous
one in my life, and now I go out of my way

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.850
to preserve that.
That atmosphere of that joyous one, and not

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.020
to attack it.
Cuz there is that impulse to do it.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:18.901
And another thing is I wish I knew a good
way to insulate yourself from that, from that,

00:25:18.901 --> 00:25:22.240
from that negative.
And again it's this idea of emotional self

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.020
sufficiency.
Like can you be happy enough in yourself that

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.860
you could just let it sort of wash away.
But it's very difficult.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.720
Which is why a lot of times those people just
become more isolated and then they feel even

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.270
less happy.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.540
[Pause]

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.540
One more?
And then

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:46.300
&gt;&gt; Well actually I have a couple quick questions

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.990
Gretchen: Oh

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:56.420
&gt;&gt; And you can pick which one you want to
do.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.100
Gretchen: OK

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:04.012
&gt;&gt; One was I was wondering about with the
happiness set point

00:26:04.012 --> 00:26:05.012
The other question was about our modern medicated
way [inaudible]

00:26:05.012 --> 00:26:06.012
has changed our way to develop natural happiness.

00:26:06.012 --> 00:26:07.012
Gretchen: The first question is about the
happiness set point.

00:26:07.012 --> 00:26:10.200
And this is the idea that people are basically
have a set point of happiness, and that things

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.700
make them go up or down but they basically
go back to the set point.

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.640
And it seems true that happiness is about
50% genetically determined.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:23.740
And some people are just naturally more Tiggerish,
and some people are naturally more Eyoreish.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.890
And that's hard wired.
Then about 10% to 20% is life circumstances

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:33.970
which is things like health. occupation, income,
marital status, gender, things like that.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:38.200
And then the rest is very much influenced
by the things that you do and the ways that

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.900
you think.
So I think that -- A more helpful way to think

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.270
about the set point is to think that we all
have a range.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.080
And some people are here, and some people
are here and there's not much you can do about

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.290
that.
But there's definitely things that you can

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:55.870
push yourself up to the top of your range
or push yourself down to the bottom of your

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.710
range.
And we were talking earlier about somebody

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:01.210
who has a job that they hate.
If you've ever known somebody who had a job

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:06.310
that they hated, and then had a job that they
loved, you realize it's not the case that

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:08.670
people are just always at the same happiness
level.

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:13.300
I mean, what you do with your life can have
a huge implact -- impact on how high you are

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.190
and how low you are.
So for my happiness project, I was more thinking

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.060
like well, I'm about a seven.
I would say that that's what most people are,

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.740
I'm about a se -- I am about a seven, but
I want to be at a high seven and not a low

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.350
seven, and I can definitely do that.
And then the other question was about medication,

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:32.750
and then I'll end here.
I am a huge believer in medication.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:35.630
I think if people are depressed, they need
serious help.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.470
And if medication can help them, that's really
really important.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:47.890
And I don't know enough about whether people
are overly medicated or how that, how that

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:52.620
 -- you know when people decide to make -- to
take medication.

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.900
But I guess

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.360
[Pause]

00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.670
Somebody once said -- you know, the thing
is -- As soon as countries become prosperous,

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.500
then they all get this anti-depressant medication.
And so were just spreading this idea throughout

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.120
the world.
But then somebody else said, well it just

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.620
shows that as soon as people can afford it,
they pay for it.

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:19.070
So, so I don't know, I think it's a very important
question that's very complicated.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.420
But anyway, thank you.
It was so much fun to be here, it made me

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:25.180
very "happy" to come to Google.
So thank you very much.

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:25.440
[Applause]
