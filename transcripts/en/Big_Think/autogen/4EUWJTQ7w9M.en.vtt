some edge and with Hank gone we lost an
 

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.360
some edge and with Hank gone we lost an
edge and so the thought about the

edge and so the thought about the
 

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.220
edge and so the thought about the

really is that the product could
 

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.449
really is that the product could
withstand it that the investors who

00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459
withstand it that the investors who
 

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:30.019
withstand it that the investors who
invested in these products were all

swap insurance on it I think there was

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:46.529
swap insurance on it I think there was
 

00:10:46.529 --> 00:10:50.210
swap insurance on it I think there was
just too much of an assumption that the

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.220
just too much of an assumption that the
 

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.860
just too much of an assumption that the

thought of credit default swap and

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240
thought of credit default swap and
 

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.660
thought of credit default swap and
securitization was the spreading of risk

00:10:59.660 --> 00:10:59.670
securitization was the spreading of risk
 

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.069
securitization was the spreading of risk
and I think what we've learned is yes

00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079
and I think what we've learned is yes
 

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:06.019
and I think what we've learned is yes
you can spread it but the other part of

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:06.029
you can spread it but the other part of
 

00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:08.329
you can spread it but the other part of
it was you couldn't get rid of it

00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:08.339
it was you couldn't get rid of it
 

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:10.819
it was you couldn't get rid of it
because of the lack of liquidity in the

00:11:10.819 --> 00:11:10.829
because of the lack of liquidity in the
 

00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:14.449
because of the lack of liquidity in the
market and I really see the major issue

00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459
market and I really see the major issue
 

00:11:14.459 --> 00:11:16.850
market and I really see the major issue
in the major signal for me was early on

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:16.860
in the major signal for me was early on
 

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.420
in the major signal for me was early on
when there was no 30 60 90 day money in

the market and people with positions

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.110
the market and people with positions
 

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.819
the market and people with positions
couldn't finance themselves and I think

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:25.829
couldn't finance themselves and I think
 

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:28.040
couldn't finance themselves and I think
the Fed was a little slow to pick that

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.050
the Fed was a little slow to pick that
 

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.670
the Fed was a little slow to pick that
up but I I think too much assuredness in

up but I I think too much assuredness in
 

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.030

the product will be interesting to see

the product will be interesting to see
when when the product does come back in

when when the product does come back in
 

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.810
when when the product does come back in
a major way will it just come back again

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:38.820
a major way will it just come back again
 

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.720
a major way will it just come back again
in the same way that there won't be any

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:41.730
in the same way that there won't be any
 

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.220
in the same way that there won't be any

in the banking organization so that they

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:48.510
in the banking organization so that they

some of them come back like there are
coming back but i but i think there was

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:55.649
coming back but i but i think there was
 

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:57.620
coming back but i but i think there was
just too much of an assumption that this

just too much of an assumption that this
 

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:02.139
just too much of an assumption that this
