year's prize is awarded for an invention
 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.970
year's prize is awarded for an invention
that was conferred the greatest benefit

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980
that was conferred the greatest benefit
 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.540
that was conferred the greatest benefit
to mankind it's something that Alfred

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
to mankind it's something that Alfred
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.189
to mankind it's something that Alfred
Nobel would be happy about as you

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199
Nobel would be happy about as you
 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.500
Nobel would be happy about as you
mentioned in the press conference can

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510
mentioned in the press conference can
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.859
mentioned in the press conference can
you explain it a bit more I I really

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
you explain it a bit more I I really
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.509
you explain it a bit more I I really
think that Alfred Nobel would be very

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
think that Alfred Nobel would be very
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.580
think that Alfred Nobel would be very
happy about this price at three and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590
happy about this price at three and
 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.490
happy about this price at three and
invention and it's really something that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500
invention and it's really something that
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.569
invention and it's really something that
will benefit most people artificial

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
will benefit most people artificial
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.850
will benefit most people artificial
lighting is everywhere around us and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
lighting is everywhere around us and
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.250
lighting is everywhere around us and
this is a way to make artificial

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
this is a way to make artificial
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.369
this is a way to make artificial
lighting much more efficient than other

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
lighting much more efficient than other
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.389
lighting much more efficient than other
older light sources it also gets rid of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399
older light sources it also gets rid of
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.069
older light sources it also gets rid of
some of the problems that we have with

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
some of the problems that we have with
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.170
some of the problems that we have with
with for instance fluorescent light

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
with for instance fluorescent light
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.500
with for instance fluorescent light
sources which use mercury and and these

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
sources which use mercury and and these
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.049
sources which use mercury and and these
ones don't have that and so we can get

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
ones don't have that and so we can get
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.529
ones don't have that and so we can get
rid of the mercury but there are also

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
rid of the mercury but there are also
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.009
rid of the mercury but there are also
other uses which are maybe not so big

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
other uses which are maybe not so big
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350
other uses which are maybe not so big
today but in the future maybe we will

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360
today but in the future maybe we will
 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.550
today but in the future maybe we will
see portable devices that can disinfect

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
see portable devices that can disinfect
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.780
see portable devices that can disinfect
water or two to sterilize water because

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
water or two to sterilize water because
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.390
water or two to sterilize water because
UV light can can can kill bacteria and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
UV light can can can kill bacteria and
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.649
UV light can can can kill bacteria and
almost everyone has seen an LED light as

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
almost everyone has seen an LED light as
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.969
almost everyone has seen an LED light as
we have it in our yeah but most people

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
we have it in our yeah but most people
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.520
we have it in our yeah but most people
have seen this kind of smartphone where

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
have seen this kind of smartphone where
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.940
have seen this kind of smartphone where
you have a flashlight which uses this

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950
you have a flashlight which uses this
 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.910
you have a flashlight which uses this
LED technology in fact also the screen

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
LED technology in fact also the screen
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.510
LED technology in fact also the screen
of the of the smartphone is using LED

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520
of the of the smartphone is using LED
 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.109
of the of the smartphone is using LED
technology and many TV sets etc are

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
technology and many TV sets etc are
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.600
technology and many TV sets etc are
using our computer screens are using

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
using our computer screens are using
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.000
using our computer screens are using
this technology

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010
this technology
 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.820
this technology
you have a bright light from the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830
you have a bright light from the
 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.430
you have a bright light from the
telephone as the one you showed now the

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440
telephone as the one you showed now the
 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.190
telephone as the one you showed now the
hard thing here is that the price is

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200
hard thing here is that the price is
 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.550
hard thing here is that the price is
awarded for invention of a blue light

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560
awarded for invention of a blue light
 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.190
awarded for invention of a blue light
wedding day out there so how does it go

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200
wedding day out there so how does it go
 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.640
wedding day out there so how does it go
together well it's it's so that to get

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650
together well it's it's so that to get
 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.580
together well it's it's so that to get
white light you really need to combine

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590
white light you really need to combine
 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.350
white light you really need to combine
at least three different colors so

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
at least three different colors so
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.410
at least three different colors so
typically you do mix red and green and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420
typically you do mix red and green and
 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.380
typically you do mix red and green and
blue and this is well known this is

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390
blue and this is well known this is
 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.950
blue and this is well known this is
actually known since Isaac Newton in

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960
actually known since Isaac Newton in
 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.960
actually known since Isaac Newton in
1671 but it was so the red and the green

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
1671 but it was so the red and the green
 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.670
1671 but it was so the red and the green
LEDs have been around for a long time

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680
LEDs have been around for a long time
 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.250
LEDs have been around for a long time
but the blue one has really been missing

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260
but the blue one has really been missing
 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.670
but the blue one has really been missing
and so now these laureates have have

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680
and so now these laureates have have
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.770
and so now these laureates have have
made the inventions that made it

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780
made the inventions that made it
 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.550
made the inventions that made it
possible to make efficient blue LEDs and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560
possible to make efficient blue LEDs and
 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.949
possible to make efficient blue LEDs and
so now we have that and we can mix it

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959
so now we have that and we can mix it
 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.660
so now we have that and we can mix it
with the red and the green and that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670
with the red and the green and that
 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.260
with the red and the green and that
provides white light sources so what did

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270
provides white light sources so what did
 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.810
provides white light sources so what did
they do that the others failed to make

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820
they do that the others failed to make
 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.940
they do that the others failed to make
yeah so this is very interesting because

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950
yeah so this is very interesting because
 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.160
yeah so this is very interesting because
there's also what's fascinating is that

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170
there's also what's fascinating is that
 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.460
there's also what's fascinating is that
that a lot of big companies really try

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470
that a lot of big companies really try
 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.640
that a lot of big companies really try
to do this and they failed but these

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650
to do this and they failed but these
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.250
to do this and they failed but these
guys persisted and they tried and try it

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260
guys persisted and they tried and try it
 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.440
guys persisted and they tried and try it
again and eventually they actually

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450
again and eventually they actually
 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.930
again and eventually they actually
succeeded and you can say there's two

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940
succeeded and you can say there's two
 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.690
succeeded and you can say there's two
two major things they did one was just

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700
two major things they did one was just
 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.560
two major things they did one was just
to grow a sufficiently good material

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570
to grow a sufficiently good material
 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.509
to grow a sufficiently good material
this is this is called gallium nitride

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519
this is this is called gallium nitride
 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.570
this is this is called gallium nitride
and that was very hard to grow and to

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580
and that was very hard to grow and to
 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.210
and that was very hard to grow and to
get a good material and they managed to

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220
get a good material and they managed to
 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.880
get a good material and they managed to
do that and the second part was to dope

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890
do that and the second part was to dope
 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.259
do that and the second part was to dope
it in the right way in semiconductors

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269
it in the right way in semiconductors
 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.009
it in the right way in semiconductors
like this you you dope both electrons

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019
like this you you dope both electrons
 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.280
like this you you dope both electrons
and holes and it was the whole doping

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290
and holes and it was the whole doping
 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.710
and holes and it was the whole doping
which was very difficult but they

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720
which was very difficult but they
 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.070
which was very difficult but they
succeeded in doing that too so and and

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080
succeeded in doing that too so and and
 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.440
succeeded in doing that too so and and
it was really an effort that we're all

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450
it was really an effort that we're all
 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.690
it was really an effort that we're all
the three-peat

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700
the three-peat
 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.250
the three-peat
people were contributed to this okazaki

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260
people were contributed to this okazaki
 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.059
people were contributed to this okazaki
and imani worked together in one lab and

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069
and imani worked together in one lab and
 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.460
and imani worked together in one lab and
nakamura worked in another life and they

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470
nakamura worked in another life and they
 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.890
nakamura worked in another life and they
made it in parallel yes they very much

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900
made it in parallel yes they very much
 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.960
made it in parallel yes they very much
made it in parallel and they made

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970
made it in parallel and they made
 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.150
made it in parallel and they made
different versions of it and they sort

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160
different versions of it and they sort
 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.020
different versions of it and they sort
of improved each other's results this

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030
of improved each other's results this
 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.979
of improved each other's results this
seems like a giant step in making light

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989
seems like a giant step in making light
 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.100
seems like a giant step in making light
actually because until now it was mainly

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110
actually because until now it was mainly
 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.090
actually because until now it was mainly
fire that was producing hi so what's

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100
fire that was producing hi so what's
 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.580
fire that was producing hi so what's
interesting is that this kind of this

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590
interesting is that this kind of this
 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.370
interesting is that this kind of this
way of making light is actually getting

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380
way of making light is actually getting
 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.710
way of making light is actually getting
quite close to the theoretically

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720
quite close to the theoretically
 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.620
quite close to the theoretically
possible way so that every time you put

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630
possible way so that every time you put
 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.190
possible way so that every time you put
in one electron you get one particle of

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200
in one electron you get one particle of
 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.820
in one electron you get one particle of
light a photon out and and that's the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830
light a photon out and and that's the
 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.129
light a photon out and and that's the
maximum you can get and and these these

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139
maximum you can get and and these these
 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.400
maximum you can get and and these these
LED sources are actually going towards

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410
LED sources are actually going towards
 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.030
LED sources are actually going towards
that goal so it will be hard to find

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040
that goal so it will be hard to find
 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.570
that goal so it will be hard to find
something that will be better so we will

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580
something that will be better so we will
 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.070
something that will be better so we will
be left with this now for ever I think

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080
be left with this now for ever I think
 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.960
be left with this now for ever I think
so they will of course improved over the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970
so they will of course improved over the
 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.170
so they will of course improved over the
years and and become a little bit better

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180
years and and become a little bit better
 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.690
years and and become a little bit better
but it will you will not get anything

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700
but it will you will not get anything
 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.460
but it will you will not get anything
that will be you know ten times better

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470
that will be you know ten times better
 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.610
that will be you know ten times better
there's not room for that so we are all

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620
there's not room for that so we are all
 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.969
