uh there are there are many mistakes and
 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.799
uh there are there are many mistakes and
and I think every entrepreneur would say

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809
and I think every entrepreneur would say
 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.499
and I think every entrepreneur would say
that they've had a lot of mistakes to

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:17.509
that they've had a lot of mistakes to
 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.290
that they've had a lot of mistakes to
manage through and hopefully you dodge

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300
manage through and hopefully you dodge
 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.990
manage through and hopefully you dodge
the big mistakes and the big ones don't

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000
the big mistakes and the big ones don't
 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.670
the big mistakes and the big ones don't
sink the ship and hopefully it's just a

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680
sink the ship and hopefully it's just a
 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.650
sink the ship and hopefully it's just a
bunch of small ones that you're able to

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660
bunch of small ones that you're able to
 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.870
bunch of small ones that you're able to
learn from and there's no doubt in my

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880
learn from and there's no doubt in my
 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.370
learn from and there's no doubt in my
mind that you learn more from your

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380
mind that you learn more from your
 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.500
mind that you learn more from your
mistakes than from all the things that

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510
mistakes than from all the things that
 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.680
mistakes than from all the things that
you do write in terms of mistakes and in

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690
you do write in terms of mistakes and in
 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.070
you do write in terms of mistakes and in
our case i would say i think i alluded

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080
our case i would say i think i alluded
 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.520
our case i would say i think i alluded
to this earlier i think raising a larger

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530
to this earlier i think raising a larger
 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.380
to this earlier i think raising a larger
round would have made sense at the time

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390
round would have made sense at the time

we did a round of financing in 2007 sec

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400
we did a round of financing in 2007 sec
 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.009

series b and and we did have the

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019
series b and and we did have the
 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.110
series b and and we did have the
opportunity to bump that round up and I

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120
opportunity to bump that round up and I
 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.520
opportunity to bump that round up and I
and I wish we had done it for a couple

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530
and I wish we had done it for a couple
 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.369
and I wish we had done it for a couple
million dollars more so but you know I

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379
million dollars more so but you know I
 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.530
million dollars more so but you know I
don't think anyone was anticipating some

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540
don't think anyone was anticipating some
 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.210
don't think anyone was anticipating some
of the other hurdles we would face

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220
of the other hurdles we would face
 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.570
of the other hurdles we would face
coming up but at but so that I think is

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580
coming up but at but so that I think is
 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.140
coming up but at but so that I think is
one one one mistake that I would have

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150
one one one mistake that I would have
 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.160
one one one mistake that I would have
would have done things a little bit

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170
would have done things a little bit
 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.550
would have done things a little bit
differently another is certainly in the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560
differently another is certainly in the

case of our magazine we we are an online

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990
case of our magazine we we are an online
 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.450
case of our magazine we we are an online
business ninety percent of our

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460
business ninety percent of our
 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.370
business ninety percent of our
businesses online we did something very

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380
businesses online we did something very
 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380
businesses online we did something very
unusual in launching a print product

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390
unusual in launching a print product
 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.690
unusual in launching a print product
both because we believe it will be

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700
both because we believe it will be
 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.740
both because we believe it will be
profitable it has a great opportunity to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750
profitable it has a great opportunity to
 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.840
profitable it has a great opportunity to
be a solid profitable business but it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850
be a solid profitable business but it
 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.420
be a solid profitable business but it
also reinforces our overall brand and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430
also reinforces our overall brand and
 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.210
also reinforces our overall brand and
the positioning of our brand however if

I were to do things differently I would

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600
I were to do things differently I would
 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.990
I were to do things differently I would
not have launched in the middle of 2006

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000
not have launched in the middle of 2006
 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.240
not have launched in the middle of 2006
I would have had us do a prototype for

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250
I would have had us do a prototype for
 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.100
I would have had us do a prototype for
it rather than actual printing of the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110
it rather than actual printing of the
 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.290
it rather than actual printing of the
magazine we ended up burning through

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300
magazine we ended up burning through
 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.840
magazine we ended up burning through
some cash with actual manufacturing and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850
some cash with actual manufacturing and
 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.970
some cash with actual manufacturing and
production of that magazine and I think

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:48.980
production of that magazine and I think
 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.410
production of that magazine and I think
we should have done a prototype first

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420
we should have done a prototype first
 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.170
we should have done a prototype first
and then launched a little bit later

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180
and then launched a little bit later
 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.700
and then launched a little bit later
which brings me to a general lesson

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710
which brings me to a general lesson
 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.219
which brings me to a general lesson
which is think very hard about where

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229
which is think very hard about where
 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.080
which is think very hard about where
you're investing your money and if you

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090
you're investing your money and if you
 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.120
you're investing your money and if you
can figure out ways to take smaller

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130
can figure out ways to take smaller
 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.610
can figure out ways to take smaller
