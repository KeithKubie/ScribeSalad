Well, that was an example of a gang of four structural pattern, in fact the,

00:00:06.305 --> 00:00:10.710
the book has three categories of patterns. In structural patterns, the main

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.870
value added is the description of the various classes and how they're connected

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.880
to each other. The book also has a category called creational patterns,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.890
that describe ways in which objects can be constructed. The largest and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.180
most interesting part of the book has to do with behavioral patterns,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.820
which describes interesting interactions, interesting ways in which classes

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.840
interact to accomplish some particular goal. We will now take a minute to

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.100
look at each of these three categories beginning with the creational category.
