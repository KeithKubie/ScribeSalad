[Captioned via Y Translator]
In this video, we're going
to be taking a look at all

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.400
of the different suggested methods
for making ice that is completely clear.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.180
There are several of them,
and some will work, and some won't.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.320
We'll find out which.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.560
[Music]

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.740
Ice is really cool,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.800
and of course, I mean
that in multiple ways.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.200
But what's even better is if you can
have ice that's completely clear.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.400
You can see right through it.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.700
But that's kind of
a hard effect to achieve.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.700
Today, we're going to put
to the test several suggested methods

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.940
for how to get clear ice.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.300
The basic idea is we'll have
a separate container for each

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.400
of our different methods
for making clear ice,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.200
we'll let them all freeze,
and we'll see which one's work the best.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.192
Here's what we're going
to try, boiling water,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.100
letting it cool down,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.800
and then boiling it again is
one that I've seen all over the place

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400
as a sure fire method
for making clear ice.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.920
Then there's the idea
that you can use distilled water,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.400
and it's complete lack of impurities
will let the water crystallize

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.300
into a nice clear formation.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.800
We're also going to try putting
some water in our vacuum chamber,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.600
and letting that run
for a while to sort

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.300
of suck out any extra dissolved gases.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.540
Hopefully, those won't
get trapped in the ice,

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.440
and that will let us get a clear result.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.200
Then finally, we have a small cooler,
and we're just going to fill this most

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.100
of the way with water,
and put this freezer as well,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.400
and see what happens
if we force all of the water

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.820
to freeze from one direction,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.000
in this case, it will freeze
from the top down.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.880
As a first step, let's fill
our small pot with water.

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:25.860
We'll boil it,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.860
let it cool down back to room temperature,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.920
and then boil it a second time
before pouring it into this container,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.840
where will freeze it.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.360
[Music]

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.080
This one's just
distilled water.

00:01:40.582 --> 00:01:43.722
Distilled water is water that's been
run through a distilling process.

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:47.320
It's boiled off and the steam is
condensed back down into water,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.000
and in theory, what you're left with
is water that's completely sterile,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.100
and has nothing else in it.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.900
So this should just be hydrogen
and oxygen atoms

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.780
bonded together in water form.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.780
Nothing else.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:16.620
[Music]

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.140
Okay.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.000
Now, we've got some normal
tap water in one of our containers,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.972
and we're going to vacuum it.

00:02:23.712 --> 00:02:25.600
Not with a vacuum cleaner,
vacuum chamber.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.000
We hit a low pressure.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.900
That's about 25
inches of mercury.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.700
It starts boiling and bubbling,
and the idea is that by putting it

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.400
in a vacuum chamber,
all of the extra dissolved gases

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.760
get pulled right out.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.700
I'm not entirely sure how
that's supposed to work,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.842
because we are obviously just creating gas
by causing it to boil at a low pressure.

00:02:49.572 --> 00:02:51.700
There could be a level
where it pulls out gases

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.180
before adding more in.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.400
Okay, I think our water
is good and vacuumed.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:08.680
[Music]

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.740
Now, let's take our cooler,
and fill it most of the way.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.620
We'll put that in the freezer,
and we'll let it freeze.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.900
[Music]

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.300
Just to make sure we've really
exhausted all possibilities,

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.200
I took some distilled water,
I boiled it twice,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.800
and then I ran it
in the vacuum chamber

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.100
for a while so we can get a test
of all three of these methods at once.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.700
Before we check on that ice,
we want to talk a little bit

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.940
about Audible, the sponsor
for today's video.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.900
Audible has the largest selection
of audio books, and they're always

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.000
adding new content
so they keep things fresh.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.400
Something new that
they've just released

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.620
is called Audible Originals.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.300
Audible Originals are
exclusive audio titles

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.000

from things like theater, literature,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.640
journalism, and more.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.400
Since these Audible Original pieces
are made for and exclusive to audible,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.700
you can't get them anywhere else.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.700
Audible is offering new listeners
a free 30-day trial that comes

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.000
with one credit good
for an audiobook, and two

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.600
credits good for Audible Originals.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.300

of your media is yours to keep,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.780
even if you cancel your membership.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.300
You can go back at any time
and listen to pieces even

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.700
if you aren't currently a subscriber.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.260
Recently, I've been listening
to the audiobook called

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.460
Legion: The Many Lives of Stephen Leeds
by Brandon Sanderson.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.500
It's great because I love reading,
but I don't often like to sit still

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.660
long enough to read a hardcopy.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.300

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.200
It's written right here.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.892
There you go.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.900
Good luck lining
that up editors.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.300
All right.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.312
Let's crack open the freezer,
and see how our ice is doing.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.700
[Music]

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.620
Oh my gosh.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.480
Oh, I just have it locked.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.000
Here we go.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.400
We've got our distilled water,
we've got our vacuumed water,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.052
and we have our boiled water.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.820
I wonder if we can pop these--
Oh, yeah, that was easy.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.680
[Music]

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.800
That was slightly
less easy, but...

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.400
Now, first Impressions.

00:05:31.952 --> 00:05:35.400
They definitely all
have bubbles in them.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.700
I have seen quite a
few comments talking

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.100
about how to get clear ice.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.500
If you boil it,
that's going to work.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.000
You're going to have
perfectly clear ice.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.100
Well, not really.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.140
Here is our twice boiled water,
and that, that has formed ice

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.040
with bubbles in the middle.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.000
I'll give it something.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.800
It is not cracked the way
that our other two are,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.300
that might be a function of the boiling,
that might be a function of it

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.100
had slightly more or less water in it,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.642
or its container was just a slightly
different flexibility level.

00:06:09.422 --> 00:06:10.122
There it goes.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.840
So with two of these,
as I place them under the water,

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.600
just to try and get more
of a clear surface,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.600
we got some pretty gnarly cracks that form.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.200
I mean, they're already had cracks,
but some new ones just popped

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.832
into existence.

00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:25.292
Our distilled, our vacuumed,
and then are boiled in sort

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.542
of the order of most air bubbles
and ice damage to least air bubbles

00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:31.340
and the ice damage.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.400
However, I don't think
that it's necessarily

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.000
perfectly a function of being boiled.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.580
I think there are other
factors at play here.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.600
For example, I have here
a container in which I froze

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.540
distilled water that I boiled twice,
and then I put in the vacuum chamber,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.800
so it's all three of these combined,
and honestly, it doesn't look any better

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.260
than the distilled water,

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.700
and maybe somehow distilled water
is just inherently worse

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.700
in terms of air bubbles.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.620
I'm not sure.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.200
Let's run this under some water,
hope the glass doesn't shatter,

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.200
and see if we can pop it out.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.300
This is a glass container rather
than the plastic container.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.302
In that very well could contribute
to the shape change,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.960
and all of the cracking in there as well.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.000
It's spinning in there,
but air can't get in

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.992
there to let it drop out.

00:07:18.512 --> 00:07:19.082
There we go.

00:07:20.122 --> 00:07:24.362
Our distilled, vacuumed,
boiled puck is...

00:07:24.692 --> 00:07:26.500
Boy, that-- That might be
the worst one of all,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.700
and that I believe is mostly
because it was in a glass container,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.400
which had no flexibility.

00:07:32.412 --> 00:07:35.000
So when that ice tried to start
expanding, it had nowhere to go

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.900
but to push itself up more.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.000
Of course, if we had tried
to seal it in that glass container,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.700
it probably would have just
shattered the container.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.600
Ice does not like
to be contained.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.482
Let's take a look at our last type of ice,
and that's the ice that we put into a cooler.

00:07:48.422 --> 00:07:51.100
First Impressions is I can see
some air bubbles down in there,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.820
but when I take a closer look,
it becomes obvious

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.500
that we actually have multiple inches
of perfectly clear ice

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.400
before we get to those bubbles.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.700
So you can see
that those bubbles start

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.900
several inches down into the ice.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.600
They're not immediately
up at the top here,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.000
and what happened is our cooler made it
so that all of the cold could really only

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.300
go in through the top,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.300
or rather the heat could
only escape out the top,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.400
which means that the top
of the ice froze first,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.080
and it froze down, down into the cooler,

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.760
and after, there were a
couple inches of frozen ice,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.100
or maybe it's less than that.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.172
I can't tell because it's going
to distort the light a little.

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:33.800
But it got a good ways down,
and then it froze under that,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.200
and that part
has some bubbles trapped in it.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.700
Those bubbles had know
where they could go.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.500
They couldn't escape
out of our container.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.700
Let's see if we can get
this whole ice block

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.500
out of our cooler.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.212
This could be tricky.

00:08:46.432 --> 00:08:47.222
That sounded good.

00:08:48.372 --> 00:08:48.900
There we go.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.722
There's our block.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.700
Oh boy.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.420
That's--

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.600
That's fantastic.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:05.300
[Music]

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.300
So now we can see
how much clear ice

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.200
we're getting out of this.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.000
I'd say we have an inch
and a half of ice

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.100
with no bubbles in it,

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.400
and then we have very
very minimal bubbles

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.800
for another 3/4 of an inch,
and then after that

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.452
is where the real bubbles really start.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.920
Let's see if we can't cut our clear ice
off of our white ice.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:47.680
[Music]

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.900
Having melted and chipped away most
of the white portion of the ice,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.500
you can see how clear we are this point.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.200
Let's just set it down here,
and look through it like that.

00:10:00.362 --> 00:10:03.500
Obviously, there are still
some little bubbles in here,

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.240
and if you wanted to make sure
you didn't have any of those,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.600
there's a few things I'd recommend.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.100
First is actually taking
the ice out sooner.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.500
Don't let it freeze all the way through,
but just have it freeze for the top inch

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.200
and a half or so,

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.400
and then take the cooler out,
take your ice block out

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.640
and use it however you like.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.960
The way that I've done it
is just to demonstrate why

00:10:22.962 --> 00:10:24.200
we get bubbles in the ice.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.900
We get bubbles in the ice
because there is gas

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.982
trapped in the water,
and we can't get that out

00:10:28.982 --> 00:10:32.020
by boiling it or by vacuum chambering it,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.500
but it's going to have gas
and contaminants in the water even

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.100
if we use distilled water,
vacuum it, boil it, all of that.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.200
But if we freeze it from only
one direction, then they all

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.500
sort of get pushed out of the way,

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.500
and we get some nice,
beautifully clear ice

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.900
before we get to the portions
that are going to cause problems.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.260
Before we get to the bubbles and stuff,

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.120
and then those will get
pushed to the bottom.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.400
So this is the only way that
I have found to freeze

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.500
clear ice at home.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.400
