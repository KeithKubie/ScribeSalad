00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.910
ALEX MONTOYA: Today I'm
going to speak on my journey,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.050
and my journey that has taken
me from Medellin, Colombia

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.830
to San Diego, and a lot
of points in between.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.020
And a journey that has included
overcoming adversity, but also

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.000
seeing how both technology and
inspiration within technology

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.210
has really led me to do
something what I call living

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.080
inspired.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.600
And my goal is not for
anyone to quit their job

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.610
at the end of day,
but to actually

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.850
be more inspired within
their role to really make

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.620
their job even more phenomenal.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.430
So you'll see what
I mean by that.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.132
But before I begin, I'm
going to ask each of you

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:45.840
to do me a favor.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.270
I know people are eating and
you've got a plate of food

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.050
on your lap.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.270
If you can, set the
food aside for a second.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.250
I'm going to ask
everybody to stand up.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.820
Arise.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.440
Rise to your feet.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.180
OK.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.120
Everybody raise up.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.520
Now if you can, can you
please raise your left arm?

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.186
Your left arm.

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:04.769
A couple of you had
to think about it.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.489
I like that.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.220
OK.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.720
Keep it up.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.220
Keep it up.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.670
If you can, could you also
please raise your right arm?

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.449
Your right arm.

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:12.990
There you go.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.160
Let's wave your hands.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.582
Hey, oh, hey, ho.

00:01:17.582 --> 00:01:18.540
Make sure you're awake.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.890
Make sure the blood is flowing.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.190
OK.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.690
Keep 'em up.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.720
Keep 'em up.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.875
Now if you can--

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:24.750
I know we kind of have
some tight space here.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.020
If you can, you also please
raise your right leg?

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.799
Your right leg.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:32.340
There you go.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.048
It's kind of like,
"The Karate Kid" pose.

00:01:34.048 --> 00:01:34.650
Right?

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.070
There you go.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.570
Awesome.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.701
Go ahead, put it down.

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:37.200
There we go.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.900
That's what we call
a little Google yoga.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.233
You can put the hands down, too.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:40.970
You're good.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:41.649
You're good.

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.440
I just wanted somebody
everybody was awake,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.074
was alive, was ready to go.

00:01:45.074 --> 00:01:46.740
I'm going to ask you
one more favor, now

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.290
that I know that everybody
is fully present.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.588
If you would, please
follow my lead.

00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:55.576
[CLAPPING]

00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:01.552
Ooh!

00:02:01.552 --> 00:02:02.730
There we go.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.060
Go ahead, have a seat.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.430
The reason I do that--

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.930
the power clap, or as civil
rights icon Cesar Chavez used

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.620
to use with the farm workers--
he called it the si, se puede--

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.405
yes, you can clap--

00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:18.800
is for this reason.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.390
If I had asked just
one row of you,

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.420
or if I had asked just
one section of you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.690
to clap your hands,
to make some noise--

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.360
it would have made
pretty minimal impact.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.710
Right?

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.240
But by asking all of you
to clap at the same time,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.520
it made more impact.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.710
It made more noise.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.040
We do so much more
when we work together.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.620
We have so much
more of an impact

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.160
when we're all working together,
pulling on the same rope,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.170
doing the same clap
at the same time.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.470
We have more of a
thunderous, impactful impact.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.330
So bear that in mind.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.560
In 2015, I had a very nice
job with the San Diego Padres.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.180
Sports is my passion.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.390
Love the Padres as a team, love
the Padres as an organization.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.930
And I decided at that
point to leave my job

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.030
within the Community
Relations Department,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.560
because I wanted to do more.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.374
I wanted to try
something different.

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:21.790
I wanted to see
really what it was

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.210
like to kind of take
a risk, take a plunge,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.460
be out there on my own.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.810
And really get the aspect
of taking a risk really

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.510
for the first time in my life--

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.250
of figuring out if
I have ambition,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.180
and if I have a
passion, but I also

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.300
have teamwork surrounding
me in my life.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.740
How much more could I,
as an individual, do?

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.640
I wanted to see that.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.330
I wanted to really give
that the first test.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.390
Now on the theme
of teamwork, let

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.310
me give you a quick example.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.112
Once I left the Padres--

00:03:59.112 --> 00:04:00.570
and a lot of people
were surprised.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.340
A lot of people said, you
know, you spent 10 years there.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.900
It's a fantastic job,
wonderful organization.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.880
Is this something you're
sure you want to do?

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.010
And I said, you know,
it might sound crazy.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.954
It might sound a
little unorthodox.

00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:18.370
But there are times
where you have

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.649
to leave your comfort zone
because, that's really

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.330
where the greatest growth is--

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.920
when you leave
your comfort zone.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.830
I'm sure that this is something
not only that I want to do,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.610
but something that I need to do.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.260
One of my first
speaking engagements

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.040
when I decided to become
a full-time writer

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.362
and become a full-time
speaker was in Chicago.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.070
I have a friend here
the audience today--

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.904
Cort Peters.

00:04:41.904 --> 00:04:42.820
Cort, raise your hand.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.560
Wave to the crowd.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.590
Cort and another good
friend of mine named Sean--

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.660
the three of us were in Chicago.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.599
And I know that
Googlers travel a lot,

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.890
so you guys are familiar with
a lot of different cities

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.550
and a lot of different
airports, and how crazy

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.230
it can be at the airports.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.180
Well, so we're in Chicago.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.570
It's actually President's
Day weekend of 2017.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.390
And my speaking
engagement was on Friday.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.600
So that gave us the whole
weekend to enjoy the city,

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.810
and then on Monday, to fly home.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.240
Now for those of you that
have been in Chicago,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.500
been through Chicago--

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.530
you know that the
Chicago Airport--

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.070
either one, either Midway or
O'Hare-- that day I was through

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.940
Midway--

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.740
is not an easy deal.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.620
Especially on a holiday
weekend, especially

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.760
on a Monday of a
holiday weekend.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.510
And so I have a personal
habit, a personal routine.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.370
I like to try to
be anywhere that I

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.790
need to be at least an
hour early, but especially

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.090
the airport, and especially
when you wear prosthetics

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.060
and it takes extra
longer to go through TSA

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.250
because they need to check
all of your prosthetics.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.840
They need to look
through everything.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.060
They just have you go
in a separate line.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.060
Let me just tell you,
it's just quite a mess.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.200
And so I always make sure that
I'm there an hour minimum,

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.070
early.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.100
Well, on that
particular day as me

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.080
and my buddies arrived
to the airport--

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.010
now their flight was actually
two hours later than mine.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.520
My flight was going to be two
hours departing before them.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.050
And so they said,
OK, let's just all

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.624
go to the airport
at the same time.

00:06:15.624 --> 00:06:18.040
Let's make sure that we get
there, we get you through TSA,

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.070
we get you through
your usual boondoggle

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.150
of going through TSA.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.550
But we'll get you there.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.080
Turns out with the usual
Chicago Airport craziness,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.600
with a traffic jam with
the holiday weekend,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.670
and a TSA agent that
wanted to move extra slow--

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.020
and actually lectured
me for not arriving

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.289
to the airport on time--

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:40.830
in which case I was
telling him dude,

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.660
you're not making
me move any faster.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.080
Like, this is crazy.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.000
We realized that I only
had about a half hour

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.820
to get through TSA, and
to get through everything

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.630
with the luggage.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.580
And by the time we did that,
I had exactly 10 minutes

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.020
to catch my flight--

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.380
10 minutes.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.570
And mind you, if
you try to go from,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.820
you know, the area where
you have your luggage

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.790
and you're trying to
get to your gate I mean,

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.150
that's at least a good 10
minute walk for anyone.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.250
For me, probably
a little slower.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.630
So my best friend Cort
says, I've got an idea.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.340
There was a wheelchair nearby.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.905
It was empty.

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:19.530
It was vacated.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.940
Nobody was using it.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.210
Cort's like, I'm going to
wheel you down to your gate.

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.430
Take all of our bags,
hold them in your lap.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.690
This is teamwork here.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.170
Sean, I want you to
run up to the gate.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.060
It's almost like we
playing football out

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.500
on the asphalt. Sean, go deep.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.290
He was like, Sean,
run to the gate.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:41.350
Let them know that
we are on the way.

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.320
We don't want Alex
to miss his flight.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.590
So I get in the wheelchair.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.150
I could feel Cort, with his
bare white knuckles clenching

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.400
against the chair.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.640
And we start racing
down the concourse.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.390
And we're running.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:56.200
He's running.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.820
He's huffing, he's puffing.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.990
I'm like, fearing for my
life inside the wheelchair.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:02.140
I can-- what's that?

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.330
CORT PETERS: I said
you weren't running.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.663
ALEX MONTOYA: I wasn't running,
but my heart was racing.

00:08:05.663 --> 00:08:08.650
And I could see Sean running
side, right alongside of us.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.970
He's getting up to the gate.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.680
There's a point to
the story, I promise.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.170
And, you know, what's
amazing is all the people

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.410
on the concourse-- there's just
kind of a universal thing that

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.709
whenever they hear
the sound meep-meep--

00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:21.250
which is exactly
what we were doing--

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.039
people were ducking
out of the way.

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.580
And they were ducking
out of the way.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.410
And we were zigging
and we were zagging.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.880
And I just knew
that if we happen

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.520
to hit any sort of a speed
bump at all on the wheelchair,

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.179
I was going to come flying out
of that chair in an instant.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:36.900
But fortunately,
that didn't happen.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.440
And my whole thing
was not only did

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.750
I want to get an
hour early just to be

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.720
able to take care of our
luggage and get to the gate,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.980
I was also hungry.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.420
I wanted some McDonald's.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:46.921
You know?

00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:49.253
And I was like, Cort, don't
we have time for McDonald's?

00:08:49.253 --> 00:08:49.840
He's like, no.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.923
We don't have time to eat.

00:08:50.923 --> 00:08:52.750
We've got to get
you to the gate.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.609
So we're flying
down the concourse.

00:08:54.609 --> 00:08:55.150
We get there.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.550
We arrive with one
minute to spare--

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.210
one minute to spare.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.080
And the flight attendant
says, hey, you guys are fine.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.680
Welcome.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.060
Your buddy ran up and told
me you were on the way.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.560
We're probably not going to
take off for another 10 minutes,

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.010
so you're good to go.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.860
And I turn around.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.620
I'm amazed.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.184
My heart's still racing.

00:09:16.184 --> 00:09:17.350
Cort is huffing and puffing.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.610
Sean is huffing and puffing.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.840
We're gasping.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.930
And I turned to them.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.440
And I said, you
know, you guys still

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.150
have a couple of hours
before your flights home.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.530
What are you guys going to do?

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.470
And Cort says, eh, we'll
probably go to McDonald's.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.560
So I said, wow.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.060
OK.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.018
Well, that's messed up.

00:09:32.018 --> 00:09:33.430
But it's all good.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.790
But it was the teamwork
that got me there.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.570
It was the teamwork
that got me to the gate

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.790
and got me obviously
to my flight,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.500
to where I needed to go.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.110
It was those kinds
of experiences

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.620
that I wanted to embrace.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.610
It was those kind of
adventures that I wanted now

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.140
to be a part of my life.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.360
Because as you will
see, my journey

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.800
is far different than the
journey that most people take.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.110
My name is Alex Montoya.

00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:05.290
I am the owner of
A-MOtivational Communications.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.010
Ever since that
day three years ago

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.190
where I decided to leave my
job and do this full time,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.130
I am an author.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.630
I have published four books.

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.150
And I have a fifth
book on the way.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.410
I am a speaker.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.260
I get to travel the country
sharing my experiences

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.210
and sharing my thoughts.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:23.290
I am an immigrant.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.740
I was born in
Medellin, Colombia.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.490
And I am also a triple amputee.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.690
When I was born in 1974,
I had a rare birth defect

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.360
that led me to be
born missing both

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.490
of my arms and my right leg.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.300
Now the doctors
didn't expect it.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.100
The doctors didn't
anticipate it.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.200
They didn't know
this was coming.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.550
My family didn't
know this was coming.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.700
I had an older brother,
and an older sister.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.290
They were all physically fine.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.590
So this was quite a
shock to my family.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:59.230
And actually, the message
that the doctors delivered

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.910
to my parents was
that they should have

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:05.180
low expectations for my life.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.160
They said, you know,
if your son was

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.100
born missing both
of his arms and he

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.710
was born missing both of
his legs-- by the way,

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.772
we have the Google
Slides available.

00:11:15.772 --> 00:11:17.940
Go ahead and put
that first one up.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.660
That's actually a
picture of me shortly--

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.650
maybe a year or so after
being born, with my parents

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.650
there in Columbia.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:31.770
And so you can see that I
have a little bit of a stump,

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.560
in essence.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.130
But I was primarily born missing
the arms and the right leg.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.000
And the doctors message
was, his adversity in life

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.760
will be so great,
and his challenges

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.980
will be so great that you should
keep your expectations low.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.280
You should keep your
thoughts low about what

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:55.770
he's going to be able
to accomplish in life.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.040
You see, at that
time Colombia didn't

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.950
have a lot of technology.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.710
They didn't have
special education.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.920
They didn't have access
to making prosthetics.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.320
There wasn't really
a whole lot of hope

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.460
for people with disabilities.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.940
It's a lot better now, and
there's been a lot of changes,

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.130
and there's been a
lot of modernization.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.460
And it's a different world now.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:21.830
But at that time in 1974, if you
were born with a disability--

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.330
if you had a disability--
life was extra challenging.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.770
And some of my first memories
that I can actually recall

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.300
are two primary things.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.580
As long as I've been
old enough to remember,

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.940
as long as I've been old
enough to formulate memories,

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.981
I remember my parents--
and especially my father,

00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:40.100
pictured right there--

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.210
I remember my father telling me
no matter what the world says,

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.620
I don't want you feeling
sorry for yourself.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.510
And no matter what
the world says--

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.350
Because he knew.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.180
He knew that once we
went out in public,

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.360
people would be looking
at me differently.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.510
People would even
be pointing at us,

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.090
and whispering to themselves.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.510
And people would actually come
up to me and come to my family

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:06.980
and say, wow.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.640
I feel sorry for you.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.240
I really feel sorry for you
that you're in this predicament.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.200
And my father said, don't
ever give in to that.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.050
Even though the world
may feel sorry for you,

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:21.770
you can never feel
sorry for yourself.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.400
And his reasoning was this.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.050
He said as long as you have a
strong faith, a strong family,

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.910
and a strong education
you can do anything.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:35.180
You can do anything
at all in this world.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.420
And that was really where the
first idea of teamwork kind of

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.120
came into my mind,
or my consciousness.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.730
Because they said you're
going to need a lot of help.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.069
You're going to need assistance.

00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:46.610
But you're not going
to need everyone

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.830
to do everything for you.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.530
We're going to find a
way to help you to be

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.210
able to do things for yourself.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.879
So I remember really as
far back as I can remember,

00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:58.670
I remember that was
one of the main lessons

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.990
that my father taught me.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.540
The other thing
that I remember was

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.340
that every single morning
when my father would wake up,

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:11.600
the first thing that he would
do is not look out the window

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.807
and check the weather--

00:14:12.807 --> 00:14:15.140
which really, he needed to
do because he was a traveling

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.830
salesman.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:19.050
He didn't check
the news headlines.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.584
He didn't check the
family finances.

00:14:21.584 --> 00:14:24.000
You want to know the very first
thing that my father would

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.800
do every single morning?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.920
He would wake up, he would
thank God for a new day,

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.740
and he would crank up the music.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.720
He would crank up the
music and start singing,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.060
and start dancing,
and start flooding

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.935
our household with music.

00:14:37.935 --> 00:14:41.190
And it drove my mom nuts,
because we're not exactly

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:42.860
morning people in my household.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.040
And she would say, what
the heck are you doing?

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.820
And he would say, we're going
to make this day a great one.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.680
We're going to make
this day a happy one.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.450
We are going to set the tone.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.630
And we're going to do
something that inspires us,

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.320
and something we're
passionate about.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.180
One of his main
passions was music,

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.640
so he would flood the household
with music every single day.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.310
So those were the two
main memories that I had.

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:11.240
Now when I was four years old,
my life took a radical change.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.350
An organization here
in the United States

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.350
called the Shriners Hospitals
offered the chance for me

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.890
to move from Colombia,
and move to the States

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:23.820
in order to receive medical
help and my education.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.280
The Shriners, for those
that may not know--

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.360
an organization that takes kids
from Central America, Latin

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.150
America, Mexico--

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.680
and if they have
either orthopedic needs

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.720
or are burn victims,
they will bring them

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.000
to this country
for free and take

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.430
care of all of
their medical needs

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:47.890
as long as they have a need and
irrespective of financial need,

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.650
all the way up to age 18.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.860
And so they made an
offer to my family.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.310
I already had some family
living in the States,

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:58.450
and living in San Diego.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.200
My mom's sister,
my aunt, lived here

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.510
in San Diego with her
husband and their kids.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.000
And so we already
had family built in.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.180
And so the offer was
extended-- why don't you

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.580
move Alex to the US?

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.194
We'll take care of his needs.

00:16:13.194 --> 00:16:13.985
He'll go to school.

00:16:13.985 --> 00:16:15.450
He'll get the
education, and really

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:19.350
receive the life that he
would not have in Colombia.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.780
And so my family
knew that that was

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.180
a brand new opportunity for us.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.300
I remember my father
sitting me down the night

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.170
before I left for the States.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:30.420
And he said this.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.460
He said, I hope you realize that
this is a once in a lifetime

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.780
opportunity.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.450
God has shone his
grace on us, and you

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:43.890
have a wonderful, marvelous,
incredible opportunity

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.460
to go to the US,
receive your education,

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.280
receive prosthetics,
receive artificial limbs,

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.270
and really start your
life over, and to prove

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.045
all those doctors and
all those people wrong,

00:16:57.045 --> 00:17:02.170
that you can succeed
just like anyone else.

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:05.500
It was pretty heady stuff
for a four-year-old to hear.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.790
But I needed to hear it.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.810
And he said, you have two main
missions when you go to the US.

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.839
He said number one, I
want you to study as hard

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:18.300
as you possibly can and
pursue a quality education,

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.630
passionately.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:24.500
And he said number two, I want
you to inspire other people.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:28.280
I want you to show
people what is possible.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.460
And again, as a four
year old, I didn't really

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.540
fully know what that meant.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.740
I was just looking forward
to coming to the States,

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.870
going to Disneyland
for the first time,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.190
going to McDonald's.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.449
I have an obsession
with McDonald's.

00:17:41.449 --> 00:17:43.240
You know, I was just
really looking forward

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.290
to all those things.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:49.690
And my father knew that I had
a far more important mission

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:51.620
on this journey.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.130
Next slide.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.310
So the first thing that
happened when I moved to the US

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.530
was I received my prosthetics.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.140
The Shriners received
my prosthetics,

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.550
and I'd love to explain to you
and show you how they work.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.190
If you notice on
the picture there,

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.350
I wear a strap
harness that actually

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.900
is attached to my back.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.330
And the strap harness
is connected to a series

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.980
of cables on my arms.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.110
And hopefully
everyone here can see.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.196
And whichever way I
move my shoulder--

00:18:20.196 --> 00:18:22.070
and you can see there
in the picture, the way

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.090
they're connected to me.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:29.110
Whichever way I move my shoulder
will actually pull on the cable

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:32.000
to make the hook itself move.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.700
So even if my arm
is all the way out--

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.400
even if my arm is all
the way out past me,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.190
I need to be able
to move it inwards

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.360
in order for the strap harness
to pull on the right cable.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.550
The cable will
pull on the thumb,

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.595
and the thumb itself
will pull on the hook.

00:18:48.595 --> 00:18:49.970
And that's just
what I call them.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.530
It's just my hooks.

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.420
And whichever way I move
will trigger everything else.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.060
So if I move my
shoulder downwards,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.700
it'll move a different set of
cables on my elbow in order

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.210
for the elbow to move.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:07.460
And that's what allows the
elbow up and down motion.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.240
And that's what allows for the
prosthetic itself to operate.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:15.800
My leg is actually a
prosthetic hydraulic knee.

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.230
So in other words, because
I don't have the same heel

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.840
to toe ratio as most
people, whenever I step down

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.050
I actually activate a hydraulic
knee that lifts me up.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.800
And it's connected to
me through a waist belt.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.650
And it remains connected
to me all day long.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.290
I take my arms and
leg off at night.

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.480
I put them on in the
morning, very easily.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.510
I slip into them just like
an old pair of slippers.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.880
But they are on me
as long as I'm awake,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.340
all day long, all day strong.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.710
And I learned a couple
of things through that.

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:52.220
I learned number one, the
importance of connectivity.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.190
I knew that I needed my
straps to be connected

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:57.710
to my cable, my
cable to be connected

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:01.340
to my hook, the hook itself to
be activated through the thumb.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.060
I needed for the hydraulic
knee to stay activated and stay

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.430
connected to the
other parts of my leg,

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:08.900
in order for me to walk.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.890
I knew that prosthetics
were all about connectivity.

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:15.140
I knew that all of
these things connected

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.010
allowed me to move, and
walk, and talk, and live

00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.690
a normal life.

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.700
But I also saw that
there was a higher

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.430
level, or a different
level of connectedness

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:27.380
that I had to embrace.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.170
First of all, there is
the technology aspect.

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.630
Obviously, I had to embrace
all of the technology

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.860
that I was wearing.

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.730
And whereas most people would
see me and say, wow, poor guy--

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:40.010
he has prosthetics--
I would look

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:42.440
at it as, this is fantastic.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.160
Whereas before I
didn't have anything,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.987
and I couldn't hold anything,
and I couldn't grab anything.

00:20:47.987 --> 00:20:49.820
All of a sudden you're
giving me prosthetics

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.060
that are allowing me to
hold, and grab, and grab

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.880
food, and grab a pen, and be
able to operate and function.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.770
This is great.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.760
This is fantastic.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.310
For me, this is freedom.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.820
But I also learned that
it wasn't necessarily

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.010
an easy freedom.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.870
There were a lot of challenges.

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.290
One of my first
obstacles was learning

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.990
how to put on a t-shirt.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.390
And just as a side note,
a lot of the things that I

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:20.360
had to learn how
to do, maybe you

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.860
might take them for granted.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.360
Because there are
things that you've

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.090
done every single day
of your life with great,

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.010
tremendous ease.

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:31.100
And I just want to say, never
take things for granted.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.910
Never take even the easiest,
simplest thing for granted.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:38.330
Because not all of us can do
those things, necessarily.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:43.100
Not all of us can necessarily
have an easy pathway

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:44.060
to learning those.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.010
Never take even the
simplest things for granted.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.510
Show gratitude in all things.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.650
And I remember my
aunt-- remember,

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:54.350
my mom's sister who really
became like a second mom

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.730
to me--

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.520
the very first time she
saw me struggling putting

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.120
on a t-shirt, and struggling to
learn how to put my prosthetic

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.230
arms through the arm
holes on the shirt--

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.840
she said, you know,
I can help you

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.870
and we would get your
shirt on right away.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.820
Or I can teach you how to do
this, and help you find a way

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:21.500
to do this so that you can
put your own shirt on forever.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.310
And we learned, and we developed
a system where we said let's

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:27.000
just put one prosthetic
arm through one

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.540
hole, the next prosthetic
arm through the next hole,

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:33.015
my big, fat head through
the hole of the head.

00:22:33.015 --> 00:22:34.390
And then, of
course, I need to be

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.380
able to grab onto to the
shirt itself, pull it down.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.080
But for me, that was
a learning process.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.380
That was an example of learning
the keys of determination.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.890
I saw that I needed to
embrace being determined,

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.550
because things just weren't
going to be as easy for me.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.550
And then finally,
the third thing

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.770
was I needed to learn how--

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.990
no matter what in each
aspect of my life--

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:02.680
I needed to be
self-motivated and self

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:08.470
inspired to be able to overcome
these sorts of obstacles.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:13.240
The greatest and most
immediate example of that

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.260
was my very first summer camp.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.130
I attended a camp in
the state of Arizona.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:20.420
I was very excited.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:22.680
I was dressed far
different than today.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.246
I had on a t-shirt and shorts--

00:23:24.246 --> 00:23:26.370
you know, the kind of thing
that you would normally

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.780
wear to a camp.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.770
So you could see my prosthetics
very clearly, and very easily.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.250
And I was very impressed that
when the school bus pulled up

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.670
to the campsite and we were
ready to jump off the bus

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.620
and go to the camp,
I was very impressed

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.430
that the camp director
was actually right there

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.610
to greet us and to say hello.

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.690
Imagine my surprise when
I stepped off the bus

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.520
and I saw him looking at me.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.770
And I saw him looking
at my prosthetic arms.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:58.510
And I saw him looking
at my prosthetic leg.

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:03.300
And he pauses, and he looks
at me square in the eye,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.760
and he says, wow.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.860
I wish you weren't here.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.230
I wish you weren't here.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.010
And I said, why?

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.340
And he goes, well, you
obviously got a lot going on.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.860
You're dealing with a
whole lot going on here.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.140
You're probably going
to need a lot of help.

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.120
You're going to need
a lot of assistance.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.192
You may even fall
and sue our campsite.

00:24:27.192 --> 00:24:28.400
I just wish you weren't here.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.070
I wish you were
at some other camp

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.900
for some other kind of kids.

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.540
And that was my first
taste of really wanting

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.640
to prove someone wrong.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.460
That was my first taste of
being inspired and saying,

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.395
you know what?

00:24:42.395 --> 00:24:46.530
I understand why you
have those views.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.010
Because I know by now
that we're all just

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:54.390
kind of a composite of our
experiences and our ambitions.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.760
And that's really just
what his viewpoint was.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.340
His only encounters
with disabled people--

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.576
if he had any at all--

00:25:00.576 --> 00:25:01.950
were that they
were somebody that

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.100
needed a lot of
help, somebody that

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.910
needed a lot of assistance.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.810
He looked at me
from my limitations

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.470
instead of my potential.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:15.420
And I was inspired
to prove him wrong.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.980
Now contrast that with another
incident, just a short time

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.850
later, where I joined
some friends of mine

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.470
on the playground for
the very first time.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:28.560
And I noticed that
they were all going

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.350
to frolic and have fun
and have a good time

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:35.460
at this beautiful, shiny,
metallic thing called

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.600
the monkey bars--

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.340
which for me, was a
brand new experience.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.080
How many here used to
play on the monkey bars

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.630
when you were kids?

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.130
I'm just curious.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:41.640
OK.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.740
How many still play
on the monkey bars?

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:44.350
OK, good.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.680
All right.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.263
You're honest.

00:25:45.263 --> 00:25:46.930
I appreciate that.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:50.360
Well for me, it was a
brand new experience.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.320
And I went out with
about 10 of my friends.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.350
And they looked at me.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.100
And I remember about half of
them looked at the monkey bars

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.910
and they said, Alex, are you
sure you want to do this?

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:02.100
Like, we don't
know if the straps

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.590
and the cables on your
arms can suspend you

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.330
in the air like that.

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:08.680
We don't know if you're
even able to climb up

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.840
to the monkey bars.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.930
This is probably
not a good idea.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.180
This is probably
not a good activity.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.932
You should probably
sit this one out.

00:26:15.932 --> 00:26:17.640
And then I had another
group of friends--

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.920
about five other friends--
that said, you know what?

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.380
If you want to get on the
monkey bars, let's find a way.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.740
What if we took your
hooks and we clamped them

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.900
onto the rungs of the
ladder, and we had

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.630
you climb one rung at a time?

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:38.750
And what if we take your
good leg-- your left leg--

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.860
and we had you put all
your weight on there

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.560
and just kind of drag
your prosthetic leg up?

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.990
And I liked their
thinking a lot better.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.570
Because I think
the words what if

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.800
are the greatest words
in the English language.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.680
I think when you come
from a point of what

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.460
if, you come from a
point of potential.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.522
You come from a point of
exploring possibilities.

00:27:01.522 --> 00:27:02.730
And so I said, you know what?

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.680
I think you're right.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.460
What if we do that?

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.340
So I said, I'm
going to try this.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:08.640
And my friends even said, look.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.556
If you fall down, we're
going to laugh at you.

00:27:10.556 --> 00:27:11.990
But we'll help you up.

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.460
You know, we'll find a way.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.670
And so they said,
let's take your hooks.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:18.200
Let's clamp them onto
the rungs of the ladder.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.861
And so I climbed, and I climbed,
and I climbed, and I climbed.

00:27:21.861 --> 00:27:24.110
And they said, let's take a
good leg-- your left leg--

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.990
and let's put all
the weight on there.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.500
Let's kind of drag
your prosthetic leg up.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:30.800
So I'm climbing, and I'm
climbing, and I'm climbing,

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.700
and I'm climbing.

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.530
And by now, this is
like an OMG moment.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.190
Like, OMG, this is happening.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.570
This is the reality now.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.170
And by that point,
all the kids--

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.280
all the kids were--

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.260
the ones that said that I could
and the ones that said that I

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:44.130
couldn't-- they're yelling
for me, they're cheering,

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.140
they're whistling.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:46.760
Girls are inviting me to prom.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.844
I mean, it was just crazy.

00:27:47.844 --> 00:27:50.009
So I'm climbing, and I'm
climbing, and I'm climbing,

00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:50.990
and I'm climbing.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:54.140
And I realized that I've spent
so much focus and so much

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.980
time on thinking about
what it took to get up

00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.390
to the top of the monkey bars--

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.390
I hadn't thought about
what it was going to take

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.040
to get across the monkey bars.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.470
And how many times
in life do we think

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.720
about a certain
ambition that we have,

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.570
or a certain project,
or a certain plan,

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.310
and then we realize that
everything has gone sideways

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.960
and we have to just
adapt our life.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.690
And so I quickly
had to think, OK.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.710
If I want to get
across the monkey bars,

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.630
I needed to raise
my strap harness--

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:24.580
as you see there--

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.230
raise it just a
little bit higher.

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.600
And so that way, I can
raise my arms higher

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.492
and start climbing across, and
across, and across, and across,

00:28:33.492 --> 00:28:35.090
and across.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.840
And I reached about the halfway
point when all of a sudden I

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.150
heard the worst
sound that you'd want

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:46.022
to hear at that moment, which
was [IMITATES SCHOOL BELL]..

00:28:46.022 --> 00:28:49.340
What do you think that was?

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.000
The school bell.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.040
And all of a sudden
I'm still up there,

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.570
and all my friends are below me.

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.800
And they scattered.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.020
I was like Moses
parting the Red Sea.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.870
Because they ran to the
left, they ran to the right,

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.820
they all ran away.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:09.005
And I'm still up on the
monkey bars by myself.

00:29:09.005 --> 00:29:10.880
And it took about five
minutes for my teacher

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.810
to realize that I
wasn't in class.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:17.232
And she comes out and she says,
"Alejandro Montoya Gonzalez--"

00:29:17.232 --> 00:29:19.773
And you know you're in trouble
when they say all three names.

00:29:19.773 --> 00:29:23.070
She said, "Alejandro Montoya
Gonzales, what are you doing?"

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.810
And I said, "Hey.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:25.730
I'm just hanging out.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.045
How about you?"

00:29:27.045 --> 00:29:28.450
And she laughed.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.860
But she helps me down.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.100
But that incident-- both
combined with the incident

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.530
in camp and the incident
on the monkey bars--

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.410
topped the three key
things that really I've

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.230
carried through with me
for the rest of my life.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:46.250
Number one, once
again, it taught me

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:49.160
the importance of technology.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.100
It taught me how I had to
trust that my arms were

00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.390
built in the right way.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.410
I had to trust that the
strap harness and the cables

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.090
weren't going to let me down.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:02.420
I had the trust that I had a
good, strong leg that could

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.010
help me in getting up there.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.370
I had the trust
the technology that

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.120
was on me, and that
was a part of me,

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.860
could help me to be able
to do something new--

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:15.320
a new activity like this--
whether it was be at the camp,

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.350
or be on the monkey bar itself.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.360
And then, of course,
the second aspect

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:24.830
was I once again saw the
importance of determination.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:28.670
When life, or actual
people tell you

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.280
that you can't do
something, how determined

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.770
are you to prove them wrong?

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.650
How determined are
you to show people

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.980
that their expectations
are too low?

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.335
When people tell you that
adversity is too strong

00:30:42.335 --> 00:30:47.640
and the odds are too great, how
determined are you to succeed?

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.030
How determined are you to push
forward against all adversity?

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:55.610
Because I'm not the only
one that has adversity.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.920
Every single person does.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:02.480
Even people who you think
have so-called perfect lives

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.490
have adversity.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:05.720
It's part of our DNA.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.740
It's part of our fiber.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.090
It's part of everything
that goes on.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.320
We all have a level of
adversity in our lives.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.860
But each one of us responds
to it in a different way.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:21.360
How determined are you to
overcome those obstacles?

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.000
And then finally, number three--

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.240
when I was up there and
I was at the monkey bars

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.730
and I was hanging
out by myself, I

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:32.720
felt like I was the only
person left on Earth.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.340
I mean, everybody cleared out.

00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.660
There will be times within
your journey, Googlers,

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:45.181
and within your career path or
even a project or assignment

00:31:45.181 --> 00:31:46.180
that you're working on--

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.550
you may feel like you're alone.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.430
You may feel like
people don't understand

00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:53.980
your journey, or the
things that you go through,

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:57.120
or the places that you've been,
or the pathway that you've

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.620
taken.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.880
You may feel like there are
times where you are alone

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.230
in your mission.

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.030
And that is when
I want to remind

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:06.280
you to just keep hanging on.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.450
Just keep believing in yourself.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.740
Just keep believing in your
conviction, and in your ideals.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.800
And just like my father told
me, and continued to tell me

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.630
whenever I would call home--

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.560
don't feel sorry for yourself.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.420
Know that if you have a strong
faith, a strong family--

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.940
which also includes
strong friends--

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.930
a strong education,
you can do anything.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:31.360
You can overcome anything.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:35.000
And you will inspire
other people.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.630
And I saw that those were going
to be lessons that continued

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:44.540
to influence me, guide me,
carry me, really motivate me

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.900
all the way through.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.080
It fueled me to
always tell myself

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.420
I'm not just going to
do the bare minimum.

00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.490
I'm going to make
sure that I try

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:59.020
to make my dreams come true to
the greatest extent possible.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.260
When I chose my
place of college,

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:04.190
I chose a pretty
challenging school--

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.190
the University of Notre Dame.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:07.690
Go, Irish.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.930
When I chose my
career path, I chose

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.600
to go into professional sports--

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.760
not only because I had
a passion for sports,

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.350
but because a lot
of people said,

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.650
well, everyone wants
to get into sports.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.960
There's no way you'll
ever get a job in sports.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.400
There are millions of people
out there getting into sports.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.100
And that motivated me
to try even harder.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.200
And because of that,
I was able to spend

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:37.010
10 years working in sports
for the San Diego Padres.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.570
One of my other
passions was writing.

00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:41.060
I've always been a
very passionate writer.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.950
And it fueled me
and it motivated

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:49.540
me to be able to write, and
to start expressing my story

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.450
and expressing my journey.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.600
Another passion of mine and
another mission that I took on

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.100
was marathon running.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.010
Next slide.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:03.980
I know that Google is
celebrating its 20 year

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:04.970
anniversary.

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:08.330
Well, you know what else
happened 20 years ago?

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:11.060
The Rock and Roll
Marathon series

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:15.500
began 20 years ago, actually
right here in San Diego.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.920
And for me, I wanted
to prove to people

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.449
that even a guy on one leg
could complete a marathon.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.830
Even the guy with a disability
could do something as arduous,

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:32.320
as grueling, as grinding
as be on a marathon,

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.270
and be on a marathon relay
team-- which is what I did.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.530
Now the very first
marathon in San Diego,

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.969
or the very first Rock
and Roll Marathon--

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:43.300
which was located and
created here in San Diego--

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.810
was in 1998.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.150
And it was actually
at Balboa Stadium,

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:50.420
which is next to San Diego
High School, downtown.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.860
That's my alma mater.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.719
I went to San Diego High.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:55.520
So quick story here--

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.570
because I went to San Diego
High and I knew the layout

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.060
of the place, and I knew the
whole layout of where they

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.954
would have the
post-race concert--

00:35:03.954 --> 00:35:05.870
How many here have been
involved in marathons?

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:06.481
Anybody?

00:35:06.481 --> 00:35:06.980
OK.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.560
A few of you.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.074
Good.

00:35:08.074 --> 00:35:10.490
Anybody that's been involved
in the Rock and Roll Marathon

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.130
will know that one of the
greatest aspects of that race

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.670
is they have a really
cool concert as

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.650
soon as the race ends.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:23.120
Well, the concert that year was
at Balboa Stadium, right next

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.290
San Diego High.

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.930
And the headliner was
Huey Lewis and the News--

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.690
a famous group, of course,
from the '80s and '90s.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.980
And so I, knowing the
layout as well as I did--

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.630
I snuck backstage.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.420
I snuck into the buffet area--

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.170
again, obsessed with food.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.300
And I walked up to Huey Lewis.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:44.750
Let's go back to
that other slide.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.270
I walked up to Huey Lewis.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:50.000
And Huey Lewis looks at me,
and he looks at my prosthetics.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.180
And his first words are,
"Hey, you have two of those."

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.190
And I said, "Yeah.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.660
Why don't you give me
two of those hot dogs?"

00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:59.510
And he did.

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.580
He put two hot dogs on my plate.

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:06.190
So I could actually say that I
was served food by a rock star.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.600
Sometimes what the
world might view

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.990
as a hindrance or a
limitation or something bad,

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:16.160
can actually lead
to great adventures

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.680
and to great and
wonderful times.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:21.080
I think it's fair
to say I probably

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.930
wouldn't have met Huey
Lewis and the News,

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:26.750
or been as brazen
about it, unless I

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.480
had this very
interesting topic to be

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:33.540
able to talk to Huey about.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:39.810
It's really led me to have
some very great experiences,

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.690
and inspirations, and
things that have really

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:47.440
proven to people that life is
all about how you look at it--

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.340
focusing to choose
on what you have

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.730
instead of what you are missing.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:54.730
I'll finish with this.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:58.890
I'll finish with
one final story.

00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:02.790
Circling back to when I decided
to turn this into a full-time

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.070
business, and be a
full time writer,

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.630
and be a full time speaker--

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.870
one of my other first
speaking engagements

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.690
aside from the one in
Chicago was actually

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:16.590
at a school in
downtown San Diego

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.725
called The Monarch School.

00:37:17.725 --> 00:37:20.100
And for those that might not
be familiar with The Monarch

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:20.790
School--

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.060
it is this school
exclusively dedicated

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.370
to kids who are homeless.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.250
And I remember
when I was invited

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.200
to speak at that school--

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.110
I remember thinking, wow.

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.330
I guess part of
doing this full-time

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:40.610
and speaking and
writing full-time

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.670
is going to places that
I might not even feel

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.950
all that confident in going to.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.590
And the reason I
didn't feel confident

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:50.910
is because I felt that no matter
how many obstacles I have,

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.150
and no matter how many
adversities I have,

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:58.400
I'm fortunate to know that
I have a roof over my head

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.020
at the end of the day.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.960
And I didn't know what I
could say that could possibly

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.050
inspire the kids at
that school, given

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:09.640
the circumstances they're in.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.850
But I remembered what
my father told me.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.380
And I actually called home
and talked to him about it.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.360
And he said, look.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.470
Your mission is to continue
to live life with passion,

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:23.820
pursue your education with
passion, and inspire people.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.280
You need to go and
give your message,

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:28.480
and inspire those kids.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.340
And so I did.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.480
I went to the Monarch School
and I spoke to the students.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.670
And I especially
emphasized the importance

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:37.630
of not giving in
to your obstacles,

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.020
not giving in to your
hurdles, never giving

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:45.570
up, and just trusting that
good things would be ahead.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:50.040
But I still walked out of that
school not feeling too great.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.900
Because again, I didn't
feel like the things

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.810
that I had overcome
necessarily measured up

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.440
to what they were overcoming.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.700
About a week later
after my talk,

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.910
I'm in downtown San Diego.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:04.920
It's where I live.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.450
It's where I run my business.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:09.780
And I actually run my business
out of the downtown San Diego

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.740
Library--

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.710
which if you haven't been to the
library down there, please do.

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.160
It's a marvelous place.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.770
And a little girl approaches me.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.660
And she says, "Mr.
Alex, Mr. Alex."

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.900
And I look and I say, "Yes?"

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:28.290
And she says, "Mr. Alex,
I have something for you."

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:31.120
And I say, "What could
you possibly have?"

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:35.190
And she kneels down, and she
reaches into her backpack.

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:38.220
And she says, "I
made you a picture."

00:39:38.220 --> 00:39:40.750
I said, "You made me a picture?"

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:46.480
My friend Cort here is going to
show you this beautiful picture

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.890
that she made,
that I had framed.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:53.370
And it says, Alex
Montoya, big and strong.

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:55.812
And I said, "You
made that for me?"

00:39:55.812 --> 00:39:56.770
And I thought about it.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:57.600
And I said, "Wait a minute.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.724
It's like, 12:00 right now.

00:39:58.724 --> 00:40:00.540
Why aren't you in school?"

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.100
And she says, "Well,
we're actually

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:06.360
given an hour to go home,
check on our families,

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.460
and make sure everything
is OK with our families.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.890
And then we have to go
back to our school."

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.050
Thank you, sir.

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:17.466
And she says, "I made this
specifically for you."

00:40:17.466 --> 00:40:18.340
And I was blown away.

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.370
And I said, "Thank
you so, so much."

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:22.230
But I was curious.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.720
I said, "So you liked my talk.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.570
What was it about my
talk that you liked?"

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:30.720
And she says,
"Well, I'm homeless.

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:35.010
And your message to us was
all about never giving up.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:37.320
Your message was
to us about if we

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:40.600
are inspired within our lives
to do more and to be more,

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.320
then no matter what else we
have going on in our life

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.710
we can overcome it.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:48.620
That we can't give
in to the thoughts

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.720
and negativities and all the
challenges we have going on.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.400
That I have to keep
pushing and moving forward.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.840
That I can give up on life."

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.170
She said, "I thank you, because
that really inspired me."

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.610
And it blew me away.

00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:05.290
It blew me away.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:09.760
Because it taught me that
our mission in life--

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:14.050
all of us-- is to
inspire others.

00:41:14.050 --> 00:41:17.170
Our mission is to take
whatever adversities,

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:20.800
whatever challenges, whatever
things go wrong, whatever

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.314
things aren't perfect--

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.980
and grow from them,
and learn from them,

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.560
and be determined by them.

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.330
And to take the
things that we have--

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:33.390
so in my case it's having
prosthetics, and having

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.250
a strong faith, and a strong
education, and a strong support

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.300
system--

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.490
and making the most
out of those things

00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:43.280
to be able to inspire others.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:48.070
It is our mission and our
role to inspire other people.

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:51.760
Now Google, as a company,
often times will do that.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.720
Let's say when the home page is
changed on the search engine--

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:59.080
sometimes you honor
certain causes or leaders

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.430
or civil rights leaders.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.520
That's a very inspiring thing.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.490
But only you know within your
roles and within your jobs

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:11.020
how exactly you can even
inspire even more people--

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:15.280
how you can inspire the
greater world out there.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:21.320
I urge you-- urge you to
look for a way every day,

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:25.210
not just to get through the
day, not just to get through

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:28.540
the deadlines and the work
and the meetings and all those

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.470
things that we have--

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.810
all those things that are
part of our responsibilities.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.710
I urge you to not just
get through those.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.660
I urge you to live inspired.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.360
I urge you to find
a way to figure out,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:44.230
how can I take my job--
how can I take my role

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:48.630
and really inspire
people through it?

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:52.530
And I think I was able to do
that with that little girl.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:56.090
And I hope that she's able to
do that with her classmates,

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:58.980
and her family, as well.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:03.340
Now about a year-- ago
almost a year to the date--

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:08.880
it was August of 2017, my father
that gave all of that wisdom

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.770
and all of that inspiration to
me and all of those words that

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:15.420
really fueled me--

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.120
passed away.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.330
And he went to be with the Lord.

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:21.620
He lived a great life.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.990
He was almost 80 years old.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.540
He was always the
life of the party.

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.730
He was someone that always made
people feel great to be around.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.240
That was just the kind
of bubbling personality

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.940
that he was.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.680
And as often happens
when you lose a parent--

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.540
you really spend most
of your life thinking

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.450
about all the ways that you are
different from your parents,

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:47.470
and you want to exert your
independence from your parents.

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:50.364
But let me tell you, when you
have a parent that passes away,

00:43:50.364 --> 00:43:52.280
you start thinking about
all the ways that you

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.880
are like your parents, and
the influence they had on you,

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.130
and the way they mold you,
and the way they shape you,

00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:59.879
and the way they transform you.

00:43:59.879 --> 00:44:01.670
And I started thinking
about all the things

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:04.390
that my father
wanted me to learn,

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:08.480
and all of the ways that
his ways really inspired

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.310
me and helped shape me.

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:15.230
And when he passed, I know that
he became my guardian angel.

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.022
I know that he's here today.

00:44:17.022 --> 00:44:19.230
I know that many of you may
have guardian angels that

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:20.139
are here today.

00:44:20.139 --> 00:44:21.680
And I think if
there's one thing they

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.730
want us to know is that we
have such an opportunity.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.270
We have such a great
chance within our jobs,

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.780
within our roles, within
our volunteer time,

00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:37.200
just within our journeys,
to inspire other people

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.120
and to show people that our
challenges and our adversities

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.970
aren't in vain--

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:45.980
that we have an opportunity
to learn from them

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:51.260
and grow from them, and to show
a different side of this world.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:55.020
To show that all of us
can accomplish anything.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:55.520
Next slide.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.650
That is me working out--

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:03.180
something I need to do more of.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.890
You might even say
determined, inspired,

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:09.930
being a world changer--

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.152
this is us.

00:45:11.152 --> 00:45:13.110
That's the actor from
"This is Us," by the way.

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:17.290
I met him at a Notre Dame
football game in 2010.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.210
Next slide.

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:23.420
That is me, completing one of
the Rock and Roll Marathons,

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:27.320
where I went from gatecrasher
to actual participant.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.740
And I want you to
know, Googlers,

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:32.175
that if you look at your
life in a different way,

00:45:32.175 --> 00:45:35.030
and if you look at your
adversities in a different way,

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:37.760
and if you live your
life with passion,

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:40.010
you live your life
with purpose, and you

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.620
live your life with inspiration,
I'll put it like this--

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:47.030
if a young man can come
from Medellin, Colombia

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:51.080
and come into this country
and make his dreams come true,

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.060
and write four books, have
a fifth one on the way,

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:57.140
and do a couple of
marathons, and be

00:45:57.140 --> 00:45:59.840
able to achieve his
wildest dreams--

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.610
why can't you?

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:03.200
Why can't you?

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.310
Live with purpose,
live with inspiration,

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:10.310
and know that you
can do anything.

00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:11.630
Thank you for your time.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.940
Do we have time for questions?

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:26.960
Are there any questions in
the house, or any thoughts?

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.960
That's a great question.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.490
Do I have bucket list, and
what are the top two or three?

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:33.870
So it's actually kind
of a two part question.

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:35.240
I'm 44.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:40.100
And right before I turned
40 is when I actually

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.490
created a bucket list,
but with a twist.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:51.200
I made a list of 50 things that
I want to accomplish before 50.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.590
And the reason for that is, they
say that first of all, any goal

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:56.600
that you write down--

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.660
any goal that you have, you are
80% more likely to achieve it

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.370
if you write it down.

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:06.110
And then the second thing is, if
you create goals that are just

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:10.700
kind of long-term and
just kind of vague,

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:12.020
you might not ever get to it.

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.780
But if you give yourself
an exact time window,

00:47:14.780 --> 00:47:17.510
you're more apt to
really work on it.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.280
So I specifically
wanted that parameter.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:24.740
I specifically wanted age 50
to kind of be my cut off age.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.456
Because, I mean, at 50
we're still very young.

00:47:27.456 --> 00:47:29.670
But it's only 10 years away.

00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:31.310
And so I knew I
was going to work

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:35.240
hard to really get those things
accomplished within the age 50.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.250
And they're pretty
much a lot of the goals

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:41.090
that most people will have--
places they want to see,

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:42.380
things they want to do.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.800
For me, it entailed
I wanted to make sure

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.940
that I wrote more books, that
I got to do more travel--

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.190
things like that.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:55.660
But my other kind
of main list that

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.620
was kind of an
offshoot of that, is

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:03.050
I have a goal of
speaking in 100 cities.

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:07.220
For me, that also helps take
care of seeing the world,

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.400
connecting with old friends and
connecting with people that I

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.630
love, experiencing new
adventures and new things

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:18.140
within my journeys.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:23.630
So 100 cities-- and right now
I am currently at city 53.

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:27.830
So I have 47 more cities
to reach that goal.

00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:30.470
And on social media I
made this a hashtag--

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:32.330
#100cities.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:35.480
So that's my goal and my purpose
that drives me every day,

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:38.660
is how can I find a way to
speak and deliver my message

00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:41.530
in as many cities as possible.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:45.080
So if any of you have ideas
or recommendations or leads,

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.060
I'm all ears.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.670
But that's good that
you were thinking

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:52.060
in terms of those terms,
as creating a list

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.990
to be able to live inspired.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.160
Other questions?

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:57.780
Yep.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:00.460
So I've published
four books so far.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.530
The first one is
"Swinging for the Fences."

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:07.350
And that's really the story
of overcoming my disability

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.740
and immigrating to the US.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.810
Second book is called
"The Finish Line."

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:15.900
And that was
specifically about doing

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:20.190
the marathon, and what it
took as a triple amputee

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.810
to do the marathon.

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.000
Third book is called
"See the Good."

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.290
And it's all about my
theory that in life,

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:31.050
if you take something bad
that has happened to you

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:33.920
or taken adversity
within your life--

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.430
then if you look, you can find
a minimum of two good things

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:39.875
within every bad thing.

00:49:39.875 --> 00:49:42.000
So in other words, out of
every piece of adversity,

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.180
out of every challenge,
of every confrontation,

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:47.540
out of every bad thing--

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:51.506
minimum, two good things
have come out of it.

00:49:51.506 --> 00:49:52.380
You just got to look.

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:55.680
You just got to look and
look for what they are.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.900
And then I actually
have written-- so those

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.390
are three motivational books.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:05.400
Fourth is just a fiction
novel called "Wolf Pack."

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:11.880
And it's about kind of a take
on the old hangover motif, where

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.460
he says, this is my wolf pack.

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.370
It's a group of friends that
faced adversity together,

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:19.050
and how they do
so as a wolf pack.

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:21.880
And then again, my fifth
one coming out this year,

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.540
called, "Living
Inspired," which is

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.610
changing your life by choosing
only things that inspire you.

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:29.896
So thank you for asking.

00:50:29.896 --> 00:50:30.770
Thank you for coming.

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:31.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:33.760
Thank you, Google.
