1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,890
The Joe Rogan experience, is it? Oh,
this is what I was going to say. Yeah.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,240
We were talking about, uh, uh, we
weren't even talking about this, but

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,890
my daughter is watching
these youtube videos of this.

4
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:21,030
There's this young gay fellow does
makeup tutorials Charles. Oh yeah.

5
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:25,530
Okay. He's enormous. Ease, enormous.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,560
You know, he, he,

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,560
he probably gets more views than any
network show that's ever been created.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,660
How old was this fellow? He's young. He's
like 20. Oh, okay. What do you say, Jan?

9
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,430
I'm trying to lie if I
should bring this out here.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,920
I just put the last thing that
popped in my head during Coachella,

11
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:44,250
he got accused of being in this viral
video that happened. It wasn't him,

12
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:46,240
but there's the Ferris wheel Coachella.
No.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,930
Have you ever seen that
dude I'm talking about? No.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,690
It's a big famous thing that people
take pictures in front of. Uh,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,200
during a concert you could
see a silhouette of somebody
getting head in there

16
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,100
and it's two guys. Oh, really? It's
a very vivid video that was going on,

17
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,070
went super viral on Twitter that night,
and they were saying it was him. Yeah.

18
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,260
How dare they. He's all about makeup,
not ahead. Yeah. Sons of bitches.

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,150
Keep it to reapply your lipstick and
keep it clean, but it's hilarious.

20
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,770
My, my sister, Oh, me and my sister.

21
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:18,260
My daughter sits in front of
the TV cackling watching. It is,

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,800
it is supposed to be funny.
She thinks it's funny. Yeah.

23
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,290
She thinks he's hilarious for
laughter. I don't know. Yeah.

24
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,130
I mean he's covered in crazy makeup.
I think what she was laughing at though,

25
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:34,190
in all fairness was he was making
fun of someone subscriber 6 million,

26
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,180
16 million black.

27
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,910
I think he was making fun of people
that put on too much makeup. Okay,

28
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,250
so he was going crazy with them.
Yeah. She thought it was really funny.

29
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,410
That is fucking banana. 16 million
people and he's doing makeup tutorials.

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,580
He looks great. He looks great.
That's the thing. It's like we,

31
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,120
there's an always on Kardashian,
right.

32
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,670
Kinds of shit like this that you
would have never expected. Yeah,

33
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,930
and because of the access,
because on demand access,

34
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,330
especially like through computer,
it's so easy.

35
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,890
It's so easy to just type in
the next thing. John Reed.
What's next? Just pops up.

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,780
Yeah, so like these people that
no network in their right mind,

37
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,330
like NBC would never
say, Hey, that young guy,

38
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,370
let's get that guy to do a makeup show.
They'd be like,

39
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:24,570
get the fuck out of the office. You
don't know shit about ratings. Meanwhile,

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,830
8 billion subscribers. That's crazy.
That'd be a fun game to play is like,

41
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:33,270
what rabbit hole would youtube
send you down if you typed in this?

42
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,000
I just let it keep going.
That's up on its own.
