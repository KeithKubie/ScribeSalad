[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:07.300
SPEAKER: We have a
great panel for you

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.240
today with women from
the cast and creatives

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.840
of "Beautiful," the Carole
King musical on Broadway.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.160
Before she was Carole
King, superstar,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.820
she was Carole Klein,
teenage songwriter.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.640
For five years, "Beautiful,"
the Carole King musical

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.970
has thrilled theatergoers
with the inspiring true story

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.260
of one woman's remarkable
journey from teenage songwriter

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.360
to the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.860
From the string of
pop classics, she

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.540
wrote for the
biggest acts in music

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.690
to her own life-changing,
chart-busting success

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.490
with "Tapestry,"
"Beautiful" takes you

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.470
back to where it all
began, and takes you

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.230
on the ride of a lifetime,
featuring such unforgettable

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.230
classics as "You've Got
a Friend," "So Far Away,"

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.080
"Take Good Care of My Baby,"
"Will You Love Me Tomorrow,"

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.800
and "Natural Woman."

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.680
This Tony and Grammy
award-winning musical

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
phenomenon is filled with
songs you'll remember

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.620
and a story you'll never forget.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.120
So we're going to kick it off
with a quick sizzle of Melissa

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.010
Benoist rehearsing
for "Beautiful."

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.343
And then we'll get
right into the Q&amp;A.

00:01:07.343 --> 00:02:09.219
[MUSIC - MELISSA BENOIST, "I
 FEEL THE EARTH MOVE."]

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.381
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:13.310
MELISSA BENOIST: Sit here?

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.280
SPEAKER: All right.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.290
Melissa.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.300
MELISSA BENOIST: Hi.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.690
SPEAKER: Everyone, let's welcome
our panelists, Melissa Benoist,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.770
who plays Carole
King, Joyce Chittick,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.860
our associate choreographer,
and Stacey Zaloga,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.120
our assistant stage manager.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.670
So Melissa, congratulations
on your Broadway debut playing

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.140
Carole King in "Beautiful."

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.280
I saw the show last week.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.820
It was fantastic and great
to see your interpretation

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.550
of the character.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.954
I had seen it prior as well.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:44.620
And you currently
star in the title role

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.550
of "Supergirl" on
the CW, and you

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.400
starred in my personal
favorite, "Glee."

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.420
[LAUGHS]

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.650
Joyce, you are the
associate choreographer.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.960
You've been on Broadway
for over 20 years

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.010
as a performer, a dance captain,
and associate choreographer.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.980
Prior to "Beautiful," you
worked on "Anything Goes,"

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.860
"Grease," "Thoroughly
Modern Millie," "Cabaret,"

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.590
"Pajama Games," and "Cats."

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.992
And Stacey, you are the
assistant stage manager.

00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:13.075
You've been with "Beautiful"
since the beginning--

00:03:13.075 --> 00:03:15.521
so almost five years now.

00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:17.770
And prior to that, you worked
on "Shrek, the Musical,"

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.410
and you've stage
managed other Broadway

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.790
and off-Broadway shows.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.920
So our conversation
today is really

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.070
going to be focused on women,
women in the theater industry.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.400
So each of you has had
very successful careers.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.080
We're all thrilled to
have you here today.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.727
So can you each tell us a
little bit about your careers

00:03:36.727 --> 00:03:38.560
and how you came to
where you are today-- so

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.821
a bit about your career path.

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.070
And have there been women
who helped you along the way

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.030
in your careers?

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.830
MELISSA BENOIST: Well,
I feel a bit unqualified

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.270
to talk about being a woman
in the theater industry,

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.140
as I just made my Broadway
debut a month ago.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.170
But I did grow up doing theater.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.540
And it was my passion in life.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.040
I started when I
was four years old,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.330
and Broadway was
always the dream.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.520
And I had many women
that really encouraged

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.190
me and helped me grow.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.730
And each show I would
do, as I was growing up,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.270
you become such a community and
a family in each production.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.970
So yeah, I met a lot
of women along the way.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.949
And one in particular.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.240
I have a godmother who was
my dance teacher growing up,

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.610
who got to come see "Beautiful."

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.950
And she really ushered me
into this as a career choice.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.340
SPEAKER: That's great.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.090
Can you share your
career with us as well?

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.965
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yeah.

00:04:40.965 --> 00:04:43.240
I began my career
in high school.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.450
My senior year of high school
is when I joined "Cats," first

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.869
on tour, and then on Broadway.

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:50.410
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.119
How old were you?

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:52.160
JOYCE CHITTICK: I was 17.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.810
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.000
JOYCE CHITTICK: I finished
high school on the road

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.540
by correspondence the
days before computers.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.420
Yes.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.290
That's how old I am.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.730
So there was no laptop.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.500
I hand wrote all of my papers.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.310
And then I would save
them up, and then

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.650
I would put them in
a FedEx envelope,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.450
and I'd send them to my teacher.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.630
And my dad, I remember one
time, because it'd been a while

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.120
since I'd sent anything.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.360
He wasn't sure that I
was doing my homework

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.020
because I was saving them up
to send them in one big FedEx.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.220
And it was on that tour that
I met Kathleen Marshall, whom

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.780
I've done a lot of shows with.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.620
And so as far as
women go, Kathleen

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.230
has been very instrumental in
giving me many opportunities

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.790
in this Broadway career.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.310
And just like Melissa just said,
since the time I was little,

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.210
this was my dream, Broadway.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.670
I remember seeing a Tony
Awards when I was, like,

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.280
seven or eight years old.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.155
But that was the only
time you could watch it

00:05:58.155 --> 00:06:01.530
because you couldn't rewind,
and you couldn't YouTube it.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.170
And that image of
those Tony Awards

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.590
stuck with me till the next
year when they were on TV.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.097
And it was always my dream goal.

00:06:13.097 --> 00:06:15.430
SPEAKER: Stacey, can you tell
us about your career path?

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.263
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:06:16.263 --> 00:06:20.440
I actually got into theater
and this whole aspect

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.660
of entertainment later
than most people.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.860
It wasn't until college.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.590
I was on a totally
different career path.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.180
And my second year of
college is when I kind of

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.962
had my quarter-life
crisis and decided

00:06:32.962 --> 00:06:34.420
to completely change
what I thought

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.550
I wanted to do my whole life.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.355
SPEAKER: What was
your original plan?

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:40.480
STACEY ZALOGA: I thought
I was going to be pre-med.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.360
And I was following my
dad's footsteps at that time

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.730
and wanted to be a doctor, or
so I thought, since I was nine.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.110
And then I got to college.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.650
And it wasn't going the way
I thought it was going to go.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.860
And I decided to
take four classes

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.930
my second year of
college in anything

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.520
that I was remotely
interested in.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.220
And an introductory to
theater class was one of them

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.861
because my parents had always
brought me to New York.

00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:08.110
They're from New York
originally and would bring me in

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.070
to see Broadway shows.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.762
And I fell in love with
it at an early age,

00:07:11.762 --> 00:07:13.720
but I never, in a million
years, thought that I

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.620
would have a career in it.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.320
So the introductory to
theater was just on a whim.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.550
And I fell in love with it,
and ended up changing schools

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.320
and changing majors.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.840
So by my third year college,
that's when I first started.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.420
And I didn't even know
what a stage manager was.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:35.050
I went to the
University of Kentucky.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.629
And I went to the
theater department.

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:38.170
And they were like,
why are you here?

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.870
And I was like, well,
you know how you

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.320
watch the making of a movie?

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.910
I'm obsessed with that,
like, the behind the scenes,

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:46.450
whatever.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.007
And one of my professors
said, on that very first day

00:07:49.007 --> 00:07:51.340
when I met him, he said, you'd
be a great stage manager.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.780
And I was like, what's that?

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.500
What is that?

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.725
SPEAKER: Do you want
to tell the group what

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:55.250
a stage manager does?

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:56.083
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:07:56.083 --> 00:07:58.420
So as a stage manager--

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.580
well, for instance,
on "Beautiful"

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.720
there are three of us.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.570
And basically, we
are there every day

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.712
to make sure that the
production basically happens.

00:08:07.712 --> 00:08:09.670
One of us is on stage
left every day, one of us

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.310
is on stage right every
day, and the other one of us

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.770
calls the show.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.520
And by calling the
show, that's basically,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.370
we have a script of the entire
show with every light cue

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.790
and every scenic move
that happens in the show.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.800
And any time the
lights change, it's

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.160
because we have said lights 36
go, and someone hits a button.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.750
Any time scenery
moves, it's cause

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.927
we put a warn for a switch
in, and flick the switch off,

00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:33.010
and someone takes the cue.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.350
So in a way, it's kind
of like conducting

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.110
the lights and the scenery.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.890
And we're also responsible for
watching backstage, making sure

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.140
everything's happening the
way it's supposed to happen

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.000
and maintaining the safety
of everyone in the show,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.020
and helping to put new
people into the show,

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.770
and understudy rehearsals,
and maintaining

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.910
the production on a whole.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.080
And we kind of communicate
with every department that's

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.100
involved in a production.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.646
And our tasks vary from
beginning a show, rehearsals,

00:09:01.646 --> 00:09:03.770
through tech, through
actually running of the show.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:07.900
But we're there every
single day doing that.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.400
So yeah.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.900
So when my professor
told me, you'd

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.730
make a great stage
manager, I didn't

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.950
know any of this, of course.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.490
And I had to learn, in
college, what it was.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.270
And they just kind of threw me
on some main stage productions.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.700
And it just was
so natural to me.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:26.260
And we didn't actually have a
stage management class there.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.040
So I just was guided
by my professors.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.579
And especially, with
women, there was the chair

00:09:32.579 --> 00:09:35.120
of our department at the time,
[? Gerri ?] [? Maschio, ?] who

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.220
was probably the most important
woman in my life as far

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.090
as my career goes.

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:45.010
She really guided me along that
process and helped me a lot.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.927
So she's probably the
most instrumental woman.

00:09:46.927 --> 00:09:48.134
SPEAKER: That's really great.

00:09:48.134 --> 00:09:48.850
I think we all--

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.350
especially as women,
in our careers,

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.240
our mentors and our
sponsors are really

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.180
pivotal in helping us
find our career path

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.590
and taking that next step.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.530
So coming back to the
show, "Beautiful,"

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.824
it is centered on one
woman's story and career.

00:10:02.824 --> 00:10:04.240
So can you tell
me how each of you

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.026
feel connected to Carole King's
story and her body of work?

00:10:09.026 --> 00:10:10.002
MELISSA BENOIST: Hm.

00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:11.470
[CHUCKLING]

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.750
JOYCE CHITTICK:
Well, I'll start.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.690
Unlike Stacey, I wasn't here
from the very beginning.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.020
I came in when we began
the national tour.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.540
And I've since gone on and put
together "The Japan Company."

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.220
And now you said
Tony and Grammy,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.930
it's now also a
Helpmann Award winner.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:29.680
SPEAKER: Oh, yeah.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.555
In Australia.

00:10:30.555 --> 00:10:32.180
JOYCE CHITTICK: So
just the other day--

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.830
yes, five Tony awards,
including Best Musical.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:36.610
So I was there.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.840
I helped Marc Bruni put together
the production in Australia.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.050
So I came on board.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.040
And I came to see the show
before I met the choreographer.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.660
And I came by myself, which
I was really glad I did.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.780
And I just wept.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:59.080
And the first time that my
heart strings were pulled

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.920
was when Carole first
sings "Wonderful."

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.910
And I'm a mother now.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.090
And having lived
your life a lot--

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.990
relationships, et cetera,
marriage, children, et cetera--

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.960
there was so much
that spoke to me

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.980
and so many songs
in the show that I

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.310
didn't realize that she wrote.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.910
And they are timeless.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:35.030
And I still, three years
later, watch the show,

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:40.385
and I get teary eyed moments
because it's just human nature,

00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:41.260
you know what I mean?

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.020
And there's so
much joy and heart.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:49.330
And it speaks to everybody.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.200
It really does.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.764
And I was just
instantly drawn to it.

00:11:52.764 --> 00:11:53.680
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.150
I had a very similar experience
watching it for the first time.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:01.870
I hadn't seen it until I knew
I was going to be doing it.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.240
So I watched it
for the first time

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.180
the night before I
started rehearsing.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.160
And I just gave myself
one night to let

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.760
it kind of wash all over me.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.670
And I, essentially, like
washed myself with my tears.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.440
I was crying.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.540
I was weeping.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.750
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yeah.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.690
And in a good way too.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:20.565
MELISSA BENOIST: Yes.

00:12:20.565 --> 00:12:25.650
JOYCE CHITTICK: At the end, like
in such a joyful way, the lyric

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.030
that you get to
sing every night,

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.950
"you've got to wake
up every morning

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.744
with a smile on your
face and show the world

00:12:31.744 --> 00:12:32.910
all the love in your heart."

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:38.070
And in our world today, I
think that that sentence just

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:39.240
speaks volumes.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.280
And that's what we
need in our lives is

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.414
to show people the love
that we have and the care.

00:12:44.414 --> 00:12:45.330
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.940
And that's really what is
so beautiful about Carole,

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.370
and why she is
this living legend.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.545
Because she lives that way.

00:12:54.545 --> 00:12:55.920
JOYCE CHITTICK:
Have you met her?

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.790
MELISSA BENOIST: She
really does-- no.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:57.347
I haven't.

00:12:57.347 --> 00:12:58.430
SPEAKER: Have you met her?

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.720
STACEY ZALOGA: I've met
her several times now.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:00.360
Yeah.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.568
JOYCE CHITTICK: I've met her.

00:13:01.568 --> 00:13:02.600
And she is full of life.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.480
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.040
JOYCE CHITTICK: She has more
energy, I think, than all of us

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.700
right here put together.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:05.820
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:06.305
Oh, yeah.

00:13:06.305 --> 00:13:06.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.605
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yeah.

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:08.350
She does.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.724
STACEY ZALOGA:
She's exactly what

00:13:09.724 --> 00:13:11.850
you want her to be and more.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.940
And the expectations of what you
think she's going to be, like--

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.080
JOYCE CHITTICK: It's no wonder
these melodies came from her.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.130
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.921
JOYCE CHITTICK: They
just emanate from her.

00:13:21.921 --> 00:13:22.890
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.410
SPEAKER: And so did any
of you know her music

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.072
or love her music
before the show?

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.280
STACEY ZALOGA: Oh, of course.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:28.780
Yeah.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.190
Yeah, the "Tapestry" album,
probably for all of us

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.860
was my mom's favorite
album of all time.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.160
And it became one of
mine, as a child too,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:39.970
because my mom loved it so much.

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.922
And I remember on road trips,
we'd have our CD collection.

00:13:42.922 --> 00:13:44.130
And what do we listen to now?

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:46.421
And I would always be like,
Carole King time, let's go.

00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:48.450
Let's put "Tapestry" on.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.040
So it was very
special to me too.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.860
And I remember when I got this
job too, and I was so excited,

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.440
and I told my mom
all about the show.

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.120
But I didn't tell her
what it was first.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.078
And she was so excited.

00:13:58.078 --> 00:14:01.249
Then I go, do you want
to know what it's called?

00:14:01.249 --> 00:14:02.040
And she goes, yeah.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.329
And I go, "Beautiful,
the Carole King Musical,"

00:14:04.329 --> 00:14:05.370
and she just freaked out.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:08.012
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:08.012 --> 00:14:09.720
SPEAKER: Did your mom
get to meet Carole?

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.060
STACEY ZALOGA: My mom
actually has met Carole.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:14.850
When Carole did "The
Today Show" with us

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:19.320
once with Chilina and Abby right
before Abby went out on tour,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.390
my mom happened to be
visiting me in the city.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.660
And I wasn't supposed to
go to that press event.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.660
Other people were going.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.640
And I was, like, I don't know,
do you want to roll out of bed

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.210
and go over there?

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.770
And she was like,
if I don't, I'll

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:29.910
regret it for the
rest of my life.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.870
So we did, and we went.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.670
And I got to introduce Carole
to my mom really quickly.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:36.090
JOYCE CHITTICK: Carole needs
to get here before you go.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.090
MELISSA BENOIST: I know.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:37.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.590
I hope I get to meet her.

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.500
I don't want to know if she's
in the audience until after.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.484
But I hope to meet her.

00:14:44.484 --> 00:14:45.726
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:45.726 --> 00:14:47.642
JOYCE CHITTICK: It's a
little bit of pressure.

00:14:47.642 --> 00:14:49.312
STACEY ZALOGA: That's
a lot of pressure.

00:14:49.312 --> 00:14:51.270
SPEAKER: Joyce, can you
tell us about your role

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.040
as associate choreographer
and what that entails?

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.730
JOYCE CHITTICK: So I
maintain all the movement

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:01.710
in the show for the Broadway
company and the national tour.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.640
So it involves various things--

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.910
auditions, finding,
helping the casting people,

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.800
find people that are
right for the show,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.410
teaching them the movement,
working with them.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:17.220
When we hire people,
I'm the person

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.604
that initially works
with them and teaches

00:15:19.604 --> 00:15:20.520
them all the movement.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.550
And when I say,
"teach the movement,"

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.110
we're working with people
that are not dancers first.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.820
They're singers.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.530
This is a singer's show.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.510
And so a lot of
times we have found

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.720
people that are phenomenal
talents, that their voices are

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.180
incredible, but they're not
confident in their movement.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:42.690
And so I come in
and I help them find

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.290
that confidence and their
natural movement abilities

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.640
and sort of help show them
that it's not about five,

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.390
six, seven, eight.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.520
It's about the feeling
of the movement,

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.300
and where it comes
from within you.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.600
So that's sort of my main goal.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:02.460
And to keep it fresh--

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.037
like I said, because we're
now how many years running?

00:16:06.037 --> 00:16:06.870
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.550
4 and 1/2 I guess now, yeah.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.670
JOYCE CHITTICK: I'm not
about, here's the steps,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.410
and you have to do
it just like this.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.620
Sometimes I'll not
change the choreography,

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.830
but just find how it
works on their bodies

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:24.770
and keeping it exciting and
passionate from each performer.

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.520
SPEAKER: And Joyce,
is this very different

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:29.280
than other shows you've
worked on that maybe,

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:32.367
if this is more of a singer's
show than a dancer's show,

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.950
has your approach had to be very
different than on other shows

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:36.779
that are more dance-oriented?

00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:38.070
JOYCE CHITTICK: Very different.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:42.300
And you say my 20-plus career--

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.050
I began dance captaining
when I was 20,

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.330
with "Tommy" on Broadway.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.840
And throughout my
course of my career,

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.100
I have worked with so many
different abilities, and ages,

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.270
and body types.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.440
And you have to
find each person.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.940
What's going to
work for one person

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.660
doesn't work for another.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:08.910
And your approach is different
with singers than it is

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.500
for somebody who has spent a
lot of time in front of a mirror

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.630
learning how to plié
and hold their arms.

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.275
And when I do have people
that come into the show that

00:17:17.275 --> 00:17:18.650
have had a lot of
dance training,

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.720
it's a completely
different approach

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.710
of how you work with
them versus the singers.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.700
In Australia and
Japan, for example,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.490
I had a couple guys that had
never done musical theater.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.620
One was, like, a gospel singer,
and the other, in Australia,

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:36.590
he was this Jazz singer.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:41.260
And they're comfortable
singing, but yet, as soon

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.060
as you teach them
choreography, this fear of God

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.780
comes over them.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:50.150
And so it's taking that
fear away from them

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.800
and getting them to realize that
what we're doing is so simple.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.465
And you do it when you're
fooling around in your shower,

00:17:57.465 --> 00:17:58.340
you know what I mean?

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:03.224
But then when suddenly it's
those five, six, seven,

00:18:03.224 --> 00:18:05.390
eight come out of a mouth,
everybody goes like this.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:07.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.380
SPEAKER: So each of you
shared that Broadway

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:10.480
was a dream of yours.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.390
It was a consistent
theme for each of you.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.490
So can you share how each of
you began your Broadway journey

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.420
and how you came to
work with "Beautiful?"

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.590
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.330
It's weird because I feel
like, in this business,

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.860
a lot of the jobs that I've
gotten, 90% of the time

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.840
has been because
of the job prior,

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.587
because I knew somebody that
led me to somebody else.

00:18:37.587 --> 00:18:39.670
JOYCE CHITTICK: I was there
for Stacy's first job.

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:41.020
STACEY ZALOGA: That's true.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:47.810
We met 15 years ago on a
production of "The Boyfriend"

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:48.980
that Julie Andrews--

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.570
it was her directorial debut
out at Bay Street Theater

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.500
out on Long Island.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.820
And I was an intern then.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.390
But Bay Street used interns as
the assistant stage managers.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.292
So even though I hadn't
joined the union yet,

00:19:01.292 --> 00:19:03.750
I still was the assistant stage
manager on that production.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.670
SPEAKER: Was it an
unpaid internship?

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:07.710
STACEY ZALOGA: It
was paid, but "paid."

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.130
Yeah.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.490
JOYCE CHITTICK: Housing.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.080
STACEY ZALOGA: Grunt money,
housing, they give you housing.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.560
That was like a
very small, $100--

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.170
I don't even remember--
maybe $200 at most a week,

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.250
or maybe not even that.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:23.270
But that's what a lot of
production assistant and intern

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.210
jobs are at first until you
actually do get into the union

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.730
and get union jobs.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.200
So my career kind of
took off after that

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.580
show because the scenic
and costume designer was

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.581
Tony Walton who used to be
married to Julie Andrews years

00:19:41.581 --> 00:19:42.080
ago.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.240
And they had a daughter Emma
who actually, at the time,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.531
was running Bay Street Theater.

00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:47.819
And I started working
for him after that

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:49.610
as a personal assistant
for a little while.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.670
But one of the questions
he asked me was,

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:52.920
what do you really want to do?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.380
And I said, I really want
to be a stage manager.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.296
And he said, I think I
can help you with that.

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:59.480
So he introduced me to
an amazing stage manager

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.670
named Peter Lawrence who got me
my first sub job on "Spamalot,"

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.430
and then my first full
time show, which was "Shrek

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.760
the Musical," and then things
just kind of progressed

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.810
from there.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:15.830
But this job is actually
different in that I reached out

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.760
to our production stage
manager, Peter Hanson.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.525
And I just, on a whim, started
reaching out to some people,

00:20:23.525 --> 00:20:25.400
just saying, hey, can
I have coffee with you?

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.350
And he met me for coffee.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.690
And then a year later,
he hired me to work

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.290
on a workshop production.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.787
And then another year
later, this job came up,

00:20:35.787 --> 00:20:37.370
and he just called
me out of the blue.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:41.750
And that had gone so well that
he asked me to do this with him

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:43.587
and Johnny [? Kraus, ?]
his assistant.

00:20:43.587 --> 00:20:45.420
And they've been working
together for years.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.200
So yeah, Peter and Johnny
have been working together

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.830
for 20-plus years together.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.969
And I was new to their
team and got to join them.

00:20:52.969 --> 00:20:55.010
And the three of us just
worked so well together.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:56.970
So it was kind of a perfect fit.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.360
SPEAKER: And how'd you
come to "Beautiful?"

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.030
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:06.410
Because I had worked with them
on a prior two-week-long thing,

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.510
and Johnny really liked
me from that moment,

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.610
when they were looking
for an assistant,

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:12.710
they really wanted to
have a woman, actually,

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.970
as their third team member
just because, A, they

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.130
like working with
women, and they also

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:22.430
just like having the team
kind of be balanced that way.

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:27.920
So Peter always says, sometimes
other women in the show

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.120
like to talk to women.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.180
And so it's kind of nice to have
the team have a variety of men

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.230
and women and stuff.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.590
So yeah, and then we just
started working on the show

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:38.090
together.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:43.539
And it was my first time working
with them on beginning a show.

00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:45.330
I mean, they had worked
together for years.

00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:46.860
But I had just joined in.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.650
So trying to find
the balance of how

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:50.850
I fit in this team
with the two of them.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:55.271
And it just worked really well,
and we all get along so well.

00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:57.020
That's why all three
of us are still there

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.350
because we enjoy
working together.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.516
JOYCE CHITTICK: That's rare.

00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:01.570
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah,
it's very rare actually.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.420
Yeah.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.970
SPEAKER: And Joyce, you
started your career at 17.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:05.960
JOYCE CHITTICK: At 17.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.350
And then that led me to the
Broadway company of "Cats."

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.330
And as I mentioned
earlier, Kathleen Marshall

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.160
was one of the dance
captains on tour with "Cats,"

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.720
and she taught me the show.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.040
So that friendship began there.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.980
And when I moved to
New York to do "Cats,"

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.290
I pounded the pavement
the old fashioned way,

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.950
picking up a paper backstage.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:30.390
I didn't have an agent.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.460
I went to those open calls.

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:38.130
And you would go check
your answering service.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.900
Mine was Bells are Ringing.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.579
And I think my box
number was, like, 312.

00:22:43.579 --> 00:22:45.120
And you'd go to a
payphone, and you'd

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.500
see if you had a callback.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.620
And one thing led to
another, and I just

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.720
kept working going
from show to show

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.840
and became a dance captain
very early on, like I said,

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.680
with "Tommy."

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.100
And that sort of led
a parallel career.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.440
I was a career as a
performer, but then I

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.740
was always sort of juggling
this other side of myself

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.630
as a dance captain.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.500
And Marc Bruni and I
have known each other--

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.690
my gosh, how long now--

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:13.956
over a decade.

00:23:13.956 --> 00:23:15.330
We've done several
shows together

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:17.310
when he was an associate.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:21.570
And I did at production at
Encore of "Paint Your Wagon."

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.210
I was the associate
for Dennis Jones.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.940
And they were
looking for somebody

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.350
in this position
for "Beautiful."

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:33.030
And Marc recommended me to
the choreographer, since Marc

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.910
and I had worked together in
"Grease," and other shows,

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.410
putting people into
shows and stuff.

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.880
So that's how I
came to "Beautiful."

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.100
SPEAKER: People
looking out for you.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.200
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.700
SPEAKER: And Melissa,
how about you?

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.684
Can you tell us about
your career path,

00:23:44.684 --> 00:23:46.350
how you started your
career, and how you

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.150
came to work on "Beautiful?"

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.200
MELISSA BENOIST: Well,
I knew, like I said,

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.120
Broadway was my dream.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.420
So I came to New York City to
go to college on the Upper East

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.330
Side at Marymount
Manhattan College

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.460
to get a degree in acting.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.890
And Broadway and
the stage was kind

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:11.740
of the only arena I thought
I was going to pursue.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.660
And then I started
doing episodic work

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.160
because almost every actor,
at one point or another,

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.140
gets an episode of
"Law and Order."

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.019
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:23.019 --> 00:24:23.685
It's inevitable.

00:24:23.685 --> 00:24:24.518
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:24:24.518 --> 00:24:25.325
You've made it.

00:24:25.325 --> 00:24:26.700
JOYCE CHITTICK:
Or more multiple.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.030
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.650
I've done two.

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:30.630
I did "SVU" and an episode
of "Criminal Intent"

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.280
before that show
went off the air.

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:39.970
But I really enjoyed
how different it was.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.080
And so that's sort of where my
path into television and film

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:43.620
started.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.580
And that was really
unexpected and really did

00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.990
kind of take me away
from theater for a bit.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:52.440
But I was doing the same--
pounding the pavement

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:57.150
and going to open
calls and running

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.120
and having three auditions a day
and not really getting anywhere

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:05.850
in theater and doing a few
regional things here and there.

00:25:05.850 --> 00:25:08.850
And then I got "Glee," which
I was very fortunate to do

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:12.700
and kind of involved my
love of musical theater.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.120
But it took me to the
opposite side of the country.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.470
And then things kind of
snowballed after that.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:25.590
But I was always wanting to come
back to stage and to New York

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.470
because I just love
being in this city.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.040
And I feel like myself on stage.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.490
So I was constantly pestering
my agents and my managers,

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.090
like, guys, I really
want to do theater.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.080
And they'd be like,
yeah, yeah, OK, OK.

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.850
And then this kind of came
about because Chilina Kennedy,

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:50.550
she got a show at the
Atlantic Theater Company,

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.010
and they needed someone in
the interim for two months

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.550
before Abby Mueller came back.

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.790
And it sort of just fit
into this tiny little slot

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:01.890
on my hiatus of
"Supergirl." and?

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.930
I was planning on doing nothing.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.600
SPEAKER: Your summer vacation
is working eight shows a week.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:08.786
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:26:08.786 --> 00:26:09.286
It did.

00:26:09.286 --> 00:26:11.520
And I couldn't be
happier that it did.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.020
I wouldn't have
forgiven myself if I

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:15.750
didn't take this opportunity.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.800
And it's sort of like
a dream come true.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.280
And I'm turning 30 this year.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.917
And my childhood dream,
cheesily, came true this year.

00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:25.417
SPEAKER: Aw.

00:26:25.417 --> 00:26:27.299
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:29.340
STACEY ZALOGA: We've had
a lot of Broadway debuts

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:29.990
on our show too.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.350
It's fantastic.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.470
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.280
STACEY ZALOGA: It's fantastic.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.960
The energy when that happens--

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.464
and Melissa joined and so
many other people that have--

00:26:36.464 --> 00:26:38.630
JOYCE CHITTICK: A lot of
our drifters and Shirelles.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.921
STACEY ZALOGA: --had their
Broadway debuts on our show.

00:26:40.921 --> 00:26:43.950
We just added another,
Shirelle just recently

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.259
that she also joined the
union and Broadway debut.

00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:48.300
MELISSA BENOIST: She got
her actor's equity card?

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.270
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yeah, she did.

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:49.890
MELISSA BENOIST:
Oh, that's awesome.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:50.340
JOYCE CHITTICK:
And the other day

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.820
when we were working on
the stage for the first day

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.440
on stage, she said,
oh, a thing came up,

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.910
a memory on my Facebook.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.040
Seven years ago, I was
doing an internship,

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.540
and I was making $50 a week.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.520
MELISSA BENOIST: Oh.

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.895
JOYCE CHITTICK:
And now, here she

00:27:02.895 --> 00:27:05.040
was, standing on her
Broadway debut stage.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.850
MELISSA BENOIST: That's amazing.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.880
STACEY ZALOGA: That makes it
so fun when that happens too.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.255
SPEAKER: Melissa,
can you tell us

00:27:09.255 --> 00:27:12.680
about stage acting
and screen acting,

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.377
and what the
differences are, and how

00:27:15.377 --> 00:27:16.460
you approach each of them?

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.090
And does working on both
help you hone your craft?

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:24.890
MELISSA BENOIST: They're so
different to the point where

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:31.460
I hadn't been on stage in
almost six years before I

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.470
got this opportunity.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:35.270
And I would be in
rehearsals with Shelley,

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.682
one of our associate directors.

00:27:37.682 --> 00:27:39.140
And she'd be like,
I think you just

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.976
need to speak up a little more.

00:27:40.976 --> 00:27:42.100
And I'd be like, oh, sorry.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.040
I have to get back into this.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.290
There are totally different
skill sets and muscles

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:48.580
that you have to flex.

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.270
And it's hard.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.600
It's a different way of
conveying your emotions.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:02.000
It's a different scale of
energy that you expend.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.150
And it also depends
on whatever project

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.120
you're working on because,
working on "Glee,"

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.830
I could be a little more
theatrical and presentational.

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.380
But then, things
like, I've worked

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.059
on the movie, "Whiplash."

00:28:17.059 --> 00:28:19.100
And that had to be so
subtle that I almost didn't

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.520
feel like I was doing anything.

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:23.960
You just kind of
had to feel and hope

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.170
that it was translating somehow.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.820
And I don't prefer
one or the other.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.850
They're both challenging
in their own respect.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:38.301
But yeah, it's a really
different approach.

00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:40.550
SPEAKER: Do you hope to
continue spending your summers

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.960
on the stage in some capacity?

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.400
MELISSA BENOIST: Oh,
my gosh, of course.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:43.820
Yes.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:44.660
JOYCE CHITTICK: Are
you going to come back?

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.070
MELISSA BENOIST: I hope so.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.360
I would love to.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.860
SPEAKER: So can you
all tell us what

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.110
has been the most surprising
thing about working

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.750
on Broadway?

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.941
So each of you has dreamed
about this since you were young.

00:28:55.941 --> 00:28:58.190
Are there things that are
different than you expected?

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.480
JOYCE CHITTICK: Well,
when you're little,

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.837
and you don't realize that
it's eight shows a week.

00:29:06.837 --> 00:29:09.170
MELISSA BENOIST: I was just
going to say the same thing.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:10.790
Yeah, eight shows
is a big number.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.456
JOYCE CHITTICK: It's
eight shows a week,

00:29:12.456 --> 00:29:13.840
week, after week, after week.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.049
But then, to remember that the
audience, maybe there are fans,

00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:19.340
and they come and see it a lot.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.381
But the audience is seeing
it for the first time.

00:29:21.381 --> 00:29:26.030
And you've got to make
it fresh every time.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.810
And so you've got to find
that passion within you

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:33.160
every night to not just phone
it in, not just press autopilot.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.410
And I know, for myself, with
all the shows that I have done,

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.500
I would sort of hit a
year mark with a show.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.100
And I would be like, I can't
do this eight times a week

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.720
anymore, week after week.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:49.390
But I also was always teaching
the shows most of the time.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.700
I was, not only
physically performing it,

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.880
but I was always teaching
one track or another.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.800
And keeping it fresh,
it's a hard thing

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.460
to do week after week.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:08.110
And being a dancer, what
it has done to my body,

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.990
you know what I mean-- like
the aches and the pains

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.970
from doing that
repetitive motion.

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.010
MELISSA BENOIST: Mm-hmm.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:14.750
SPEAKER: Stacey, how about you?

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:15.880
What surprised you?

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.530
STACEY ZALOGA: I
would second the time

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.450
commitment that it takes.

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:22.330
And I think the hardest
part for everyone,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.560
and it's something that
we all talk about a lot

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.020
backstage is the
fact that we miss out

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.399
on a lot of other
family life events.

00:30:31.399 --> 00:30:32.440
JOYCE CHITTICK: Holidays.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.898
STACEY ZALOGA: In
order to do this.

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:37.550
Holidays, we work holidays.

00:30:37.550 --> 00:30:41.410
Everyone's normal weekend,
generally, is Friday to Sunday,

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:42.620
and that's our busiest time.

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.660
We generally do five shows.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.940
I've missed weddings,
friends' weddings and events.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.440
And we get occasional time
off, but it's limited,

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.100
and it's hard.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.560
Especially, the
holidays are hard.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.214
And to have our families
understand why sometimes, I

00:30:59.214 --> 00:31:00.130
can't make it to that.

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.530
I really wish I
could, but I can't.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:06.770
That's probably the
hardest part of the job.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:10.330
But it's so rewarding too.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:14.200
I find, when I do talk to
family and friends outside,

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.910
they just want to ask me so
many questions about, oh, what

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:17.410
do you do?

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.440
That must be so cool.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.050
And I find myself, the day to
day sometimes is exhausting.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.970
But I do have moments
backstage all the time

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:28.180
where I'm like, this is so cool
that I do this for a living.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.140
Like, this is my job.

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:30.134
Like, they pay us.

00:31:30.134 --> 00:31:32.800
I had a surreal moment the other
day when one of our hair people

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.591
was walking around with
like wigs on heads,

00:31:34.591 --> 00:31:36.960
I was, like, this is our day.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.010
This is our life.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:40.100
We get paid to come
here and do this.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:45.530
And our building has been
such a special family feeling.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:49.482
Everybody that comes in is just
another member of the family.

00:31:49.482 --> 00:31:51.190
And it's been such a
happy place to work.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.660
MELISSA BENOIST: It's
a very good group.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.070
JOYCE CHITTICK: Very good.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.330
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:54.890
They're going to have to drag
me out of that building one day,

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:57.480
because I'm not leaving
until they make me.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.970
SPEAKER: And having worked on
so many different shows, this

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:02.720
is just one you
just don't tire of.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:03.190
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.485
SPEAKER: You don't
tire of this music.

00:32:04.485 --> 00:32:05.318
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:32:05.318 --> 00:32:06.850
The music never gets old, ever.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.725
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yeah.

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:09.979
And the joy of it.

00:32:09.979 --> 00:32:12.520
I've been a part of shows that
you don't have that experience

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.600
every night.

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.540
And you're battling
to stay running,

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:18.760
and you're like, oh, the
audience weren't there.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.980
They didn't like it.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.330
They weren't engaged in it.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.730
But this is one of those
shows that you just

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.956
take people on a journey,
and it's a joyful one.

00:32:26.956 --> 00:32:27.956
MELISSA BENOIST: Mm-hmm.

00:32:27.956 --> 00:32:29.455
SPEAKER: Melissa,
how about for you?

00:32:29.455 --> 00:32:31.270
So one month in on Broadway.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.650
It's still fresh for you.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.139
What's been most surprising?

00:32:34.139 --> 00:32:35.680
MELISSA BENOIST:
Well, I think what's

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:39.970
been surprising is very similar
to what Joyce was saying.

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:44.320
Because I was coming into this
like, oh, eight shows a week,

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.970
yeah, It's a lot.

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:50.260
But I'm used to working 16
hour days on "Supergirl"

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:54.010
and being in a spandex
suit and a leather cape

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.617
for 15 of those hours.

00:32:56.617 --> 00:32:57.700
SPEAKER: Under hot lights.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:58.616
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:32:58.616 --> 00:33:00.610
And that's an exhausting
job, and it really

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:01.600
takes a lot out of me.

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.327
But-- so I think
I underestimated.

00:33:05.327 --> 00:33:06.160
I underestimated it.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:12.280
And this is the difference too
between television and stage

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.310
acting is the audience.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:16.480
There's nothing like that.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.030
And it is kind of
stereotypical to say,

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.100
but it changes everything.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:25.090
And it requires so much
more focus and energy.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.775
And you really have to mean
it because they can see it.

00:33:28.775 --> 00:33:30.900
JOYCE CHITTICK: And you
take a journey every night.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:31.210
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:32.230
JOYCE CHITTICK: You
ride that full arc.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.229
MELISSA BENOIST: You have
to go there with them.

00:33:34.229 --> 00:33:38.990
And it's more exhausting to me
than "Supergirl" has ever been

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.354
and in a very fulfilling way.

00:33:41.354 --> 00:33:43.270
So that is something
that's been surprising to

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:49.260
me is the time commitment
and how much of my soul

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.469
I bear every night.

00:33:50.469 --> 00:33:52.510
JOYCE CHITTICK: And even
though you're exhausted,

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:54.810
when you receive that
love from the audience,

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:57.230
you probably-- it takes a few
hours to go to bed at night,

00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.730
right?

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:58.210
MELISSA BENOIST: Oh, my gosh.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:58.460
I'm wired.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.130
JOYCE CHITTICK:
You're on a high.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.635
Even though you're
exhausted, you're on a high.

00:34:00.635 --> 00:34:02.540
MELISSA BENOIST: I am
starving, and I'm--

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.390
I can't sleep.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.980
JOYCE CHITTICK: But
you're exhausted.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:07.855
MELISSA BENOIST: Yes.

00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:10.239
JOYCE CHITTICK:
It's the best drug.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:10.359
MELISSA BENOIST: Yes.

00:34:10.359 --> 00:34:10.400
Totally.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.590
JOYCE CHITTICK: Seriously.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.210
STACEY ZALOGA: I mean, I still
get goosebumps every night

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.221
during the curtain
call, especially when

00:34:15.221 --> 00:34:16.679
whoever's playing
Carole comes out,

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:22.320
and that audience just
goes crazy every night.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.110
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:26.020
So over the past few
years, representation

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.190
in Broadway, theater has become
more important than ever.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.110
And this includes
bringing more women

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:36.229
into the spotlight, as well as
more women behind the scenes.

00:34:36.229 --> 00:34:38.020
So we're seeing more
and more opportunities

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.150
for women in the industry.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.800
So what have you been noticing,
from your perspectives,

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.330
as members of the theater
community and the TV community?

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:49.510
And are you seeing more
of this positive change?

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.126
STACEY ZALOGA: Definitely.

00:34:51.126 --> 00:34:53.250
I've talked to Peter and
Johnny, the stage managers

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:57.520
that I work with, and
they say, 15 years ago, it

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.220
was all a male-dominated field,
stage management, generally.

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:05.270
And he goes and teaches
a lot to classrooms

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.870
and is seeing now,
in the colleges,

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.510
the stage management
groups, he says, are now,

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:13.430
it's almost all women in the
classrooms and very few men

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.930
now.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:15.346
And I definitely
feel like there's

00:35:15.346 --> 00:35:18.910
been a shift, especially
in my department

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.445
over the last 15 or so years.

00:35:20.445 --> 00:35:21.820
MELISSA BENOIST:
That's exciting.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:22.390
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah,
it's really cool.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:23.020
SPEAKER: That's
great, especially

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.590
for the more technical
side of theater.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:24.780
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.140
Because there aren't a lot.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.730
And even on our show, we now
have a sound person woman,

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:31.300
Kate.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.890
And Josie's backstage,
and there's more women.

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:38.604
But especially the crew is
definitely more male-dominated,

00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:41.020
but definitely, we're starting
to infiltrate a little bit.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:41.460
[GIGGLING]

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:41.586
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:35:41.586 --> 00:35:43.420
And here at Google,
we're very invested

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:46.790
in getting women more involved
in the technical side,

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.490
and investing in
girls, and helping

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:49.820
them learn to code as well.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.340
So it's great to
see that there's

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:54.980
a similar shift happening on
the technical side of theater

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.824
as well.

00:35:56.824 --> 00:35:58.240
Is there any advice
that you would

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.270
like to give women or
girls who aspire to be

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:04.259
part of the theater community?

00:36:04.259 --> 00:36:05.425
STACEY ZALOGA: Oh, goodness.

00:36:10.526 --> 00:36:12.760
JOYCE CHITTICK: I mean,
it's a different day and age

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.320
now from when I began.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.120
I mean, this social media--

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.160
I mean, here we are in Google.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.250
Social media is
just everything now.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:26.830
But I think that's great, and
I think it's a great tool.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.290
But I think that
there's nothing like

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:34.000
the good old fashioned hard
work of taking those classes.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.550
And not just, oh, yeah, my video
looks great, don't I look good?

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:43.090
But no, can you do that
eight times a week?

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.200
Can you sustain that?

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:49.884
And if this is what you want to
do, it has to be your passion.

00:36:49.884 --> 00:36:50.800
STACEY ZALOGA: Mm-hmm.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.955
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:36:51.955 --> 00:36:53.540
JOYCE CHITTICK: You
have to love it.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:54.070
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:54.960
It's too hard otherwise.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.010
JOYCE CHITTICK: It is
an emotional roller

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.490
coaster at times.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:57.760
STACEY ZALOGA: It really is.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.843
Never knowing when your
next job is going to come,

00:36:59.843 --> 00:37:01.630
how long it's going to last.

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:02.237
It's a grind.

00:37:02.237 --> 00:37:03.070
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yes.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.130
It is a grind.

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:10.000
But if you love something,
then invest everything

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.060
you have in yourself to do it.

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:17.410
And the people along the
way that you may think

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:21.460
may not mean anything
sometimes, those

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:25.750
are going to be the people that
will call you up and say, OK,

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:26.980
or recommend you.

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.220
And I would never have
thought I'd be here,

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.030
but it was my relationship with
Marc Bruni that led me here.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:39.147
I didn't know the
choreographer before this job.

00:37:39.147 --> 00:37:41.230
MELISSA BENOIST: That's
kind of what I would think

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:46.360
is advice that I would
have liked to have heard.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.870
I think the more you
give, as a person,

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:51.760
it's returned to
you in abundance,

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.140
especially with kindness,
and especially with listening

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:59.460
and taking the time to get to
know the people you work with

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:05.020
and sharing the experience
and really remaining present

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.590
and being where you
are in that moment.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:10.240
And you're right.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.290
It pays off.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:15.560
And it's always in the
most unexpected ways.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:21.732
And also, I think this show
kind of exemplifies that too.

00:38:21.732 --> 00:38:23.440
Because we take this
journey every night,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:27.310
and with Carole kind of finding
ownership of who she is,

00:38:27.310 --> 00:38:29.720
and really embracing
herself as an artist.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.720
And I think, if you want
to do this as a career,

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:36.490
you really have to find
that inner light in yourself

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:41.200
to follow it and to really
just be true to who you are.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.400
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.010
So this has been a really
challenging and eye-opening

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:48.130
year for women in the
entertainment industry

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.890
with the Me Too and the
Time's Up movements.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.410
Scores of women have spoken
out about sexual assault

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:55.570
and harassment in the
entertainment industry.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.670
And through the Times
Up movement, there's

00:38:57.670 --> 00:39:00.030
been a focus on
workplace equality

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.340
and creating economic
opportunities

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.510
and fair pay for women.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.210
So what have your
experiences been, as women,

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:09.660
during this watershed moment
in the entertainment industry?

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.220
And have you or other women
you know or have worked

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.644
with overcome challenges?

00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:16.560
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.720
And it's ongoing.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.550
I do have to say, though,
joining this company,

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.910
I've not felt anything,
but just warmth and love.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:36.030
And this particular company,
from what I've seen,

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.610
you guys have it figured out.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:45.520
And everyone is just on
the same playing field.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.430
That's what I've experienced.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:54.690
It's been a stressful
year and a frustrating one

00:39:54.690 --> 00:40:00.060
in many respects concerning
Time's Up and Me Too,

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.160
but also very uplifting.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.500
And specifically,
on "Supergirl,"

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.645
I do see things
changing every day.

00:40:06.645 --> 00:40:09.090
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.840
MELISSA BENOIST: And it's a
male-dominated field, the crew,

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.110
for a television series,
but we're hiring more women.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:19.380
And we're trying to get
more female directors.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.766
And it's always a part of
the conversation, every day,

00:40:22.766 --> 00:40:24.390
that we're putting
something out there.

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.098
We're like, OK, well,
what are we saying?

00:40:26.098 --> 00:40:27.780
And what does this
have to relate to?

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.630
How will women and young
girls, specifically,

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:32.280
take this and internalize it?

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.700
And how will this
make them feel?

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.830
And what are we saying and
adding to the conversation?

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:39.330
A day does not go
by that I don't

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:40.710
think about what's happening.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.110
SPEAKER: Especially
portraying a character

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:47.520
that girls are looking up to.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.400
So are you thinking about
things like the writing,

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.230
and what is your
role portraying?

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.660
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah,
absolutely, and making sure

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:04.410
that women believe that they
can have parity and equality.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:08.940
And we call ourselves more
humanist than we are feminist

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:11.880
because we are
feminists as well,

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.190
but humanists-- we just think
everyone deserves to be equal,

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.980
no matter what
sexuality, no matter

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:21.870
what gender, no matter where you
come from, your race, anything.

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:25.350
So yeah, it is definitely a
part of our conversations.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:26.241
SPEAKER: Great.

00:41:26.241 --> 00:41:27.990
At this point, we'd
like to welcome people

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:32.255
to come up to the microphones,
if you have any questions,

00:41:32.255 --> 00:41:33.900
So feel free to
come up to the mics.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.510
And I'll continue with
questions as well.

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.510
Melissa, you are involved
in a mental health awareness

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.375
movement called IDON'TMIND.

00:41:41.375 --> 00:41:44.830
That works to put a stop to the
stigma around mental illnesses.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.550
How did you come to be involved
in IDON'TMIND, and what are you

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:48.810
hoping to achieve?

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.860
MELISSA BENOIST: Well,
my boyfriend, Chris Wood,

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:56.130
he has had the idea to start
this for the past five years

00:41:56.130 --> 00:42:02.020
because he, sadly, lost his
father due to mental illness.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.200
So it's very near and
dear to his heart.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.270
It means a lot to
him because I think

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:09.300
he felt things might have gone
differently if there wasn't

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:14.370
such a stigma around dealing
with it or getting people help

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:17.110
or talking about it.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.360
And he grew up in the Midwest.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:24.930
So I think it is different
in many different places.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.370
So he wanted to start it.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:30.320
And I think everyone
in this room,

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.740
maybe, either knows someone
or experience it yourself,

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.190
and none of us are immune to it.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:41.880
Our brains are very delicate,
and fragile, and complicated

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:42.510
things.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.210
And we both, Chris
and I, believe

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.302
that you should
take care of them

00:42:47.302 --> 00:42:49.260
the way you take care of
the rest of your body,

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.330
the way you go to a gym to
take care of your health,

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:55.230
you should go to a
therapist or a counselor

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.790
to take care of your mind.

00:42:57.790 --> 00:42:59.280
And it's not a shameful thing.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.040
So I've been really involved
in helping him come up

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.490
with who we want to target--

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:07.410
young people--
but anyone really.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.330
And just get people
talking about the way they

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:13.974
feel with each other and being
open to listen and be there

00:43:13.974 --> 00:43:15.390
when someone needs
a helping hand.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:16.050
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:17.092
And opening the dialogue.

00:43:17.092 --> 00:43:18.008
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:43:18.008 --> 00:43:18.860
Absolutely.

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.485
SPEAKER: Great.

00:43:19.485 --> 00:43:21.280
Let's take a question here.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.080
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.880
Thank you all for coming.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.620
This question's for Melissa.

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.830
I was wondering, as you
were preparing for this role

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:32.160
to play Carole
King, how much did

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.940
you prepare to sing in your
own voice versus impersonating

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.800
Carole King's voice?

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.170
MELISSA BENOIST: Well, I
met with our music director,

00:43:40.170 --> 00:43:45.000
Jason Howland, a couple of weeks
before I got into rehearsals

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.780
just to sing through the music
and to learn some of the piano

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:48.990
bits.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:50.940
And the first
thing he said to me

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.740
was, we don't want this
to be an impersonation.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.000
It's not you mimicking her.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.320
It's not any of that.

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.080
But listen to her music.

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.490
Don't listen to Jessie Mueller.

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:03.260
Don't listen to
Chilina's versions.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:13.880
Listen to Carole, and just
try to infuse just her aura,

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.680
if you can.

00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:17.960
So that's all I did,
really, was I would just

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.380
listen nonstop on
repeat to "Tapestry,"

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.770
and her versions of the
songs that I was singing.

00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:26.750
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.304
SPEAKER: And Melissa, you
played piano before the show?

00:44:29.304 --> 00:44:30.470
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah, I do.

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:34.372
I cannot play like Carole,
but I did play piano, yeah.

00:44:34.372 --> 00:44:36.080
SPEAKER: So was that
challenging to learn

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.799
to play piano as Carole
on the stage as part

00:44:40.799 --> 00:44:41.840
of the rehearsal process?

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:42.350
MELISSA BENOIST: Yes.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:44.516
Essentially, it was the
thing I was the most nervous

00:44:44.516 --> 00:44:45.890
about from the get-go.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:47.644
But it's a bit
like choreography.

00:44:47.644 --> 00:44:48.560
JOYCE CHITTICK: It is.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:48.990
Yeah.

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:51.156
MELISSA BENOIST: It's a
different part of your brain

00:44:51.156 --> 00:44:52.070
you have to--

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:55.750
But now, you get
in the rhythm of it

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:58.340
with the song when
you're singing on stage,

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:00.192
and it's a lot of fun.

00:45:00.192 --> 00:45:02.150
SPEAKER: And so, Melissa,
you'll be in the show

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:04.190
through August 4.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:05.350
What is next for you?

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:06.934
So you'll be returning
to "Supergirl."

00:45:06.934 --> 00:45:07.808
MELISSA BENOIST: Yes.

00:45:07.808 --> 00:45:09.310
I think I have two
days in between.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:11.540
I close "Beautiful,"
I have a weekend,

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:15.340
and then I'm back in Vancouver
shooting two days after.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.170
SPEAKER: And what do
you hope to do next?

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:18.420
MELISSA BENOIST: I don't know.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.995
We're up in Canada
for quite some time.

00:45:20.995 --> 00:45:23.354
It's like 10 months
out of the year.

00:45:23.354 --> 00:45:25.270
SPEAKER: But now you've
got this theater itch.

00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.358
MELISSA BENOIST: I don't know.

00:45:25.358 --> 00:45:25.650
Take it a day at a time.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.560
I would love to
get back on stage.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:30.410
I'm always going to be looking
for more theater opportunities.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:31.690
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.020
And Joyce and Stacey,
how about you?

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.120
Stacey, you've been with
the show for five years.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.953
STACEY ZALOGA: Yeah.

00:45:36.953 --> 00:45:38.210
I'm hoping it'll be five more.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:39.600
So I'll be there.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.560
I'll be there.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.390
SPEAKER: So you're hoping
to stick with this.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.764
STACEY ZALOGA: As
long as-- yeah.

00:45:42.764 --> 00:45:44.099
SPEAKER: And Joyce, for you?

00:45:44.099 --> 00:45:45.140
JOYCE CHITTICK: I'm here.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:49.580
And the tour regroups
at the end of August.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.040
And we tech in Denver.

00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.580
And so the reopening
is in Denver,

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.650
and then they're booked
for a few more years.

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.690
And I'm also a mother.

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:03.170
So if anybody's a mother or
father, it's a full-time job.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:06.630
And I'm also doing some
of my own choreography.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:10.730
So I'm doing a little
production of "South Pacific"

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:11.429
in Cape Cod--

00:46:11.429 --> 00:46:12.470
MELISSA BENOIST: Oh, fun.

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:14.303
JOYCE CHITTICK: --coming
up here this summer

00:46:14.303 --> 00:46:15.680
at the Cape Playhouse.

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.920
So it's a very short stint,
and it rehearses in New York,

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.100
so I don't have to
leave "Beautiful."

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:23.265
I can still do my job here.

00:46:23.265 --> 00:46:23.890
SPEAKER: Great.

00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:25.647
And still have
your side projects?

00:46:25.647 --> 00:46:26.480
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yes.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.600
SPEAKER: Great.

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.670
Well, thank you again.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:29.010
JOYCE CHITTICK: I
think we have one.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.718
SPEAKER: Oh, do we
have another question?

00:46:30.718 --> 00:46:32.079
Yes, please.

00:46:32.079 --> 00:46:32.870
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.590
So I have two kids.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:38.180
My daughter is 15, and my
son is turning 11 tomorrow.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:42.500
And both of them are religious
"Supergirl" fans, as well as

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.440
"Glee," certain
episodes of "Glee" fans.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:50.810
And my son is an aspiring
song and dance man.

00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:55.670
He's a complete musical
theater passionate performer.

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:59.390
And I was curious to the point
about taking classes and making

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:02.510
sure that you're still doing
the work of taking classes.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.500
Knowing that you do
eight shows a week,

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.330
what would you say, Melissa, are
the key classes that you keep

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:11.750
up with that you keep taking,
or in terms of really putting

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.940
in the training
to be a performer?

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:16.640
MELISSA BENOIST: Well, I don't
have to dance in "Beautiful,"

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:23.570
but if I did, I would for
sure be in ballet and jazz.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:25.530
Ballet, to me, is
the most important.

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.030
JOYCE CHITTICK:
It's the foundation.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.946
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:47:27.946 --> 00:47:29.330
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yeah.

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:31.940
When I was doing eight shows
a week, in my early days,

00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:35.720
I would race uptown
between shows

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.394
and go take a class at Steps.

00:47:37.394 --> 00:47:39.560
And not only that, I would
start with a voice lesson

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.900
across the street at
Ansonia for an hour,

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.970
and then run next
door to Steps and take

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:46.010
a class for another hour,
and then run back down

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:47.300
to do a show number two.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.850
And I was 20.

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:51.230
I had a lot of
energy to do that.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:52.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:56.270
And so you just have to keep
doing that instead of sitting

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:57.810
around and dreaming it.

00:47:57.810 --> 00:47:59.960
MELISSA BENOIST: This
instrument really is--

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.510
it's wild that we do
eight shows a week,

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.630
and we rely on these two tiny
little muscles in our throat.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:06.957
And they're so fragile.

00:48:06.957 --> 00:48:08.540
JOYCE CHITTICK: Need
to be maintained.

00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:11.510
MELISSA BENOIST: And need to
be maintained and taken care of

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:13.150
and used properly and healthily.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:15.860
So yeah, voice
lessons are the things

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.160
that I still keep up with even
when I'm not doing theater

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.119
in Vancouver and in LA.

00:48:20.119 --> 00:48:22.159
JOYCE CHITTICK: And if
he's a song and dance man,

00:48:22.159 --> 00:48:23.933
he needs to take every
kind of dance class

00:48:23.933 --> 00:48:26.339
out there from all
different types of teachers.

00:48:26.339 --> 00:48:27.255
MELISSA BENOIST: Yeah.

00:48:27.255 --> 00:48:28.088
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:28.088 --> 00:48:29.360
JOYCE CHITTICK: Yeah.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.151
SPEAKER: All right.

00:48:30.151 --> 00:48:32.660
Well, thank you again to
Melissa Benoist, Joyce Chittick,

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:36.450
