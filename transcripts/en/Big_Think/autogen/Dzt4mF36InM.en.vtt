the question is what should we be

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040
the question is what should we be
 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.830
the question is what should we be
cognizant of as new technologies emerge

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840
cognizant of as new technologies emerge
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.809
cognizant of as new technologies emerge
in fact it's it's a very good question

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819
in fact it's it's a very good question
 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.240
in fact it's it's a very good question
and answers itself we should be

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250
and answers itself we should be
 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.669
and answers itself we should be
cognizant of the new technologies the

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679
cognizant of the new technologies the
 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.270
cognizant of the new technologies the
pattern that we see where regulations to

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
pattern that we see where regulations to
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.980
pattern that we see where regulations to
don't know that we should see is it the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
don't know that we should see is it the
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.660
don't know that we should see is it the
private sector innovates that's a good

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670
private sector innovates that's a good
 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.000
private sector innovates that's a good
thing because they create the wealth the

private sector and those innovations
generally succeed if they have

whether or not to buy them to
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.650
whether or not to buy them to
participate in them at some point

innovation will reach a kind of critical
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.690
innovation will reach a kind of critical
mass and it will so change the situation

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
mass and it will so change the situation
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.959
mass and it will so change the situation
that you need new rules and the problems

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
that you need new rules and the problems
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.010
that you need new rules and the problems
come in from this standpoint when the

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020
come in from this standpoint when the
 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.700
come in from this standpoint when the
regulations lag the state of the art and

regulated there were also you got
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.880
regulated there were also you got
information technology it was now

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
information technology it was now
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.039
information technology it was now
possible beginning in the 80s for an

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049
possible beginning in the 80s for an
 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.010

into a security process is called
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.890
into a security process is called

pieces of it so you bought now as an
 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.440
pieces of it so you bought now as an
investor pieces of a thousand loans you

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
investor pieces of a thousand loans you
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.700
investor pieces of a thousand loans you
couldn't keep track you don't know if

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710
couldn't keep track you don't know if
 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.650
couldn't keep track you don't know if
any good there were no rules for that

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
any good there were no rules for that
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.810
any good there were no rules for that
situation people who lend money and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820
situation people who lend money and
 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.660
situation people who lend money and
expect the borrower to repay are careful

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670
expect the borrower to repay are careful
 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.690

who lend money and then sell the loans
to others don't worry as much so what

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020
to others don't worry as much so what
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.050
to others don't worry as much so what
happened in the 80s 90s and into the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060
happened in the 80s 90s and into the
 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.870
happened in the 80s 90s and into the
turn of the 21st century was a lot of

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880
turn of the 21st century was a lot of
 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.720
turn of the 21st century was a lot of
innovations that had no rules what we

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
innovations that had no rules what we
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.520
innovations that had no rules what we
did in the financial reform bill was to

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530
did in the financial reform bill was to
 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.560
did in the financial reform bill was to
create new rules and I believe we now

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
create new rules and I believe we now
 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.810
create new rules and I believe we now
have a fairly good set of rules for the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820
have a fairly good set of rules for the
 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.940
have a fairly good set of rules for the
current situation the next issue was

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950
current situation the next issue was
 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.400
current situation the next issue was
okay what what do we look out for and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410
okay what what do we look out for and
 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.720
okay what what do we look out for and
the answer is we don't know what to look

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
the answer is we don't know what to look
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.110
the answer is we don't know what to look
out for because we don't know what the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120
out for because we don't know what the
 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.699
out for because we don't know what the
innovations will be of the future but

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709
innovations will be of the future but
 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.290
innovations will be of the future but
what we did do was to give the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300
what we did do was to give the
 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.870
what we did do was to give the
regulator's in this case the power to

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880
regulator's in this case the power to
 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.270
regulator's in this case the power to
adopt new rules as new phenomena come up

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
adopt new rules as new phenomena come up
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.340
adopt new rules as new phenomena come up
in other words we did two things we had

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350
in other words we did two things we had
 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.930
in other words we did two things we had
a kind of backward looking set of rules

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940
a kind of backward looking set of rules
 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.860
a kind of backward looking set of rules
okay we're going to regulate

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870
okay we're going to regulate
 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.100
okay we're going to regulate
securitization derivatives etc but we're

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110
securitization derivatives etc but we're
 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.220
securitization derivatives etc but we're
also going to give these regulated

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230
also going to give these regulated
 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.680
also going to give these regulated
regulatory bodies information and the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690
regulatory bodies information and the
 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.140
regulatory bodies information and the
authority to adopt new rules as new

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150
authority to adopt new rules as new
 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.570
authority to adopt new rules as new
things come up so short answer what

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580
things come up so short answer what
 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.460
things come up so short answer what
should we be looking for we should be

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470
should we be looking for we should be
 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.020
should we be looking for we should be
looking for the new phenomena that will

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030
looking for the new phenomena that will
 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.630
looking for the new phenomena that will
ultimately transform the situation and

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640
ultimately transform the situation and
 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.479
ultimately transform the situation and
not wait towards that bulls that that

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489
not wait towards that bulls that that
 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.269
not wait towards that bulls that that
never liked them
