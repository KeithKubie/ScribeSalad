00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.400
Bubbles have got lots of interesting
properties and it can be fun to

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.059
investigate these with your children.

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.079
You can buy bubble mixture from the shops, but it's easy enough to make at home.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.999
All you need is some good quality washing up liquid,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.080
add that to some water and hey presto, you get some nice bubbles. 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.960
In order to make it even better,

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.940
all you need to do is add some glycerine to it and you can get glycerine from your local chemist.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
You could have one of these bubble wands
lying around the house but the great

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.140
thing about bubbles

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.359
is that you can make them with almost anything. So for example

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.159
I've used a simple cookie cutter I found in
my kitchen,

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.450
or a pipe cleaner

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.570
which has been bent into shape.

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.259
Experimenting with different ways to
make bubbles is a great way

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.710
to get children thinking scientifically as
they play.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.970
Can you tell me what do you think is going to happen if you blow 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.210
really really hard?

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.220
It'll make a bigger bubble? You think it's going to make a bigger bubble?

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.820
OK, shall we try?

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.220
What do you think is going to happen if you use a fatter straw?

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.220
The same thing.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.160
You think the same thing's going to happen? Shall we have a go? 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.180
What do you think? Do you think using a different straw made a difference to the bubbles?

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.660
Yes.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.290
We're going to have a go at trying to make one with this pipe cleaner.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.030
Can you make something similar?

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.590
Very good.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.760
Wow!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.940
Keep going! Amazing, well done!

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.480
What do you think is going to happen if I use a different shape?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.720
For example this one? What type of bubble do you think I'm going to get from that?

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.220
A star. You  think I'm going to get a star one? Shall we have a go? 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.200
Look at the bubble. What does it look like?

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.620
A circle.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.440
And what do you think is going to happen with the hand shape? It will go into a circle.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.040
Shall we have a go? Yeah!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.980
When you blow up a balloon, you have to blow hard. The air inside the balloon has to press

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.400
outwards and stretches the rubber of the balloon. When you tie up the balloon,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.950
the air inside it carries on pressing
outwards, and the rubber presses

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.030
inwards. These forces balance each other

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.700
and give the balloon its shape. A similar thing happens when you blow a soap bubble,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.769
but instead of rubber it is a thin skin of soap solution that contains the air.

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.320
Your bubble may start off in a funny shape, but the soap film is 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.489
always pulling inwards and the air is
pushing outwards.

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.820
The bubble ends up shaped like a sphere

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.400
because then the outward force of the air exactly balances

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.040
the inward force of the soap film in all
directions.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.269
Shall we try to make an even bigger bubble?

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.709
Yeah!

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.109
Right so I'm going to show you a really really big bubble! 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.709
OK? You excited?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.600
To make a really big bubbles

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.520
you can just use a cake tin or even a
coat hanger.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.610
But what I'm going to do today is show you how to make a big bubble wand

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.770
using some string, two wooden spoons

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.060
and a weight, which is going to be a key.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.630
The first thing you need to do is take your string

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.930
and loop it through and tie it around one of your wooden sticks.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.260
The next thing you need to do is take your key,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.920
which is going to act as your weight, and pass that through

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.730
the string again so it's roughly about

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.670
a third down your string.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.660
You are trying to form a bubble wand which is in a triangular shape.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.120
So this forms the first side of my triangle.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.660
The next thing you need to do is take your string and take your second

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.720
wooden stick or spoon,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.130
and again pass that through.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.400
And that should be about two thirds of your string,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.050
and make another knot.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.710
So there you go, you've got two sides the
triangle,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.990
and all you need to do now is complete the triangle.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.210
Take the rest of the string, and again it needs to be approximately the same size

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.460
as the other two.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.690
And I tie that around to finish off my bubble wand.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.830
When I hold that up what we end up with is a really really nice triangular shape

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.750
that I can now use to make some really really big bubbles.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.220
You put it in the bubble mix, take it away,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.300
and then open it and walk back slowly,

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.080
and when there's a bubble you have to close it.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.080
Me and Mischa have played with bubbles so many times before,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.840
but this time round, asking her questions, getting her to investigate the properties,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.740
getting her to look at them really really closely

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.520
has meant that we've got so much
more out of it.

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.749
I do hope you do to.
