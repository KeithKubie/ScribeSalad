00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.313
- [Instructor] The goal of this video

00:00:01.313 --> 00:00:03.401
is to use this scratch pad on Khan Academy

00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:05.802
that was written by Khan
Academy user Charlotte Allen,

00:00:05.802 --> 00:00:07.109
in order to get a better

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.903
intuitive sense of confidence intervals.

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:13.624
So here we're dealing
with a gumball machine

00:00:13.624 --> 00:00:16.042
where a certain proportion of the gumballs

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:17.482
are going to be green.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:19.202
And so let's say we can set that on it.

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:21.834
Let's make that 60% of
the gumballs are green.

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:23.165
But let's say someone else comes along

00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:24.095
and they don't actually know

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:26.420
the proportion of gumballs that are green,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.333
but they can take samples.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.355
And so let's say they take
samples of 50 at a time,

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:33.602
and so they draw a sample.

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:35.444
The sample proportion right over here,

00:00:35.444 --> 00:00:38.366
actually just happened to be 0.6,

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.878
but then they could draw another sample.

00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:41.669
This time the sample proportion

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:45.801
is 0.52 or 52% of those 50 gumballs

00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.620
happened to be green.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.612
Now you could say, all right,

00:00:48.612 --> 00:00:50.453
well, these are all different estimates.

00:00:50.453 --> 00:00:52.656
But for any given estimate,

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:56.117
what, how confident are we that the,

00:00:56.117 --> 00:00:58.140
a certain range around that estimate

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.755
actually contains the true
population proportion?

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:03.624
And so if we look at
this tab right over here,

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:05.906
that's what confidence
intervals are good for.

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:06.970
And in a previous video,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.649
we talked about how you calculate
the confidence interval.

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.901
What we wanna do is say, well,

00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:14.124
there's a 95% chance,

00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:15.814
and we get that from
this confidence level,

00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:18.904
and 95% is the confidence
level people typically use.

00:01:18.904 --> 00:01:21.957
And so there's a 95% chance that

00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:23.924
whatever our sample proportion is

00:01:23.924 --> 00:01:25.535
that it's within two standard deviations

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:27.508
of the true proportion.

00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:30.573
Or that the true proportion
is going to be contained

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:33.196
in an interval that are
two standard deviations

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:36.466
on either side of our sample proportion.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:38.473
Well if you don't know
the true proportion,

00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:41.206
the way that you estimate
the standard deviation

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:42.632
is with a standard error,

00:01:42.632 --> 00:01:44.069
which we've done in previous videos.

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.354
And so this is two standard
errors to the right

00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:47.774
and two standard errors to the left

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:49.773
of our sample proportion.

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:51.916
And our confidence interval
is this entire interval,

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.095
going from this left
point to this right point.

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:55.725
And as we draw more samples,

00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:58.193
you can see it's not obvious,

00:01:58.193 --> 00:02:01.134
but our intervals change depending on

00:02:01.134 --> 00:02:03.314
what our actual sample proportion is.

00:02:03.314 --> 00:02:05.132
Because we use our sample proportion

00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:07.480
to calculate our confidence interval

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.437
because we're assuming
whoever's doing the sampling

00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:13.984
does not actually know the
true population proportion.

00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:15.503
Now what's interesting here,

00:02:15.503 --> 00:02:17.285
about this simulation,

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:20.541
is that we can see what
percentage of the time

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.842
does our confidence interval,

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:25.768
does it actually contain
the true parameter?

00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:28.616
So let me just draw out
25 samples at a time.

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:30.911
And so you can see here that right now,

00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:34.022
93% of our,

00:02:34.022 --> 00:02:36.363
for 93% of our samples,

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:40.110
did our confidence
interval actually contain

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.997
our population parameter.

00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:45.150
And we can keep sampling over here

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.148
and we can see the more
samples that we take,

00:02:48.148 --> 00:02:50.016
it really is approaching

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:53.581
that close to 95% of the time,

00:02:53.581 --> 00:02:56.104
our confidence interval does indeed

00:02:56.104 --> 00:02:58.494
contain the true parameter.

00:02:58.494 --> 00:03:00.528
And so once again, we did all that math

00:03:00.528 --> 00:03:01.879
in the previous video,

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.995
but here you can see
that confidence intervals

00:03:04.995 --> 00:03:07.300
calculated the way that
we calculated them,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.355
actually do a pretty good job

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.942
of what they claim to do.

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:13.013
That if we calculate a confidence interval

00:03:13.013 --> 00:03:15.768
based on a confidence level of 95%,

00:03:15.768 --> 00:03:17.530
that it is indeed the case that

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.143
roughly 95% of the time,

00:03:20.143 --> 00:03:23.368
the true parameter, the
population proportion

00:03:23.368 --> 00:03:25.867
will be contained in that interval.

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:28.368
And I could just draw more
and more and more samples

00:03:28.368 --> 00:03:30.891
and we can actually see that happening.

00:03:30.891 --> 00:03:32.186
Every now and then, for sure,

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:34.839
you get a sample where

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:37.041
even when you calculate
your confidence interval,

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:39.407
the true parameter, the
true population proportion

00:03:39.407 --> 00:03:40.823
is not contained.

00:03:40.823 --> 00:03:43.891
But that is the exception,
that happens very infrequently.

00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:47.019
95% of the time, your
true population parameter

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.107
is contained in that interval.

00:03:49.107 --> 00:03:51.411
Now another interesting thing to see is,

00:03:51.411 --> 00:03:53.257
if we increase our sample size,

00:03:53.257 --> 00:03:55.894
our confidence interval
is going to get narrower.

00:03:55.894 --> 00:03:57.340
So if we increase our sample size,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.936
we'll just make it 200.

00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.503
Now let's draw some samples.

00:04:00.503 --> 00:04:04.569
Notice, now our confidence
intervals are narrower,

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:06.709
but still because our confidence level,

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.406
which was used to
calculate these intervals,

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:09.859
is still 95%,

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.727
when we draw a bunch of samples,

00:04:11.727 --> 00:04:13.398
we are still going to get

00:04:13.398 --> 00:04:16.034
roughly 95% of the time

00:04:16.034 --> 00:04:18.781
our confidence intervals contain

00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:20.854
our true population proportion.

00:04:20.854 --> 00:04:24.077
But roughly 5% of the time, they don't.
