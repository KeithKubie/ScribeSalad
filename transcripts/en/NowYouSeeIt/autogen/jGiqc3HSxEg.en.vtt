00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 You break me Lisa! 

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:03.495
 When you think about it 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.865
 "so bad its good" you probably think of a movie 

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.800
 with terribly horrible plays and bad manuscript. 

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:11.175
 A movie that is so bad that it becomes really fun to watch. 

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:14.105
 You see it and make fun of it with your friends because such a bad movie 

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:15.795
 takes himself so seriously. 

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:18.945
 "so bad it's good" film, goes all the way back to the 40's and 50's B movies. 

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.540
 The concept has always been the same: 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.520
 They are "guilty pleasure" movies where you enjoy the movie because of its 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.545
 Excessive use of clichÃ©s, overplayed plays 

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:30.320
 and awful room work. And that makes sense. 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.000
 It's not hard to see the grumpy similarity in "Robot Monster" 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 in 1953, and "Sharknado". 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.075
 But the problem is: 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.080
 The analysis of "so bad it's good" usually stops there. 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.175
 But I think you can go much deeper than that. I want to talk about what is at the core of it 

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.505
 This phenomenon and establish that the techniques 

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:47.375
 in "so bad it's good" is present in thousands of critically acclaimed 

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.375
 movie, and almost all the time 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.440
 it is done on purpose. So let me explain: 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.300
 "Michael" 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.140
 "join me" 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.415
 "so bad it's good" movie is an extreme version of 

00:00:56.415 --> 00:00:59.285
 the idea that the audience enjoys theatrical and 

00:00:59.285 --> 00:01:02.315
 exaggerated film that still takes itself seriously. 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.385
 This concept is called "Camp". And it's another tool available 

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:06.780
 which is used by an instructor. 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.720
 When you think of "Campy" movies, you probably think that they are always made unconsciously. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.880
 Like Tommy Wiseau, trying to film a serious movie, 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.560
 which ultimately becomes the ultimate Camp classic. 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.700
 But that is not the case. Instructors are constantly pretending 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300
 They take their film seriously to create a hero 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.620
 new level of entertainment. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.280
 "But if everyone is sincere and serious, and pretends 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.355
 it is an ordinary earthquake, or an alien invasion, or whatever it is, 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.015
 then it transforms sincerity, 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.000
 and then you can go even further with his villain, 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.480
 which is "Sharknado". One can do insane things, " 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.220
 "And that makes the movie even more fun." 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.900
 "Camp" is not necessarily a genre 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.840
 of film. Some movies may have elements of "Camp", without exclusively considering themselves as "so bad its good". 

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:48.520
 Perhaps the perfect balance of "Camp" and sincerity 

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.935
 "The Princess Bride". The film is actually wise written and performed, 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.800
 while at the same time having a lot of "campy" and flat moments. 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.320
 "You seem like a nice guy, 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.020
 I would hate to kill you. " 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.360
 "You seem like a nice guy. I would hate to die." 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.335
 The sword fight blurs the border 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.160
 between cartoon-like and serious. The risks are high and the stage 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.940
 is professionally choreographed, but they also make random salters. 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.780
 "Camp" makes "The Princess Bride" fun to watch, without making it a movie people make fun of. 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.180
 It is extravagant, but never too much 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.020
 and it always takes itself seriously. 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.940
 In fact, "Camp" can sometimes save a movie. 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.400
 Johnny Depp's performance turns "Pirates of the Caribbean" from a derivative 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.160
 action movie, for a charming and fun franchise. 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.180
 And that's because of his "campy", exaggerated, down-to-earth performance. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.420
 "You're certainly the worst pirate I've ever heard of" 

00:02:31.285 --> 00:02:32.635
 "But you've heard about me." 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.360
 Wes Anderson is a champion of "Camp". 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.020
 His scenes are famously symmetrical so it borders on impossibility. 

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.845
 The camera constantly pans from one character to another, 

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:44.985
 He loves to use old-fashioned cartoon-like special effects, 

00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:48.015
 And he ends up awkward conversations at the end of each sentence. 

00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:49.605
 "Why do you see me as your enemy?" 

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.755
 "because your boyfriend stuck me in the back with left hand bag" 

00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:56.245
 "she is my wife now" 

00:02:57.795 --> 00:02:58.875
 "Congratulations" 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.400
 Anderson creates charming and critical acclaim 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.080
 movie, despite breaking numerous movie conventions. 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.120
 "Campy" movie techniques give the film the extra flame that makes them 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.380
 fun and shatteringly reciprocating. 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.155
 "campy" instructors, roam the border between the impossible and the realistic, 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.005
 So movies have some elements of "camp" while 

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:17.020
 at the same time possess a hint of seriousness. 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.080
 So it doesn't seem like they are trying too hard. 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.475
 "For me, Ralph plays a real person and makes him a real person," 

00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:26.515
 "and even the context" 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.580
 "is this kind of invented country, in this just as invented 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.595
 "version of the story, etc., so have" 

00:03:32.595 --> 00:03:35.615
 "I'm a bit like trying to make it as realistic as possible, given" 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.040
 "given what it is." 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.960
 Excessive and "campy" filming is happening all the time. So this: 

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:44.955
 turns into this: 

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:51.005
 And this: 

00:03:53.725 --> 00:03:54.725
 turns into this: 

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:00.575
 Quentin Tarantione loves "Camp". 

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:03.745
 If you have a villain, then make her a schoolgirl, and give her a gun as a weapon. 

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:06.415
 His love for the theatrical and exaggerated shows 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.980
 basically that in all his films, lets characters 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.500
 as if they are someone they are not. 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.140
 "Come, let's get in character." 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.660
 The result is extravagant, 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.980
 but serious moments of bad or flashy play. 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.960
 "Arrivederci" 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.220
 "Arrivederci" 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.400
 "Arrivederci" 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.380
 "Arrivederci" 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.380
 "Camp" is also incredibly common in dialogue. 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.800
 So many movies have characters to say things, no one really says. 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.760
 "this is a line that cannot be erased, my friend" 

00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:33.815
 But that doesn't make the dialogue bad. Or, ever do it. 

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:36.615
 "I didn't beat her. It's not true, it's bullshit" 

00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:38.915
 "I didn't beat her, I didn't." 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.460
 "oh, hi Mark" 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.720
 But it's also a way to make movies fun. 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.660
 Aaron Sorkin is one of the best screenwriters in the film industry, and 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.920
 he loves "campy" dialogue. 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.900
 In many scenes, he prefers excessive dialogue, rather than what one would actually say: 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.020
 "Anne!" 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.660
 "yes sir" 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.660
 "touch my face, please" 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.525
 Aaron Sorkin's famous "walk'n talk" style, from "Westwing" 

00:04:57.525 --> 00:04:59.680
 feels extremely theatrical and constructed 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.555
 It has been recycled to the point where it has been parodyed in almost all TV sitcoms. 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.060
 He even parodies it himself: 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.740
 "join me" 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.920
 "I'm Aaron Sorkin" 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.940
 His smart dialogue 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.820
 is also recycled for an amazing degree: 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.480
 "This is you and me talking Dana, I'm not other people" 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.720
 "I'm not other people" 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.760
 "I'm not other people" 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.820
 "I'm not other people" 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.420
 "Don't talk to me like I'm other people" 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.040
 But it is not badly written. 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.840
 It actually takes a very talented author to create a style that is 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.360
 so easy to parody, but remains 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.880
 exciting to see. 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.415
 Technically, he is not original, but he still keeps it fresh. 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.975
 We can feel his classic style, but we are not disgusted, 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.965
 We appreciate it, for a mental illness actually, it gets closest 

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:36.815
 worshiped to the point where they make actors reproduce Sorkin's 

00:05:36.815 --> 00:05:38.585
 style of talk shows. 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.740
 "Camp" lets B movies, be movie, 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.540
 and this is a concept we feel all over: 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.460
 Mainly when a movie does something extravagant that would never happen in reality, 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.820
 But the film still holds it in its sincerity. 

00:05:57.995 --> 00:05:58.995
 "marriage" 

00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:02.135
 And "The Room" fits in well with the concepts 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.360
 about excessive and entertaining film production. 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.515
 What makes the movie special is that it is one of the only "campy" movies that took itself completely 

00:06:08.515 --> 00:06:10.495
 seriously, without any idea 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.400
 just how excessive it was. 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.200
 It is still "Camp", but it is unique because it is so innocently unaware of it. 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.760
 "hey dog" 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.980
 "you are my favorite customer" 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.460
 "many thanks! goodbye" 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.040
 And that leads me to the most important part of "Camp": 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.380
 "Camp defies the binary thinking in film, 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.160
 because it is both bad and good. 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.860
 It breaks objectively many of the rules of film production. 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.680
 unrealistic plays, flat dialogue, and extreme movie techniques, 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.820
 is almost always frowned upon. But the crazy thing is, "Camp" is not bad. 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.200
 Sometimes it is actually extremely entertaining. 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.960
 Perhaps the most entertaining kind of movie that exists. 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.480
 Too many instructors can be serious, and many instructors can be fun, 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.560
 But not many can be so serious that they are funny. 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.120
 I appreciate the "Camp" for movies shouldn't always be serious if they don't want to. 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.535
 on the contrary, "camp" lets movies be 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.265
 what they should be. entertainment. 

00:06:54.265 --> 00:06:56.700
 So the next time you watch a movie, don't just take it into consideration 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.100
 whether it is good or bad, think about whether you like it for its "guilty pleasure" 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.720
 Consider whether it's so bad, but it's not a bad thing. 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.680
 It's actually a good thing. It's good that it's bad. 

00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:07.285
 "Do you want me to order a pizza?" 

00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:09.075
 "whatever, I don't care" 

00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:10.485
 "I've already ordered it" 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.040
 "you think about everything" 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.040
 Thanks for watching
