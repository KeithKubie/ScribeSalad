When I think about where do we go from
here, I think about where I come from

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.170
which is the great south side of Chicago.
Where I was born and raised I attended K

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.509
through 12 public schools. I also
attended a great public institution for

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.550
undergrad where I met Diane Penderhughes, an African-American female

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.180
political scientist who changed my life
her motivation encouraged me to pursue a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.800
PhD and to enter a career in academia.
Now at UCLA I've become the first

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.090
african-american female and the first
woman of color in the political science

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.219
department to earn tenure and promotion.
I teach with an understanding that

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.300
higher education changes socioeconomic
status but not just for our students but

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.460
possibly for their communities and
generations to come so where do we go

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.770
from here? Well we'll continue to
motivate and inspire our students each

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.400
day and moreover. We'll continue to be
motivated and inspired by our students

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.250
at UCLA. In short where do we go from
here? We'll continue to teach our hearts

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.360
out at UCLA.
