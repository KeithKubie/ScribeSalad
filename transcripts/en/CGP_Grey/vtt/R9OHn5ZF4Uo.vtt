00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.020
On the internet, the algorithms are all around you.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.320
You are watching this video because an algorithm brought it to you (among others) to click,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.160
which you did, and the algorithm took note.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.660
When you open the TweetBook, A the algorithm decides what you see.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.960
When you search through your photos, A the algorithm does the finding.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.960
Maybe even makes a little movie for you.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.800
When you buy something, A the algorithm sets the price

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.000
and A the algorithm is at your bank watching transactions for fraud.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.180
The stock market is full of algorithms

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.740
trading with algorithms.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.240
Given this, you might want to know how these little algorithmic bots shaping your world work,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.040
especially when they don't.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.080
In Ye Olden Days,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.900
humans built algorithmic bots by giving them instructions the humans could explain.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.780
"If this, then that."

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.080
But many problems are just too big and hard for a human to write simple instructions for.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.560
There's a gazillion financial transactions a second, which ones are fraudulent?

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.980
There's octillion videos on NetMeTube.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.680
Which eight should the user see as recommendations? Which shouldn't be allowed on the site at all?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.940
For this airline seat, what is the maximum price this user will pay right now?

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.500
Algorithmic bots give answers to these questions.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.920
Not perfect answers,
but much better than a human could do.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.820
But how these bots work exactly,
more and more, no one knows.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.920
Not even the humans who built them,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.880
or "built them",

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.860
as we will see...

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.420
Now companies that use these bots
don't want to talk about how they work

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.820
because the bots are valuable employees.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.300
Very, VERY valuable.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.660
And how their brains are built is a fiercely guarded trade secret.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.000
Right now the cutting edge is most likely very

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.640
'I hope you like linear algebra',

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.340
but what the current hotness is on any particular site

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.300
and how the bots work, 
is a bit "I dunno", and always will be.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.600
So let's talk about one of the more quaint but understandable ways bots CAN be "built"

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.320
without understanding how their brains work.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.240
Say you want a bot that can recognize
what is in a picture.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.220
Is it a bee, or is it a three?

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.760
It's easy for humans (even little humans),

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.820
but it's impossible to just tell a bot 
in bot language how to do it,

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.680
because really we just know 
that's a bee and that's a three.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.100
We can say in words what makes them different, 
but bots don't understand words.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.980
And it's the wiring in our brains 
that makes it happen anyway.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.800
While an individual neuron may be understood, and clusters of neurons' general purpose vaguely grasped,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.460
the whole is beyond.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.020
Nonetheless, it works.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.120
So to get a bot that can do this sorting,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.420
you don't build it yourself.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.200
You build a bot that builds bots,
and a bot that teaches bots.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.680
These bots' brains are simpler,
something a smart human programmer can make.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.140
The builder bot builds bots, 
though it's not very good at it.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.360
At first it connects the wires and modules in the bot brains almost at random.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.480
This leads to some very...

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.440
"special" student bots sent to teacher bot to teach.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.700
Of course, teacher bot can't
tell a bee from a three either;

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.220
if the human could build teacher bot to do that, 
well, then, problem solved.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.780
Instead the human gives teacher bot a bunch of "bee" photos, and "three" photos,

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.960
and an answer key to which is what.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.440
Teacher bot can't teach,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.680
but teacher bot can TEST.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.840
The adorkable student bots stick out their tongues, try very hard,

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.780
but they are bad at what they do.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.160
Very, VERY, bad.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.040
And it's not their fault, really, 
they were built that way.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.600
Grades in hand, the student bots take a march of shame back to builder bot.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.760
those that did best are put to one side,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.420
the others recycled.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.700
Builder bot still isn't good at building bots,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.520
but now it takes those left
and makes copies with changes in new combinations.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.480
Back to school they go.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.940
Teacher bot teaches - er, tests again, and builder bot builds again.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.920
And again, and again.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.240
Now a builder that builds at random, 
and a teacher that doesn't teach, just tests,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.020
and students who can't learn, they just are what they are, in theory shouldn't work,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.760
but in practice, it does.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.000
Partly because in every iteration, builder bot's slaughterhouse keeps the best and discards the rest,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.840
and partly because teacher bot isn't overseeing an old-timey, one-room schoolhouse with a dozen students,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.460
but an infinite warehouse with thousands of students.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.740
The test isn't ten questions, but a million questions.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.420
And how many times does the test, build, test loop repeat?

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.920
As many as necessary.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.579
At first students that survive are just lucky,

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.460
but by combining enough lucky bots, and keeping only what works,

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.240
and randomly messing around with new copies of that

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.020
eventually a student bot emerges that isn't lucky,

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.540
that can perhaps barely tell bees from threes.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.320
As this bot is copied and changed,
slowly the average test score rises,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.120
and thus the grade needed to survive the next round gets higher and higher.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.580
Keep this up and eventually from the infinite warehouse

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.100
(slaughterhouse)

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.760
a student bot will emerge, who can tell a bee from a three in a photo it's never seen before pretty well.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.760
But how the student bot does this, neither the teacher bot nor the builder bot,

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.100
nor the human overseer, can understand.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.500
Nor the student bot itself.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.320
After keeping so many useful random changes,
the wiring in its head is incredibly complicated,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.140
and while an individual line of code may be understood, and clusters of code's general purpose vaguely grasped,

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.920
the whole is beyond,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.600
nonetheless, it works.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.220
But this is frustrating, especially as the student bot is very good at exactly

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.000
only the kinds of questions it's been taught to.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.520
It's great with photos, but useless with videos or baffled if the photos are upside down,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.120
or things that are obviously not bees, it's confident are.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.520
Since teacher bot can't teach,

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.240
all the human overseer can do is give it more questions, to make the test even longer,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.720
to include the kinds of questions the best bots get wrong.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.640
This is important to understand.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.540
It's a reason why companies are 
obsessed with collecting data.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.860
More data equals longer tests equals better bots.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.860
So when you get the "Are you human?" test on a website,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.460
you are not only proving that you are human, 
(hopefully),

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.240
but you are also helping to build the test to make bots that can read, or count,

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.640
or tell lakes from mountains, or horses from humans.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.080
Seeing lots of questions about driving lately?

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.880
Hmm...! What could that be building a test for?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.380
Now figuring out what's in a photo, or on a sign, or filtering videos,

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.260
requires humans to make correct enough tests.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.220
But there is another kind of test that makes itself.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.520
Tests ON the humans.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.180
For example, say entirely hypothetical NetMeTube wanted users to keep watching as long as possible?

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.540
Well, how long a user stays on the site is easy to measure.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.620
So, teacher bot gives each student bot a bunch of NetMeTube users to oversee,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.580
the student bots watch what their user watches, looks at their files,

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.820
and do their best to pick the videos
that keep the user on the site.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.300
The longer the average, the higher their test score.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.380
Build, test, repeat.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.040
A million cycles later, there's a student bot who's pretty good at keeping the users watching,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.640
at least compared to what a human could build.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.200
But when people ask:
"How does the NetMeTube algorithm select videos?"

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.040
Once again, there isn't a great answer other than pointing to the bot,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.140
and the user data it had access to,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.420
and most vitally, how the human overseers 
direct teacher bot to score the test.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.800
That's what the bot is trying to be good at to survive.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.420
But what the bot is thinking, or how it thinks it,
is not really knowable.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.000
All that's knowable is this student bot
gets to be the algorithm,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.160
because it's point one percent better than the previous bot at the test the humans designed.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.780
So everywhere on the internet, behind the scenes,
there are tests to increase user interaction,

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.240
or set prices just right to maximize revenue,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.180
or pick the posts from all your friends you'll like the most, or articles people will share the most, or whatever.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.840
If it's testable, it's teachable. Well, "teachable",

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.900
and a student bot will graduate from the warehouse 
to be the algorithm of its domain.

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.540
At least, for a little while.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.440
We're used to the idea that the tools we use, even if we don't understand them, someone does,

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.980
but with our machines that learn we are increasingly in a position where we use tools,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.460
or are used by tools,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.720
that no one, not even their creators, understand.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.220
We can only hope to guide them with the tests we make,

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.940
and we need to get comfortable with that,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.020
as our algorithmic bot buddies are all around, 
and not going anywhere.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.140
OK. The bots are watching.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.960
You know what's coming.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.480
This is where I need to ask you...

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.700
To like...

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.060
comment...

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.820
...and subscribe.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:10.620
And bell me.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.040
And share on the TweetBook.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.140
The algorithm is watching.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.200
It won't show people the video...

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.560
unless you do this.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.060
Look what you've reduced me to, bots.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.340
What do you want? Do you want watch time?

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.600
Is that what you want?

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:28.820
Fine.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.260
(sigh...) Hey guys, did you know I also have podcasts you can listen to?

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:40.200
Maybe even just in the background while you're tidying up your all room for hours? Or whatever?

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:47.020
There's hours of audio entertainment for you, 
and watch time for the bots overseeing your actions.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.900
Go ahead and - and take a click.
Entertain yourself.

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.340
Help me.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.420
Help the bots.
