the idea is completely unoriginal the

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:12.650
the idea is completely unoriginal the
 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.090
the idea is completely unoriginal the
idea that teachers are the central lever

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100
idea that teachers are the central lever
 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.839
idea that teachers are the central lever
in education is sort of obvious the idea

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849
in education is sort of obvious the idea
 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.470
in education is sort of obvious the idea
that we have to respect them and we

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480
that we have to respect them and we
 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.570
that we have to respect them and we
can't respect them simply by paying lip

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580
can't respect them simply by paying lip
 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.880
can't respect them simply by paying lip
service to respecting them is also

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890
service to respecting them is also
 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.920
service to respecting them is also
completely unoriginal many many people

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930
completely unoriginal many many people
 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.040
completely unoriginal many many people
have said the country and the education

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050
have said the country and the education
 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.560
have said the country and the education
system will not improve until teachers

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570
system will not improve until teachers
 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.240
system will not improve until teachers
are paid a decent wage so the idea is

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250
are paid a decent wage so the idea is
 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.370
are paid a decent wage so the idea is
sort of common sense it didn't come to

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380
sort of common sense it didn't come to
 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.470
sort of common sense it didn't come to
me in a flash I think it's out there in

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480
me in a flash I think it's out there in
 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.139
me in a flash I think it's out there in
the culture the only sort of challenge

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149
the culture the only sort of challenge
 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.310
the culture the only sort of challenge
was how to implement it so when I was in

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320
was how to implement it so when I was in
 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.520
was how to implement it so when I was in
the classroom teaching sixth grade for a

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530
the classroom teaching sixth grade for a
 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.190
the classroom teaching sixth grade for a
couple years and then eighth grade one

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200
couple years and then eighth grade one
 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.900
couple years and then eighth grade one
of the things that really appealed to me

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910
of the things that really appealed to me
 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.029
of the things that really appealed to me
was the whole idea of public charter

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039
was the whole idea of public charter
 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.910
was the whole idea of public charter
schools because public charter schools

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920
schools because public charter schools
 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.010
schools because public charter schools
essentially free teachers and free and

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020
essentially free teachers and free and
 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.700
essentially free teachers and free and
administration from the constraints of a

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710
administration from the constraints of a
 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.969
administration from the constraints of a
large bureaucracy and allow creative

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979
large bureaucracy and allow creative
 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.590
large bureaucracy and allow creative
individuals to create a school that they

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600
individuals to create a school that they
 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.810
individuals to create a school that they
think will produce better results and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820
think will produce better results and
 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.520
think will produce better results and
produce better more educated kids than a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530
produce better more educated kids than a
 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.469
produce better more educated kids than a
traditional school so it's a very

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479
traditional school so it's a very
 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.870
traditional school so it's a very
entrepreneurial venture the idea of a

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
entrepreneurial venture the idea of a
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.820
entrepreneurial venture the idea of a
public charter school it really gives

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830
public charter school it really gives
 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.230
public charter school it really gives
people who think they know what they're

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240
people who think they know what they're
 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.450
people who think they know what they're
doing and maybe we don't but the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460
doing and maybe we don't but the
 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.840
doing and maybe we don't but the
opportunity to at least see if we can

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850
opportunity to at least see if we can
 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.620
opportunity to at least see if we can
create a school that is outstanding I'm

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630
create a school that is outstanding I'm
 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.749
create a school that is outstanding I'm
freed from the constraints of a large

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759
freed from the constraints of a large
 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.490
freed from the constraints of a large
bureaucracy and the flip side of course

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500
bureaucracy and the flip side of course
 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.350
bureaucracy and the flip side of course
that appealed to me is charter schools

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360
that appealed to me is charter schools
 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.960
that appealed to me is charter schools
at least in theory are really supposed

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970
at least in theory are really supposed
 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.340
at least in theory are really supposed
to be held accountable in a way that

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350
to be held accountable in a way that
 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.109
to be held accountable in a way that
publix that traditional public schools

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119
publix that traditional public schools
 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.569
publix that traditional public schools
are not public charter schools really

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579
are not public charter schools really
 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.810
are not public charter schools really
have to meet certain goals in order for

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820
have to meet certain goals in order for
 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.789
have to meet certain goals in order for
their charter to be renewed and that's

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799
their charter to be renewed and that's
 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.380
their charter to be renewed and that's
also very appealing because you can

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390
also very appealing because you can
 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.789
also very appealing because you can
actually see whether you've been

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799
actually see whether you've been
 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.880
actually see whether you've been
successful or not in New York State if

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890
successful or not in New York State if
 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.550
successful or not in New York State if
you're writing a charter you typically

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560
you're writing a charter you typically
 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.789
you're writing a charter you typically
get a document from the state that says

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799
get a document from the state that says
 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:16.990
get a document from the state that says
here are the goals that you have to put

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
here are the goals that you have to put
 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.229
here are the goals that you have to put
in your charter there's not much choice

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239
in your charter there's not much choice
 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.370
in your charter there's not much choice
the goals center a lot around

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380
the goals center a lot around
 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.630
the goals center a lot around
attendance standardized test results

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640
attendance standardized test results
 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.310
attendance standardized test results
parent teacher student satisfaction and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320
parent teacher student satisfaction and
 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.290
parent teacher student satisfaction and
I think all those are important though I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300
I think all those are important though I
 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.230
I think all those are important though I
will say this I think the emphasis on

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240
will say this I think the emphasis on
 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.870
will say this I think the emphasis on
standardized tests represents a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
standardized tests represents a
 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.450
standardized tests represents a
relatively low bar if kids are not

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460
relatively low bar if kids are not
 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.270
relatively low bar if kids are not
passing the New York State English

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280
passing the New York State English
 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.610
passing the New York State English
language arts exam then certainly the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
language arts exam then certainly the
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.460
language arts exam then certainly the
school is doing something wrong however

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470
school is doing something wrong however
 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.290
school is doing something wrong however
if they are passing that exam I don't

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300
if they are passing that exam I don't
 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.420
if they are passing that exam I don't
necessarily think that means the school

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
necessarily think that means the school
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.100
necessarily think that means the school
is a great school there are a lot of

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110
is a great school there are a lot of
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.380
is a great school there are a lot of
other factors that go into whether the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390
other factors that go into whether the
 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.270
other factors that go into whether the
students are learning and whether the

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280
students are learning and whether the
 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.890
students are learning and whether the
school is excellent just to give one

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900
school is excellent just to give one
 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.710
school is excellent just to give one
example standardized exams have a very

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720
example standardized exams have a very
 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.120
example standardized exams have a very
difficult time assessing whether a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130
difficult time assessing whether a
 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.580
difficult time assessing whether a
student can write which in my view is

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590
student can write which in my view is
 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.380
student can write which in my view is
one of the most important if not the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390
one of the most important if not the
 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.290
one of the most important if not the
most important skill that emerges after

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300
most important skill that emerges after
 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.010
most important skill that emerges after
12 years of schooling you much more

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020
12 years of schooling you much more
 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.450
12 years of schooling you much more
easily can measure that through

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460
easily can measure that through
 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.790
easily can measure that through
something like a writing portfolio where

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800
something like a writing portfolio where
 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.280
something like a writing portfolio where
you get a sample of a kid's writing

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
you get a sample of a kid's writing
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.810
you get a sample of a kid's writing
every two weeks in different disciplines

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820
every two weeks in different disciplines
 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.290
every two weeks in different disciplines
and sort of see over the course of the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300
and sort of see over the course of the
 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.570
and sort of see over the course of the
year what was the student writing in

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580
year what was the student writing in
 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.550
year what was the student writing in
September and what was the student

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560
September and what was the student
 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.820
September and what was the student
writing in June and assessing that for

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830
writing in June and assessing that for
 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.840
writing in June and assessing that for
content for form for grammar all of that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850
content for form for grammar all of that
 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.510
content for form for grammar all of that
to me is a much more robust measure of

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520
to me is a much more robust measure of
 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.790
to me is a much more robust measure of
whether the school is being successful

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800
whether the school is being successful
 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.200
whether the school is being successful
and the students are being successful

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210
and the students are being successful
 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.120
and the students are being successful
than a standardized tests which are

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130
than a standardized tests which are
 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.190
than a standardized tests which are
important in my view but represent a

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200
important in my view but represent a
 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.870
important in my view but represent a
relatively low bar one of the things

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880
relatively low bar one of the things
 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.880
relatively low bar one of the things
that we that we're trying to do is is

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890
that we that we're trying to do is is
 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.580
that we that we're trying to do is is
really have the teachers get a lot out

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590
really have the teachers get a lot out
 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.650
really have the teachers get a lot out
of the school environment as well I'm

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660
of the school environment as well I'm
 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.210
of the school environment as well I'm
obviously that's a focus of the school

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
obviously that's a focus of the school
 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.250
obviously that's a focus of the school
the idea that a school is not just for

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260
the idea that a school is not just for
 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.710
the idea that a school is not just for
students it's also a place where adults

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720
students it's also a place where adults
 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.460
students it's also a place where adults
work and I think if you have a school

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470
work and I think if you have a school
 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.190
work and I think if you have a school
that buys into the mythology that
