00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.066
In this lesson,

00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:04.640
we will first discuss the IP layer
security protocol called IPSec.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.850
We will cover the main
mechanisms of IPSec.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.660
And the Internet key exchange
protocol that is used to set up

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.550
the IPSec security parameters.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.030
We will then briefly discuss
the transport layer security protocol.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.420
These protocols are based on
the cryptographic operations and

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.950
security protocols that we have
covered in previous lessons.
