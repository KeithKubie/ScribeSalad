00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.309
Take this pen, and this bit of paper.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.420
Peg it on here.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.380
What's happening? 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.340
It's going bigger! And what else is happening?

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.750
It's gone blue!

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.750
Yeah it's gone blue.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.440
Is there anything else apart form the blue you can see?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.700
Black! I can see light pink.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.710
So we started off with a black dot, and the water's gone through the black dot.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.270
What do you think that means that we're now seeing these different colours?

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.650
That the blue is separating from the black and the pink is separating from the black.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.310
Very good Samantha!

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.980
I've got some strips of paper here, and we've got some different pens.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.380
What do you think might happen? 
It'll turn another colour?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.000
Would you like to try? Yeah!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.860
Don't put the dot in the water,

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.389
just dip the end of the paper in. That's it! Then peg it over the top.

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:31.060
Shall we watch and see what happens to the colours?

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.300
You both used different pens, didn't you?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.320
Mine is blacker.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.200
Mine is more blue.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.140
And mine isn't turning any colour. 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.140
It's not is it? There's a wee bit of bluey-green.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.540
So what does that tell you about these pens? Do you think these pens were made...

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.040
Differently!

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.020
How can you tell it's not the same black ink? Because it's different colours and patterns.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.650
This process of separating a sample of inks out into its constituent colours

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.060
is known as chromatography. This literally means coloured writing.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.060
It works with ordinary water,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.640
but if you'd like to try adding about a tenth of the volume in salt

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.200
you can get better results depending on
the inks that you use. 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.560
I've used ordinary kitchen roll, but you can also try using different types of paper,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.020
such as coffee filter papers or even
loo roll, so long as it'll absorb the water.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.080
Because different coloured dyes travel at different speeds in the liquid,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.670
an ink that is made up of different dyes, like the black in that I've used, 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.470
can be separated out into its constituent colours.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.310
I've got a puzzle for both of you: 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.730
I've got your initials on these bits of paper,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.380
but we don't know which pen wrote them. How do you think we could figure that out?

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.300
By writing all the pens on the top? That's one way...

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.110
They'll both have different colours 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.450
when the water touches them!

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.250
Yes! So how will that help us to figure out which pen it is?

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.170
Because we've used all the black pens. If one looks exactly like one of those, 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.050
we know which pen was used. Yes!

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.829
Do you think they'll all look the same when they're dry?

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.879
This one looks like that one!

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.319
We've had loads of fun doing this experiment. If you'd like to learn more about chromatography,

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.340
don't forgot to log on to the website and download our worksheet.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.390
We'd love to see your photographs and videos of you doing this activity too,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.450
And don't forget to subscribe for more great experiments
