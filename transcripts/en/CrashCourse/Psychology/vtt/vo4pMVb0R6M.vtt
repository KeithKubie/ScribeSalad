00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.759
That dream about the dinosaur in the leotard,
those times that you said that thing that

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.020
you know you shouldn't have said, or even
that thing you didn't even know you were gonna

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.800
say. The little cogs of your consciousness
cranking away, making your life possible,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.231
making society function, all of the things
that you're so glad you can do and all of

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:21.160
the ones that you wish you could stop doing.
Excluding other human minds, your mind is

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.020
the most complicated piece of the universe
that humans currently know about. The rules

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.230
that govern it are mysterious and elusive.
Maybe our brains just aren't complex enough

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.120
to understand themselves. But that's not going
to stop us from trying!

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.600
The word 'psychology' comes from the Latin
for the "study of the soul." And while its

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.030
formal definition has evolved over the last
several decades, today we can safely call

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.110
it the science of behavior and mental processes.
The term 'psychology' wasn't coined until

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.630
around the turn of the sixteenth century,
and the practice that we would actually call

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.560
science today wasn't established until the
mid-1800s. But of course, humans have always

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.290
been curious about themselves and what's going
on up here. Aristotle pondered the seed of

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.760
human consciousness and decided that it was
in the heart, not the head -- being, as we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.740
have seen quite a lot here on Crash Course,
absolutely and completely wrong.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.830
Two thousand years ago, Chinese rulers conducted
the world's first psychological exams, requiring

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.040
public officials to take personality and intelligence
tests. And in the late 800s, Persian doctor

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.690
Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Rhazes, also known
as Rhazes, was one of the first to describe

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.890
mental illness, and even treated patients
in what was essentially a very early psych

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.360
ward in his Baghdad hospital.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.200
From the efforts of those early thinkers up
until today, the field of psychology has been

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.960
all about tackling some of the big questions:
How can humans do horrible things like commit

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.980
genocide and torture other humans, and how
come we know those things are horrible? Do

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.310
we have free will, or are we simply driven
by our environment, biology, and non-conscious

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.840
influences? What is mental illness, and what
can we do about it? And what is consciousness?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.120
Or the notion of self? If I lose my awareness
of myself, am I still human?

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.120
I DON'T KNOW!

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.690
But over the next 6 months, these are the
questions that we're gonna be exploring together:

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.659
how our brains work, how they can break, how
they can be healed, why we behave the way

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:16.139
we do, even when we don't want to, and what
it means to be thinking and feeling and alive.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:21.459
[Intro]

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.290
When hearing the word psychology, most people
probably think of a therapist listening to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.680
a patient unpacking the details of his day
while reclining on a couch. Maybe that therapist

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.120
is wearing glasses, chewing on a cigar, stroking
his whiskered chin.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.269
Admit it! If you're thinking about psychology,
you're probably picturing Freud.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.689
Sigmund Freud was one of the most tremendously
influential and controversial thinkers of

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:46.049
his time, maybe of all time. His theories
helped build our views on childhood, personality,

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.920
dreams and sexuality. And his work fueled
a legacy of both support and opposition.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.590
His life was long and spanned an important
swath of history from the American Civil War

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.809
to World War II. But like most great scientists,
Freud developed his revolutionary ideas by

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:02.680
building on the work of others, and of course
innovation in the field didn't stop with him.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.319
In truth, psychology is one of the most wildly
diverse sciences in terms of the questions

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.590
it proposes, the methods it applies, and the
different schools of thought and disciplines

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.590
it contains.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.870
Perhaps more than any other science, psychology
is just a big old integrated melting pot.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.780
For instance, right around Freud's time, there
were a lot of different schools of thought

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.510
of about how the study of the human mind should
be tackled. Mainly, there were the ideas of

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.760
structuralism, functionalism and psychoanalysis.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.319
Scientific psychology got its start in 1879
in Germany when physician Wilhelm Wundt set

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.529
up the first psychology laboratory at the
University of Leipzig just a few years after

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:44.239
publishing his Principles of Physiological
Psychology, considered the first true psychology

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.239
textbook.

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.839
Wundt and his student Edward Bradford Titchener
took cues from chemists and physicists and

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:54.559
argued that if those people could break down
all matter into simple elements or structures,

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:56.920
why couldn't they do the same for the brain?

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.529
They tried to understand the structures of
consciousness by getting patients to look

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:06.030
inward, asking them how they felt when they
watched the sun set, or smelled a coffee,

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.340
or licked a kitten, or whatever.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.979
Titchener named this approach 'structuralism',
but despite its rigid sounding name, it really

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:16.820
relied so much on introspection that it became
too subjective. I mean, you may sense and

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.810
feel something different that I do, even if
we lick the same kitten. Psychologists, of

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.120
course, can't actually observe a patient's
inner thoughts or feelings, so ultimately,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.870
the structuralist school of thought was fairly
short-lived.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.540
By contrast, American physician and philosopher
William James proposed a different set of

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.580
questions, focusing on why we think and feel
and smell and lick, or whatever. Basically,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.090
he focused on the function of behavior. This
approach, 'functionalism', was based on Charles

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.570
Darwin's idea that adaptive behaviors are
conserved throughout the evolutionary process.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.840
James published his seminal book, The Principles
of Psychology, in 1890, defining psychology

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.550
as the science of mental life, just as Freud
was starting to flex his big brain.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.940
Sigmund Freud began his medical career at
a Viennese hospital, but in 1886, he started

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.710
his own practice, specializing in nervous
disorders. During this time, Freud witnessed

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.220
his colleague Josef Breuer treat a patient
called Anna O with a new talking cure. Basically,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.250
he just let her talk about her symptoms. The
more she talked and pulled up traumatic memories,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.590
the more her symptoms were reduced. It was
a breakthrough, and it changed Freud forever.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.160
From then on, Freud encouraged his patients
to talk freely about whatever came to mind,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.430
to free associate. This technique provided
the basis for his career, and an entire branch

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.430
of psychology.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.890
In 1900 he published his book The Interpretation
of Dreams, where he introduced his theory

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.190
of psychoanalysis. Now, you probably think
of psychoanalysis as a treatment -- the whole

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.310
patient on the couch scenario. And that's
definitely part of it. But Freud's concept

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.150
was actually a lot more complex than that,
and it was revolutionary.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.590
A radical kernel of psychoanalysis was the
theory that our personalities are shaped by

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.950
unconscious motives. Basically Freud suggested
that we're all profoundly affected by mental

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.040
processes that we're not even aware of.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.910
Now that sounds almost obvious to us now,
but part of the genius of Freud's theory was

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.780
that in 1900, it wasn't obvious at all. The
idea that our minds could be driven by something

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.051
that our minds themselves didn't know about
was hard to grasp. As hard as like, uhh, maybe

00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:25.400
organisms evolving by natural selection. It
was abstract, invisible, and there was something

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.650
about it that seemed irrational.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.561
But the other important part of Freud's theory
was that the unconscious, literally the thing

00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:35.590
below consciousness, was still discoverable.
Even though you weren't aware of it, you could

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.940
come to understand it through a therapeutic
technique that used dreams, projections and

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.390
free association to root out repressed feelings
and and gain self-insight.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.980
So what Freud was really saying was that mental
disorders could be healed through talk therapy

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:54.230
and self-discovery. And this was a really
big breakthrough. Because prior to this, people

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.800
with mental illnesses would be confined to
sanatoriums and at best given menial labor

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.730
to do and at worst, shackled to a bed frame.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.990
After The Interpretations of Dreams, Freud
went on to publish over 20 more books and

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.510
countless papers with an iconic cigar in hand
all the while. He believed smoking helped

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.682
him think, but it also helped him get jaw
cancer. During the last sixteen years of his

00:07:14.682 --> 00:07:19.120
life, he underwent at least thirty painful
operations while continuing to smoke.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:24.210
By the late 1930s, the Nazis had taken over
Austria, and Freud and his Jewish family narrowly

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.770
escaped to England. By September 1939, the
pain in his cancerous jaw was too great and

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.300
a doctor friend assisted him in suicide through
morphine injection. He was eighty-three.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.880
Whether you love him or hate him - and make
no mistake, plenty of people vehemently disagreed

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.440
with him - there is no question that Freud's
impact on psychology was monumental. While

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.490
competing theories in the young field of psychology
either fell away or evolved into something

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.920
else, psychoanalysis remains an important
concept and practice today.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.510
The next big shake-up rolled in during the
first half of the 20th century when behaviorism

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:00.280
gained a higher profile. Heavy hitters like
Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.300
were key players here. They focused on the
study of observable behavior. You may remember

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.510
Skinner as the dude who put rats and pigeons
and babies in boxes and conditioned them to

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.840
perform certain behaviors. Right around when
Freud escaped to England, Skinner published

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.730
his Behavior of Organisms, ushering in the
era of behaviorism which remained all the

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.480
rage well into the 1960s.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.430
The other major force at the time was, of
course, Freud's psychoanalysis, and its many

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.600
descendents collectively known as the psychodynamic
theories. These focused on the importance

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.879
of early experiences in shaping the unconsciousness
and how that process affects our thoughts,

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:37.789
feelings, behaviors, and personalities.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:41.930
By the mid-20th century, other major forces
in psychology were also brewing -- schools

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:46.680
we'll explore later in this course including
humanist psychology, which focuses on nurturing

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.499
personal growth; cognitive science and neuroscience,
all of which contributed their own unique

00:08:51.499 --> 00:08:53.139
takes on the study of mind.

00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:57.660
Today's formal definition of psychology, the
study of behavior and mental processes, is

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.069
a nice amalgamation that pulls from all these
different schools of thought. It recognizes

00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:06.350
the need for observing and recording behavior,
whether that's screaming, crying or playing

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.500
air saxophone to an imaginary audience, but
it also gives credit to our mental processes:

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.560
what we think and feel and believe while we're
tearing it up on our invisible instruments.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.309
Because again, the point I really want you
to take home is that psychology is an integrative

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:24.850
science. Yes, folks still get grumpy and disagree
plenty, but the essence of the discipline

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.370
has everything to do with creating different
ways of asking interesting questions and attempting

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:34.389
to answer them through all kinds of data-gathering
methods. The human mind is complicated. There

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:40.019
is no single way to effectively crack it open;
it must be pried at from all sides.

00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:44.249
Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich has gazed
into the distant horizon of space, and even

00:09:44.249 --> 00:09:49.529
he has acknowledged that the human brain is
by far the most complex physical object known

00:09:49.529 --> 00:09:55.470
to us in the entire cosmos. And we all get
to have one! Of our very own! Just knocking

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.680
around right up in here.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.990
We here at Crash Course are really excited
to spend the next several months delving into

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:04.899
the world of psychology -- how it applies
to our lives, our minds, and our hearts, and

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:08.889
how it deepens our understanding of each other,
our world, and ourselves.
