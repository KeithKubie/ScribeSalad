FEMALE SPEAKER: Please join me
in welcoming to Google New

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.110
York Nathan Myhrvold.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.910
So Nathan, you wanted to start
with a presentation about the

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.510
book and give an overview.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.090
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Yeah, let me
show some pictures, and then

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.230
we can talk.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sounds good.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.660
And then we'll open it up
for Q&amp;A at the end.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.910
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Great.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.770
So I'm going to tell you a
little bit about "Modernist

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.870
Cuisine At Home." In 2011, we
released this book, "Modernist

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.010
Cuisine." This is what we call
the big book, which was an

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.860
encyclopedic treatment of all
aspects of cooking and the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.730
science behind it.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.240
So the really interesting
question is,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.940
what do we do next?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.330
And one next thing after that
that we could do, may still

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.260
do, would be pastry baking and
dessert, because the first

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.110
book didn't cover that.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.060
But as our next act, we decided,
in fact, we would do

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.710
modernist cuisine
at home instead.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.440
And the idea was basically that
modernist cuisine was

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.265
about sort of the no holds
barred approach to cooking.

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:13.180
There are recipes that require
a centrifuge, or a rotary

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.640
evaporator, or all kinds of
things that most people--

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.480
I have them at home, but
most people don't

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.980
have them at home.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.060
So we decided we would do a book
that would take the same

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.710
ideas as "Modernist Cuisine,"
but apply them in a way that

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280
was a smaller, little bit
less daunting book.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.230
It's a little pamphlet,
like 700 pages.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: It weighs more
than my child, we were

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.760
deciding earlier.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.690
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: And try to do
stuff that would address

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.900
things that people
could do at home.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.540
So every recipe in here,
you can do at home.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.610
It doesn't require unusual
equipment.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.780
And it doesn't require
unusual ingredients.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.060
And we also tried to really
focus on practical techniques

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.560
and use lots of photography to
make it really easy to see

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.230
what's going on.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.350
One side of these shows
our step by steps.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.000
The other thing shows what
we call a cutaway.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.570
This is where we show
you the magic

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.720
view inside your equipment.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.870
The people at Viking
gave us this Viking

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.389
stove to cook with.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.699
We cooked with it for a while.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.180
And then we cut it in half.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.240
It's sort of like the 4H kid
that gets a little calf, and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.880
raises it up, and then, oops.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.730
But we cut it in half
so you can see what

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.510
it looks like inside.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.370
Like the first book, we have
a washable kitchen manual.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.320
It's on washable waterproof
paper.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.750
That's so you can take it in
the kitchen, get it dirty.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.200
It's a little bit smaller
format, too.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.520
And it folds back on itself,
because it's spiral bound.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.190
And we kind of consider this
the next part of "Modernist

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.400
Cuisine," yet it's focusing
on home cooking.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.800
And home cooking just
means two things.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.480
One is what I said earlier, that
it's a set of stuff that

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.530
you can do at home from an
equipment perspective.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.915
But equally important is that
it's a set of cooking recipes

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:02.560
that are less formal.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.810
In the first book, we've got
recipes from Ferran Adria, and

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.790
Thomas Keller, and Heston
Blumenthal, and all the best

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.370
chefs in the world.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.250
You don't typically cook that
food at home all the time.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.620
In the new book, we have a
chapter on mac and cheese.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.980
We have a chapter on
chicken wings, and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.420
other skewered snacks.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.960
So it's a little bit less formal
style, in addition to

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.210
being a little bit more
accessible from an equipment

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.560
perspective.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.150
So here's uncompromising
physical quality.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.730
I wish I could say that about
myself, but by god, I can say

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.700
it about my book.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.520
So we tried to make the physical
aspect of the book

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.630
kind of cool.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.580
It's big, it uses great paper.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.330
This is sort of nerdy, but I
figured I'm at Google, so that

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.000
should be OK.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.240
But when you typically print a
picture in a book, it uses

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.130
half tone screen, and this is
what it looks like when you

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.550
blow it up.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.120
It's 175 line.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.850
An art book would use
a 200 line screen.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.200
But this whole idea of using a
fixed screen is sort of an old

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.430
analog world concept.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.690
It's still done.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.960
We used something called
stochastic screening, which

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.860
uses an error diffusion
algorithm, and the dots are

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.590
now all created digitally.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.410
And you can see, it just
looks a lot better.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.520
Here's another thing most
people don't realize.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.930
The gamut is the
range of colors

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.630
that inks can represent.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.980
And most inks have a hard time
with really saturated colors.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.250
So here's a picture from the
book where the grey shows the

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.480
stuff you can't actually
represent in the color gamut.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.700
Well, if you buy something
called Chroma Centric inks,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.000
you can show it all.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.030
And so people will ask us, how
did you get all of that color

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.410
in those pictures?

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.170
Is that because you digitally
processed it?

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.750
And we said, no, we actually
sprung for the expensive ink.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.080
Because it turns it you just
can't represent some colors,

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.410
particularly highly
saturated colors.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.040
You'll see it's the tomato, for
example, and some of the

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.230
greens in the apple, or the
greens in that cauliflower.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.290
Those are the things that don't
come across, because

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.425
they're highly saturated.

00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:23.120
Now, of course, a good question
is, why the hell am I

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.760
doing a book at all?

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.985
Why is it physical?

00:05:26.985 --> 00:05:30.550
And the original answer for
"Modernist Cuisine" is that at

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.370
the time we started, there
were no tablet computers,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.300
except for the first version of
Kindle, which was tiny and

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.080
black and white.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.485
There was no iPad.

00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:40.730
It hadn't come out.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.250
And so we had to choose a
platform, and we chose print.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.790
But here's the other reason--

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.790
here's a picture from the
original book, and here's what

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.480
it looks like on Kindle
and on an iPad.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.340
And once you decide you're going
to do layout for a big,

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.630
big high resolution display that
you're going to get this

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.790
close to, it's hard
to just change it.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.820
Of course you could do it.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:12.060
But if you just literally took
the PDFs from the book and

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.250
just said, I'm going to move
them onto a tablet, it's not

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.590
very usable, because you're
always scrolling one way and

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.880
scrolling another way.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.400
It also, to me, is
kind of boring.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.310
Because if you just took the
PDFs, you don't have any of

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.960
the things that's magical about
an interactive platform.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.490
So we're talking about one
possible future project is to

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.310
make a really interactive
version.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.720
But then that actually starts
getting to be real work,

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.350
because you have to animate, and
you want to have a lot of

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.870
things live, and you have
to have a little

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:41.880
different user interface.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.320
So at some point, yeah.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.090
For now, actually, print is a
great way to deliver large,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.610
high resolution pictures
to people.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.830
And particularly, if I target
the people in this room or in

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.930
the tech industry, then tablets
would be even more

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:57.480
appropriate.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.950
But if I want to have influence
with lots of

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.250
traditional chefs around the
world and give them an ability

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.380
to step up, actually print is
probably a better platform

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.180
from that perspective
at the moment.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.840
So here's some fun facts
about the new book.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:17.120
Two volumes, 9.9 pounds
unpacked, 684 pages, 228 of

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.090
which are waterproof.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:28.200
23 chapters, 210,000 words,
405 recipes, 114 that have

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.410
step by step photos.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:35.250
And we took about 86,000
pictures, of which 1,500 are

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.120
in the book.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.760
So here's how we can sort of
put it in perspective.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.590
If you took "Modernist Cuisine
At Home," and you put it all

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.310
in one line of text at the same
type size, it would be

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.170
1.4 miles long, and that would
stretch from 14th Street up to

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.720
42nd Street.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.550
So several subway stops.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.890
And of course we're here.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.660
That's the you are here.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.580
"Modernist Cuisine," the big
one, that actually would go

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:10.450
from lower Manhattan all the
way up to 116th Street.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.450
So here's another comparison.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.840
People will say, why is this
book so expensive?

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.750
And we say, well, look.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.000
The first book was $625.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.540
List price, street price,
maybe $460.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.980
The new book is $140.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.970
Currently the street
price is $130.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.610
I'd be surprised if that
didn't go down.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.140
I have no way to control street
price, of course.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.039
That's what retailers
sell it at.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:41.030
But it's only $0.41 per recipe,
and $0.35 per recipe

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.130
in the new book.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.100
It's $15.63 a pound for this,
but only $14.00 a pound.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.900
How does that compare?

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.160
Parmesan-Reggiano
is $19 a pound.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.760
We are cheaper than
Parmesan cheese.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.610
So if you love cheese, you
should love this book.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.815
It's cheaper.

00:08:59.815 --> 00:09:01.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
a good sales pitch.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.920
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Yeah, I've been
I'm trying to come out of

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.340
being a programmer and actually
learn how to sell.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.700
As I said before, we've got lots
of step by step photos.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.930
I don't think we have a single
page that doesn't have a color

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.060
photo on it.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.220
Here was another.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.490
In "Modernist Cuisine," we
decided we would have

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.470
everything with weights.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.360
But our new motto is,
now with teaspoons!

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: For
the home cook.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.830
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Because
home cooks--

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.340
now, when people ask, what's the
first gadget they should

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.860
buy for their kitchen, I
always say a digital

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.040
thermometer.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.210
And then the second one
is a digital scale.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.490
And they're like $20.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.830
This is not like any kind
of expensive thing.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.000
But once you get into it,
weighing ingredients is faster

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.060
and more accurate than
measuring them out.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.920
And you don't have to worry
about leveling it.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.430
And you don't have to worry
about is your sugar clumping a

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.080
different way, or some
other things.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.930
So I highly recommend
the weight approach.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.285
But now we have teaspoons,
by god.

00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:00.670
Whenever we do a recipe,
we like to have lots of

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:04.330
variations on those recipes.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.330
So here was something.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.945
One spread shows pesto, and we
started off making pesto.

00:10:08.945 --> 00:10:10.780
And then we went, what the hell,
let's make a whole bunch

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.260
of pesto-like sauces.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.940
We started off with a chapter
on chicken wings.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.210
And then we said, let's make
yakitori style chicken wings.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:22.190
But then if you like yakitori,
tsukune, these chicken

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.380
meatballs are really cool.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.580
And then pretty soon
we had saute, and

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.610
tons of other skewers.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.530
So we love having variations.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.600
And we want to encourage people
to mess around and do

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.770
cool new things with cooking.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.665
It's not about here's a
recipe for one thing.

00:10:37.665 --> 00:10:39.270
Lots of books will do that.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.860
We try to say, here's a
principle, and here's an

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.100
example, and now here's a couple
other examples, and

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.870
then experiment yourself and
go take it other places.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.840
We have some tables.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.130
We had a lot of tables
in the big book.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.830
We have fewer in
the small book.

00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.970
But here, if you're cooking
meat, there isn't a right way

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.120
to cook it.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.750
If you want it rare or medium
rare or pink or medium,

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.460
there's different levels and
different temperatures,

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.186
different times that
you can use.

00:11:09.186 --> 00:11:11.860
So we try to provide all
that information.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.660
We do have things on sous
vide in the new book.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.590
And sous vide is something that
most people don't have

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.360
the equipment for, but
increasingly they are.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.450
So we decided it was fair to
put that in the new book.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.270
But we also have lots of
alternatives that don't

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.660
require the equipment.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.025
So we have a sous vide salmon
recipe where you just cook it

00:11:27.025 --> 00:11:28.160
in the sink.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.440
Just run the hot water.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.070
We have sous vide steaks for
camping or tailgate parties,

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.280
where you fill a big cooler full
of hot water, put your

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.510
steaks in Ziploc bags.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.750
Just put them in there,
no electric

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:42.470
device or anything else.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: No burgers
at your house, are there?

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.116
Just, like, regular?

00:11:45.116 --> 00:11:47.130
Do you eat just like
a normal sandwich?

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.800
Never.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.960
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: If I'm making
it, usually it's not normal.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.260
But I mean, tonight, I'm giving
a talk at the American

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.320
Museum of Natural History.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.450
And so we're going to
Shake Shack first.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.670
Because it's the only
pragmatic way to

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.860
get fed in a certain--

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.130
and they do good stuff.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.650
The first book had lots of
ingredients that are pretty

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.040
difficult to find.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.420
In this new book, we use
ingredients which

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.960
are all easy to find.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.150
But they still might not
be totally familiar.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:24.540
And again, we thought
that was OK.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.750
So we have things that
involve agar.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.035
People say, isn't that
some weird chemical?

00:12:29.035 --> 00:12:31.630
And I say, well, actually, it's
been used in Asia for

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.550
1,000 years.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.040
It's actually more traditional
than gelatin by that standard.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.450
It's been around for longer.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.290
But between that and a whole
variety of these other

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.600
things-- whey protein powder
from the health food store, or

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.770
xanthin gum, which is
in essentially every

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:48.570
grocery store now.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:52.000
Because you can't make gluten
free muffins without xanthin.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.720
As a result, it's
always there.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.300
And we're just saying, hey,
now you can use it for

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.010
something besides gluten
free muffins.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.670
You can thicken sauces
with it.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.560
We have a lot of science in this
new book, not as much as

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.450
the previous book.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.000
But we have a lot of things that
we describe the science

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.950
of things, and then try to
provide pointers off to

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.410
people, either in the web or
other books, or the big book

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:18.890
that will explain things more.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.680
Hell of a process
making the book.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.060
Here's a few of the photos.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.800
Here's one of our fun toys.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.360
This is an ultra high
speed camera.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.270
It shoots HD quality
720p video at

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.550
6,200 frames per second.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.640
So this lets us do
things like this.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.490
Now, what I love about this is
when I was a kid, I'd watch

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.300
these Roadrunner cartoons.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.170
And the roadrunner would run off
the edge of the cliff, and

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:44.770
so would the coyote.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.720
But the coyote would only fall
after he looked down.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.300
So nobody told the water it was
time to fall yet, so it

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:53.420
kind of sits there.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.530
I'll run through a few of the
spreads from the book, and

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.110
we'll talk a little bit about
it, and then we can turn into

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.360
more of a conversation.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.130
This is our chapter on stocking

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.440
the modernist kitchen.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.080
It's about different kinds
of equipment, basically--

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.310
countertop tools.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.640
It turns out if you take a
picture of a blender while

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:20.610
it's pureeing tomatoes, you
make a hell of a mess.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.680
But we had this great principle
that it only has to

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.570
look good for a thousandth
of a second.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:26.810
After that, if it all goes to
hell, that's our problem.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.920
That's not the viewer's
problem.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.410
Here's what a whipping siphon
looks like from the inside,

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.220
and we explain how you can use
this for making whipped cream

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.870
or other kind of whipped foam
things, but also for all kinds

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.270
of other stuff.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.770
Again, this is not a
piece of equipment

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:42.770
everybody finds at home.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.140
But they're like $20.

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.150
And they're in every Williams
Sonoma, so we

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.010
thought it was fair game.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.540
Here's our pressure cooker.

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.780
We like pressure cookers.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.740
There's a lot of pressure cooker
recipes in the book.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.690
Here's our Viking stove
cut in half.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.580
Microwave oven.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.550
I was just on the Rachael Ray
Show right before coming here

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.040
where I actually did two
microwave things.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.385
Watch closely, and we'll
discuss it afterwards.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:16.830
So that's popcorn.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, amazing.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:19.830
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Now, the cool
thing about this from a

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:23.810
science perspective is that when
water flashes into steam,

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.260
it expands in volume by
a factor of 1,600.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.770
So right now, a tiny
crack has formed.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.160
This is a steam rocket,
basically.

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.710
And it's coming up,
and it's trying

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.200
to relieve the pressure.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.040
And it's relieving the pressure
a little bit by

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.920
leaking out, but that crack has
also caused a fatal flaw

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.530
in the skin of the popcorn.

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:43.400
So you can watch it expand
a little bit.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.460
It's trying to relieve
the pressure.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.370
But ultimately it's not
enough, and woosh.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.440
Open it goes.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.410
That's why the high speed
camera is so much fun.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.420
And here's what a microwave
looks like on the inside,

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.260
including, we discuss what
happens inside the cavity

00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.280
magnetron, which is where the
microwaves are actually made.

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.840
In the big book, we also have
instructions for how you can

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.590
measure the speed of light
with Velveeta and your

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.420
microwave oven.

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.560
Do try that at home.

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.000
Here's how we do
those cutaways.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.160
We have a machine shop.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.080
Machine shop is part of our lab,
and so I highly recommend

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.330
having a machine shop.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.950
Well, actually, I originally
had a machine shop at home.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.350
But it's even nicer to have it
in a place where people can

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.550
run it 24 hours a day and
clean up for you.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.570
As a programmer myself, I love
that most of these machines

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.140
are also really programmable,
so you can actually control

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.570
them all by writing programs.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.610
Here's one of our
cool machines.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.550
This is called an EDM machine.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.130
See that wire?

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.000
That wire has got a tremendous
amount of electricity coming

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:55.480
through it.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.640
Sparks jump off the electricity
underwater.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.770
And those sparks actually
are able to cut

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.290
almost any form of metal.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:05.099
So here, we're cutting a
cast iron Dutch oven.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.565
And we speeded this up a little
bit, it's kind of slow.

00:17:07.565 --> 00:17:10.829
We drain the water
off, and voila!

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:14.329
We have cut it in half.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:15.099
FEMALE SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.440
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: And between the
other pieces of equipment,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.339
we can cut glass.

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.530
We can cut almost anything
in half like that.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.680
In fact, I like to say we have
two halves of one of the best

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.060
kitchens in the world.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.260
You can see a couple of those
that have the red glue on it.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.230
That's a high temperature
silicone.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.730
So we take a piece of Pyrex,
we put a bead of the high

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:36.720
temperature silicon on them.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.460
We glue the piece of Pyrex glass
to the edge of the pan.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.980
So we can actually cook in it.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.630
Now, that gives us that
red goopy look.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.170
And so that's where we use the
little digital technology.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.280
When you cut a pan in half,
you get two halves.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.570
So we put the other half in the
same position and take a

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:58.430
picture, and that gives
us the image bit for

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.570
the edge of the pan.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.140
And then we substitute that in
for where that red goop is,

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.320
very much like the way in a
Hollywood movie, Spider-Man

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.490
will fly through the air
supported by wires, then you

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:16.260
digitally remove the wires, and
he's flying without it.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.430
Tons of other cool things
in the book.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.260
Here's two of them.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.130
Most of the flavor
of chargrilling

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:26.260
comes from fat flareups.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.810
And one of the reasons when
people grill zucchini, the

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.860
zucchini doesn't taste all that
charbroiled is there's no

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:35.070
fat in zucchini to drip.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.860
A steak, there's
plenty of fat.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.600
It renders out, it drips,
you get a fat flareup.

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.660
That's what gives you the
charbroiled flavor.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.160
So what do you do if you
want your zucchini

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.510
to taste this way?

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.120
You spritz olive oil
on the fire.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.490
Works great.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.340
And if you really want to
sear something, you want

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.290
the fire from hell?

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.730
You take a hair dryer and you
stick it up the vent of your

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.980
Webber, and boy, oh boy.

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:01.770
You can actually get it going
enough that if the coals are

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.840
against the side of the Webber,
they'll go through.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.030
So don't do that.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: So for that
photograph, the one that you

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:12.580
were just showing us, is that
where you put the glass on it?

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.400
And then you actually cooked
to make that photograph?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.850
NATHAN MYHRVOLD:
Let me go back.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:23.490
So the answer is no, because
the coals are so hot they

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.910
would break the glass.

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.636
There's nothing in
front of that.

00:19:27.636 --> 00:19:30.340
Some people say, well, but
wouldn't the coals fall?

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.350
And we say, of course
they would fall.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:32.920
That's why Johnny was
underneath there

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.970
with a pair of tongs.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:39.210
And every time they would
fall, he'd put it back.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.600
We made a hell of a mess so you
could get a cool picture.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.830
One of our guys lost his
eyebrows twice in things

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:47.410
flaring up.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.456
It's a real process.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.760
So anyway, here's
fat flareups.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.540
This is what happens.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:58.290
Here the fat is dropping down.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.680
Initially, it spends most of the
energy actually vaporizing

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.310
and heating up.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.410
And then finally it catches.

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.760
And it's that fat flareup
that makes most of the

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.545
characteristic chargrilled
flavor.

00:20:11.545 --> 00:20:13.350
The difference between grilling
and broiling is

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.810
broiling, the heat's
on the top.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.140
And so no fat can drip on it.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:18.320
And so you don't get
those flavors.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.890
And that's really
the difference.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.110
Here's a close up of that
same picture here.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.180
Here's our hamburgers.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.280
And there's nothing
holding those in.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.790
We've just sort of propped
them right at the edge.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:32.280
And they kept falling.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.760
We have a big chapter
on ingredients.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.660
Ingredients, of course, really
central to all of cooking.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.600
Something on basics.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.582
This is about making
sauces and stocks.

00:20:46.582 --> 00:20:51.080
A chapter on eggs, salads,
and cold soups.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:56.170
Turns out you need about two or
three pounds of raspberries

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.060
dropped one or two at a time
before you get the timing

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.740
right to get a photo
like this.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.380
You drop them, and there's a
bunch of ways you can set up

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.290
light beams to trigger.

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:09.870
But there's variations enough
that fundamentally, several

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.450
pounds of raspberries dropped.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: And Nathan,
you took a lot of these

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.160
photographs yourself, correct?

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.210
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: That's right.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.970
Yeah, I originally was going
to take all of them.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.110
But I got a lot of other
things to do.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.240
But I took quite
a few of them.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.860
And then our photo team
took the rest.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:34.600
Here's salad making, pressure
cooked vegetable soups.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.810
We had a recipe in Modernist
Cuisine for carrot soup that

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.760
was one of the most
popular recipes.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:43.550
So we took it and made a whole
chapter out of it, tried lots

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:46.650
of other ingredients, managed
to make it work with some--

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.230
the first version actually
used a centrifuge.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:53.020
So we weaned ourselves
off the centrifuge.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.770
And here's a bunch
of those soups.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:56.760
Steak.

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.580
We have a whole chapter
on steak.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.830
Carnitas.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.310
Braised short ribs.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.000
So if that doesn't make
you hungry, well

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.900
then, you're a vegan.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:13.370
But, see pressure cooked
vegetable soups earlier.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:14.620
Roast chicken.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.110
So roast chicken is an
interesting thing.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:22.920
The ideal roast chicken is
fundamentally a contradiction.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.100
You're trying to get the
interior flesh to be juicy and

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.790
the exterior to be crispy.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.500
But they're right beside
each other.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.580
So by the time you've heated
up the skin enough to be

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.830
crispy, you've overcooked
and dried out the flesh.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.310
So one thing people do
is they brine it.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.980
And if you dunk the whole
chicken in salt water, the

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.130
action of the salt
on the proteins--

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.160
the uncooked proteins of the
meat-- actually makes them

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.860
absorb a lot more water.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.020
And so there's a real physical
chemical reason that salt will

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.790
make it juicier.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:55.610
Trouble is, there's protein
in the skin also.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:23:00.890
And when you make the skin
juicy, that's called rubbery.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:02.015
So what do you do?

00:23:02.015 --> 00:23:06.570
And the answer is, we used
syringes to inject the brine

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.580
into the meat without getting
any on the skin.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.530
Now, you can say that's kind of
a freaky thing to do, but

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.100
it turns out you can get
syringes all over the place.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.740
When I first started coming to
New York, it was Union Square

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:23.070
Park you'd go to get syringes.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:27.010
But in fact, there was another
park in the city which was

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.650
informally called Needle Park.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.240
But you can get syringes
all over the place.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.630
And if you really care about
making the ultimate chicken,

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.500
this is how you do it.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.680
Then the other thing is, we hang
the chicken inside the

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.380
refrigerator like this.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:43.050
That prevents the salt from
accumulating on the skin.

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.100
And if you leave it uncovered
in the fridge with a plate

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.040
underneath it, it lets
the skin dry out.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.000
And that makes it much easier
to make it crispy.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.430
And this is the result.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.330
When you do it right, when you
take the chicken out at the

00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:01.750
end, and you hit it with a tongs
or a spoon, the skin

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.600
will crack.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.340
It's almost like glass.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.290
And then here, we're
serving it.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.170
But we have another whole
chapter on chicken wings.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.710
And I understand in one of the
Google cafeterias today, they

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.120
served a couple of our wings.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: I don't think
they used hypodermic needles

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.210
there, but yes.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.010
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Generally
for the wings, you

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.850
don't need to do.

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.900
We have another technique
for the wings.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.820
Now, chicken noodle soup, sort
of the Jewish penicillin.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:27.830
We thought we'd do a whole
chapter on that.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.570
Here's our salmon chapter.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:32.960
Pizza.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.300
Mac and cheese.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.070
That's the mac and cheese
sauce being made.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.880
And boy, the interesting thing
here is, normally you put a

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.270
lot of starch into a cheese
sauce to keep the fat in the

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.200
cheese from separating.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.410
Cheese is an emulsion.

00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:52.210
And when you heat it up
too hot to melt it,

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:53.450
it separates out.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.020
You've probably seen pizzas
where you get this layer of

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.680
grease on the top, and then the
cheese is kind of stringy

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.360
and disgusting?

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.950
Well, in a sauce, that
really doesn't work.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.860
So the typical thing is, you
put lots of starch in.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.370
Well, that adds a lot
of carbohydrates.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:08.240
But the main thing is,
it dulls the taste.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.990
Because the starch molecules
wind up coating everything, so

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.860
it doesn't taste anywhere near
as cheesy as the cheese does.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:18.610
It's cheese-ish sauce,
not cheese sauce.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.480
Turns out if you add a little
bit of sodium citrate, which

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.530
is in every grocery store in
New York, because it's also

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.680
called sour salt.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:29.420
It's used in Passover.

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.090
It's also the solid form
of citric acid.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.960
Just a little bit of that keeps
the emulsion, and so you

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.460
can make a cheese sauce that
has no starch in it at all,

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.450
and it tastes amazingly
cheesy.

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:45.270
And then if you cast it into
sheets, you can use that to

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.890
make your own melty cheese to
make melted cheese sandwiches.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.000
And we find melted cheese
sandwiches work so much better

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.250
when there's no gravity.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:58.060
Recipes we developed for the
International Space Station.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.420
So anyway, that's some
of the pictures.

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.030
And I thought we could--

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:03.910
FEMALE SPEAKER: Have a chat?

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:04.105
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Yeah.

00:26:04.105 --> 00:26:04.300
Talk about it.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:04.625
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:07.010
That's extraordinary.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:10.175
You know, you call this
"Modernist Cuisine at Home."

00:26:10.175 --> 00:26:13.770
But I feel like your home
kitchen is very different from

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:14.630
my home kitchen.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.530
I think we've gathered that.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.065
I don't have things cut
in half and the like.

00:26:19.065 --> 00:26:23.010
So what do you think I could
make in my New York kitchen

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.230
from your book without
hypodermic

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.840
needles and a blow torch?

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:28.865
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Well, you know,
there's a lot of New

00:26:28.865 --> 00:26:33.010
York kitchens that have
hypodermic needles.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:34.555
FEMALE SPEAKER: Not in this
audience, I'm hoping.

00:26:34.555 --> 00:26:36.730
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: And I
love blow torches.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:40.720
Blow torches are one of the
coolest single tools.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.780
They're $20 at Home Depot.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.320
And when you need intense
heat to touch up.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.520
When you sear a steak, it's
nice if you sear the

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.950
edges of the steak.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:52.310
It just looks a whole
lot nicer.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.490
And you can do that by kind of
holding it up with tongs and

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.270
trying to jam it into the
bottom of the pan.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:57.810
That works.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.000
But it's even easier
to put it on a pan.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.370
And you just take the blow torch
and you go around the

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:03.970
edge of the steak.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.010
So don't dismiss blow torches.

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:11.865
But essentially all of the
recipes in the book you can do

00:27:11.865 --> 00:27:14.060
in your New York kitchen.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:16.890
Some of them will be easier for
you if you get some sous

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:18.270
vide equipment.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.390
Some of them will turn out a
little bit better if you get a

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:23.040
pressure cooker.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.940
But sous vide is the
most exotic we get.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.370
But we thought it would be
kind of a betrayal of our

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.520
roots if we didn't include
sous vide in a home book,

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.350
especially now that every
Williams Sonoma and Sur La

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.170
Table and comparable
stores has them.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.070
So it sort of qualifies.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.610
But for people that don't have
them yet, we say how you can

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.085
approximate it at home.

00:27:45.085 --> 00:27:45.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.870
And what you said, running
things under hot water.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:48.080
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Yeah.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.960
So the thing about sous vide is
that you want an accurate

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.180
thermostat.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.270
In a lot of traditional cooking,
you are the human

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.330
thermostat, either by using a
thermometer, or just by using

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.230
your intuition, you're supposed
to sit there and

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.920
modulate the heat.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.610
Well, digital technology makes
much better thermostats then

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:11.570
we will ever, ever be.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:14.145
And there's some people that
say, well, if I use that,

00:28:14.145 --> 00:28:16.600
you're taking the soul
out of cooking.

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.000
And I say, bullshit.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.020
I do not feel soulful playing
the human thermostat.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.050
Sorry.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:24.100
That's something that
technology can just

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:25.170
do better than me.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.250
So we describe in the book how
you can do sous vide either by

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.900
keeping a pot of water hot on
the stove and playing human

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.400
thermostat.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:39.120
Or if you have a large volume
of water, in the case of the

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.670
salmon recipe, you run the water
in the sink up to about

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:45.700
120, 130 degrees,
you check that.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.080
The tap water will do
in almost all cases.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:50.490
Then you seal the salmon
in plastic bags.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.350
And you just put it in there.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.720
And as long as you've got a
reasonable size sink and not

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.720
too much in the way of salmon,
there's enough heat capacity

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.850
in the water that you don't need
to actually keep actively

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:00.760
heating it to keep it
that temperature.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.140
The temperature will
drop a bit.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:03.590
But that's OK.

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, I mean,
obviously technology is your

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.400
background.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.390
And that's sort of where
you come from.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.310
And technology clearly plays a
huge role in all of your work

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:13.610
on the Modernist series.

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.290
So can you talk a little bit
about that, and how your

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.000
background in technology has
sort of influenced the

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.720
evolution of this series to
the point it's at now?

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.200
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Well, I just
gave you one of the examples

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:25.980
of I don't think it's really bad
to use digital technology

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.760
to control the thermostat
accurately so I can have this

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.890
exactly at the temperature that
I want, or to use scales

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.070
or other sorts of things.

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:37.030
In the case of the first book,
"Modernist Cuisine," I

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:40.950
actually wrote a lot of code in
the process of making the

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:48.050
book, because we did things to
predict the heat distribution

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.780
in a piece of food, or heat
distribution in a pan.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.180
Does it matter that you have
the fancy copper pan?

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:55.880
And the answer is, it really
doesn't matter.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.320
Copper is a much better
heat conductor.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.700
So the idea is, well, you're
going to get all this lateral

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.430
heat movement.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.850
The thing is, the pan's
this big around.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:06.490
The thickness is this much.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.190
So yeah, it's a good
conductor.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:11.480
But laterally, it would have
to go 100 times as

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.260
far as it goes up.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.390
So it doesn't spread that much
unless you have a copper pan

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:16.580
with like, an inch
thick block.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.910
Oh, that would work great.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.670
But then it'd be too heavy to
lift and too expensive to buy.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.790
And in fact, the real issue we
discovered in doing this

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:26.725
modeling is you want to make
sure your pan and your burner

00:30:26.725 --> 00:30:28.450
are well matched.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:32.080
You put a big pan on a little
burner, and no amount of

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.710
fanciness in the pan is
going to help you.

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.610
If you size them appropriately,
and your plan

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.320
is not tissue paper thick,
you'll be fine.

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: I guess
the answer is it

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.480
played a big role.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:43.780
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Yeah.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.120
Technology, well, it's the way I
see the world is through the

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.552
lens of technology
and science.

00:30:50.552 --> 00:30:55.140
I had a reporter in the UK sort
of give me a hard time

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.130
for the first book.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.720
And they said, well, what makes
you think you should

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.030
bring science into
the kitchen?

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.290
I said, I'm sorry, science was
always in the kitchen.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.410
I'm just trying to take
ignorance out.

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:11.930
Because the laws of nature
are how things work.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.140
And you wouldn't say, oh gee,
it's such a shame that the

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.050
architect who built this
building understood how

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:19.480
buildings stand up.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.740
Gosh, isn't that terrible?

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:21.730
No, it's a great thing.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.720
That means we're not going
to come plummeting down.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.880
And for the same reason, giving
people insights as to

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:33.650
how the science actually works
is both cool, if you're

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:36.950
curious, and it's useful.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.190
And so I would like to say our
books are for people who are

00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:42.190
both passionate and curious
about cooking.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:45.260
If you're not passionate about
it, you're not going to buy a

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.020
big fancy book like this.

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.260
You don't necessarily
have to be a cook.

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:52.520
If you're curious enough,
that'll do.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.320
If you're not curious, there's
all kinds of cookbooks you can

00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.960
buy that'll say here's 30 minute
meals, or cooking for

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.170
dummies, or something else.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.340
And you follow those recipes
exactly, and you'll

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.270
get what you get.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.886
It's if you have a curiosity
to say, well why does

00:32:04.886 --> 00:32:05.880
it work that way?

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.710
And how do chefs at top
restaurants do it?

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:10.570
And why is this is done?

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:14.690
That's where we really have
a proposition for you.

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.710
And so the whole thing was
written from a technologist's

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:21.290
or a scientist's or an
engineer's point of view,

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:22.890
rather than from a

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:24.230
traditionalist's point of view.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.060
FEMALE SPEAKER: And so what was
the initial inspiration

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.710
for writing the series?

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.480
As you mentioned, you obviously
come from a

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:31.390
technology background.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.620
So where did the interest
in food come in?

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.465
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: So I've
been interested in

00:32:35.465 --> 00:32:36.650
food since I was little.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.710
When I was nine years old,
I decided to cook

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:40.980
Thanksgiving dinner.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.640
I told my mom she couldn't
come in the kitchen.

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.440
I cooked it all by myself.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.341
I would do a lot better
job today.

00:32:47.341 --> 00:32:52.790
And then for many, many years,
I was a self-taught chef.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:54.730
When I was working at Microsoft,
actually, I decided

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.285
I would stop being
self-taught.

00:32:57.285 --> 00:33:01.570
And I decided I wanted to go
to chef school in France.

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:05.210
So I convinced Bill to give
me a leave of absence.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:06.770
And I went to work.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:09.970
Well, to get into the chef
school, I had to have

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:11.680
professional experience.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.240
So one night a week for two
years, I worked in a French

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.520
restaurant in Seattle.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.640
And then after that, the chef
school would take me.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.870
So I went and I went to this
intensive program there.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.370
And so I've been into
it for a long time.

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.800
But then after leaving
Microsoft, I started

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.660
cooking a lot more.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:32.006
That was kind of part of
the reason I left.

00:33:32.006 --> 00:33:35.110
And I realized that there
wasn't a big book that

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:38.520
explained cooking from the
point of view I had.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.550
Now, there's two ways
to make a product.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:46.600
One is to say, I'm going to do
market research and find out

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:47.620
what they want.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.740
And they is some funny set of
folks that we interview them

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.860
and run focus groups
and surveys.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.790
And it's a fine way of making
a product for some things.

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.600
But that's not how
we did the books.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.440
We did the books the completely
other way, which is

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.530
to say, we were going to make
the book we wanted.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.410
It's our damn thing.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.510
And then we just pray that
there's other people that

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:08.739
agree with us.

00:34:08.739 --> 00:34:13.949
And the difference is that all
of the best things in the

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.850
world, in my view, are made this
second way-- by making

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.149
what you want.

00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:20.130
Now, unfortunately, some of the
worst things are made that

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.179
way, too, or some of the
great disasters.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:25.580
Because it turns out you make
what you want, and nobody else

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.476
does want it.

00:34:27.476 --> 00:34:29.350
But I decided we'd
take the risk.

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:31.580
And so, it was through that.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:34.100
And then the internet played
a huge role in it.

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:38.870
There's a forum site called
eGullet, and I started posting

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.560
on eGullet about sous
vide and other

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.389
aspects of modern cuisine.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:46.949
And it was people on eGullet
that gave me the suggestion I

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:47.960
write the book.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.730
But it was more than that.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:53.090
It was the community of people
on eGullet spanned home cooks

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.590
to some of the top professional

00:34:54.590 --> 00:34:55.960
chefs in the world.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.100
And everyone was eager to get
this kind of information.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.370
And so that convinced me that it
wasn't only going to be me

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.680
that I was making this for.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: So what was your
favorite discovery in the

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:10.770
process of writing the book?

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:12.020
Because there's obviously
some really cool things

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:12.823
that came out of it.

00:35:12.823 --> 00:35:14.745
But what was the best
that you found?

00:35:14.745 --> 00:35:18.360
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Well, my
favorite single one is a

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.250
little hard to explain.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:22.540
But in traditional barbecue
cooking-- this is in the

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.930
southeastern US, when
you make barbecue.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.530
There's something called
the stall--

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:32.050
S-T-A-L-L. And if you're cooking
a brisket or a pork

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:35.410
shoulder or some other big
honking piece of meat, then

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:38.010
people notice that the
temperature would rise and

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.170
rise and rise and rise.

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.700
And then it would hit this
point where it would stop

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.600
rising, and it would
stall for hours.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.050
And then it would eventually
come up again.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:49.990
Well, there are thousands
and thousands--

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:52.700
do a Google search on
barbecue stall, and

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.830
you will see thousands.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:56.590
You could get a few things for
somebody's barbecue stall like

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:57.450
in a farmer's market.

00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:00.270
But you filter those out, and
there's still thousands of

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:03.130
people saying, what the hell
is the barbecue stall?

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:04.980
What causes this?

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.780
And they have lots
of theories.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.310
And we discovered they
were all wrong.

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:10.610
And we found out what really
causes the barbecue stall.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Tell us.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.425
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: OK.

00:36:13.425 --> 00:36:16.860
It works for the same
reason we sweat.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.180
People sweat because when water
evaporates, it takes a

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.190
lot of heat with it.

00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:26.110
And sweating is our body's way
of using evaporative cooling.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:30.210
We'll spend some water to
get a lot of cooling.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.510
Well, meat is about 75% water.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.480
So you put it in a hot barbecue
and hot air, it's

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:37.940
going to start evaporating.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.440
And that cools things down.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:44.770
And what happens is that stall
period is the period when no

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:49.210
matter how much heat you put
in, more heat is leaving

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.060
because of evaporation.

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.550
Now, the funny thing is, one
of the traditional remedies

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:59.095
for this is to slather more
sauce on it, which is exactly

00:36:59.095 --> 00:37:03.210
like trying to heat the thing
up by putting a hose on it.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:06.120
You will never get it hot if
you keep slathering it on.

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.830
But people do for a while.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.780
And there's various
things about it.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:15.270
And so to test this, we
took some briskets

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:16.350
and cut them in half.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.100
And then we would either wrap
one in foil or seal it in a

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.060
sous vide bag, all instrumented
with lots of

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:22.980
temperature probes.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.850
And right beside it,
one that was open.

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.090
And the one that was sealed
had no stall at all.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:35.112
And the one that was open had
exactly the stall that you

00:37:35.112 --> 00:37:36.452
would predict.

00:37:36.452 --> 00:37:38.290
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
so interesting.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:42.310
So what is your favorite
cookbook?

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.330
Apart from your own.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.950
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Yeah, it's
a really good question.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:51.420
Historically, the one that was
hugely inspirational to me,

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:53.980
but also very difficult, because
I first got it when I

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.700
was nine, was "Escoffier."

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: You were
a very precocious

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:58.726
child, weren't you?

00:37:58.726 --> 00:38:00.790
I was reading Ramona the
Pest when I was nine.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.730
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Pain
in the ass for Mom.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:06.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: The difference
between me and you, I think.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.990
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: So "Escoffier"
was an inspiration

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:12.140
to me, both positively
and negatively.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:17.980
The positive aspect is that
Escoffier was incredibly

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:22.080
influential to basically chefs
all over the world.

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.130
The book came out in 1903.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.790
And it really sealed the deal
for French food being

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:32.240
synonymous with high-end food
for the next century or so.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.060
It just was incredibly
influential.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:39.720
The negative inspiration is that
it also had a variety of

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.690
things that I definitely
didn't want to do.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:47.435
So a typical Escoffier recipe
will say, prepare this, put it

00:38:47.435 --> 00:38:50.990
in a hot oven, and
cook until done.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:54.170
Now, in Escoffier's time, he
was writing for people that

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.390
were apprentices.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:58.320
They would've apprenticed to a
master chef, and they didn't

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.150
have any technology.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:01.420
Even though they had
thermometers, it wasn't common

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:05.110
in a turn of the previous
century kitchen.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.810
So hot oven, what the
hell was that?

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.310
Cook until done?

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:11.090
What the hell is that?

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.970
We wanted to make sure that we
had stuff that had this more

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:15.890
technological perspective of
saying, now, we're going to

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:18.620
tell you how to do it so you can
get a good result, even if

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.860
you've never done it before.

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:22.460
And we're going to do that by
telling you, cook it to this

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.230
temperature.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.310
Cook it in an oven of
that temperature.

00:39:26.310 --> 00:39:28.100
And here's how you tell
if it's done.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.350
And here's how you tell
if it isn't done.

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:33.400
And try to make the things
as objective as possible.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.620
So it was sort of an inspiration
for me in a couple

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.240
different ways, positively
and negatively.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:40.750
I'm going to do a couple
of finish this

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.020
sentences with you.

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:42.455
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: OK.

00:39:42.455 --> 00:39:43.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: Ask you to
finish this sentence, and then

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.735
we're going to open
up for questions.

00:39:44.735 --> 00:39:46.870
So I'll ask whoever
has a question.

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:48.590
There's two mics in the room.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.570
And if you can use one of the
mics, because we are recording

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:52.085
this for YouTube, that
would be great.

00:39:52.085 --> 00:39:55.240
So you can start lining up
and we'll get going.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.840
Modernist cooking is?

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.090
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Great.

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:05.160
Modernist cooking is cooking
to make stuff taste great

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:08.370
without regard to feeling
you have to

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.110
slavishly follow tradition.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: I am
challenged by?

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.020
NATHAN MYHRVOLD:
Keeping clean?

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.140
I make a hell of a
mess when I cook.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:19.730
FEMALE SPEAKER: Because
you're cutting

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:20.885
everything in half, I think.

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:21.680
That might be part
of the problem.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.480
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: It turns
out cooking well--

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.960
we found out why most people
don't cook with

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.062
a wok cut in half.

00:40:28.062 --> 00:40:30.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: I probably
could've told you that.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:34.800
A food trend I hate is?

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.170
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: So a food trend
I hate, which has got

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:43.810
multiple different forms,
is when a buzz word gets

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:47.150
perverted to a use it didn't
originally have.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:50.220
And so a good example of that,
or bad example, depending on

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.920
your perspective, is organic.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.230
Organic, once upon a time, meant
it was this stuff grown

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:59.550
by this hippie couple sort
of at the edge of town.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:02.290
And it kind of was ugly.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:05.120
But it tasted really good,
because it was picked in all

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:05.680
these ways.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:10.400
Today, because people will pay a
premium for organic, organic

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:17.917
has been largely eviscerated by
folks that have read all of

00:41:17.917 --> 00:41:19.870
the rules, lobbied
the government

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:20.960
to change the rules.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.740
And the food they have is
effectively the same.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.460
Local is another one
of these things.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.410
It's nice that something's
local.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:33.960
But I promise you, as local
starts getting a market edge,

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:37.290
people will find ways
to cheat on it.

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:43.080
One of the examples we have in
"Modernist Cuisine" is honey

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.210
is essentially fructose.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.850
It's 90some percent fructose.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.380
But high fructose corn
syrup, a lot of folks

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.490
think that is bad.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.560
And there's some reasons
to believe that it is.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.460
But the hypocrisy of
the following thing

00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:58.330
just drove us crazy.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:01.760
We found there's a bunch of
commercial honey places that

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:07.940
basically fed bees with
artificial flowers with high

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:09.810
fructose corn syrup.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.620
So it was fructose laundering.

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.390
You feed it to the bees, the
bees loved it, because they

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:20.300
didn't have to do much work.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.960
They suck up the fructose
here, squirt it into the

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:28.630
honeycomb, and just
hugely productive.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:33.390
So they can sell people
natural honey.

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:34.640
Here's another one.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:41.940
The reason that you've got a
red color and some of the

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:46.220
flavors in cured meat like bacon
is because of nitrates.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:50.000
And there is some legitimate
concern about whether nitrates

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.270
are all that good for
you, and so forth.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:58.460
But if you go to Whole Foods,
you'll find nice, rosy red

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.880
bacon that's nitrate free.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.720
How did they do that?

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.650
They take concentrated celery
juice, which has got the same

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.500
nitrate concentrate as
the original brine.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.060
But it happens but there's a
lot of nitrates in celery.

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.200
Now is that nitrate free?

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.140
No.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.310
But in a ruling with the Federal
Trade Commission, in

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:23.540
fact, because it started off as
celery juice, the fact it

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.360
has the identical quantity--

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.630
and if it didn't have the same
quantity, it would not turn

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:29.146
the meat red.

00:43:29.146 --> 00:43:31.900
And that's why if you really
cared about nitrate free

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.090
bacon, it better be gray.

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:37.400
Because otherwise it's nitrate
by another name.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:41.530
So anyway, I hate using
hypocrisy to try to fool

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.770
people in some way.

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:45.810
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK,
so that was a very

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:46.700
long finish the sentence.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:46.840
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Sorry.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: So we're only
going to do one more so that

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.410
we make sure.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:52.720
I'm trying to think-- three
things that are always in my

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:53.970
fridge are?

00:43:57.450 --> 00:44:03.830
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Fish sauce,
sesame oil, and some

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:06.520
rendered duck fat.

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.790
FEMALE SPEAKER: I was expecting
a much more bizarre

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:08.716
answer, so that's all right.

00:44:08.716 --> 00:44:11.170
You surprised me.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:14.020
OK, can we start over there?

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.842
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thanks for coming.

00:44:15.842 --> 00:44:18.760
The book is fantastic.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.720
And I'm very much so looking
forward to using it.

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:23.050
My question is actually in
regard to something you made

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:26.510
reference to right when
you first stepped up.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.410
And that's in regard
to baking.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:31.810
So I don't know whether you've
explored this as a

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:32.700
potential next step.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.180
But I'm curious as to your
thoughts around--

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:39.330
baking, to me, seems to be much
more exact, much more

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:40.260
scientific.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:44.170
So I'm wondering what your
thoughts are about how maybe

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:48.480
you see that as potentially an
easier world to explore, as

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.592
opposed to traditional
cooking?

00:44:50.592 --> 00:44:54.210
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: So you're
absolutely right that from a

00:44:54.210 --> 00:45:00.340
cultural perspective, baking
and pastry is more precise.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.330
Nobody adds baking
powder to taste.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:04.950
First of all, it tastes
terrible.

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.980
Second of all, you can't judge
by taste what's the right

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.950
amount to make your
muffins rise.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.530
And you'd better measure it
pretty precisely, otherwise

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.660
your muffins are going to
over-rise, or they're going to

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.130
be like hockey pucks.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.700
So pastry chefs bought
off on a lot of these

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.340
things earlier on.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:26.340
One funny example is in the
book, we use percentages in

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.460
addition to grams.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:30.040
Because if you want to scale it
up, it's handy to do that.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:33.040
And the system we use is called
baker's percentages.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:33.570
Why?

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:37.630
Because every baking
book has it, but no

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:38.970
non-baking books have it.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.880
And it was funny, the number
of even professional chefs

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:44.270
who'd say what's their
percentage crap?

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:46.660
And their pastry chef would
say, uh, chef, I'll

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:47.840
explain it to you.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.650
We've used it for 100
years in pastry.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:53.270
So that's one thing
that's different.

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:58.900
Another thing that's different
is that there are pastry books

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:01.840
that take you much closer to
the state of the art than

00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:03.770
savory books did.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:09.310
So if you read a pastry book by
Pierre Herme, for example,

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.780
Paco Toro Blanco, and I could
list all kinds of them, they

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:16.990
probably would have more recipes
and more techniques

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:20.050
that were close to the state of
the art than if you tried

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:23.230
to find the same kind of thing
for cooking meat, for example,

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.420
where the state of the art was
50 years ago, in terms of what

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.290
you find in books.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:35.080
That said, the world of baking
and pastry chefs are very

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.500
receptive to all of
these things.

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.220
Here's actually one
other point.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:42.760
At a lot of restaurants in New
York, the modern techniques in

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:46.310
the kitchen, all pioneered
by the pastry chefs.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:51.370
So at Jean-Georges, Johnny
Iuzzini, the first sous-vide

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:55.270
cooked in Jean-Georges was
by Johnny for pastry.

00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:58.080
At Le Bernardin, it was
Michael Laiskonis.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.250
And both of them, and lots of
other pastry chefs like them,

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:04.250
drag the rest of their kitchen
into the at least 20th

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:09.180
century, and maybe
into the 21st.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.180
But for the same reasons,
they're also very

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.450
receptive to it.

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:13.980
And there's an awful
lot of really

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.320
interesting creative things.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:18.960
So watch this space.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:19.690
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:20.510
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Yeah.

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:23.610
AUDIENCE: So I enjoy smoking
meats at home.

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:27.500
And I find one of the great
things about it is if you're

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.470
patient, and you can control
the temperature, then a

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:33.630
brisket or ribs or a pork
shoulder will just tend to be

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.520
delicious no matter
what you do.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.830
So what do you recommend to sort
of take it up a level?

00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.360
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: OK.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:42.870
So we're really big
on barbecue.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.630
And what I'm about to
say tastes great.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:47.920
But this is total anathema to
traditional barbecue folks.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.820
So you're totally right that low
and slow is the way to go.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.760
Only we like to go
lower and slower.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:48:01.040
So for pork ribs, I'd cook them
at 140 degrees for 48

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.550
hours, sous vide.

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:05.140
So this is not like,
hi, honey!

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.493
Let's have ribs tonight!

00:48:07.493 --> 00:48:09.425
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.020
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Then
you smoke them

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.160
for a couple of hours.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.760
Again, you don't want to exceed
maybe 140 degree air

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.480
temperature.

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.310
Turns out you can smoke them
either before or after you

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.930
hook them sous vide.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:33.660
And for a pork shoulder, I
would do the same thing.

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.450
I might actually take the
temperature up a little bit,

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:42.470
to, say, 145 degrees,
but for 48 hours.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:49.810
For short ribs, we typically do
145 degrees for 72 hours.

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:52.380
So this is truly patience
oriented.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:56.010
But oh my god, the results you
get are just unbelievable.

00:48:56.010 --> 00:48:58.410
Now, there's a guy named
Steven Raichlen who's

00:48:58.410 --> 00:48:59.670
considered one of the
world's foremost

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.700
authorities on barbecue.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.720
He's literally sold millions
of his barbecue books.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.390
He came to our lab.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:10.280
And we made these short
ribs for him.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:13.080
And he wrote on his blog that
they were the best ribs of any

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.920
kind he'd ever had in his life,
which was more than we

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.870
could possibly hope for.

00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:21.880
So try that.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:23.350
Get sous vide.

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:26.670
But hey, if you already have a
smoker, you're already at the

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:28.560
bleeding edge of craziness.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.650
AUDIENCE: You can keep
it outside, though.

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:31.110
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: That's fine.

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.980
But you can do your sous
vide cooking inside.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.080
You can do it ahead
of time, right?

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:38.560
In fact, you can also freeze
it or keep it in the fridge

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.080
after you've cooked it
sous vide that way.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: Take a
couple days off work.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.650
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Yeah.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.900
We find you only smoke it
for an hour or two.

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.630
Depends on how heavy of a
smoke flavor you want.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:57.760
But smoking for a really long
period of time doesn't do that

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.900
much good, because the
penetration depth that you get

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:03.250
was smoking drops off
exponentially.

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:07.340
And so smoking it for six
hours isn't that useful.

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:07.910
Yeah.

00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:12.010
AUDIENCE: So this idea that we
can replace a lot of the sort

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.030
of technique and skill that
used to be was required to

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:19.010
cook right with technology
is really neat.

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:22.120
And I'm just wondering if I,
as a home cook, go and do

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.660
that, if I buy your book and buy
my digital thermometer and

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:28.630
so forth, and so I don't have
to know when my food is done

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:32.870
by looking and smelling, I now
have a lot of free time.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:34.250
So what skills should
I develop?

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:36.671
What's my highest marginal
return to time I can develop

00:50:36.671 --> 00:50:37.236
in the kitchen?

00:50:37.236 --> 00:50:37.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: Come
back to work?

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.140
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: I was gonna
say, you work at Google!

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.340
You don't know what to
do with free time?

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.070
What's free time?

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:43.760
But here's a different way.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.050
Here's sort of an answer, which
is, there's a tremendous

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:52.140
amount of cooking that is
aesthetic at its essence.

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.960
And there isn't a technological

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:54.950
solution for that.

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:58.390
So what combinations of
flavors do you put in?

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:02.910
What combination of textures
do you do?

00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:05.410
If the dinner party got
so simple, well,

00:51:05.410 --> 00:51:07.790
add a couple of courses.

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:11.700
There's always an axis that you
can move in where there's

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.030
an unbounded amount of stuff,
and where technology isn't

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.580
going to help you.

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.710
So while you've automated some
things so that you'll never

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:19.110
overcook it, you'll never
undercook it.

00:51:19.110 --> 00:51:21.430
It's all perfect,
it's done great.

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:24.110
Well, then, use that
time to experiment.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:25.190
Do some more cool stuff.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:28.730
Add a couple dishes,
add garnish.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:29.455
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:29.455 --> 00:51:31.355
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, this
is our last question.

00:51:31.355 --> 00:51:32.840
AUDIENCE: Thanks again.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.730
You mentioned that the
thermometer would be the first

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:35.950
thing that you purchase,
or you would

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:37.380
recommend as a purchase.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.110
I remember the first
Thanksgiving where I took over

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:40.610
the kitchen.

00:51:40.610 --> 00:51:41.960
It wasn't at 9.

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.190
Probably 19.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.700
But I put in the probe
thermometer, and the

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.870
convection oven was going.

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:48.530
And a few hours later,
it reached

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:49.780
temperature, started beeping.

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.060
And I'm like, all right!

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:51.200
It's done.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.290
And mom's like, no way.

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:55.400
And we cut in, and sure
enough, it was raw.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:59.170
And so I wonder, like, do you
cover basically the fact that

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:01.440
meat is not equal
all throughout?

00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.380
Like, the proper way of
measuring temperature--

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:05.610
because that's really
important.

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:06.800
Not just having the tool.

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.110
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Yeah.

00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:10.180
So we do discuss that.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:14.420
The really cool thing I have in
this ovens that I have at

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.600
home, which are sort of
commercial grade ovens.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.990
You probably have them somewhere
in one of your

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.710
cafeterias.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:20.010
They have the coolest thing.

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:23.090
They have a temperature probe
that's got five separate

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:24.430
probes in it.

00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:28.590
And so not only does it pick the
coldest one, but it also

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:30.390
looks at the gradient.

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:32.950
And so then you could tell how
it's heating up or cooling

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:35.370
down, and by doing that, you
can figure all the way.

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:37.580
But in general, what you want to
do is you want to pick the

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.340
thickest part of something.

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.190
In the case of poultry, the
traditional thing is to put it

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:45.150
down near the hip joint.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:46.860
That's not really because that's
the thickest part.

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.120
The thickest part is still
going to be the

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:49.400
breast for a turkey.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:53.490
But that's the part that
probably you're most concerned

00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:55.760
about undercooking.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.380
So, yeah.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.790
We definitely cover
that in the book.

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:03.780
And it's true, you need to make
sure your temperature is

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.658
representative, otherwise you're
going to fool yourself.

00:53:06.658 --> 00:53:08.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thanks.

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:09.790
That's all we have time for.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:11.380
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.410
NATHAN MYHRVOLD: Well,
thank you.

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:13.310
FEMALE SPEAKER: It
was really great.

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:14.560
Thanks.
