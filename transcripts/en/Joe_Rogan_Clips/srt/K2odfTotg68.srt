1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,690
The seven piece meal
specialist back at KFC.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,690
Why are we wasting this
seven pounds on me?

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,090
That seven pieces of the colonel's world,

4
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:11,850
famous chicken for 1299 they have wings.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,340
It's flesh comes complete with a
large mashed potato, large Cole slaw,

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,120
and to drink for only 1299 it's a
deal. So good. It should be illegal.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,860
Oh,
the government not involved.

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,810
Hurry in and you can also get our gizzards
and liver meal for eight 99 and they

9
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:31,100
take the organs and
they take the skin joke.

10
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,580
KFC knows how to take care of
you. Yeah, I'm comfortable.

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,870
The seven piece meal special
is back only at KFC. See,

12
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:41,710
it's a southern love of bows.
