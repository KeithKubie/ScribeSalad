00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.340
- [Voiceover] Let's now
take some limits involving

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.484
composite functions.

00:00:04.484 --> 00:00:07.277
So over here we have
the limit of g of h of x

00:00:07.277 --> 00:00:10.003
as x approaches three, and like always,

00:00:10.003 --> 00:00:12.027
I encourage you to pause
the video and see if you can

00:00:12.027 --> 00:00:14.065
figure this out on your own.

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:16.088
Well, we can leverage
our limit properties,

00:00:16.088 --> 00:00:17.965
we know that this is
going to be the same thing

00:00:17.965 --> 00:00:20.767
as the limit, actually
let me write it this way,

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:24.934
this is going to be the
same thing as g of the limit

00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:29.170
as x approaches three of h of x,

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.070
or I could say the limit of
h of x as x approaches three.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.920
And so we just need to figure out

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.885
what the limit of h of x
is as x approaches three.

00:00:39.885 --> 00:00:42.331
So, let's look at h of x right over here

00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:45.088
and as x approaches three, so we see that

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:48.954
h of three is undefined
but we can think about

00:00:48.954 --> 00:00:52.831
what the limit of h of x
is as x approaches three.

00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.175
As x approaches three from the left,

00:00:56.175 --> 00:00:58.388
as x approaches three from the left,

00:00:58.388 --> 00:01:01.785
we see that the function
just stays at a constant two,

00:01:01.785 --> 00:01:05.035
so at h of 2.5 is two, h of 2.9 is two,

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.899
h of 2.999999999 is two.

00:01:11.152 --> 00:01:12.838
So it looks like when we
approach from the left,

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:15.159
the limit is two and we
approach from the right,

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.023
we get the same thing, h of 3.01 is two,

00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:22.440
h of 3.001 is two, h of 3.0000001 is two.

00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:28.891
So this limit right over here is two.

00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:32.058
So this is all simplified to g of two.

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:34.508
Now what is g of two?

00:01:34.508 --> 00:01:36.435
Well, let's see, this function here,

00:01:36.435 --> 00:01:39.352
when x is two, g of two is zero,

00:01:40.973 --> 00:01:44.635
so this right over there
is going to be zero,

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:48.234
and we're done, let's
do a few more of these.

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:52.032
Alright, so we wanna find
the limit as x approaches

00:01:52.032 --> 00:01:54.536
negative one of h of g of x.

00:01:54.536 --> 00:01:56.517
Well, just like we just
did, this is going to be

00:01:56.517 --> 00:02:00.434
the same thing, this is
equal to h of the limit

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:08.226
as x approaches negative one of g of x,

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.762
so let's try to figure
out the limit of g of x

00:02:13.762 --> 00:02:15.817
as x approaches negative one.

00:02:15.817 --> 00:02:18.764
So, this is the graph y equals g of x

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:22.386
and we see at negative
one right over here,

00:02:22.386 --> 00:02:26.219
we have this discontinuity
and as we approach,

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:30.591
as we approach x equals
negative one from the left,

00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:34.441
it looks like we go unbounded
in the negative direction,

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:37.247
so you could say we're
approaching negative infinity,

00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:40.729
and as we go from the right,
as we go from the right,

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:43.725
looks like we are, as we
get closer to x equals

00:02:43.725 --> 00:02:45.830
negative one on the right-hand side,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.094
looks like we're approaching infinity,

00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:51.149
so even if they were both
approaching the same direction

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.553
of infinity, we would say
that the limit's not defined

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:56.300
or at least that's the
technical idea here.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.063
But this is going, one's going
towards positive infinity,

00:02:59.063 --> 00:03:00.724
and the other is going
to negative infinity

00:03:00.724 --> 00:03:03.265
so this limit right here is undefined.

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:07.432
So, it doesn't exist, or I
should say, does not exist.

00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:12.616
So, if the limit as x approaches
negative one of g of x

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:14.505
does not exist, well,
there's no way we that

00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:16.107
we can evaluate this expression.

00:03:16.107 --> 00:03:18.230
We can't find h of does not exist,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.027
so this entire limit does not,

00:03:21.027 --> 00:03:23.651
this entire limit does not exist.

00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:26.023
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:26.023 --> 00:03:30.190
Alright, so we have once
again limit of h of f of x

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.964
as x approaches negative
three, this is the same thing,

00:03:35.964 --> 00:03:38.547
this is equal to h of the limit

00:03:40.324 --> 00:03:43.991
as x approaches negative three of f of x.

00:03:47.236 --> 00:03:51.181
So, let's look at f of x, this
is the graph y equals f of x,

00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:54.009
and the limit as x
approaches negative three,

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:58.449
well, as we approach negative
three from the left-hand side

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.336
as we get closer and
closer to negative three,

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:04.182
it looks like we are
approaching the value of one,

00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:06.337
and as we approach from
the right-hand side,

00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:08.601
it looks like we're
approaching the value of one.

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:10.265
If I were to take from the left-hand side,

00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:13.653
if I were to take negative
3.1, negative 3.01,

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:17.069
negative 3.001, I'm gonna
get closer and closer to,

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.031
if I evaluate the function
there, so I should take

00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:22.825
f of negative 3.1, f of negative 3.01,

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:25.699
f of negative 3.0001, we're getting

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.581
closer and closer to one, and same thing

00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:31.007
on the right-hand side, so
this thing looks like it's one.

00:04:31.007 --> 00:04:34.277
So, now we just have to
evaluate, and I'll rewrite it,

00:04:34.277 --> 00:04:37.444
so this is the same thing as h of one,

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.216
h of one, so you just
have to evaluate this.

00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:44.752
Then when we look at
this graph here at one,

00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:47.509
this function does not look defined,

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.676
so h of one is actually
undefined, undefined right here,

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:58.931
so also in this case, this
limit would not exist.

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.948
Once again, the limit
part was actually at least

00:05:00.948 --> 00:05:03.747
the limit of f of x was
fairly straight forward,

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:05.915
but then when we tried to take that output

00:05:05.915 --> 00:05:07.633
and put it as the input into h of x,

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:10.800
well, h of x, h wasn't defined there.
