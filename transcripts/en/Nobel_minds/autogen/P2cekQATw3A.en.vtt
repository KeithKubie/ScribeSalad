hi my name's Pete Hatfield and I studied

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520
hi my name's Pete Hatfield and I studied
 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.430
hi my name's Pete Hatfield and I studied
maths physics and chemistry at a-level

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440
maths physics and chemistry at a-level
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.860
maths physics and chemistry at a-level
my question is do you think there's any

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870
my question is do you think there's any
 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.179
my question is do you think there's any
strengths than any of the multiverse

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189
strengths than any of the multiverse
 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.740
strengths than any of the multiverse
theories at the moment and what you

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
theories at the moment and what you
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.209
theories at the moment and what you
think would constitute empirical

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219
think would constitute empirical
 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.419
think would constitute empirical
evidence for their existence hi Pete so

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429
evidence for their existence hi Pete so
 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.150
evidence for their existence hi Pete so
you're asking about the multiverse this

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
you're asking about the multiverse this
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.859
you're asking about the multiverse this
is the idea that maybe there are melding

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
is the idea that maybe there are melding
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.689
is the idea that maybe there are melding
other universes besides the one that

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699
other universes besides the one that
 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.300
other universes besides the one that
we're in and that may be tied together

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
we're in and that may be tied together
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.359
we're in and that may be tied together
or maybe mathematically possible and at

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
or maybe mathematically possible and at
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.009
or maybe mathematically possible and at
the moment I think we have to admit that

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
the moment I think we have to admit that
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.570
the moment I think we have to admit that
they're mathematically possible but

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
they're mathematically possible but
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.990
they're mathematically possible but
there is very difficult or impossible to

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
there is very difficult or impossible to
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.530
there is very difficult or impossible to
actually tell if they're true so

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540
actually tell if they're true so
 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.729
actually tell if they're true so
according to everything we know we can

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
according to everything we know we can
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.139
according to everything we know we can
only see things in our own universe

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149
only see things in our own universe
 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.450
only see things in our own universe
would we ever see any evidence that our

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
would we ever see any evidence that our
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610
would we ever see any evidence that our
universe is not the thing that we think

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
universe is not the thing that we think
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.760
universe is not the thing that we think
it is possible yes but it's a hard thing

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
it is possible yes but it's a hard thing
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.639
it is possible yes but it's a hard thing
to think about everything that we know

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
to think about everything that we know
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.049
to think about everything that we know
about our Big Bang says that it is so

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059
about our Big Bang says that it is so
 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.580
about our Big Bang says that it is so
intense that it erases almost all

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
intense that it erases almost all
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.760
intense that it erases almost all
evidence of everywhere else so and the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
evidence of everywhere else so and the
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920
evidence of everywhere else so and the
universe that we see is so large that if

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
universe that we see is so large that if
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.029
universe that we see is so large that if
there's another part of it that's

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
there's another part of it that's
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650
there's another part of it that's
different from ours you know we can't

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
different from ours you know we can't
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.109
different from ours you know we can't
tell it's just too far away for us to

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
tell it's just too far away for us to
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.890
tell it's just too far away for us to
notice so I think logically it's one

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
notice so I think logically it's one
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.420
notice so I think logically it's one
could imagine that there would be a way

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
could imagine that there would be a way
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.270
could imagine that there would be a way
found to measure this so far we haven't

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
found to measure this so far we haven't
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.030
found to measure this so far we haven't
thought of a good way
