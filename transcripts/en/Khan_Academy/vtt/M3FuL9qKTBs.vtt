00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.530
 

00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.720
Let's say I have
some matrix A.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.090
If I'm trying to determine
the null space of A, I'm

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.200
essentially asking -- I'm
essentially just asking, look

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.740
if we set up the equation Ax is
equal to the 0 vector, the

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.090
null space of A is all the x's
that satisfy this equation.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.800
All the x's that satisfy
that equation.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.370
Ax is equal to the
0 vector, or you

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.680
could call it the system.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.930
And the way you would solve it
-- and we've done this many

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.900
times, this was many videos
ago -- you would make an

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.680
augmented matrix with this.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.510
So the augmented matrix
would look like that.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.320
And you would have the 0 vector
on the right hand side.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.530
And then you'd perform a bunch
of row operations to put the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.770
left hand side into reduced
row echelon form.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.070
So, you would do a bunch
of operations.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.040
The left hand side would go into
reduced row echelon form.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.950
Let's call that reduced
row echelon form of A.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.239
And then the right hand side
is just going to stay 0,

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.100
because you performed the
same row operations.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.040
But when you perform those row
operations on 0, you just get

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.850
the 0 vector right here.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.080
And then when you un-augment--
when you create the system

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.840
back from this right here,
because these two systems are

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.500
equivalent, you are essentially
going to have your

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.320
solution set look something
like this.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.960
You're going to have your--
let me write it like this,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.840
your solution set is
going to be equal

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.230
to some scalar multiple.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.870
Let's say that, of your free
variables, your free variables

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.060
are going to be the
scalar multiples.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.820
And you've seen this
multiple times, so

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.860
I'll stay fairly general.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.520
But it's going to be some
multiple times, let's say,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.880
vector 1 plus some other scalar
times vector 2, these

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.200
scalars tend to be your free
variables-- times vector 2 all

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.930
the way to, I don't
know, whatever, c

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.600
times your nth vector.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.830
I'm just trying to
stay general.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.910
We haven't seen any examples
that had more than two or

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.800
three vectors here.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.100
But this is what, essentially,
your null space is spanned by

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.220
these vectors right there.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.110
You get an equation-- you get
a solution set that looks

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.560
something like that, and you
call that your null space.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.220
We've done that multiple
times.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.340
Your null space is that,
so it's all the linear

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.060
combinations, or it's the span,
of these little vectors

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.690
that you get here.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.660
And 1 and 2, all the
way to n, n.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.670
This is nothing new.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.010
I'm just restating something
that we've seen multiple,

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.790
multiple times.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.330
We actually did this in
the previous video.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.850
I just maybe never wrote
it exactly like this.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.110
But what about the case when
you're solving the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.760
inhomogeneous equation.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.090
So the inhomogeneous equation
looks like this.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.920
So if I want to solve Ax is
equal to b, I would do

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.230
something very similar
to this.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.640
I will create an augmented
matrix.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.200
We'll have A on the left hand
side, and I'd put b on the

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.010
right hand side, and I'll
perform a bunch of row

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.006
operations to put A into reduced
row echelon form.

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:02.750
So, let me do that.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.250
So this left hand side will
be the reduced row

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.300
echelon form of A.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.650
And then the right hand side,
whatever operations I did on

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.990
A, I have to do on
the entire row.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.040
So I'll also be doing
them to b.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.010
So I'll have some
new vector here.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.060
Maybe I'll call it the vector--
maybe I'll call that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.200
the vector b prime.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.640
It's going to be different
than b, but let's

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.430
just call it b prime.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.100
And so when you when you go back
to your-- I guess when

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.520
you go out of the augmented
matrix world and rewrite it as

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.380
a system, and you solve for
it, and we did this in the

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.870
last video-- you'll get
your solution set.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.345
Your solution set that satisfies
this is going to be,

00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:42.500
x is going to be equal to this
b prime, whatever this new

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.890
vector is, this b prime plus
something that looks

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.770
exactly like this.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.380
It looks exactly like that, in
fact I'll copy and paste it,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.130
it'll look exactly like this.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.640
Let me see if it did copy.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.600
Copy and paste it.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.680
Edit, copy, and let
me paste it.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.090
So it will look something that
looks exactly like that.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.700
And we said in the last video
that you can kind of-- given

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.959
this you can kind of think of
the solution set to the

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.430
inhomogeneous equation is
equivalent to some particular

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.070
solution, let's call that x
particular, some particular

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.490
solution, plus some member
of your null space.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.410
So you could say it's plus some
homogeneous solution.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.820
So if you just pick particular
values for a, b and c, all of

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.520
the different multiples of the
vector that span your null

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.940
space, you'll get some

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.910
particular homogeneous solution.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.380
So what I implied in the last
video, and I didn't show it to

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.725
you rigorously, is that any
solution to the inhomogeneous

00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:01.990
system-- let me write it this
way, any solution-- and do it

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:09.740
in white-- that's not white--
any solution to the

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:23.370
inhomogeneous system Ax is equal
to b, this is a claim I

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:34.010
made, will take the form-- some
particular solution--

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.830
that was this right here,
maybe I should do it in

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.570
green-- this is this right
here-- When you do the reduced

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.300
row echelon form, it becomes
that b prime vector.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.270
Plus some homogeneous solution,
so some member of

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.580
the null space.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.860
Now I didn't prove it to
you, but I implied

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.665
that this is the case.

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:57.040
And what I want to in this video
is actually do a little

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.790
bit of a more rigorous proof,
but it's actually fairly

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.390
straightforward.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.040
So let's first of all verify
that this is a solution.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.050
So let's verify that
this is a solution.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.690
So let's just put this into
out original equation.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.000
Let's remember our original
equation was Ax is equal to b.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.250
So let's verify.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.760
 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.950
Let me write it as a question.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.460
Is that particular solution,
plus some homogeneous

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:32.290
solution, a solution to
Ax is equal to b?

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.240
Well to do that you just put
that in the place of x.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.100
So let's try it out.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.230
So A times this guy right here,
times some particular

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.540
solution, plus some homogeneous
solution is going

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.050
to be equal to A times the
particular solution, plus A

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.440
times some member of
my null space.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.980
And what is this equal to?

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.280
That is going to
be equal to b.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.510
Right?

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.290
We're saying that this
is a particular

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.370
solution to this equation.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.240
That is going to be equal to b
and that this is going to be

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.540
equal to the 0 vector because
this is a solution to our

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.300
homogeneous equation.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.820
So this is going to be
equal to b plus 0, or

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.050
it's equal to b.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:19.130
So A times this vector right
here is indeed equal to b.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.430
So this is a solution.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.750
This is a solution, yes.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.850
Now the next question is, does
every solution to the

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.400
inhomogeneous system, or does
any solution to the

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.860
inhomogeneous system,
take this form?

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:48.810
So does any solution x, to Ax
equal to b, take the form x is

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:53.200
equal to some particular
solution, plus a member of our

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.940
null space, or plus a
homogeneous solution.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:00.700
So to do that let's take-- let's
test out what happens

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:08.270
when we multiply the vector
A times x-- let me

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.860
write it this way.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:20.460
let's say that x is any solution
to Ax is equal to b.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:21.790
Let's start off with that.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.800
And let's see what happens when
we take A times x minus

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.130
some particular solution
to this.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.820
So when we distribute the matrix
vector product, you get

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.940
A times our any solution
minus A times

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.460
our particular solution.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.700
Now what is this going
to be equal to?

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.180
We're saying that this is a
solution to Ax equals b.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.960
So this is going to
be equal to b.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.100
And of course, any particular
solution to this when you

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.870
multiply it by A is also
going to be equal to b.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:56.310
So it's going to be b minus b,
so that's going to be equal to

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.780
the 0 vector.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:03.700
Or another way to think about
it is, x, the vector x minus

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:12.190
our particular solution is
a solution to A times

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.180
x is equal to 0.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.350
Think about this if you take
this, in parentheses right

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.890
here, and you put it right
there, and you multiply it

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.880
times A you get the 0 vector.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.010
We just did that, you get the
0 vector, because when you

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.320
multiply each of these guys
by A you get b and

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.810
you get b minus b.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.740
And so that you get 0.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.990
So you can say that x minus--
so our any solution x minus

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:51.520
the particular solution of x is
a member of our null space.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:51.760
Right?

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.420
By definition our null space is
all of the x's that satisfy

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.910
this equation.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.450
So, since its a member of our
null space, we can say that it

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.010
is equal to-- so our any
solution minus our particular

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:06.920
solution is equal to some member
of our null space.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.690
We could say that it is equal
to a homogeneous solution.

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:11.870
There might be more than one.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:17.245
A homogeneous solution.

00:10:17.245 --> 00:10:20.730
 

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.830
Now, if we just add our
particular solution to both

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.300
sides of this, we get that any
solution-- remember, we assume

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.780
that x is any solution to this--
that any solution is

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.420
equal to our homogeneous
solution, is equal to a

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:40.120
homogeneous solution, plus a
particular solution-- or plus

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.820
our particular solution.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.360
So we've proven it both ways.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.980
That this is a solution to our
inhomogeneous equation, and

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:51.130
that any solution to our
inhomogeneous equation takes

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:53.450
this form right here.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.940
Now why am I so concerned with
this, and I've been kind of

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.910
fixated on this inhomogeneous
equation for some time.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.060
But we've been talking about the
notion of a transformation

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.310
being one-to-one.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:09.370
 

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:11.850
That was one of the two
conditions for a

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.200
transformation to
be invertible.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.180
Now to be one-to-one-- so let me
draw a transformation here.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.930
So let's say this is my domain,
X, and this is my

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.910
co-domain right here, Y, and I
have a transformation that

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.360
maps from X to Y.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.630
 

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.520
In order for T to be
one-to-one-- so I'll write it

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.230
like this, one-to-one.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.830
In order for T to be one-to-one
that means for any

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:50.600
b that you pick here, for any
b that is a member of our

00:11:50.600 --> 00:12:02.450
co-domain, there is at most
one solution to A times x.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.380
And I'm assuming that A is our
transformation matrix, so we

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.300
can write our transformation T
as being equal to some matrix

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.930
times our vector
in our domain.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.790
So this would be Ax if this is
x right here, so T would map

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:18.830
from that to that right there.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.040
So in order for our
transformation to be

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.450
one-to-one, that means if you
pick any b here, there has to

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.300
be, at most, one solution
to Ax is equal to b.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.090
Or another way to say that is
that there is at most one guy

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.750
that maps into that element
of our co-domain.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.790
There might be none.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.870
So there could be no solution
to this, but there has to be

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:39.480
at most one solution.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:46.715
Now, we just said that any
solution to an inhomogeneous--

00:12:46.715 --> 00:12:53.610
let me write it in blue-- any
solution takes the form-- if

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:54.310
there is a solution.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.350
So if there isn't a solution,
that's fine.

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.270
That will still satisfy
one-to-one.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.050
But if there is a solution, any
solution is going to take

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:09.500
the form x particular plus a
member of your null space.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.420
Where this guy right here is
a member of the null space.

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.980
This thing right here just
applies to that guy.

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:15.340
Right here.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.100
Any solution if they exist,
if there are no

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.890
solutions, that's fine.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.740
You can still be one-to-one.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.850
But if you do have a solution
you can have at most one

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.530
person that maps to it,
and any solution

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.580
will take this form.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.840
I just showed you that.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.780
Now in order to be one-to-one,
this can only be one solution.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.610
The solution set can only
be one solution.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:41.240
 

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.010
We can only have one solution
here, right?

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.120
What does that mean?

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.580
That means that this guy
right here cannot be

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.940
more than one vector.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.590
It just has to be one vector.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.000
There's only one particular
solution right there.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.500
But this guy right here has to
be-- for any solution set,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.200
depending on how you define
it, there's only one

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.540
particular vector there.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.620
But this guy, the only way that
you're only going to have

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:14.510
one solution is if your null
space is trivial, if it only

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.240
contains the 0 vector.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.200
Your null space will
always, at minimum,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.120
contain the 0 vector.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.590
In the last video I think I,
just off the cuff, said that

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.750
all your null space
has to be empty.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.270
But no, your null space will
always, by definition, by the

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.480
fact that it is a subspace,
it will

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.920
always contain a 0 vector.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.960
You can always multiply
A times 0 to get 0.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.930
So your null space will
always contain that.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.450
But in order to have only one
solution, your null space can

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.340
only have the 0 vector so
that this can only be 0.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.040
And so that your only solution
is going to be the particular

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.560
solution that you found,
depending on how you got

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.220
there, but it's only going to
be your particular solution.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.760
So let me put this this way.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:15:04.110
So in order to be one-to-one
your null space of your

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.830
transformation matrix
has to be trivial.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:11.280
It has to contain only
the 0 vector.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.590
Now we've covered this many,
many videos ago.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.910
What does it mean if your
null space only

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.290
contains a trivial vector?

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.270
Let me make this clear.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:23.340
So if your transformation vector
looks like this, A1,

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:28.800
A2, all the way to An, and
you're multiplying it times

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.650
x1, x2, all the way to xn, and
the null space is all of the

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.385
x's that satisfy this equation,
0, and you are going

00:15:36.385 --> 00:15:39.210
to have m 0's right there.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.810
So if your null space is
trivial, and we're saying that

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.170
that is a condition for you
to be one-to-one, for your

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.510
transformation to be one-to-one,
the transformation

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.510
that's specified
by this matrix.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.140
If your null space is trivial,
what does that mean?

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:56.600
That means that the only
solution to-- another way of

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:05.250
writing this is x1 times a1,
plus x2 times a2, all the way

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:11.240
to xn times an, is equal
to the 0 vector.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.290
These are equivalent statements
right here.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.250
I just multiplied each of
these terms times these

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.360
respective column vectors.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.760
These are the same thing.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.720
Now if you say that your null
space has to be equal to 0,

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.270
you're saying that the only
solution to this equation

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:28.270
right here, the only scalars
that satisfy this equation--

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:32.950
oh sorry, these aren't-- let me
actually-- because I wrote

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:37.010
the scalars as vectors-- so
this guy right here, this

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.030
statement right here, is
equivalent to x1 times a1,

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:45.680
plus x2 times a2, plus all the
way to xn times an, is equal

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.710
to the 0 vector.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.075
Where the x1's through
xn's are scalars.

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:52.680
Now, if we say the null space
is 0, we're saying the only

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.890
way that this is satisfied is
if your x1 all the way to xn

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.740
is equal to 0.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.700
And this means, this is our
definition actually, of linear

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.350
independence.

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:09.200
That means that a1-- so the null
space being 0 also means

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:15.920
that your column vectors of a--
let me write it this way--

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:23.310
it also means that a1, a2, all
the way through an, are

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:26.060
linearly independent.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.670
 

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.930
Now what does that mean?

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:35.950
If all of these guys are
linearly independent, what is

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.230
going to be the basis for
your column space?

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.660
Remember, the column
space is the span.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:47.510
The column space of a is equal
to the span of a1, a2,

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.920
all the way to an.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.840
What we just said, if we're
dealing with the one-to-one,

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.780
or one of the conditions, or the
condition to be one-to-one

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.550
is that your null space
has to be 0, or only

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.900
contain the 0 vector.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.970
If your null space contains the
0 vector, then all of your

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.790
columns are linearly
independent.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:08.925
If all of these columns span
your column space, and they

00:18:08.925 --> 00:18:13.810
are linearly independent,
then they form a basis.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:27.430
So that means that a1, a2, all
the way to an, are a basis for

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.520
our column space.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:32.880
And then that means if all of
our column vectors here are

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.900
linearly independent, they
obviously span our column

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.880
space by definition, and they
all our linearly independent,

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.060
they form the basis.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.610
So the dimension of our basis,
so the dimension of our column

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.910
space, that's essentially the
number of vectors you need to

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.710
form the basis, is going
to be equal to n.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.032
We have n columns.

00:18:52.032 --> 00:18:53.930
So it's going to
be equal to n.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:58.790
Or another way to say it is that
the rank of your matrix

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.990
is going to be equal to n.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:04.520
So now we have a condition for
something to be one-to-one.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.630
Something is going to be
one-to-one if and only if, the

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.780
rank of your matrix
is equal to n.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.680
And you can go both ways.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.120
If you assume something is
one-to-one, then that means

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.100
that it's null space here has to
only have the 0 vector, so

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.690
it only has one solution.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.070
If it's null space only has the
0 vector, then that means

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.000
it's columns are linearly
independent.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.790
Which means that they all
are part of the basis.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:30.960
Which means that you have
n basis vectors, or you

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.060
have a rank of n.

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.910
Let's go the other way.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.480
If you have a rank of n, that
means that all of these guys

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.390
are linearly independent.

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:39.470
If all of these guys are
linearly independent, then the

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.240
null space is just
the 0 vector.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.920
The null space is just the 0
vector, this part of your

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.460
solution disappears.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.410
And then you are only left
with one solution.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.360
So you're one-to-one.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.200
So you're one-to-one if and
only if the rank of your

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.620
transformation matrix
is equal to n.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.120
