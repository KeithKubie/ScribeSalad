00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:19.410
But seriously, that speech was great.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.070
&gt;&gt; Aw, thanks.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.930
[LAUGH] I was actually super nervous
when they called shopping list

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.450
plus plus.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.308
I just kind of panicked.

00:00:25.308 --> 00:00:25.969
&gt;&gt; May I?

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:26.851
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:28.326
&gt;&gt; Wow, this is elegant.

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:29.127
Personalized everything.

00:00:29.127 --> 00:00:30.009
This is amazing.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a lot heavier
than you'd think it'd be.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.499
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Hey,

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:34.908
have you had one of these macaroons?

00:00:34.908 --> 00:00:38.031
&gt;&gt; No, I actually haven't
eaten anything all day.

00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:40.143
I would kill for an right now.

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:41.389
&gt;&gt; I think Walter's at the store,

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:43.391
if there's only some way
we could contact him.

00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:45.690
&gt;&gt; Hey, we could use the app.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.860
&gt;&gt; Of course.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.800
&gt;&gt; Here, get my phone open.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.230
And I'll just go ahead and
scroll through my shopping list.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.500
And Walter is in the store,
that's awesome.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.080
So, let's go ahead and
add insta, delicious instarito.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.342

00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:13.184
[NOISE]

00:01:13.184 --> 00:01:13.882
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:14.822
Looks like he picked it up.

00:01:14.822 --> 00:01:15.843
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's super fast.

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:16.737
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:16.737 --> 00:01:18.225
&gt;&gt; What do we do now?

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:19.083
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:20.382
What about teach.

00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:21.496
&gt;&gt; Right, let's teach this class.

00:01:21.496 --> 00:01:21.996
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:22.541
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:23.860
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Hello there, and

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.059
welcome to Firebase Essentials for
Android.

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:30.150
My name is JP and I'm a program manager
for Google with Developed Training.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.280
More recently, I've been involved with
Google's cloud courses on Udacity.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.215
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Lyla.

00:01:35.215 --> 00:01:37.560
I'm an android course
developer at Udacity.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.100
I've worked on developing android apps,
as well as android for.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.032
&gt;&gt; So by now,
you've probably guessed that Lyla and

00:01:43.032 --> 00:01:45.102
her team are the creators
of shopping list plus plus,

00:01:45.102 --> 00:01:48.750
the wildly successful collaborative
shopping list app written in firebase.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.316
You've recently seen it in action
when Walter, Lyla's roommate,

00:01:52.316 --> 00:01:53.794
ordered us in as instarito.

00:01:53.794 --> 00:01:54.341
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:55.838
But what you don't know
is how we got here.

00:01:55.838 --> 00:01:57.266
In this five lesson course,

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:01.074
you will take on the role of shopping
list plus pluses first developer hire.

00:02:01.074 --> 00:02:01.810
And in doing so,

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.079
you're going to help us integrate
the Android app with a firebase backend.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.967
&gt;&gt; You know, if you don't know what
firebase is, it's a platform for

00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:10.654
building mobile and web applications
where you can read data,

00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:14.205
create authentication methods, and also
configure security and permissions for

00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:15.220
your data.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.473
&gt;&gt; When you're done, you're going to
know how to create a app with

00:02:18.473 --> 00:02:22.540
a backend that can support something
like a chat application or Google Docs,

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.749
or even the backend for
a multiuser game.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:25.302
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
And

00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:27.953
I'll be collaborating with Lyla
discussing firebase theory.

00:02:27.953 --> 00:02:30.083
I'll also introduce some examples
that you can use when you're

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:31.710
building your project.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.021
&gt;&gt; And I'm the course's app architect,
which means I'll be walking you through

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.851
the code examples and talking about
sort of design issues with you.

00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:40.750
I'll also ask you to implement
features for the app.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.243
&gt;&gt; So you might be wondering what
exactly do you need to know to begin

00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:43.807
this course.

00:02:43.807 --> 00:02:48.150
Well basically, you need to be able to
build Android apps that can connect

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.983
to the internet and read data.

00:02:49.983 --> 00:02:53.307
You also need to understand
the Android lifecycle in UI,

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:58.320
specifically responsive design, and
you should know GitHub and GitRepos.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.859
Basically, if you've completed
the developing Android apps and

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.182
completed the project for
that course, you should be fine.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:03.704
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:06.124
And there's actually a couple things
that you do not need to know for

00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:06.815
this course.

00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:09.355
For example, you don't need to
know how to configure servers or

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.015
do anything with backends.

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:12.119
&gt;&gt; So, Lyla, one question,

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.714
what does students want to know if
this course is really for them?

00:03:14.714 --> 00:03:15.817
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a great question.

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:17.130
And actually, we thought of that.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.769
So, we typed up a full list of
prerequisites and you can go ahead and

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.887
check out the instructor notes for
those.

00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:24.643
&gt;&gt; So I think with that, maybe this
is a good time to take a trip down

00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:27.304
memory lane and go back in time and
see how everything began.
