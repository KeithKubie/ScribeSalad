00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To solve this problem, the first thing I did was say, okay, well,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
it looks like this is directly in the middle of this building--this spire.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I can draw some imaginary line, making this distance 25 m.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, you could have used trigonometry to solve this question.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But there was a trick.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You could have solved it in a slightly easier way by using similar triangles.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
To use the similar triangle method,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we notice that this triangle in purple is similar to this triangle in green.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, what are the dimensions of this green triangle?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, at 60 m along the base from here, and 15 meters here--

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
simply because this height is 60,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and we subtract the 45. What about the purple triangle?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well, the base is 180 m--60 + 35 + 60 plus this 25.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
The height is unknown.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is what we're solving for. I'm going to erase our man to give ourselves some room.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We can set up a ratio.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The ratio of this side to that side must be the same as x to 180.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We multiply both sides by 180 to solve for x.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When we do out the arithmetic, we find x = 45 m,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but we also have to add in the original 45 m to get the full height of the Duomo.

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The answer is that the height of the Duomo is 90 m. Very good work.
