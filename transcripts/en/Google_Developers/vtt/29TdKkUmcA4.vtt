00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.560
Providing clear feedback to
users is one part of building

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.550
great functions.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.370
I'm going to take a look at
the function from the last

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.680
video that was used to compute
a confidence interval for the

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.750
mean using a sample of data.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.870
What if a user provided a
percentage instead of a

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.690
proportion for the
confidence level?

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.030
Currently the user simply gets
a warning, and the reason

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.700
behind the warning isn't going
to be obvious to new R users.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.890
Instead, it'd be helpful to
stop the execution of the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.640
function and clearly communicate
what is wrong.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.890
I'll do this by stopping the
function if the level of the

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.910
argument takes a value less than
zero or greater than one.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.580
To stop the execution of a
function and return an error,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.435
use the Stop function.

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:44.140
The argument of the Stop
function is a character string

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.120
to communicate why the
error was generated.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.410
Here I'll communicate that the
level variable should have

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.150
been represented by a proportion
between 0 and 1.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.360
Now, when a user inputs a level
value that is invalid,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.140
it stops and returns an error.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.220
I'm also a little concerned that
a user might provide a

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.379
level that takes a value
like 0.05 or 0.1.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.350
They might think they are
supposed to provide a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.730
significance level, rather
than a confidence level.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.700
If the confidence level is
smaller than 0.5, I'd like to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.110
warn the user that they should
rethink their input.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.400
I can do this using the
Warning function.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.810
In the next video, I'll
introduce how to pass an

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.880
arbitrary number of arguments
to a function.
