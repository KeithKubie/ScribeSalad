00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:07.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: She
is the lead designer

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.980
of Google Class, one of the
products from Google X Group.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.600
She joined the
Glass team in 2011

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.630
when the prototype was still a
phone attached to a scuba mask.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.550
And she has since
guided the team

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.070
to iterate towards the current
minimalist design, which

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.120
looks really fashionable
and has, I think,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.020
been noticed by a lot
of designers and awards.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.800
Prior to joining Google,
Isabelle worked at Fuseproject,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.740
designing a wide variety of
products ranging from the Nook

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.850
Color, Samsung televisions,
to Swarovski exhibitions,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.090
and eyewear for
children in third world.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.480
She has also designed
several furniture exhibits,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.150
which have been exhibited
at Milan Furniture Fair.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.580
Isabelle grew up in Sweden
and was influenced early on

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.200
by Scandinavian
minimalist design.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.379
Her ultimate goal
as a designer is

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.090
to make peoples' lives
easier and more beautiful.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.990
Sounds very familiar to
[INAUDIBLE] mission too.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.980
And without further
ado, let's start

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.013
watching a video of Isabelle.

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:17.771
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:18.270
-OK.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.264
So I'm going to
engage the system.

00:01:20.264 --> 00:01:21.760
[BEEP BEEP]

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.060
And now the car is in control.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.180
I didn't even imagine
that self-driving cars

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.222
would exist in my lifetime.

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:31.010
So to know that the
technology exists,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.246
and I get to work on it
firsthand is pretty incredible.

00:01:35.246 --> 00:01:39.920
-At Google X, we really take
breakthrough technologies

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.740
and apply them in
areas where we think

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.540
it could really
transform the world.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.450
-So part of it is
moonshot thinking,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.760
setting a really amazing goal
that is really inspiring,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.010
that could be possible,
but feels almost

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.140
like science fiction.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.306
-Well, especially at Google
X, is first and foremost

00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:56.040
the people.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.070
-When I first heard about
the job, I was thinking,

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.950
how would I fit in at Google X?

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.720
Coming here, I didn't
feel odd at all,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.375
because everybody's
odd in their own way.

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:11.250
-So I came to Google X
actually through a bit

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.795
of circuitous route.

00:02:12.795 --> 00:02:15.160
I went to grad school
and got my Ph.D.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.870
In a field of nanophotonics.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.410
So basically, I went
from microphotonics

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.410
to nanophotonics.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.290
-It's certainly
common in companies

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.950
around here in Silicon Valley
that the engineering workforce

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.770
is very largely male.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.040
And maybe they have 10% women,
or 20%, or something like that.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.480
We'd like to get to 50% women.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.960
-If we have just
men and not women,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.010
if we have just people
of a particular race,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.920
or just of a different
particular background,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.570
or from a particular
country, that's

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.950
not going to be helpful,
because we're not

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.699
going to think of the
breakthrough things.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.460
-It's by harnessing all
this communal creativity,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.335
if you will, that we're
able to do what we do.

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:54.717
-What we're really looking
for is passionate people

00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:56.300
who love what they
do and love to work

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.430
on high-impact projects
that have a technology

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.300
angle to them.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.080
-And you know, we make
a little prototype,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.730
and then you're like, yes.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.320
Then I run around
the entire office

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.595
and show it off to everybody.

00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:06.886
And I'm like, oh, look at this.

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:07.760
This is so cool.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.050
-I'm an optics person.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.090
I'm a hardware engineer.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.900
If you think that you're
in this very narrow field

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.690
and there's no opportunity, and
Google being mostly a software

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.000
company, you might be
surprised like I was.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.680
-I came to Google X
fresh out of school.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.745
I have friends that go to
work, and it's just a job.

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:29.370
But here, this is so
much more than that.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:36.160
-This is where we were about
one and a half years ago when

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.460
I first started.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.610
It's literally a phone
stuck next to your head.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.885
Now, we are here.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.780
-Knowing that when
I come to work,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.280
I'm doing something
that's making history

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.840
definitely puts a
smile on my face

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.310
and gets me excited to come
to work every single day.

00:03:59.357 --> 00:04:00.190
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.606
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.705
ISABELLE OLSSON: Hi, everybody.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.270
Thank you for having me.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.800
I'd like to talk
a little bit today

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.010
about staying uncomfortable.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.280
I think this is a good
example of doing just that,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.425
being in front of so many
talented women in tech.

00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:29.060
It's pretty incredible.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.610
So I hope I have something
that can inspire you.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.030
I'm not really sure,
but I'll do my best.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.060
So I think, generally in
life, we strive for comfort,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.000
trying to finding the perfect
home, or a perfect partner,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.330
and trying to be
really comfortable.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.790
And I think in our
careers and what

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.050
has helped me is to
do the very opposite,

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.930
is to put yourself in situations
where you are really, really

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.080
uncomfortable.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.970
I think that pushes
you to the next level.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.310
And I think that's why
I moved to San Francisco

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.980
about five years ago.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.770
I had a great life in Sweden.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.350
Bunch of friends,
family were designing

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.630
for [INAUDIBLE], and
exhibiting things,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.040
and just having kind
of an easy life.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.440
So then I thought, I think I
can have more impact than that.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.180
And just so much exciting things
going on in San Francisco,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.150
so I thought, why don't
I just try and go there?

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.350
Just drop everything, and
move into a little shoebox,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:42.700
and pay thousands of dollars
that I didn't have, and just

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.680
not being able to speak
the language properly,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.090
and into a tech world.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.430
I'm really not from tech.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.940
I've always loved tinkering
and building things.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.030
But when I moved here, I
didn't have a smartphone.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.300
I hardly knew what a
flat-screen TV was.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.390
And all of a sudden, I was
in this center of tech.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.140
And I thought, what
did I get myself into?

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.440
I'm crazy.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.050
And I remember my first
day at Fuseproject,

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.090
which was a design consultancy
that I started working at.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.470
And the project was to design
the next-generation tablet,

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.280
and I'm like, what is a tablet?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.710
I had no concept of it.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.910
So I started to look for
inspiration in things

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.300
that I love, things
that, I think, make

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:39.130
life more beautiful, like
furniture or jewelry,

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.840
and I pinned my little
pictures up on the wall.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.380
And then I looked around and
I saw all the dude pictures,

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.069
and it was just
full of computers.

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:50.610
There was just
computers on the wall,

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.730
and then I had some
rings and a little chair.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.780
And I thought, gosh, this is
really embarrassing right now.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:59.430
I really don't know
what I'm doing.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:06.040
But the cool thing was that
the art director was like,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.620
take down all the computers.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.270
This is where we're going
and really taking inspiration

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.780
from something that
is not familiar.

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.090
And that was the first
moment since I moved here

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.930
when I realized is, it's
good to be different,

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.640
and it's good to
be uncomfortable.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.440
So I worked there for a few
years, and it was amazing,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.140
and I was getting more
and more comfortable.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.370
Not good.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.400
So when I got a call from
Google, I thought, Google?

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.540
Do you make-- you
don't make things.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.540
It's on the computer,
the stuff that I

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.460
don't know so much about.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.900
But then she said,
well, you know,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.970
we're working on things
like self-driving cars.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.104
Self-driving cars?

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.020
She's like, yeah, you
probably heard about it.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.960
I was like, yeah, totally.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.300
I definitely heard about that.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.800
Not.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.160
But I thought, OK,
I'll take the meeting.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.630
This is interesting.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.150
Let's get a little
uncomfortable.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.110
And It definitely was.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.850
I'm sure you've heard about
the Google hiring process.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.210
And you're stuck in a room for
10 hours straight and people

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.330
asking you really
strange questions.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.160
And I didn't meet one designer.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.520
So I thought, what
would I do here?

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.910
There were optical engineers,
and mechanical engineers,

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:31.930
and UX people, and everybody
except for "my kind."

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.580
And also the only
woman, of course.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:39.289
So I thought, yeah,
yeah, I'll do this.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:42.780
I'll take this job because it
made me really uncomfortable.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:43.870
Oh, and did I mention?

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.953
They wouldn't tell me what
I was going to work on.

00:08:45.953 --> 00:08:47.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.350
So you saw this in the video.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.400
But on my first day,
that's when I found out

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:59.280
what I was going to work
on, and they showed me this.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:06.070
And that was uncomfortable, not
exactly what I was going for.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.970
And I saw this, and it was a
room full of software engineers

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:13.123
on their computers, and they
were actually using this.

00:09:13.123 --> 00:09:16.750
I don't know how really,
and this is-- I can't even.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.330
And I'm going to put it
back in my Chanel box here.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:29.550
But I got really
excited about the vision

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.330
that was underlying
around all this tech.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:39.100
So my job was to, and
this is, quote, my brief,

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.580
"make Glass comfortable
and beautiful."

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.980
So I thought I could
talk to you a little bit

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:50.380
about my approach in
trying to do that.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.570
Yeah, so this is
what we see today.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.400
Again, it's very early days.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.650
It's Explorer Edition.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.572
We're excited about
where we came from

00:09:58.572 --> 00:09:59.530
and where we are today.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.197
But obviously, I'm
already working on

00:10:02.197 --> 00:10:06.160
like the v5 or something.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.210
But it's pretty cool.

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:13.140
But it's sometimes-- and I
need to remind myself too

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.360
because you kind of start
getting like, things are not

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.199
getting smaller.

00:10:18.199 --> 00:10:19.740
Why are we not
getting further ahead?

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.150
And then I have to
put on this prototype

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:26.750
and just walk around in the
office and make people laugh.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.840
So yeah.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.800
So here's Joe.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:36.097
He's my product engineer I'm
working really closely with,

00:10:36.097 --> 00:10:36.930
and this is a model.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.075
So it's not a fair
comparison really.

00:10:39.075 --> 00:10:40.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.740
But for impact, it
makes a lot of sense.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:49.650
So I think when you're in this
really, really uncomfortable

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:54.270
situation as you have
this incredibly hard task,

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.200
someone is asking you to make
something impossible basically.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.822
Like, how would you make that
comfortable and beautiful?

00:11:00.822 --> 00:11:04.340
It just doesn't make sense.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.840
So what I try to always do
is set up design principles.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.645
And I think even if I'm
talking about design

00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:14.020
in this specific
case, I think it

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:16.840
applies to a lot of professions.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.739
And it's really about setting
out, what are the key goals?

00:11:20.739 --> 00:11:22.280
What are the key
goals that we always

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.510
have to filter a
decision through,

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.680
because the messy process?

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.850
If you're trying to create
something really amazing,

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.060
it's very, very
hard to lose track

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.960
of what's really important.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.690
Especially with technology,
you continuously

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.420
want to add sensors,
and battery life,

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.200
and all these things do
to make it even better.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:48.760
But in the process, you
actually make the problem worse.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.680
So in the case of Glass,
my main design principle

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.440
was simplicity.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.320
You see how it can be
this complex thing.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.990
And the thing is,
people really don't

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.030
want to know what's
going on on the inside.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:08.330
People just want for it to work.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.650
So we definitely had
that as a main motto

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.300
throughout the process.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.180
The second principle
is lightness.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.590
And I think it's not only
about physical lightness

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.030
but visual lightness, too.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.090
There was another early
prototype, the black one

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.400
you see here, had the same
components as Glass currently

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.390
does, but it looked really,
really techie, and heavy,

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.650
and frightening.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.980
So if you guys think Glass
is frightening today, well,

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.070
now you see how it
could have been.

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:49.010
And I think the last
principle is scalability.

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.940
It's really important to,
from the very beginning,

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.520
think about how is this
going to evolve over time?

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.580
How can we anticipate
issues that

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.850
are going to come along the way?

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:04.080
So in this case, you see the
prescription glasses for Glass.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.830
And it's the same technology,
it's just the frame coming off,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.850
and you can attach
a different frame.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:16.920
The second method that I'm
using, which is quite obvious,

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.185
but I think it's something
that we all could do even more.

00:13:21.185 --> 00:13:22.060
I want to do it more.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.034
And it's about visualizing
your ideas, and in this case,

00:13:25.034 --> 00:13:25.700
with prototypes.

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:36.010
Here is the snapshot of my desk,
actually, a few months ago.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.750
But it's an incredible
tool, right,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.460
when you were trying
to push the envelope.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.540
Instead of talking about
things, glue things

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:49.190
together and don't be
too fancy about it.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:53.180
And then here you actually
see an appearance model,

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:56.430
and it looks very,
very similar to Glass.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.360
But this is actually
a non-functional model

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.670
that I created two
and a half years ago.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.760
And this is the
Explorer Edition.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.390
So it really shows if
you set a high goal,

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.570
and if you inspire your teams
with something concrete,

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.559
you can get there, even
though it's hard along the way

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:17.600
and pretty uncomfortable.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:23.660
And I think what I touched on
before about scalability is

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.600
really important.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.340
When you're trying
to do really hard,

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.850
difficult things is to
design for evolution.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:36.000
Anticipate that things
are not going to work out.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.330
Think about ways that
you, from the beginning,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:46.450
can design in ways of
evolving things over time.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:49.180
So in the case of
Glass, I mean, yes,

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.860
what you have seen
is the core device,

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:54.040
but it's a whole
ecosystem of other things

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.860
that we've now been
able to create since we,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:01.000
from the beginning, anticipated
that one style doesn't fit all.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.405
And this will just continue
to evolve over time.

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.990
Yeah, and here you see
Greg, one of the earliest

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.930
users of wearable technology.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.370
He used to wear,
not too long ago,

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.050
a huge backpack with a
computer in it and cables

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:20.010
strapped all the
way to his head.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:25.106
But now he can wear his
regular frames in Glass.

00:15:25.106 --> 00:15:28.010
Yeah, and here's
another example of how

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.570
we design something that
could really be transformed.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.570
So I think one of the
things I'm the most excited

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:44.170
about, beyond just creating
something that I didn't even

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:49.640
think we could do, is
really how now everybody,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.400
not everybody, but
all of our Explorers

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.930
and how they're
using the product.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.380
And how inspiring
that is to then go

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.260
after the next challenge
of making this something

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.050
that could be for everybody.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.550
So we have a lot of
amazing Explorer stories,

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.700
and I just wanted to
share a little snapshot

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.070
video of that today.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.720
So if you can cue
the video, please.
