00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.190
Over the years, Disney and Pixar have created
movies based around a variety of lovable creatures,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.400
from princesses and frogs, to video game characters,
to children's toys come to life when their

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.500
owners aren't looking.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.410
For their newest release, Pixar has tapped
into a character who previously played the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.160
sidekick to a clown fish on the hunt for his
missing son.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.490
But, there are plenty of other characters
from Disney and Pixar with their own story

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.170
to tell, just like Finding Dory.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.030
Here are 10 Disney and Pixar sidekicks who
deserve their own movie.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.030
Bing Bong

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.960
There was plenty to laugh and cry at in Pixar's
Inside Out, and one character who managed

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.290
to cause both reactions in audience members
was Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.760
The character has everything needed for a
Pixar movie of his own: a theme song, an eccentric

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.040
personality, and a heartbreaking story.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.879
Though Inside Out doesn't leave room for a
sequel following Bing Bong, the imaginary

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.370
part-cat, part-elephant, part-dolphin creature
could certainly lead a prequel film about

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.040
his time with Riley, and how their relationship
changed as she got older.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.220
Mushu &amp; Cri-Kee

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.470
One of two companions to Mulan in the Disney
movie surrounding her decision to join the

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.770
army in her father's place, Mushu and the
lucky cricket are the comedic relief to the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.770
heroine.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.960
The Timon and Pumbaa to The Lion King's Simba,
of sorts.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.640
But, unlike Timon and Pumbaa who received
their own movie in The Lion King 1 1/2, Mushu

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.640
and Cri-Kee haven't starred in their own Disney
spinoff.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.960
However, the characters are a perfect focus
for a spinoff.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.900
Whether they go on their own mission to save
China or act as the Fa family's guardians

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.810
with another member of the house, Mushu and
Cri-Kee deserve their own Disney movie.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.810
Edna Mode

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.230
Although Frozone - or any number of fellow
superheroes from The Incredibles - would easily

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.170
be able to sustain his own movie, Edna Mode
could provide a departure from the typical

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.320
superhero story.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.680
Instead, a movie following the fashion designer
could focus on her unique side of the superhero

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.290
world, as the person in charge of creating
and mending the heroes' super-suits.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.260
With her demanding nature, her talent for
working with special fabrics, and perhaps

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.600
some other hidden skills that weren't on display
in The Incredibles, Edna could be the lead

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.960
in her own adventure.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960
Roz

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.320
When first introduced in Monsters, Inc., Roz
seems to be a straightforward character: a

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.909
grouchy, no-nonsense worker to Mike and Sully's
more complicated antics.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.350
So, when Roz is revealed to be an undercover
agent with the Child Detection Agency, viewers

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.680
are taken by surprise in the abrupt turnaround
from boring coworker to mysterious secret

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.680
agent.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.230
Considering Roz spent years undercover, and
previously worked for the CDA prior to that

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.129
mission, there is still plenty that Pixar
fans don't know about this particular monster

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.180
- and plenty of ground to cover in an entire
movie dedicated to Roz.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.180
Baymax

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.299
The healthcare robot devoted to making sure
Hiro Hamada was safe and healthy quickly became

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.890
a scene-stealer in Disney's Big Hero 6.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.549
Between Baymax having trouble understanding
the complexities of humans and his silly disposition

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.389
when his battery is depleted, the character
easily became a favorite among fans young

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.389
and old.

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:50.080
Plus, though he begins the film as Hiro's
healthcare companion, Baymax becomes a hero

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.080
in his own right.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.990
So, a Baymax-centric movie would a be perfect
sequel or spinoff from Big Hero 6 - Disney

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.849
just needs to come up with a reason for Baymax
to go on a solo mission.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:00.849
Little Green Men

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.650
There are plenty of different characters from
Pixar's three Toy Story movies who deserve

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.049
their own films - like Bonnie's toys Buttercup,
Peas-in-a-pod, and Mr. Pricklepants.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.549
But, some of the more mysterious characters
who have shared the screen with Woody and

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.120
Buzz are the Little Green Men that the toys
meet at Pizza Planet.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.219
Other than their devotion to their claw god,
we don't know much about these green aliens.

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:24.219
Given how Illumination's Minions have taken
over pop culture, the world may be ready for

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:27.420
a movie all about Toy Story's Little Green
Men.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.069
Cogsworth &amp; Lumière

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.969
Before Belle stepped into the Beast's castle
and began to unravel the magic spell that

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.340
had been placed on the prince, those who populated
the fortress were busy leading their own enchanted

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.340
lives.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.010
From Cogsworth and Lumière to other members
of the household like Mrs. Potts, Chip, and

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.249
the Wardrobe, the prince's castle was full
of ordinary people stuck in an extraordinary

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:47.249
world.

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.870
So, what was life like in the castle before
Belle arrived, or before the enchantress cast

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.139
the spell on the prince and everyone else
in the household?

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.939
Cogsworth and Lumière, with their charming
banter, could certainly sustain an entertaining

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.989
prequel all their own as they navigate the
Beast's household prior to Belle's arrival.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:03:59.989
Scuttle

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.180
Before Marlin, Nemo, and Dory led audiences
on a new adventure through the big blue sea,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.099
Ariel, Sebastian, and Flounder were the go-to
ocean experts in The Little Mermaid.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.689
But, when it came to knowledge of the land,
they turned to Scuttle the seagull, whose

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:16.370
expertise of human objects is unparalleled
- in it's ridiculousness of course.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.440
The eccentric bird, with his penchant for
coming up with unique names like dinglehopper

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.111
and snarfblatt, would be a fun guide through
the human world in his own movie, perhaps

00:04:24.111 --> 00:04:28.960
on his own quest to find a particularly intriguing
object - like a spork.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.050
Russell &amp; Dug

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.930
After the first 10 minutes or so of Up effectively
leaves everyone in the audience heartbroken,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.780
the movie proceeds to build viewers back up
through Carl's continued adventure after the

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.979
death of his wife and co-adventurer Ellie.

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.580
Along the way, Carl meeds Wilderness Explorer
Russell and a dog with the ability to speak

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.580
named Dug.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.830
Though Up seems to bring Carl's story to a
close, Russell and Dug are only at the beginning

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.199
of their adventuring days.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.080
What other Wilderness Explorer badges does
Russell earn?

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.669
Does Dug ever catch a squirrel?

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.590
These questions could be answered in a Pixar
movie completely devoted to these sidekicks

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.680
turned adventurerers.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.680
Olaf

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.770
An enthusiastic snowman with a love of summertime
and warm hugs, the character of Olaf easily

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.310
won over the hearts of viewers in Disney's
Frozen.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.800
The friendliest snowman in Arendelle was created
by Elsa's magic as a friend for Anna, and

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.509
helps the younger princess rescue her sister
from herself as well as the villainous Hans.

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.949
Though Frozen ends with Arendelle's magically-induced
winter coming to an end and Elsa creating

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.439
a snowcloud to keep Olaf solid, there's still
more story to tell with this happy snowman.

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.750
Perhaps he follows in Dory's footsteps and
goes on a journey to find a family.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.379
There are many sidekicks in the history of
Disney animation who deserve their own movie,

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:39.250
