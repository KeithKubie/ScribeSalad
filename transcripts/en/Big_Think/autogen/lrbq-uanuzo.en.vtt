its way through Congress now if I had
just written about the process it would

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680
just written about the process it would
 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.430
just written about the process it would
be a maybe a slightly lighter version of

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210
the Congressional Record still very
 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.420
the Congressional Record still very
boring and so I decided I had to weave

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430
boring and so I decided I had to weave
 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.339
boring and so I decided I had to weave
into it real characters and I had to

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349
into it real characters and I had to
 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.019
into it real characters and I had to
make sure that the characters express

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:49.029
make sure that the characters express
 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:51.180
make sure that the characters express
different viewpoints because the gun

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190
different viewpoints because the gun
 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.249
different viewpoints because the gun
debate is is influenced by so many

00:05:53.249 --> 00:05:53.259
debate is is influenced by so many
 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:55.559
debate is is influenced by so many
different viewpoints so it was important

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:55.569
different viewpoints so it was important
 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.829
different viewpoints so it was important
to me that this story reflect both sides

00:05:58.829 --> 00:05:58.839
to me that this story reflect both sides
 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.329
to me that this story reflect both sides
of the issue but also make the point

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:00.339
of the issue but also make the point
 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.820
of the issue but also make the point
that Congress will not act because of

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830
that Congress will not act because of
 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.459
that Congress will not act because of
the politics that surrounds us and the

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469
the politics that surrounds us and the
 

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.700
the politics that surrounds us and the
fear that so many of my colleagues have

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710
fear that so many of my colleagues have
 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.469
fear that so many of my colleagues have
not that their constituents are going to

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479
not that their constituents are going to
 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.260
not that their constituents are going to
be shot but that their careers may be

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270
be shot but that their careers may be
 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.450
be shot but that their careers may be
ended if they take on the gun Ra in the
