00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.800
Changing DOM element CSS classes is super useful.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.500
And likewise, sometimes you want to change attributes on DOM elements as well.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.200
Take a look at this unordered list in the header at the top of the page.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.390
Each of the list elements has an embedded a tag.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.840
You can see that the first element at the top of the list is missing its href.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.632
I want you to use jQuery to set its href to number 1 to match the hrefs of

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:30.740
the other elements in this list.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.785
You'll be using the .attr method to add an href.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:40.040
.attr is interesting in that it has two different method signatures.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.230
With the first signature,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.362
if you pass in the string of an attribute, you can get its value.

00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:49.890
And with the other, you can set the value of an attribute by passing in

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.300
a string for the second parameter.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.668
This is a common pattern for

00:00:53.668 --> 00:00:56.438
methods that interact with data saved on a DOM element.

00:00:56.438 --> 00:01:04.164
So, using .attr, can you change the href of this a tag to be equal to number 1?

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.250
Here's a hint.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.590
You might need another method like .first to help out.
