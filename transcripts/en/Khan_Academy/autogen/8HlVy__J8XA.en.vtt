00:00:00.446 --> 00:00:02.860
 In the first passive video 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.381
 we talked about the most passive 

00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:07.686
 of passive modes of transport - simple diffusion. 

00:00:07.686 --> 00:00:11.420
 We talked about how small, uncharged, non-polar 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.342
 molecules can easily pass through the membrane by diffusion. 

00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:16.867
 For example, carbon dioxide or molecular oxygen 

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.073
 will pass through the membrane most easily 

00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:21.035
 by diffusion. 

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:23.844
 They are small enough to slip through the small empty spaces 

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:26.688
 in the membrane and since they have no charge or polarity, 

00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:29.957
 will be able to pass through the entire membrane. 

00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:31.477
 Then we talked about medium variants, 

00:00:31.477 --> 00:00:33.496
 such as water molecules that are small enough to pass 

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:35.578
 through the spaces in the membrane, but have polarity. 

00:00:35.578 --> 00:00:37.750
 They will not be able to pass very easily, 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.766
 but they will be able to leak. 

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:40.797
 We also talked about things, 

00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:42.150
 which will be very difficult for them to pass through the membrane. 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.877
 These are the loaded frequencies, 

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:47.094
 here we have some ions - sodium ion, 

00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:48.278
 potassium ion. 

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:51.077
 Though they are small, they will interact hard 

00:00:51.077 --> 00:00:54.676
 with phosphate heads, 

00:00:54.676 --> 00:00:57.810
 with this charge, it will make it difficult 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.742
 passing through the membrane. 

00:01:00.742 --> 00:01:02.925
 In this video I want to keep talking 

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:04.631
 for passive transport. 

00:01:04.631 --> 00:01:07.976
 Remember that passive transport does not use energy. 

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:10.743
 And the particles move in the direction of their concentration gradient. 

00:01:10.743 --> 00:01:13.047
 We will talk about ways in which passive transport 

00:01:13.047 --> 00:01:14.927
 can be relieved 

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:16.926
 for some of these molecules here. 

00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:18.834
 Their passive transport 

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:22.270
 will be facilitated and facilitated. 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.049
 That's what we'll be talking about in this video. 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.103
 Let me first find a place where 

00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:29.343
 to write it, relieved diffusion. 

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.162
 I will write it, 

00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:34.330
 relieved diffusion, 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.788
 relieved diffusion. 

00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:40.895
 The previous video was for a simple diffusion, 

00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:42.915
 we will now talk about how we can make it easier. 

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:44.257
 What do you think, 

00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:46.677
 if we had to invent something, 

00:01:46.677 --> 00:01:49.939
 to facilitate these particles - 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.033
 water moles or ions, 

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.983
 to move in the direction of their concentration gradient, 

00:01:53.983 --> 00:01:55.343
 what would it be? 

00:01:55.343 --> 00:01:57.388
 You might say, "If we did not have to deal with 

00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:59.048
 with all this, 

00:01:59.048 --> 00:02:01.962
 with all these hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails, 

00:02:01.962 --> 00:02:03.744
 and hydrophilic heads here. " 

00:02:03.744 --> 00:02:05.263
 "This would facilitate movement in the direction 

00:02:05.263 --> 00:02:06.877
 of the concentration gradient. " 

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.672
 Exactly such an invention has also appeared in nature. 

00:02:09.672 --> 00:02:13.852
 Practically there are tunnels through the membrane. 

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:17.291
 One way in which the diffusion can take place 

00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:19.730
 is through the use of protein channels. 

00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:23.913
 I will write it in an organ, just like that. 

00:02:23.913 --> 00:02:27.906
 "Protein channels." 

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:30.806
 "Protein channels." 

00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:33.266
 Example of a protein channel 

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:34.927
 it may be here. 

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:37.840
 It can be a specialized channel 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.634
 for water, 

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:44.051
 this type of channels are called aquaporins. 

00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:46.365
 "Acvoporini." 

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:48.467
 It's just a protein channel for water. 

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.057
 You see there's that hole on top. 

00:02:50.057 --> 00:02:52.250
 Let's say we have more water molecules 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.094
 outside the cage, than in it. 

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:58.950
 We want to move them in the direction of their concentration gradient 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.630
 or perhaps we have a higher concentration of solute here, 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.754
 there will be osmosis. 

00:03:04.754 --> 00:03:07.532
 Water molecules will be more likely 

00:03:07.532 --> 00:03:10.000
 to move from the outside to the inside, 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.811
 than from inside out. 

00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:14.493
 We can have water molecules that come in here. 

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:16.147
 They do not have to deal with the membrane at all, 

00:03:16.147 --> 00:03:20.005
 just going through the aquaporine 

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:23.728
 and will come out inside the cage. 

00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:26.708
 We have similar protein channels for ions. 

00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:29.033
 This one can be for ions. 

00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:32.481
 Let's say it's sodium, 

00:03:32.481 --> 00:03:35.415
 here are sodium ions. 

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.200
 They are loaded, they will have difficulty passing through the membrane. 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.653
 But this protein channel may be specific for sodium ions 

00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:46.374
 and allows them to pass. 

00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:49.521
 As we will see when we learn about neurons, 

00:03:49.521 --> 00:03:52.732
 protein ion channels 

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.228
 are extremely important for boosting 

00:03:55.228 --> 00:03:58.617
 electrical or electrochemical signals. 

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:02.369
 Ionic channels can also have activating doors that open and close 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.110
 Under certain conditions, 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.537
 which may be different in different parts of the cell. 

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.428
 These protein channels may be open 

00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:09.867
 or closed, 

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:12.325
 depending on the conditions in which they are located. 

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:14.032
 This is key 

00:04:14.032 --> 00:04:16.144
 for processes in neurons, 

00:04:16.144 --> 00:04:18.173
 as we will see in the next videos. 

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:21.226
 Another kind of diffusion can take place 

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:25.973
 through the so-called transport proteins. 

00:04:26.535 --> 00:04:28.838
 I will talk about the transport proteins, but it is important to stress that 

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:31.571
 people still learn how they work. 

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.702
 I will draw a membrane here. 

00:04:34.702 --> 00:04:38.289
 I will draw the medallion and 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.554
 carrier protein in the membrane. 

00:04:45.257 --> 00:04:50.112
 This is a transverse cut of the membrane. 

00:04:50.112 --> 00:04:54.820
 The dual phospholipid layer is almost ready, 

00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:57.461
 now the carrier protein. The way I draw it no 

00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:00.091
 shows exactly what the transport proteins look like, 

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:02.404
 but gives an approximate idea. 

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:06.870
 Something like that. 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.069
 If the particles want to move in the direction of their concentration gradient - 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.702
 Let's say we have a higher concentration on top. 

00:05:12.702 --> 00:05:15.923
 I'll take some hypothetical particle, 

00:05:15.923 --> 00:05:19.092
 which has a higher concentration than the bottom. 

00:05:19.092 --> 00:05:23.346
 Particles can get stuck or get in 

00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:25.586
 the department here that will make it 

00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:29.278
 the transport protein to change its shape. 

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:32.746
 Let's see if I can draw the altered shape well. 

00:05:32.746 --> 00:05:34.812
 It can change its shape. 

00:05:35.763 --> 00:05:37.971
 This happens when we pick up particles from above. 

00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:41.912
 When the protein "sees" that there is a load, 

00:05:44.422 --> 00:05:47.318
 can change its shape to this one. 

00:05:47.318 --> 00:05:49.125
 He'll turn around. 

00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:51.209
 Let me take another tool. 

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:55.628
 Today I have a problem with the tools. 

00:05:57.802 --> 00:06:00.648
 The carrier protein can be reversed. 

00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:03.544
 It was open above, but now 

00:06:03.544 --> 00:06:04.897
 and the load that was 

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.326
 gathered from above, 

00:06:06.326 --> 00:06:09.769
 falls inside the cage. 

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.804
 It is a passive transport because 

00:06:12.804 --> 00:06:15.439
 all these particles move in the direction of their concentration gradient. 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.181
 If we did not have a cell membrane here, 

00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:18.841
 the particles would move in that direction. 

00:06:18.841 --> 00:06:20.585
 We would have more particles moving in that direction 

00:06:20.585 --> 00:06:21.648
 for a given period of time, than 

00:06:21.648 --> 00:06:23.896
 in the opposite direction. 

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:25.533
 But the cell membrane stays in the particle path, 

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:26.833
 however it can 

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:29.677
 to ease passive transport. 

00:06:29.677 --> 00:06:32.835
 It can facilitate diffusion.
