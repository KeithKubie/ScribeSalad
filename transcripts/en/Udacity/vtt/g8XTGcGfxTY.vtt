00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
To show you how we can encode a single single snap shot on the REM

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.300
as a Boolean formula,

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.020
I'm going to show you a little trick with the Boolean formula.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.800
So this Boolean formula--

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.660
it looks a bit intimidating, and it doesn't look fun.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.820
Well I'll just quickly explain it to you and then help you figure out

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.170
the special property that it has.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.450
So the formula consists of 6 variables:

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.190
X1, X2, X3 to X6

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.090
and it has 7 brackets,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.220
so as you can see, each of those brackets contains

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.880
all of the 6 variables: X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.900
Sometimes they're a bit mixed up,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.500
but every bracket here contains the 6 variables exactly once.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.040
They're all connected with an and here,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.990
and each one of them looks like this,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.960
so up here you have an or over all of those variables,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.360
and down here,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.390
each bracket has a very similar structure,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.620
so you have X1

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.020
or you have one of the variables

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.400
and a not of that variable,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.060
or,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.230
and this is a very big not

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.340
over off the other variables,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.230
and those are combined by or.

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.810
Now probably it's a bit tough to figure out by yourself

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.840
what the purpose of this formula is.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.650
I want you to figure it out,

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.490
but I will give you a few choices.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.440
So what's special about this Boolean formula?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.530
Does it not have any satisfying assignment?

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.940
Does it have several satisfying assignments?

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.650
Can it only be satisfied if exactly

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.440
one of those 6 variables is set to true,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.270
and finally, if you generalize this,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.520
so not 6 variables but any number n of variables,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.970
and then you do the same structure as you do here.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.630
That's the whole resulting formula,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.280
have size 0 (n squared) for n variables?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.630
So I think by now you're used to more than one of these answers

00:01:47.630 --> 99:59:59.000
can be true, so check all of these that are correct.
