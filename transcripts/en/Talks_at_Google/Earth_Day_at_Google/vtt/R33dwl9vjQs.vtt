THALMA LOBEL: Thank you.

00:00:01.377 --> 00:00:04.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.210
Thank you, and I'm really,
really glad to be here.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.650
You know, I heard so much
about Google offices.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.850
And I wanted all the time to
come here, but nobody let me.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.766
So I decided I'll sit for two
years, every day, write a book,

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.640
and then maybe I'll be invited.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.430
And it worked.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.840
So thank you very much.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.610
Today I want to talk about
how our physical sensations

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.320
influence our behaviors,
thoughts, emotions, judgements,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.570
decisions-- what I call
in the book "The New

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.850
Science of Physical
Intelligence."

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.090
In order to understand
that, I would

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.696
like to talk a little bit
about embodied cognition.

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:53.530
Embodied cognition actually
says what I said a minute ago--

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.070
that our thoughts,
feelings, and behaviors are

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.140
grounded in our bodily states.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.390
Later on, I'll explain
what I mean exactly

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.720
by grounded in our
physical states.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.930
But for the moment, let me
say that embodied cognition

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.450
demonstrates our physical
sensations, influence

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.720
almost everything we do.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.140
What we see, what we
hear, what we smell,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.830
without our awareness,
influences what we do.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.650
And a nice example of it is when
you examine common metaphors,

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.900
like a warm person, a soft
negotiator, clean conscience,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.600
emotionally close.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.410
Pay attention to
the fact that we

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.930
use concrete
concepts to describe

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.930
more abstract concepts.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.610
And these are actually
what metaphors are.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.560
And a lot of researchers
believe that they are not

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.620
only demonstrations of
these associations--

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.210
between concrete concept
to abstract concept--

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.860
but actually they're
part of the process.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.660
So I'll try now to show
you how these metaphors are

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.919
more than just a
figure of speech,

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.700
but show how our physical
sensations are related

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.200
to our behavior,
emotions and thoughts.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.580
Let's start with temperature.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.530
The things we touch, they may
be cold, they may be warm.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.330
And let me start telling
you about one study which

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.800
I like specifically.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.260
This study was conducted
by Williams and Bargh.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.320
I will not repeat
all the researchers.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.270
I have all them on
my presentation.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.020
I could tell you later
on about the names,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.870
but this is really important,
so I'll say the names.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.080
And they're from
Yale University.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.310
And what they did was
they asked participants

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.970
to come to an experiment.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.630
And each participant,
when he came

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.250
to the Yale building, the
psychology Yale building,

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.380
was met by an experimenter
who followed him and told him,

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.960
let's go to the first
floor in the elevator.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.720
What the participants
didn't know

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.690
is that the experiment
started already

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.080
while they were in the elevator.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.570
The experimenter
asked the participant,

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.500
can you hold my
coffee for a minute,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.185
while I'm writing your name?

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:16.310
And she gave the coffee,
and then she took it back.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.750
That's all.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.800
To half of the participants,
she gave a cold cup

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.160
of coffee, an iced coffee.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.990
To the other half, she
gave a warm cup of coffee.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.110
And then, they came to the lab.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.610
They didn't even
remember, probably,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.152
that they had this coffee.

00:03:32.152 --> 00:03:33.610
They came to the
lab, and they were

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.890
asked to evaluate Person A.
They were told that Person A is

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.070
intelligent, brilliant,
industrious-- all the things

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.830
that you see here-- determined,
practical, and cautious.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.710
And they were asked to evaluate
that person on several traits

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:52.790
or characteristics.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.570
Half of them are related
to a warm personality,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.700
like friendly or nice.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.730
And half are not related.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.060
What happened was--
and this is really,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.540
I think it's amazing--
is that participants who

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.470
held a warm cup of coffee
in the elevator, just

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.740
a few minutes earlier,
rated Person A as a warmer

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.532
person than those who
held a cold cup of coffee.

00:04:18.532 --> 00:04:19.990
And when they were
told, of course,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.600
they didn't think it had
anything to do with the coffee.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.880
They asked why do you
think this person is warm?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.350
They gave all kind of answers.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.120
Nobody thought it was
because he or she held

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.110
the warm cup of coffee
in the elevator.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.540
So that's an experiment
that influenced me a lot.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.450
And I went deeper into
thinking about it,

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.860
and it actually influenced
a lot of people.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.560
And then a lot of experiments
came out after that,

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.870
and I will describe
some of them.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.650
But before that, these
same experimenters

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.220
did another experiment.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.480
They asked people to
hold either a cold

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.710
or a warm therapeutic pad, as
if it's part of a marketing

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:02.600
research.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.420
So half of the subjects held a
warm one, half held a cold one.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.310
And they were asked all kind
of questions about the product.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.650
Then they asked, thank you
very much for participating.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.800
I want to reward you
for your participation.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.050
Please choose either
a gift for yourself

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.010
or a gift for a friend.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.000
What happened was that 75%
of the participants who

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.200
held a cold therapeutic pad
chose a gift for themselves,

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.250
and only 25% chose a
gift for somebody else.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.790
Well, those who held a
warm therapeutic pad,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.900
46% of the participants
chose a gift for themselves.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.880
And 54%, a little
bit more than half,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.720
chose a gift for a friend.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.840
That means that just the fact
that they held something warm

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.160
made them more generous.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.870
So there are more studies
done on the influence

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.290
of temperature, like
it enhances trust.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.670
But I'll go on because
I have a limited time.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.280
So I'll go to the next physical
sensation, which is weight.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.210
We hold things that may
be heavy, it may be light.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.790
And there are many
metaphors that

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.710
show that, you say heavy
decision, weighty matters,

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.960
weigh your options.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.140
And what do we mean by that?

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.410
We mean that there is an
association between weight

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.810
and importance.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.950
Heavy decision means that
it's an important decision.

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.380
So let's see if indeed, when
people hold something heavy,

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.320
they think that thing that they
are reading on that heavy thing

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.140
is more important.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.790
So what they did
in this study, they

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.660
had two groups of
participants who

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.630
read a resume of
a job candidate.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.820
The resume was exactly
the same for both groups.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.980
Only one difference.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.200
One group was holding it on
a relatively heavy clipboard,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.650
while the other
group was holding it

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.929
on a relatively light clipboard.

00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:10.720
They were holding it
while it was standing,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.050
so they felt whether
it was heavy or not.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.040
Participants who held
the heavy clipboard

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.670
rated the candidate as
a better one for the job

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.040
than those who held
the light clipboard.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.744
Remember, the only
difference was

00:07:27.744 --> 00:07:28.910
the weight of the clipboard.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.450
It was exactly the same resume.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.090
They did another study,
where they asked people

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.180
to answer a survey about
how much they think

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.210
different public issues
should be funded,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.325
like air pollution or education.

00:07:43.325 --> 00:07:46.350
All kind of things, how
much they should be funded.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:50.650
And again, some of the people
held it on a heavy clipboard,

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.010
while the others held it on
a relatively light clipboard.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.680
Again, what came
out is that those

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.360
that held the heavy clipboard--
in this case I wrote men,

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.140
and I'll tell you
in a minute why

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.130
men and not women-- but men
who held the heavy clipboard

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.360
believed public affairs should
be funded more than those

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.990
who held a light clipboard.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.400
This result did not come out
when women were involved.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.380
And one of the reasons could
be that women in general--

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:25.080
and there are studies that show
that-- are more inclined to say

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.330
these things should be funded.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.600
So there is kind of
a ceiling effect.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.240
That's why it didn't
come out for women.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.179
But for men, the
weight mattered.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:37.960
Now let's go to
vision a little bit.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.059
Tell me, what are
your associations

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:44.460
with the red color?

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.420
Yeah?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.180
AUDIENCE: Danger.

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.100
THALMA LOBEL: Danger.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.526
What else?

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:50.910
Only danger?

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.565
I need the other things too.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.190
AUDIENCE: Stop.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.340
THALMA LOBEL: Stop, right.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.874
What else?

00:08:55.874 --> 00:08:56.740
AUDIENCE: Blood.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.478
THALMA LOBEL: Yeah, you're
all in the same area.

00:08:59.478 --> 00:09:02.717
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
romanticism.

00:09:02.717 --> 00:09:04.300
THALMA LOBEL: Sorry,
I couldn't hear--

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:04.730
AUDIENCE: Romanticism.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.813
THALMA LOBEL: Yeah, great.

00:09:05.813 --> 00:09:08.870
I was looking for this
answer too, it is valid.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.370
OK.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.512
So you're all right.

00:09:10.512 --> 00:09:11.970
And we all have
these associations.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.570
We have these associations
of passion and lust.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.870
And we have the associations
that you said-- danger,

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.120
stop signs.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.370
And it depends on the
context, because it

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.920
has several associations.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.100
And I want to show you
several studies that

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.010
check it from all these angles.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.999
So the first study
is more associated

00:09:33.999 --> 00:09:35.040
with what you said first.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.700
Danger, stop, et cetera.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.300
There were three
groups of participants

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:44.310
that were given verbal tests.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.660
In this case, it's anagrams.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.130
It's a test that you
get scrambled letters,

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.500
and you have to
change it to a word.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.670
And you have to do it
as fast as possible.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.030
All three groups got
this same exact test.

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.110
Only one difference.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.900
If you notice, the participant
number had different color.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.700
One group had a red
participant number,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.090
and the other two
had different colors.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.090
OK?

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.400
And what happened
was that students

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.150
in the condition with
the red participant color

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.260
performed worse than
those in the other colors.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.100
Now, I want to emphasize.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.960
You can say it was by
mistake or something.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.830
They did it again and again
with more verbal tests,

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.540
with mathematical tests.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.910
They did it in Germany
and in the United States.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.260
They did it with high
school and they did it

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.510
with college students.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.820
Always came the same result.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:47.260
When there was some red
mark on the test-- usually

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:49.010
the participant's
number or sometimes they

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:54.710
did something else-- it
decreased the performance,

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.100
the performance worse.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.307
Why is that?

00:10:59.307 --> 00:11:01.389
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:03.430
I'm surprised that you
laughed, because I thought

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.540
that people in Google
never saw this mark.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.540
But some other people did.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.090
And one of the reasons--
that's not the only reason,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.540
there are also evolutionary
explanations that you said,

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.160
blood and all that-- but
definitely, we are reinforced

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.640
by all kind of signs
that say stop, danger,

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.290
or the teacher that
makes all these signs.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.420
And then, one of
the explanations

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.510
is that when you read a test, or
when you're performing a test,

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.020
and you see this red, it stops
you, even for part of a second.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.680
It's enough that you
will perform worse

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.920
on this type of test.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.530
I don't think it
will influence when

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.080
you have to write a
long essay and all that.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.490
But on this type of test
that you have to do quickly,

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:51.150
like mathematical and verbal
test like the one I showed you,

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:54.630
it has the effect.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.530
Let's talk about the
other association,

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:02.930
which is sexual attraction,
passion, et cetera.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:09.580
In this study, men were
shown photos of women.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:16.670
If you see the three women at
the top, they are all the same.

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.160
Only one difference, as
you can see very clearly--

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.380
the color of the background
they are depicted.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.780
One group of men saw the woman
against a red background.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.130
The other two groups saw
it on different colors.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.800
They did it several times,
so you have different women.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.980
But in each experiment,
all the groups

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.000
saw-- all the men
saw the same woman.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.290
And they were asked several
questions about her.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:49.050
How attractive she is, how
sexy and desirable she is.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.910
In some experiments
they asked, would

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.710
like to have sex with her?

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.414
They were asked, would
you like to date her?

00:12:55.414 --> 00:12:56.830
Even in one
experiment they asked,

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.420
how much money would you like
to spend on her on a date?

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.720
And surprise, surprise.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.860
The men who saw the woman
against the red background

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.800
though she was more
attractive, she was sexier.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.500
They wanted to have
sex with her more

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.920
than they wanted
with the other women,

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.580
even though they
were the same women,

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:24.220
and even to spend more
money on her on a date.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.550
In other words, just
the fact that she

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:30.580
was against a red background
was enough to perceive

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.130
her as more attractive.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.610
The interesting part is
that when they were asked,

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.520
what made you think
she's attractive or sexy?

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.480
They did not think it was
the color of the background.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.217
Some say the color of the
hair or what she was wearing.

00:13:43.217 --> 00:13:44.050
And they changed it.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.480
They did several experiments.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.510
So one she was wearing
this type of shirt, one

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.215
she was wearing
another type of shirt.

00:13:51.215 --> 00:13:54.060
They always thought it
was something else and not

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.090
the color of the background.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.790
So that's interesting,
and I will

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.000
talk at the end about
implications for dating,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.900
et cetera.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.080
Let's talk about texture.

00:14:06.192 --> 00:14:07.098
Yeah?

00:14:07.098 --> 00:14:08.994
AUDIENCE: When they
were asked that,

00:14:08.994 --> 00:14:10.910
were they shown the
pictures of the same women

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:11.944
with different
backgrounds and say

00:14:11.944 --> 00:14:12.790
why did you pick
this one over that?

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:13.580
THALMA LOBEL: No.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.090
Each group got only one picture.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.570
But they were divided
randomly, and always this group

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.551
had the higher average.

00:14:22.551 --> 00:14:24.100
AUDIENCE: So how
did they ask them,

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.058
why did you say you would
spend more money on--

00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:27.340
THALMA LOBEL: No, not more.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.820
This is a good question,
maybe I was not clear enough.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.810
They said, why do you think
that woman is attractive?

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.175
If you gave her a 5
out of 7 or whatever.

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:38.530
And he said yeah, because she
has long hair or whatever.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:39.450
OK?

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.320
And then they were
asked specifically

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.036
about the color of
the picture, and they

00:14:43.036 --> 00:14:46.100
said it didn't affect
me in my decision.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.490
Let's go back to texture.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.270
As you see, there are
all these metaphors.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:54.700
I had a rough time, smooth
sailing, rough relationship

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.875
we use, again.

00:14:55.875 --> 00:14:57.250
And you have to
ask yourself, why

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.750
do we use these particular
concrete concept rather than

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.960
others, when I want to say that
I had a bad day or something?

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.600
So let's see if these
metaphors, again, are not just

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.700
figures of speech.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.690
So in one experiment,
the participants

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.160
were asked to complete a puzzle.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.990
The exact same puzzle was given
to the two groups, only one

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.970
difference.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.980
One group got very smooth
parts of the puzzle,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.280
while the other group got very
rough parts of the puzzle.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.810
So they touched
something rough or small.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.990
Then, they were given
an ambiguous dialogue,

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.510
and had to decide
whether this dialogue was

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.910
friendly or unfriendly,
cooperative or competitive,

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.010
whether it was a
discussion or an argument.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:55.250
It was kind of ambiguous, so
you could think what you want.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.920
And as you can
imagine by now, those

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.840
that held the smooth parts
thought the interaction

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.130
was more friendly,
cooperative, and it

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.040
was a discussion rather
than an argument,

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:11.940
compared to those who held the
puzzle with the rough parts.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.110
I want to remind you, it was
not done while they were asked.

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.410
This was done like an
ostensibly different study.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.817
So first they were
holding the puzzle, then

00:16:20.817 --> 00:16:22.900
in ostensibly another
study, they were asked that.

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.330
And still it affected them.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:26.590
Which I think is more
impressive than if you ask them

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.490
while you're doing that.

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.120
Another part of texture
is hard and soft.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.600
And you can say hard person,
soft negotiators of tactics,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.450
etc.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.940
So let's see, again,
how they affect.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.945
In one study, some
of the participants

00:16:45.945 --> 00:16:49.710
were sitting on a hard chair
and some of the participants

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.050
were sitting on a soft chair.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.760
And then they were
asked to imagine

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.520
that they're at the car
dealership buying a car.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.320
And they were asked
to give two offers,

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.050
assuming that their
first offer was rejected.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:11.349
Those that sat on a soft
chair were less rigid

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.240
compared to those who
sat on a hard chair.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.310
Those that sat on a soft
chair changed their offer

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.520
more than those who
sat on a hard chair.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.400
They were softer negotiator.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.099
But let's see if you touch
something soft or hard,

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:27.560
whether that happens too.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.640
So this is a very
nice study, I think.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.710
The researchers stopped
passersby in the street,

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:37.460
and said there is going
to be a magic show.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.670
And you know that
the magician always

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:43.790
asks you to check the
things that he or she holds,

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:47.010
whether he hasn't got tricks
and the dove will come out

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.940
of the handkerchief
or something.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.360
So in this case, some
of the participants

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:55.355
were asked to check
a soft blanket,

00:17:55.355 --> 00:17:56.730
and some of the
participants were

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:01.280
asked to check a
hard wooden block.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.710
Supposedly, that was the
thing that the magician

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.336
would use in his tricks.

00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:10.510
Then, the magic
tricks never happened.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.980
They said it was postponed.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.410
And in an ostensibly
different study,

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:18.236
they were asked to listen to an
interaction between an employee

00:18:18.236 --> 00:18:23.520
and a boss and to
rate the employee.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:27.010
Again, those who
held a hard block

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.360
rated the employee
as a harder person

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.010
than those who held
the soft blanket.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.510
And I want to remind you again,
it was not at the same time.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.330
It was completely like they
didn't even relate to that.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.010
That was a magic show, and
then they went to the lab

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.550
and did another thing.

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.390
OK.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.930
Now as you showed before,
I want to talk a little bit

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.360
about morals and cleaning.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.750
You know, we have
many metaphors that

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.480
talk about the association
between physical cleaning

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.950
and morality.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:05.160
He has dirty hands,
clean conscience,

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.470
washing away the scenes,
filthy liar, et cetera.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:14.970
So we use these physical
cleaning words and concepts

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.840
to describe something
which is actually abstract,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.350
like a conscience.

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:21.510
So let's see if that works.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.950
Here, I want to tell you about
a study that me and my students

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.380
did in our lab.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.040
We wanted to see if people
who washed themselves

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.590
after a shower would cheat
more or less on a test,

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.820
if there is anything
to do with that.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:41.400
So what we did-- this is a
study that we've just submitted

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.230
for publication--
two of my students

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.310
went to the gym of
Tel Aviv University

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:54.380
and asked people, either
before they went to the shower

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:57.450
or immediately after they
came out of the shower,

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.129
to complete a questionnaire.

00:20:00.129 --> 00:20:01.420
And what was the questionnaire?

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:06.070
We constructed a very
difficult questionnaire

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.710
asking all kind of general
knowledge questions.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:13.730
We did several times
before in other studies.

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.230
And in a pre-test,
we found questions

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:19.480
that they can be answered,
but nobody knows the answer.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:24.580
Like in what year was
the stethoscope invented.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:29.590
Or what day and month and year
some not very important soccer

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.350
player from a hundred
years ago was born?

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.880
Questions like that that
definitely nobody answers.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.130
Or politician, not very well
known, when he was born,

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.130
et cetera.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.330
And we did pre-test,
and we were sure

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:45.580
that these questions,
nobody knows to answer.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.350
Now in this questionnaire,
we had 13 questions.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.590
Four were very easy, and
nine were very difficult.

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.930
So if somebody tells
the truth, he or she

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:55.310
actually says that they failed.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.240
Because they didn't
know 9 out of 13.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.620
What we did, we gave
them the questionnaire.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.640
And, in order to measure
their cheating behavior,

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.040
we just let them self-score
their own questionnaire.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.410
We gave them the answer key.

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:12.500
And we said, OK,
see what you did.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.950
And I don't need your
original questionnaire.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.930
You can tear it and throw
it to the recycle bin,

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.410
just give me the page where
you wrote, I answered correctly

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.485
so and so question.

00:21:24.485 --> 00:21:27.380
So that way we could
see who cheated.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.210
And what we found out is that
participants who went out

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:34.520
of the shower, who were
clean, cheated more

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.330
than those were
before the shower.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.049
This is a little bit
counter-intuitive, I think.

00:21:39.049 --> 00:21:41.590
Because you would have thought,
and we thought too, that once

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:44.010
you are pure from
the outside, you

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.190
will be pure from the inside.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.830
But then we thought
a little bit more.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:53.150
And we did another study also
that how much people donate,

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.020
and we found similar results.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:00.480
And what we think, is that once
you feel completely clean--

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.880
and there is an
association between being

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.682
clean inside-- you kind of feel
you have a license to cheat,

00:22:06.682 --> 00:22:08.640
because you have, you
can do a little-- I mean,

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.160
I'm completely good and clean.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.070
So I can do a little
cheating on a test

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.920
in the gym, who I don't even
get money for that or anything,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.140
so I'll do that.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:22.110
And I found out that
there are studies

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.070
that use this term
license to cheat,

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.560
but not related to
physical cleaning.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:33.060
But in some situations
people feel they can do that.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:36.500
So what we found is that once
you feel completely clean,

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.210
it's kind of, OK,
I'm pure, I don't

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:42.580
need to be very, very honest.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.060
I can cheat a little bit.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.180
So that's a nice study,
I think, that we did,

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.080
with counter-intuitive results.

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:54.162
What about vertical position?

00:22:54.162 --> 00:22:56.620
Vertical position, you know
also we use a lot of metaphors.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.720
She looks up to her
brother, she climbed

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.320
the corporate ladder,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:06.550
So we use up and down
to describe power

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:12.650
and down to describe
somebody who is not powerful.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:16.050
And you can see that
people know that.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.250
And mine is bigger.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.800
So every country
wants to show that I

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.670
have the biggest and
tallest building.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.310
And it's not only from, I think,
from an architectural point

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.990
of view.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:31.201
But really, it symbolizes power.

00:23:31.201 --> 00:23:33.320
The tallest building.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.820
So I want to show you that we
really represent-- because you

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.310
know that high represents power
and low represents powerless--

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.940
but I want to show that
we really represent

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:50.130
these powerful or powerless
that I mentioned along

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.270
a vertical dimension
really in our heads.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.120
So in order to do
that, there were

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.580
studies that showed
people two pairs of words.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.300
One was the powerless,
and one was the powerful.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.300
Servant and master, for example.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.460
And they were
asked, for example,

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.830
identify as fast as
possible the powerful word.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.850
Or, in another study,
identify as fast as possible

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.860
the powerless word.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.030
What happened was,
that if, for example,

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.490
they were asked to identify
as fast as possible

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.910
the powerless word
and it was up,

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.410
although it was
supposed to be down,

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:33.420
it took them longer than
if it was employer up

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.520
and employee down.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.089
And when you measure direction
time, you say why is it.

00:24:38.089 --> 00:24:39.130
Why is it more difficult?

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.680
I mean, you see that
servant is powerless

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.270
and master is powerful.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:48.630
But it's like you get two kind
of contradictory information.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.170
You get that the servant
is powerless, but he's up.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.880
So it takes you a little bit
longer to react correctly.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:58.600
Which actually is a proof
that we organize our thoughts

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.040
along a vertical position.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.460
But I want to show you how--
because you are here in Google,

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.530
I think it's more interesting
to show-- that even

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.250
the lengths of the lines matter.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:18.950
So in this study,
participants were

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.740
asked to evaluate a manager.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:28.980
And they were told that the
organization has 126 employees.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.940
And they were told about
their average salary.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:36.190
And then they were shown
this chart, the two charts.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.800
And they were asked, how
important is the manager?

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.660
How powerful that manager is.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.350
Questions like you
can see on the screen.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:49.010
I think that manager is
a very strong leader.

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:52.730
He's powerful in the company,
has control, et cetera.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:56.440
And what happened was that
those who saw-- and I'll go back

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.780
to show you this
chart again-- those

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:04.280
who saw the chart with
the longer vertical line

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.580
thought the manager was
more powerful than those who

00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.810
saw the same thing, and
with the same description

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:14.030
of the company, only
the line was shorter.

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.970
Which shows that, when you
draw something-- in the website

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.990
or whatever-- the
lengths of the line

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.910
matters more than
people realize.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:26.370
The other way around is
when subjects were just

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.810
given a description
of a manager.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.550
Again, very similar.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:34.840
Two groups were given
exactly the same description,

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:39.430
it's a company with so and
so employees, with such

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:42.470
and such average salary.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.820
But one group was told
that the manager is not

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.430
a very powerful
person in the company.

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:52.720
The other group was told that
he's very powerful person.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:27:01.250
And then, they were told
please put the square that

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:03.830
represents the manager
wherever you want.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:07.030
And those who were told that
the manager was not so powerful

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.640
put it lower than those
who thought-- they still

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.010
put it above the
others, but lower.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.220
We chose the links of
the vertical position

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.090
is-- Along the
vertical position,

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.070
we really perceive it as more
powerful or less powerful.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.850
OK, let's go to taste.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:32.230
We also use he's a
very sweet person.

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:36.810
We use the words bitter person,
love is sweet, et cetera.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.730
We don't have any results
so far about bitter.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.980
Actually I'm running in my
lab now things about bitter,

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:47.030
tasting bitter and see if it
affects your bitter behavior.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.310
But I don't have results,
so if you invite me

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.840
again I'll tell you.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:57.300
But I'll tell you about
this study that was done.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.910
In this study, participant
were divided to three groups.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.400
One group was asked to
taste a sweet chocolate.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.930
The other one was asked to
taste non-sweet crackers.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:13.439
And the third one
didn't taste anything.

00:28:13.439 --> 00:28:15.230
And they were asked
some things about like,

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.890
it's a marketing study.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.600
OK?

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:21.070
Then the study was
supposedly over.

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:24.800
And they were told that there
is a professor who really needs

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:31.030
help, that people will
help him in his experiments

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.720
and participate.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.830
Volunteer to participate
in his experiments.

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:38.510
And they were told
he has no money,

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.290
and he cannot give you credit.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:44.690
But how many minutes would
you like to volunteer?

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.900
Those who ate the
sweet chocolate

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.810
volunteered for a
greater number of minutes

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:54.510
than those who ate
the non-sweet crackers

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:55.950
or didn't taste anything.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.410
Which shows that when
you eat something sweet,

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.740
you're a sweeter person,
at least for a short while.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.640
So, well, think
about implications.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.150
I'll talk a little
bit at the end.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.500
This is a very nice study
which I put immediately

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.760
after tasting, because
it relates to food,

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.320
but it's not about
food, actually.

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:22.220
It's about the influence
of logos on our behavior.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:27.170
And I think again, in Google
it's especially important.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.260
There are all
these kind of logos

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:30.770
that we see all around us.

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:31.884
We walk and we see logos.

00:29:31.884 --> 00:29:33.050
We don't even pay attention.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:35.230
If I asked you what did
you see, probably you

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:36.790
will not remember most of them.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.290
But we do see them.

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:39.880
So there are
several studies that

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.940
were done on how fast food
logos influence our behavior.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.860
Because when you think
what is a fast food?

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.120
What does it represent?

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.640
It represents that we
have to do something fast.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.800
No patience to sit
in a restaurant,

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.910
wait for each dish, et cetera.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:29:58.070
That's what it implies too.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.180
It implies also other things,
but I'm talking about the word

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.700
fast here.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:09.450
So fast food logos were
flashed subliminally

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:11.604
for 12 milliseconds.

00:30:11.604 --> 00:30:13.520
Subliminally-- I'm sure
you know but I'll just

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.930
say it in case--
that consciously, you

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:19.300
don't know that you
saw these logos.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.440
But they were flashed
on the screen.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.760
And to another group,
some just squares

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:27.830
were flashed on the screen.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:32.450
And then they were asked
to read a paragraph.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.420
Those who were exposed
to the fast food logo,

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.420
without their awareness,
read the paragraph faster

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:45.070
than those who were
exposed to just squares.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:52.620
In a second study, they were
asked-- this time they were not

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:54.120
exposed subliminally--
but they were

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.920
asked to remember a time that
they went to a fast food place,

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.981
like McDonald's
or any other, KFC.

00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:05.480
Or, the other group was
asked to remember a time

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.750
that they went to
a grocery store.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:14.000
Then, they were asked to say how
desirable these products are.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.130
And as you can
see on the screen,

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.670
there are products that are
time saving, like a toaster

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:25.860
with four slices, or shampoo and
conditioner in the same bottle.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.922
And they were asked to say
how desirable they are,

00:31:28.922 --> 00:31:29.630
for each product.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.310
The one that save more
time or less time.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:38.930
And those who remembered that
they went to the fast food,

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.650
like McDonald's
or anything else,

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.940
preferred the
time-saving products,

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.170
like the toaster
with the four slices,

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:50.850
or the bottle that contains
both shampoo and conditioner.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.610
Which shows that they really,
really-- it affected that.

00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:58.790
The last one, that I'm not
showing all the details,

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:05.730
was that those who were exposed
to fast food logos, when they

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.000
were given the option, wanted
their money immediately

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.460
rather than waiting and save
it and get some more money.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:13.460
They were more impatient.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.560
So next time you're
sitting in a red light

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.230
and you honk but
somebody doesn't move,

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.030
think it might be because you
saw the logo of McDonald's,

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:28.350
and then try not to be
manipulated by that.

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.850
Now-- this is
definitely that I chose,

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.510
in my book I have many more
that I will not show today--

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.952
but of course when I
prepared this lecture,

00:32:36.952 --> 00:32:38.410
I thought for Google
I have to talk

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.460
about creativity of course.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.670
And if you look at
this picture here,

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.260
you see that there are
two metaphors actually.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.430
One is thinking out of the box,
which I'll talk in a minute.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.140
Yeah?

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.890
And the other one
is the light bulb.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:58.920
In many comics, you
portray the light bulb

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.580
above the head of somebody.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.630
It's a new innovation,
ah I found something.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:06.506
I'm sure you know this
experience of "aha".

00:33:06.506 --> 00:33:09.990
The experience, it's when
you think about a problem

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:13.410
and you don't know, and it's
not a process, you're stuck.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.410
And suddenly, you
have the answer.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.125
And this is called
the "aha" experience.

00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:19.790
We say aha, here it is.

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.150
And I could give you
many examples about that.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:28.060
And we use metaphors like
shedding light on the problem,

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.970
or I saw the light.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:33.670
So let's see if, indeed,
if you see a light bulb

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:36.270
or if you think
out of the box, it

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.330
will increase your creativity.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:44.370
So the first one was
about the light bulb.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:49.430
So here, the subject--
I will show you exactly,

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:53.730
here-- they were
given a problem, which

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:55.510
I don't know how
many of you know,

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.260
to connect four dots
with three lines.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.820
And you are not allowed to
go over the same line again.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.030
If somebody knows this
answer don't tell me.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.940
OK.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.440
What happens here
is that you have

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.770
to get out of the
boundaries of the four dots,

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:16.330
and then it's very easy, as
I'll show you in a minute.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:20.389
So participants were
given this problem.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:23.602
And 55 seconds later,
they were told,

00:34:23.602 --> 00:34:26.060
the experimenter said, I think
it's a little bit dark here.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.659
Let me turn on the light.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:32.860
For one group, he
turned on a light bulb.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.340
They saw it very clearly.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:38.400
For the other group, he
turned on a fluorescent light.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:42.760
And then, those that
saw the light bulb

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.481
solved the problems
more often than those

00:34:45.481 --> 00:34:46.480
who saw the fluorescent.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.590
And the solution is here.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.550
You get out of the
boundaries, and immediately it

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:52.130
is very easy.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.989
You do like that, like
that and like that.

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.727
But you have to think,
when I saw this problem

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:58.060
at the beginning, I didn't know.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.268
Because I tried like that,
like that, and I couldn't.

00:35:00.268 --> 00:35:02.210
Then once you know
that you can go out.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:04.910
When they saw the light
bulb there was a better

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:08.830
chance that they will solve the
problem, which is really nice

00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.330
I think.

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:16.450
The other metaphor is
sitting outside of the box

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:17.890
or inside a box.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.070
So they built a big box.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:25.290
And half of the subjects
sat inside the box,

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.840
but it was a big box.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.370
And the others sat outside.

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:30.915
And they really saw a box,
and they sat outside the box.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.970
And then they were told to
solve the following problem.

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:39.370
And let me see if
anybody of you-- this

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.090
is a very standard
creativity test,

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:44.130
it's called remote
association test.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:47.630
And you're asked to
find one word that

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:50.280
is related to all
these three words.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.277
In this case, let
me see if you know.

00:35:52.277 --> 00:35:53.735
What is the word
that you associate

00:35:53.735 --> 00:35:56.050
with most measure,
worm, and video?

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:56.755
Yeah?

00:35:56.755 --> 00:35:57.380
AUDIENCE: Tape.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.410
THALMA LOBEL: Very good.

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.442
So it's tape.

00:36:00.442 --> 00:36:01.900
And there are many
words like that.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.220
And you have to be
creative to think about it,

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.090
because you have to
get out of the box.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:12.470
So indeed, those who were
sitting outside of the box

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:16.660
solved more problems than
those who sat inside the box.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.200
These have direct implications,
don't even have to say that,

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.470
just go out of the box.

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:26.190
This is a study that I decided
to include at the last minute,

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:28.780
because it's something
we're doing in my lab,

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.030
with my student, [? Alan ?]
[? Cohen, ?] who is my PhD

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.930
Student.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:33.480
And it's about stability.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.350
We talk about
physical stability,

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:38.560
and then we talk about
emotional stability.

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.020
And we talk about
stability of companies.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.150
So we're doing some things
about the association

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:46.150
between physical stability
and emotional stability,

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.330
but here I'll show
you a little bit

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.890
only about the association
between physical stability

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:55.420
and the perceived
stability of companies.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:37:01.060
So what we did was we
showed them several logos.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:04.790
Some logos, if you
look at the top line,

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.580
you see that all these
logos are stable,

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.050
compared to the second row.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.200
Right?

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.730
They are less stable.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:17.630
And we asked, about
each logo, which company

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.340
do you think this
logo represents?

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:23.710
And we gave them six companies
that we found on pretense

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:29.220
that three are considered more
stable, which are insurance

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:33.470
companies, accounting companies.

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:38.020
They're boring, but
they are more stable

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.120
compared to advertising or
internet companies, which

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:43.530
are considered less stable.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:45.060
And this we found on a pretense.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:52.120
And indeed, more people
thought that the stable logos

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.430
belonged to stable companies.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.220
But the more
interesting, I think,

00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:02.030
stuff is the second study,
where we described a company.

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:06.440
And we asked them to
attribute the appropriate logo

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.530
to that company.

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:12.260
One company was a
more stable company.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.160
As I said, maybe more boring.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.020
And the other one was
advertising company,

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.210
which is less stable,
considered less stable.

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:21.880
And here are the results,
I think they're very nice.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:27.130
An interaction-- those that
the participants attributed

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:31.420
to the more stable companies,
the more stable logos.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:35.511
And to the less stable
companies, the less stable

00:38:35.511 --> 00:38:36.010
logos.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.930
This is really new.

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.120
We just finished writing
the paper to that.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.930
And I just wanted
to put in something

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.480
that we are doing in our lab.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.920
So I can go and
on about studies,

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.380
but I want to talk a little
bit about what does it mean.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.750
And as I said, there are
many things I didn't touch.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:00.010
So how does it work?

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:03.660
What happens is that according
to embodied cognition, which

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:14.710
I started my lecture,
our emotional sensations

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.560
are grounded in our
physical sensations.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.110
And when we are
children, we learn

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:23.070
that our parents embrace us.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.120
And we feel the
warmth of their touch.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.590
And this is what we
learn first about warmth.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:35.630
We learn also that when we lie
down as children and it's dark,

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:38.190
it's frightening,
and we associate then

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:42.610
darkness with negativity
and light with positivity.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.080
We learned that all grown
ups are much taller than us,

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.710
and they are powerful.

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:48.570
What can we do?

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:52.520
I mean, even the short
grown-ups are taller than us,

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.620
and they're powerful.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.790
So we learn to associate
vertical position with power.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.240
And the idea is-- like in
the scaffolding process,

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.970
like you build a house.

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:07.510
You have the layer of
the physical sensations,

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.860
the concrete concepts
that children

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.450
learn when they are small.

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:18.190
And on them, we build on and
on these abstract concepts

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:24.130
like warm personality, soft
negotiator, emotional distance,

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:27.770
powerful person, et cetera.

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:32.670
And then, when we
touch a warm object

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:36.720
it activates--
yes, it activates--

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.150
the concept of warm personality.

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.700
Because they are
related to each other.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:44.450
And that's the idea behind that.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:52.510
It might look a little
shallow, but the reason

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.090
is not because it's shallow.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.790
And I want to say
something about that.

00:40:55.790 --> 00:41:00.890
I think it's the first
generation of these studies.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:02.470
All the studies
that I showed you

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.350
are from the last
six or seven years.

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:08.720
Some of them are from last year,
so they're really, really new.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:13.120
And like in many other
areas of science,

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.460
once you show this
phenomena-- which

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.960
is really amazing that
the metaphors are not just

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:22.940
figures of speech-- now we have
to examine more carefully what

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.270
other [? moderate ?]
variables happen.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:29.740
Whether it affects some people
more than others, for example.

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.450
They never studied that, and
that's my plan for next year.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:37.260
Whether some people are more
affected by environmental cues

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:39.390
or physical sensations
than others.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:42.660
Whether perhaps in
some environments,

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.440
it happens more than in others.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.830
Maybe to touch a warm cup when
it's hot outside is different

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.720
when you touch when
it's cold outside.

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.010
Nobody did that yet.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:53.250
So we have to do all
these experiments

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:59.790
as the second generation,
to see when it happens more,

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:01.670
when it happens less, and why.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.240
To examine more
ages, more cultures.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.180
There are many things
to be done after you've

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:10.020
seen this amazing phenomena.

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.870
But still, even when we
didn't do all of these.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.710
As the "Sunday Times"
wrote about my book,

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:22.270
they said some are very
funny, interesting,

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:24.040
and some are alarming.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.786
Because we would
like to think that

00:42:25.786 --> 00:42:27.740
we are in control
of our decisions.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.860
It's not a very
comfortable thought

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.020
to hear that just because
I touched something warm,

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.400
I decided differently.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.520
Or just because I was
sitting on a soft chair,

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.870
I lost some money,
because I decided

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:44.520
I would sell my house
on a cheaper price.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.080
You want to think that you are
in charge of your decisions,

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.120
of your emotions, and
not that some arbitrary

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.210
things like environmental
cues affect us.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:56.120
So people don't want
to listen to that.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:00.920
But in fact, it is true that
they do affect us all the time.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:03.137
And I think they have
many implications.

00:43:03.137 --> 00:43:04.970
First of all, before I
show the implication,

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:08.310
I want to tell you, but I think
once you know that-- and there

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.194
are many more that I
didn't talk about--

00:43:11.194 --> 00:43:12.860
but once you know
that you are affected,

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:13.985
you are more aware of that.

00:43:13.985 --> 00:43:15.350
And you are less manipulated.

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.400
And that's very important.

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.600
Because when you
judge somebody who's

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.500
very tall as a powerful person,
and then you ask yourself,

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:24.275
did I do that
because he was tall,

00:43:24.275 --> 00:43:26.244
or he was sitting
on a higher chair?

00:43:26.244 --> 00:43:28.660
You ask yourself, and then you
are more conscious of that,

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.680
you will do it less.

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.500
And many others-- for
example, the association

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.860
between physical distance
and emotional distance.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:37.953
There are many things
that, when you know that,

00:43:37.953 --> 00:43:42.005
you ask yourself this
question, and then maybe you

00:43:42.005 --> 00:43:43.330
will be less manipulated.

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:46.120
But you can use it also
for your benefit when

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:50.010
you do something
like negotiations.

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.210
If you negotiate with
somebody, and you

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.040
want the negotiation to
be a nice atmosphere,

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.260
and the other person to
judge you as a warmer person

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:58.920
and to be warmer.

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.200
First of all, think about
the height of the chair.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.950
Think about the
softness of the chair

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.000
that you give the other person.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.150
Bring only a hot beverage,
like espresso or tea.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:13.530
Don't give any cold beverage
like Coke or any-- or beer

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:17.180
is another story
altogether, but don't

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:21.880
give any other but hot beverage.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.647
Maybe give something sweet.

00:44:23.647 --> 00:44:24.980
And you will see the difference.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:29.320
That person will give you
all his house for free.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.930
Not that, but it might just tip
the scale to your direction.

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.490
And it's worth trying.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.460
It's true not only
when you negotiate

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.230
in business
negotiations, but when

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.040
you negotiate with
your children.

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:45.590
Or when your children
are grown up,

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.850
and you want to have the
very important, not very

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:50.600
easy talk with them.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:53.550
And, of course, it has
implications for dates.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.960
So, first of all, of
course we're great.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:01.660
And as you see, give the
other person something warm,

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:06.130
so it will enhance the
trust, the generosity,

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:10.900
and the way one person
judges the other.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.260
So it has all
these implications,

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.220
which I just started to talk.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:19.374
And thank you very much.

00:45:19.374 --> 00:45:25.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.400
MALE SPEAKER: Does anyone
have any questions?

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:27.900
One second.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.737
AUDIENCE: Have there been
any studies measuring

00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:41.320
whether these metaphors
are universal,

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.177
or whether they vary among
cultures and among languages?

00:45:45.177 --> 00:45:46.760
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat the question?

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.080
THALMA LOBEL: Yeah, I
repeat the question.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.320
If there were any
studies that measure

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.390
whether these metaphors
are universal or vary

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.550
among cultures.

00:45:55.550 --> 00:46:00.350
Yes, some of the metaphors
are surprisingly universal,

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:01.660
but some are not.

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.470
And if you notice when I said
about the second generation,

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:08.520
some of the things should be
measured in different cultures,

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.460
and see if in one culture
there isn't such a metaphor.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.260
And actually, I did
something like that.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.920
But it didn't come with results.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.860
I did with my
Chinese colleagues.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:23.350
And we thought about some
metaphors that they don't use

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:24.730
and we use.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:28.370
We didn't come up with
very nice results,

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:30.330
so I have to repeat it.

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:31.500
But I thought about it.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:36.320
So some metaphors are universal
and some are not, definitely.

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.230
And that's a good way
to examine whether it's

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:42.134
a figure of speech.

00:46:42.134 --> 00:46:44.326
AUDIENCE: It sounds
like the experiences

00:46:44.326 --> 00:46:47.041
that we have as we're growing
up [INAUDIBLE] influence

00:46:47.041 --> 00:46:50.619
of everything, and
continue to do so.

00:46:50.619 --> 00:46:54.280
So thinking about this from
the perspective of developing

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.780
artificial intelligence,
would the inability

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:01.270
of a machine to have
experiences mean

00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:04.710
that it would have a lot
of difficulty understanding

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:06.510
human metaphors?

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.590
THALMA LOBEL: I
totally agree with you.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:14.400
Actually, it's too
difficult to repeat.

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:20.150
It's related whether, you say
that artificial intelligence

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.970
shows that it's very
difficult to develop

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.520
the physical sensations, right?

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.730
More than others.

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:29.420
And I know that's true.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.560
Actually I wrote it
at the end of my book.

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.140
That this is the
paradox that some

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.320
of the developers of
artificial intelligence state.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.460
It's easier to develop
somebody who plays chess,

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.440
than to develop what
a little child feels

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:48.320
when he touches something.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:54.305
So yes, it's more difficult
to really understand

00:47:54.305 --> 00:47:57.440
the physical sensation
when you develop

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.080
artificial intelligence.

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:04.510
And one point which I remembered
while you were asking.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:08.080
That one more second generation
that has started already,

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.400
but we have to do
more, is research

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:14.910
with FMRI, functional
magnetic resonance.

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:18.270
Because then you can see
exactly which part of the brain

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:21.290
is activated while you
say that metaphors.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:22.830
And if there is
time, I can show you

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:24.506
one study that shows
this very nicely.

00:48:24.506 --> 00:48:26.005
But first, we'll
have the questions.

00:48:28.748 --> 00:48:29.248
OK.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.200
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.220
THALMA LOBEL:
Everything is clear.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:35.720
OK.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.870
So thank you.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:42.000
[APPLAUSE]
