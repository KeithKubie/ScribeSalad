1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,980
The adaptive vertebrate immune system
is one of the most amazingly complex

2
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:12,191
products of evolution that I know of and
at its heart is the process of clonal

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,430
selection of Antigen receptors.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,300
It provides the conceptual
framework of adaptive immunity.

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:28,950
Every T or B cell bears a single type
of antigen receptor that has a unique

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,820
specificity. When a foreign
antigen binds to a receptor,

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,530
it activates that lymphocyte.

8
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,930
The lymphocyte then multiplies to form
a clone of effector cells that have

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,360
identical receptor specificity.

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,870
Lymphocytes that have affinity for self
antigen are deleted early in development

11
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,630
and that largely prevents
autoimmune disease.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,580
Here is a first picture of
how clonal selection works.

13
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,480
So on the left side we see
a single progenitor cell.

14
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,820
It gives rise to many lymphocytes.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,880
They undergo somatic recombination
so that each of them is expressing a

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
different antibody and that you can
see by the array of colors there.

17
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:21,690
On the left hand side,

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,680
somatic recombination is being done by
shuffling these inherited gene segments.

19
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,840
These exists as gene families and at each
of the low psi there are many illegals,

20
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:35,790
president of the comp in the population.

21
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:40,791
So every individual is
usually heterozygous for many
of these low psi and that

22
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:45,921
is what generates the recombinatorial
power of this process of first generating

23
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,590
a huge amount of diversity
and then selecting on it

24
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,700
during this process,

25
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,690
the cells that are
expressing self antigen,

26
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:03,691
they could cause autoimmune diseases
are eliminated and that gives a pool of

27
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,350
mature naive lymphocytes,

28
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,330
which potentially could react with
foreign antigens but not with self.

29
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,990
Then they encounter a foreign
antigen and one of them,

30
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:21,790
the purple one in this case actually
expresses an antibody that binds to it,

31
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,510
is then activated and multiplies and
it forms a clone of effector cells.

32
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,030
And the fact that each of
them is expressing that
specific antibody is indicated

33
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:35,980
by the fact that all of
these are purple here.

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,600
So the chains that are
produced are appearing to form
a unique receptor for each

35
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:46,211
lymphocyte.

36
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:51,100
You can see that this
lymphocyte is expressing
exactly the same receptor on its

37
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:51,551
surface.

38
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:55,990
This is a different lymphocyte with a
different set of somatically recombined

39
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,423
proteins,

40
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,990
somatically recombined producing
proteins which are being expressed on the

41
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,050
surface of this different lymphocyte.

42
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,570
The lymphocyte antigen receptors in
mammals are generated by somatic gene

43
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:14,640
rearrangements,
gene conversion,

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,080
nucleotide additions at the ends of
gene segments and random pairing of two

45
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,710
polypeptides to form antigen
receptors are antibodies.

46
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,730
These random processes produce this
initial huge array of diverse receptors

47
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,860
which look like this. Okay, so
let's recap antibody structure here.

48
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:39,510
We've seen it before.
An antibody is a y shaped protein.

49
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,630
It is extruded from the cell.

50
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,870
It's sitting on the surface of a cell
and exposed to the outside yet binds to a

51
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:53,751
particular antigen with a region that
contains both a variable light chain and a

52
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:55,440
variable heavy chain.

53
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,800
So these are the two parts of
this molecule which exist in gene.

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,720
Many forms in gene families in coated
in gene families in the genome and who

55
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:14,731
somatic recombination then determines
the diversity of antibodies available.

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,020
Okay?

57
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,230
No antibodies defend
their hosts in three ways.

58
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,820
They bind directly to viruses
into bacterial toxins,

59
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,360
preventing the entry of viruses into
cells and damping the activity of toxins.

60
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,730
They coat the surface of pathogens that's
called opsonization so that they can

61
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:40,540
then be eaten and killed by macrophages.
This is also done by compliment.

62
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:42,350
Yeah,

63
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,330
they activate complement proteins,

64
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,170
so they triggered this activation and
the compliment then compliments the

65
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:55,790
activity of the antibodies and coating
extracellular pathogens for consumption

66
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,900
by macrophages.

67
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,280
Okay,

68
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,280
so this is what makes blood plasma such
a dangerous environment for pathogens.

69
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,380
However,
intracellular parasites,

70
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,580
those not in the bloodstream
require special treatment.

71
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,020
Cell's infected by viruses use MHC one
molecules to present viral fragments on

72
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:24,391
their surface that activate cytotoxic
t cells that kill the cells that are

73
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,320
infected by the viruses.

74
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,030
Yeah,

75
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,440
macrophages that ingest leprosy
or tuberculosis pathogens.

76
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,530
Both of those are bacteria use MHC two
molecules to transfer bacterial fragments

77
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:45,211
to their surface where they recruit
helper t cells that detect the antigen and

78
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,080
presented to be cells.

79
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,330
Those B cells are then recruited and
magnified by clonal selection to produce

80
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,300
huge quantities of specific antibodies.

81
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,100
There are several

82
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,360
immune defense strategies.

83
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,070
First, kill bacterial and fungal
pathogens. With phagocytes,

84
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,120
anti microbial peptides and proteins, and
the compliment system, in other words,

85
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,830
eat poison or smother them.
Secondly,

86
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,310
eliminate infected cells
with cytotoxic lymphocytes.

87
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,690
These are typically virally infected
cells and cells that are infected with

88
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:26,250
intracellular bacteria and protozoa.
Third,

89
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:29,970
expel multicellular parasites
by Mucosal Epithelia,

90
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,250
mass cells and basophils.

91
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,123
Yeah.

92
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,950
All of these defenses
have associated costs.

93
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,350
Okay.

94
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:45,060
Each has its own associated
immunopathology and corresponding types of

95
00:06:45,061 --> 00:06:47,160
autoimmune and allergic disease.

96
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,450
Type one immune responses are
PR are associated with allergy.

97
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,940
That's Immunoglobulin e
and mass cell mediated.

98
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,710
Yeah,

99
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,010
so for example,
this includes food allergies and asthma.

100
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,400
Type two immune responses.
Cytotoxic.

101
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,290
This is our mediated by lymphocytes
by compliment and antibody,

102
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,280
and that can result in autoimmune
hemolytic anemia and in thrombocytopenia.

103
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,170
Okay.

104
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,170
Type three immune responses are
mediated by the immune complex.

105
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:33,621
So this is the antibody antigen complex
and results in diseases like rheumatoid

106
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:36,240
arthritis and Lupus.

107
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:37,960
Yeah.

108
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,020
Type four immune response
is t-cell mediated and it,

109
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,550
it's vulnerability.
It's caused is multiple sclerosis.

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,350
Okay,

111
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,310
so to summarize,

112
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,800
adaptive immunity increases the range
of protection against pathogens and it

113
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:55,634
adds memory.

114
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:57,620
Okay.

115
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,330
Clonal selection produces
large populations of cells
that can produce antibodies

116
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,870
with identical specificity
in large quantities.

117
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:07,870
Yeah.

118
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,180
Intracellular parasites
get special treatment.

119
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,900
Antibodies have multiple functions.

120
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,300
Each defense strategy has corresponding
types of autoimmune and allergic

121
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:19,900
diseases.
