00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.046
We've seen how to factor a polynomial with factoring by grouping. But,

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:07.881
sometimes, it's easier to just recognize special patterns to make factoring

00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:12.211
easier. We're going to look at those special patterns in this lesson. The

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:17.062
special patterns involve the square of binomials and the difference of two

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:20.690
squares. When we multiplied polynomials, we saw how to expend each of these

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.783
three cases. But this time, we're going to be given these forms and we're going

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:28.977
to move in the other direction. We want to find the factored form. We're going

00:00:28.977 --> 00:00:33.360
to focus on these two patterns first. We're going to factor the perfect square

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.003
trinomials as a perfect square or a squared binomial.
