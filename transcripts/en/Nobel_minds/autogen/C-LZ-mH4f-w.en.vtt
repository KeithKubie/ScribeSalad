hello my name is William mcLaughlin I go

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190
hello my name is William mcLaughlin I go
 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.249
hello my name is William mcLaughlin I go
to something grammar school and I'm 15

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259
to something grammar school and I'm 15
 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.499
to something grammar school and I'm 15
years old and I have two questions for

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509
years old and I have two questions for
 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.589
years old and I have two questions for
you firstly do you believe that the

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599
you firstly do you believe that the
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.990
you firstly do you believe that the
universe is infinite ongoing or does it

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
universe is infinite ongoing or does it
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.379
universe is infinite ongoing or does it
just simply stop at certain point and

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389
just simply stop at certain point and
 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.710
just simply stop at certain point and
secondly do you believe that God creates

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720
secondly do you believe that God creates
 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.840
secondly do you believe that God creates
the universe or higher power or you

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
the universe or higher power or you
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.269
the universe or higher power or you
simply an astrophysicist who believes in

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279
simply an astrophysicist who believes in
 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.960
simply an astrophysicist who believes in
science well William I yes I do think

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
science well William I yes I do think
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.060
science well William I yes I do think
the universe is infinite but of course I

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
the universe is infinite but of course I
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.420
the universe is infinite but of course I
can't prove it so far the universe has

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
can't prove it so far the universe has
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.270
can't prove it so far the universe has
allowed us to see 13.7 light billion

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
allowed us to see 13.7 light billion
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.549
allowed us to see 13.7 light billion
light years in every direction and we

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559
light years in every direction and we
 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.459
light years in every direction and we
can only guess what's beyond that so on

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
can only guess what's beyond that so on
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.720
can only guess what's beyond that so on
the other hand it's a pretty good guess

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730
the other hand it's a pretty good guess
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520
the other hand it's a pretty good guess
that we're not so special that we're at

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
that we're not so special that we're at
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.160
that we're not so special that we're at
the center so if the universe is not

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
the center so if the universe is not
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.869
the center so if the universe is not
infinite it's extremely extremely

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879
infinite it's extremely extremely
 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.389
infinite it's extremely extremely
extremely large that's a pretty good

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
extremely large that's a pretty good
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.380
extremely large that's a pretty good
guess now you're asking also does it

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
guess now you're asking also does it
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.630
guess now you're asking also does it
stop at a certain point probably not but

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
stop at a certain point probably not but
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029
stop at a certain point probably not but
we don't know we certainly cannot

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
we don't know we certainly cannot
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.639
we don't know we certainly cannot
measure any place where it stops

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
measure any place where it stops
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.250
measure any place where it stops
we imagine that if we were standing at a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
we imagine that if we were standing at a
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.219
we imagine that if we were standing at a
place thirteen billion light years say

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229
place thirteen billion light years say
 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.880
place thirteen billion light years say
directly north of us and we were on

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
directly north of us and we were on
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.800
directly north of us and we were on
another galaxy over there we would look

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
another galaxy over there we would look
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539
another galaxy over there we would look
around and we would see a universe that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549
around and we would see a universe that
 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.190
around and we would see a universe that
looks a lot like what earthbound

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
looks a lot like what earthbound
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.649
looks a lot like what earthbound
astronomers are seeing today so they

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
astronomers are seeing today so they
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.179
astronomers are seeing today so they
would probably be asking the same

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
would probably be asking the same
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.910
would probably be asking the same
question over there today and they would

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
question over there today and they would
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440
question over there today and they would
probably come to the same conclusion

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
probably come to the same conclusion
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.170
probably come to the same conclusion
that their universe also looks extremely

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
that their universe also looks extremely
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.420
that their universe also looks extremely
large and almost infinite but they would

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430
large and almost infinite but they would
 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.060
large and almost infinite but they would
not be able to prove it so that's part

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
not be able to prove it so that's part
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.280
not be able to prove it so that's part
of the answer to your question you also

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290
of the answer to your question you also
 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.950
of the answer to your question you also
wanted to know what made this happen do

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
wanted to know what made this happen do
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.410
wanted to know what made this happen do
I think that a God made this or God made

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
I think that a God made this or God made
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.020
I think that a God made this or God made
this the short version of the answer is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
this the short version of the answer is
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.760
this the short version of the answer is
yes I'm an astrophysicist and I measure

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
yes I'm an astrophysicist and I measure
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.550
yes I'm an astrophysicist and I measure
things and I am NOT able to answer the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
things and I am NOT able to answer the
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.010
things and I am NOT able to answer the
question of what came before that or why

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
question of what came before that or why
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.420
question of what came before that or why
did it happen

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
did it happen
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.300
did it happen
you physicists cannot tell you what came

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
you physicists cannot tell you what came
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.679
you physicists cannot tell you what came
before the universe it's not a

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689
before the universe it's not a
 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.700
before the universe it's not a
meaningful question for us yet so maybe

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
meaningful question for us yet so maybe
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.740
meaningful question for us yet so maybe
it will be someday but so far we just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
it will be someday but so far we just
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.870
it will be someday but so far we just
talked about process how material turns

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
talked about process how material turns
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.719
talked about process how material turns
into different forms of material and how

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729
into different forms of material and how
 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.459
into different forms of material and how
the changes happen through history I

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
the changes happen through history I
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.410
the changes happen through history I
think it's a wonderful story and very

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
think it's a wonderful story and very
 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.260
think it's a wonderful story and very
exciting and really pleased to be a part

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
exciting and really pleased to be a part
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.050
exciting and really pleased to be a part
of discovery

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060
