as a developmental psychologist who

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400
as a developmental psychologist who
 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.160
as a developmental psychologist who
studies cognition in children we were

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170
studies cognition in children we were
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.990
studies cognition in children we were
really excited to be able to focus on a

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
really excited to be able to focus on a
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.350
really excited to be able to focus on a
particular aspect of a cognitive bias

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360
particular aspect of a cognitive bias
 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.079
particular aspect of a cognitive bias
which is the development of optimism in

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089
which is the development of optimism in
 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.609
which is the development of optimism in
children so we're often studying

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
children so we're often studying
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.830
children so we're often studying
cognitive mechanisms and how children

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
cognitive mechanisms and how children
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.320
cognitive mechanisms and how children
are using these to reason about various

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
are using these to reason about various
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.790
are using these to reason about various
aspects of the world around them

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
aspects of the world around them
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.150
aspects of the world around them
including other people's thoughts and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160
including other people's thoughts and
 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.109
including other people's thoughts and
preferences and we also are looking at

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119
preferences and we also are looking at
 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.669
preferences and we also are looking at
how children are choosing to learn from

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
how children are choosing to learn from
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.860
how children are choosing to learn from
other people as well so I'm going to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870
other people as well so I'm going to
 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.319
other people as well so I'm going to
talk about two lines of research one is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
talk about two lines of research one is
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.660
talk about two lines of research one is
that mostly which I'll talk about

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
that mostly which I'll talk about
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729
that mostly which I'll talk about
looking at the development of optimism

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
looking at the development of optimism
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.080
looking at the development of optimism
and children which we were really

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
and children which we were really
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.430
and children which we were really
grateful to the hope and optimism

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
grateful to the hope and optimism
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.770
grateful to the hope and optimism
initiative to fund so that we could do

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780
initiative to fund so that we could do
 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.350
initiative to fund so that we could do
that and another that is looking at

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
that and another that is looking at
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.240
that and another that is looking at
outside of children how we're thinking

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
outside of children how we're thinking
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.040
outside of children how we're thinking
about society and how children's own

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
about society and how children's own
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.950
about society and how children's own
optimism might also apply to groups and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
optimism might also apply to groups and
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.270
optimism might also apply to groups and
society as well okay so for the purposes

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
society as well okay so for the purposes
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.189
society as well okay so for the purposes
of operationalizing how we were going to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
of operationalizing how we were going to
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.619
of operationalizing how we were going to
go about studying optimism and we're to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
go about studying optimism and we're to
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.750
go about studying optimism and we're to
start looking at this and children we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
start looking at this and children we
 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820
start looking at this and children we
took a working definition that's come

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830
took a working definition that's come
 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.200
took a working definition that's come
from tal Ichiro who is going to speak

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
from tal Ichiro who is going to speak
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.000
from tal Ichiro who is going to speak
her later as well as others working in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
her later as well as others working in
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039
her later as well as others working in
this field thinking about optimum

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
this field thinking about optimum
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.859
this field thinking about optimum
optimism as a cognitive bias and this is

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869
optimism as a cognitive bias and this is
 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.810
optimism as a cognitive bias and this is
the bias to overestimate the likelihood

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
the bias to overestimate the likelihood
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.700
the bias to overestimate the likelihood
of positive outcomes and to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
of positive outcomes and to
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950
of positive outcomes and to
underestimate the likelihood of negative

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
underestimate the likelihood of negative
 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539
underestimate the likelihood of negative
outcomes there's been a lot of work on

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
outcomes there's been a lot of work on
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.570
outcomes there's been a lot of work on
this adults which Mike already talked

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
this adults which Mike already talked
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.219
this adults which Mike already talked
about until he's gonna speak about I'm

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
about until he's gonna speak about I'm
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.109
about until he's gonna speak about I'm
not gonna go into detail on it but

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
not gonna go into detail on it but
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.749
not gonna go into detail on it but
typically roughly we see 80% of the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
typically roughly we see 80% of the
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.870
typically roughly we see 80% of the
adult population is optimistic so what

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
adult population is optimistic so what
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819
adult population is optimistic so what
about kids I mean our kids optimistic

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
about kids I mean our kids optimistic
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469
about kids I mean our kids optimistic
and the same way as adults do we see

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
and the same way as adults do we see
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660
and the same way as adults do we see
this optimism and buy a bias and what we

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
this optimism and buy a bias and what we
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.429
this optimism and buy a bias and what we
have seen in the data that we knew to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
have seen in the data that we knew to
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.319
have seen in the data that we knew to
date was that kids are very positive

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329
date was that kids are very positive
 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.450
date was that kids are very positive
they seem to be very positive about

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
they seem to be very positive about
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.060
they seem to be very positive about
themselves and interpret expectations

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
themselves and interpret expectations
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.410
themselves and interpret expectations
for themselves very positively

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
for themselves very positively
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.539
for themselves very positively
especially up to about six years of age

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
especially up to about six years of age
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.330
especially up to about six years of age
or so but if you ask children and you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340
or so but if you ask children and you
 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.880
or so but if you ask children and you
ask them to evaluate themselves they

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890
ask them to evaluate themselves they
 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.649
ask them to evaluate themselves they
tend to do this really positively so

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
tend to do this really positively so
 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.630
tend to do this really positively so
here's an example of watching a bunch of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640
here's an example of watching a bunch of
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.760
here's an example of watching a bunch of
kids in a race

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770
kids in a race
 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.770
kids in a race
and one girls pointed out that she can't

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780
and one girls pointed out that she can't
 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.630
and one girls pointed out that she can't
run very fast and another girl over

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640
run very fast and another girl over
 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.979
run very fast and another girl over
there has pointed out she can run fast

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989
there has pointed out she can run fast
 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.260
there has pointed out she can run fast
and a child simply asked which girl are

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270
and a child simply asked which girl are
 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.030
and a child simply asked which girl are
you more like okay this is the way we

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
you more like okay this is the way we
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.530
you more like okay this is the way we
can ask simple questions and get data

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540
can ask simple questions and get data
 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.270
can ask simple questions and get data
out of kids okay and here's a

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280
out of kids okay and here's a
 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.449
out of kids okay and here's a
six-year-old girl a typical answer would

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459
six-year-old girl a typical answer would
 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.190
six-year-old girl a typical answer would
be something like her I'm more like the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200
be something like her I'm more like the
 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.500
be something like her I'm more like the
fast girl okay and kids will evaluate

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510
fast girl okay and kids will evaluate
 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.390
fast girl okay and kids will evaluate
these on different scales but they tend

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400
these on different scales but they tend
 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.770
these on different scales but they tend
toward optimism

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780
toward optimism
 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.390
toward optimism
now you might were positive at least

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
now you might were positive at least
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.460
now you might were positive at least
having positive interpretations you can

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470
having positive interpretations you can
 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.140
having positive interpretations you can
also look at this in the academic realm

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150
also look at this in the academic realm
 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.030
also look at this in the academic realm
and something that can be evaluated much

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
and something that can be evaluated much
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.000
and something that can be evaluated much
more relatively because you can ask for

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010
more relatively because you can ask for
 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.009
more relatively because you can ask for
an adult evaluation of the situation so

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019
an adult evaluation of the situation so
 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.220
an adult evaluation of the situation so
here's a child again up to roughly six

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
here's a child again up to roughly six
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.289
here's a child again up to roughly six
or so years of age you ask them how do

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299
or so years of age you ask them how do
 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.640
or so years of age you ask them how do
you do in school and they say I'm really

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650
you do in school and they say I'm really
 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.470
you do in school and they say I'm really
good I get mostly A's and I get lots of

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480
good I get mostly A's and I get lots of
 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.539
good I get mostly A's and I get lots of
stars on my papers but if you ask the

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549
stars on my papers but if you ask the
 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:51.729
stars on my papers but if you ask the
teacher they have a different answer not

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739
teacher they have a different answer not
 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.009
teacher they have a different answer not
a B student sometimes gets a start and

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019
a B student sometimes gets a start and
 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.890
a B student sometimes gets a start and
what you see is this escalation in

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900
what you see is this escalation in
 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.270
what you see is this escalation in
initially escalation and being positive

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280
initially escalation and being positive
 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.070
initially escalation and being positive
and then this starts to become more

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080
and then this starts to become more
 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.500
and then this starts to become more
realistic the child's own view of

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510
realistic the child's own view of
 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.390
realistic the child's own view of
themself comes more in line with reality

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400
themself comes more in line with reality
 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.280
themself comes more in line with reality
so we were asking the question are

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290
so we were asking the question are
 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.500
so we were asking the question are
children optimist or realists because

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510
children optimist or realists because
 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.030
children optimist or realists because
all of the previous work didn't really

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040
all of the previous work didn't really
 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.650
all of the previous work didn't really
look at optimism it looked at only about

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660
look at optimism it looked at only about
 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.319
look at optimism it looked at only about
positivity about self how about applying

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329
positivity about self how about applying
 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.880
positivity about self how about applying
these kinds of things to different

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890
these kinds of things to different
 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.400

here is a test that was just looking at
 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.280
here is a test that was just looking at

them a box full of balls in this case

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750
them a box full of balls in this case
 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.270
them a box full of balls in this case
there's three different color balls and

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280
there's three different color balls and
 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.129
there's three different color balls and
there's about a third of each and you

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139
there's about a third of each and you
 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.990
there's about a third of each and you
choose randomly so you

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000
choose randomly so you
 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.030
choose randomly so you
choose a random sample okay you would

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040
choose a random sample okay you would
 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.280

ball color okay that's not the sample
 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.640
ball color okay that's not the sample
that came out in this case and so what

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650
that came out in this case and so what
 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.110
that came out in this case and so what
you can do is see whether babies are

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120
you can do is see whether babies are
 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.910
you can do is see whether babies are
surprised that that sample was withdrawn

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920
surprised that that sample was withdrawn
 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.950
surprised that that sample was withdrawn
from there or whether they just don't

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960
from there or whether they just don't
 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.960
from there or whether they just don't
pay any attention any difference to that

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970
pay any attention any difference to that
 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.000
pay any attention any difference to that
whether the expected sample was come out

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010
whether the expected sample was come out
 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.770
whether the expected sample was come out
and in fact what they do is they're

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780
and in fact what they do is they're
 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.020
and in fact what they do is they're
pretty surprised when the sample doesn't

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030
pretty surprised when the sample doesn't
 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.730
pretty surprised when the sample doesn't
match the population from which it was

friends with the person that had the
 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.970
friends with the person that had the
positive response and this often

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980
positive response and this often
 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.000
positive response and this often
happened even in the face of accuracy so

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010
happened even in the face of accuracy so
 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.310
