&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.990
&gt;&gt; Sandra Charles: Okay.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.810
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.040
And welcome to this Joint
Health Forum with Science

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.570
and Technology Division of
the Office of Health Services.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.780
I'm very pleased with this
collaboration with Tomoko.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.730
And this is the second of
two that we've done recently.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.440
And thank you all for coming.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.110 position:56%
Today in honor not only but
particularly because this is October

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.800
and breast cancer awareness month,
we're having an esteemed speaker

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.800
who will be introduced by
Tomoko -- Dr. Tomoko Steen.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.760 position:56%
And we're waiting with baited breath

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.170
to hear all the new
developments from you, Dr. Clark.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.820 position:56%
But it is -- it is a subject that we
certainly address on an annual basis

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.270
because it is still the number
two cancer killer in women --

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.400
and probably the number one
skin cancer -- that exists.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.520
So I just wanted to welcome you and
to thank you for coming and hope

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.760
that you will get as much
out of it as we hope you will

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.760
and that we expect you will.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.870
And without further ado, I'm
going to ask Tomoko to come

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.450
to the podium to introduce
Dr. Clark.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.660
Thank you very much.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.960
&gt;&gt; Tomoko Steen: It's
my great pleasure

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.320
to introduce today's
speaker, Dr. Clark.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.120 position:56%
And he's a senior colleague of mine.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.570
Today's talk is actually part of
the translational medicine series.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.260 position:56%
We started with two Nobel laureates.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.770
Jim Watson and Carol Greider came.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.260
In fact, Professor Clark was one
of the speaker was supposed to be,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.020
but the schedule didn't work out.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.770
And I'm so glad to be able to
invite him back for this topic.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.940 position:56%
Professor Clark is dean for research

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.750
at the Georgetown University
Medical School and also Professor

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.960
of Oncology and Core Director
of the Breast Cancer Program

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.060
at Lombardi Comprehensive
Cancer Center.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.690
And he has done the
DSc and PhD at Belfast,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.780
actually, University of Queens.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.600
And also, he has done the
post-doctorate research

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.000
at National Cancer Institute.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.450
And I have bio in the back.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.820
You can pick it up.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.900
And we have books on
the -- basic books --

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.840
on breast cancer back there.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.460
So if you have time,
please take a look.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.420
And before I go into
the further ado,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.020
I should just introduce
Professor Clark.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.320
Thank you so much.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.620
[ Applause ]

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.920
&gt;&gt; Robert Clarke: Well, thank you.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.220 position:56%
This is a great pleasure to be here.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.540
This is maybe going to be a little
different today because I'm going

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.630
to tell you about some of
the research that's going on

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.980
and how we've begun
to think differently

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.540
about understanding
several different cancers

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.680
but with a specific
focus on breast cancer.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.900
Okay. Hands up if you know anyone
-- yourself, anyone in your family

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:35.310
or extended family -- who's ever
had a diagnosis of breast cancer.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.310
Look around.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.110
Sadly, one in eight women --

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.590
I'll show you the statistics
in a minute --

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.770 position:56%
are likely to experience a diagnosis
of breast cancer in their lifetime.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.320
We made significant strides
in managing this disease,

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.970
and we do cure breast cancers; we
just don't cure all breast cancers.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.600
We will get there.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.650
We probably won't get
there as quickly

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.130
as everyone would like,
but we will get there.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.810
Today I'm going to give you an --

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.900
some insight into what the
statistics are for breast cancer,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.510
who it affects, some of the drugs.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.810
I'm going to focus mostly

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.610
on estrogen-receptor-positive
breast cancer,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.580
which is about 70 percent
of all breast cancers.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.410
And tell you how we've begun
to take a different approach

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.300 position:56%
to understanding the biology of that
disease and how that might lead us

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.780
to think very differently about
how we might treat that disease

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.810
and ideally, eventually prevent it.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.370
Now, I've got a little bit
of science in my slides.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.430
And probably none of you are
breast cancer researchers.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.740
So please, if you don't
understand anything, just stop me.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.500
I'm happy to take time and try

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.020
and explains things
to you as we go along.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.090
And if you see something
that you don't understand,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.660
just make sure that we don't panic.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.870
Really, this is here to have
as much conversation with you

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.360
as I am to tell you what we do.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.340
I'd like you to learn something
about breast cancer from today

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.740
and go away with it
and think about it.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.440
Because we all have a
responsibility to do something

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.930
in whatever way we can to
eradicate this terrible disease.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:33.430
So don't panic if you see data, or
crazy words, or symbols that sound

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.990
like they're a foreign language.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.560
They probably are a foreign
language; they're science language.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.050
But most of those you
don't actually need

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.170
to follow; just follow the idea.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.970
Don't worry about the
details because it's the sort

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.510
of big picture I'd like to
get across to you today.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.510
So let's start by telling
you something about cancer,

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.920
just in case you don't know much.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.760
You might think that it's
a disease of modern man

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.860
in some way, shape, or form.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.600
But actually, it is one of
those unfortunate side effects

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.680
of just being alive.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.170
We've known cancer has been
around for a very long time.

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.420
And the dinosaurs got cancer.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.100
You might wonder how
do we know that?

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.610
Well, some cancers come up in bone.

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.390
And so when fossils are created
and the bones are left behind,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.730
you can actually see evidence
that there was a cancer

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.670
in the bone, in that fossil.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.090
And it turns out this is an example
of one, apparently, who knew --

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.520
Hadrosaurus were particularly
cancer-prone.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.570
Dinosaurs -- plants can
get types of cancer.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.580
So it's really a very
common disease.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.170
And I'm going to explain
to you what cancer is.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.740
And then we're going to go and
look at what breast cancer is.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.700
And I'm going to tell you
something about some of the drugs

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.580
that we have and how they work.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.460 position:56%
And then we'll talk about how
breast cancer cells get [inaudible].

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.280
And that's the key.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.640
We need to understand how to
stop cancer cells escaping

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.930 position:56%
from when we're trying to kill them.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.280
So most cancers --
all cancers, really --

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.900
start with the DNA mutation, a
change in the sequence of DNA

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.520
that encodes for eventually
the proteins

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.840
that allow our cells
to perform functions.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:35.190
And sometimes when those changes
occur, it screws up the ability

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.140
of the cells to function properly,

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.630
and in some cases it
leads to cancer.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.560
So it starts with a mutation.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.200
That doesn't mean that we know
what that mutational event is

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.460
in all cancers -- we clearly don't.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.130
In some cases breast
cancer would be an example.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.410
We know that some are caused by
a mutation in a particular gene,

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.990
like the BRCA1 gene
or the BRCA2 gene,

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.860
which you've probably heard of.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.910
Those are mutations that
lead to more mutations

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.360
that build up in the cell.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.500
And eventually we get cancer.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.490 position:56%
And -- and to all intents and
purposes, cancer is really a disease

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.290
where there's loss of
the normal controls

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.010
on proliferation and growth.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.900
It's where cells start to
make copies of themselves

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.330
when they shouldn't and in places

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.050
where they don't belong is probably
the easiest way to think of it.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.440
There's a wonderful set of
slides which I have borrowed

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.610
from that the National
Cancer Institute has made

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.760 position:56%
that you can download and look at in
your own time if you want to see --

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.280
learn a little bit more
just about the basics.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.820
But this is -- and this is
one of them, for example.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.100
So you can see at the top
you've got these cells that go

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.550
through normal division
because as cells get old or die,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.850
they need to be replaced.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.530
Or if they get damaged,
they need to be replaced.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.380
So that's a natural process.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.590
It's when that goes wrong,
the control of that goes wrong

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.840
and you start to get growth of
cells where they don't belong

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.720
and it's no longer controlled.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.660
We usually call that a tumor.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:16.280
And they come in different types.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.840
They can grow in one place
and never go anywhere else.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.480
They can grow in one place and
stop and do very little harm.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.360
But the ones that are the
biggest problem and for

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.960
which breast cancer is
an example are the ones

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.420
that find -- that don't stop.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.850
They don't stop in the breast, they
don't stop in that little place

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.140
where they started and they start
to spread into the tissues around.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.570
And eventually they get into
the lymphatic system or they get

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.430
into the blood system and
they go all over the body.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:56.010 position:56%
And some of them will stick in other
parts of the body and start to grow,

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.440
and then you have what's
called metastasis.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.330
And you get spread of the
disease all over the body.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.630
That's usually the process
that kills most women

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.520
and the small number of men
who get breast cancer --

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.800
that process of metastatic
advanced disease.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.830
So this is what the breast looks

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.560
like when you're thinking
conceptually.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.840
The breast, of course, is there
for one purpose only: To make milk.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.710
And we wouldn't be here
as a species if it wasn't

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.590
for the milk that's
produced in the breast.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.950
And it's made in these little --
in these glandular structures here.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.640
And then it gets expelled
into these ducts

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.940
and comes out through the nipple.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.370
That's the natural process

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:49.090
that occurs during what we
call lactation, after pregnancy

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.500
when a woman has given birth and
she's making milk in her breast.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.400
Sometimes things go wrong in
the cells that line these ducts

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.230
and you end up with a tumor.

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:08.140
And you can see here this is an
example of a tumor that began here

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:10.090
in this quadrant of the breast.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.530
Sometimes it will get
out of the breast

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.400
and end up in the lymph nodes.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.830
So there are lymph nodes
that are in the breast --

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:20.630
that's often call the
sentinel lymph node.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.470
And there are the ones
turned the arm in the axilla.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.890
And so often when there's an
initial diagnosis of breast cancer,

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.070
the doctor will want to know
is it in the lymph nodes,

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.910
either in the breast
or under the arm?

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:40.090
And that tells us a lot about --
just knowing whether it's there

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.770
or not tells us a lot
about the potential

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.880
of that cancer to be
in other places.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.270
So often if it's confined
to the breast,

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:55.040 position:56%
if we can have the surgeon remove
it and the radiotherapist come along

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.070
and use radiation to burn
away and kill any few cells

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.440
that the surgeon might have
missed, that woman can go away

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.740
and she's completely cured.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.390
But many women, as you know,
that cancer has already got

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:13.060
to the lymph nodes, or to the
lungs, or the brain, or the skin,

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.360
or the bone, or the liver.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.260
And then it's a much more
difficult disease to manage.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.750
That's the sort of natural
history of breast cancer from sort

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.340
of soup to nuts, if you like.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:31.360
So let's look at the incidence
and what we think we know

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.170
about what might cause
breast cancer.

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:39.370
So in this top panel
here where it says --

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:44.520
that circle there where
there's known risk factors,

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.090
most women who get a diagnosis

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:52.030
of breast cancer have none
of these risk factors.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:13:00.930
We really still don't know what
causes most breast cancers.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.710
We know a number of things
that can increase the risk

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:06.430
on a population basis.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.100
If we look at those women,
we can say that if some

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.280
of these women have been
exposed to one, two,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.700
or threes of these things,
their risk is higher.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.880
But that doesn't mean that we can
go in and say "And you're the one

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.070 position:56%
that has a risk that's twice as high
as anybody else's as an individual

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.370
and you're the one
that's going to cancer."

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:24.670
We can't do that.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:29.920
We can only look at large numbers
of women and draw broad conclusions

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:36.180
or associations about what is this
correlated with breast cancer?

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.940
The panel below, the circle,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:43.730
shows you the age distribution
of breast cancer.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:49.470
It doesn't arise in
children before puberty.

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.480
It's extremely rare
in very young women.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.400
The incidence increases with age.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:03.420 position:56%
And the highest increase, as you can
see from that middle chart is just

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.530
around the age when women
go through menopause.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.590
So it is a disease of
getting older primarily

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:16.020
but not obviously exclusively.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.300
In terms of why is that the
case, the longer you live,

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.050 position:56%
the more cells you have in your body
that go through and are replaced.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.490
And every time you replace a
cell, there's a risk that the DNA,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.490
when it's replicated,
makes a mistake

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:33.870
and you get a mutation
by chance increases.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:38.300
So it simply increases with age.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.230
That's one explanation, probably
the simplest way to think of it.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.180
It's obviously a little
more complicated.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.340
But that's enough for now
to get the basic idea.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.290
If you inherit a BRCA1
or BRCA2 mutation --

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:55.590
and that's shown in
the table at the top --

00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:01.180
the risk of getting
breast cancer is very high.

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:02.830
But the percentage of women

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:10.720
who inherit mutated BRCA1 is
fortunately relatively low.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:19.300
So it doesn't explain most
breast cancers, it explains some.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.610
And we can find out from looking at
family histories who's likely to be

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.920
in a family that might have
a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.860
and we can identify those women
if someone in their family,

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.460
for example, comes in with a breast
cancer and we take their history.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.860
And we can sequence from just
a buccal swab, for example.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.980
We can sequence that BRCA1 gene and
determine whether they're in one

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.760
of these breast cancer families.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.760
And that allows that family to make
decisions as to who else wishes

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.720
to get screened and what they might
want to do with that information.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.390
We have a whole set of folks
called genetic counselors

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:02.010
who will help people work
through that issue if they find

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.180
that they're a carrier of this.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:13.000
One in eight women
is a lot; men, too.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.530 position:56%
But not so many largely because the
amount of breast tissue in men is --

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.460 position:56%
is much smaller than it is in women.

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.560
There's a small residual piece
of breast epithelial tissue

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.440
where the cancers arise
present in men also.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.750
But it's so small that -- and there
are so few cell there are relative

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:41.210
to women, that probably explains
why the risk is much lower to men.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:47.690
On the panel that shows the young
woman, breast cancer is caused

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.250
by the interaction of
genes in the environment.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.120
It's wonderful to say that.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.910
So what genes and what
in the environment?

00:16:54.910 --> 00:17:00.820
That's a mess -- that's much harder
to figure out because we have tens

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.100
of thousands of genes, and they
make proteins in different forms.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.530
We don't always know
what they all do.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.490
And then there are so many
things in the environment.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.260
And if it's a combination of
things and not a single exposure

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.810
in the environment, it's very,
very, very difficult to figure

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.850
out what it is that's
actually causing that.

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:26.800
So for most people,
we really have no idea

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.670
if they didn't inherit
a BRCA1 or BRCA2.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.820
We only know a few things that
might elevate their risk slightly,

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:40.830
and almost none of those are
anything you can do anything about.

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.660
So if someone says, "I
just got a diagnosis.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.170
Why me, what did I do wrong?"

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.160
You probably didn't
do anything wrong.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.060
Almost certainly you did nothing.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.800 position:56%
There is very little that you can do

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.650
to fundamentally change
your lifetime risk.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.770
There are things that
you can do that are --

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:06.140
that can moderate that to some
degree: Exercise, a healthy diet --

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.800 position:56%
the things that everybody keeps
telling you to do for a whole series

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.800
of different diseases can help

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.360
to keep your risk of
breast cancer down.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.820 position:56%
But fundamentally, what is it that's
driving it is still something we

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:20.870
still have a long way
to go to understand.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.650
And these are the numbers.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.300
Now, they are kind of scary.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:32.120
230,000 new cases every year.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:38.100
230,000 families will get a
diagnosis of breast cancer

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:43.220
because it's not just the woman who
gets it, everybody in the family

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.950
and friends in the
circle are affected

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.140
by a diagnosis of any cancer.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.080
That's 231,000.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.560
And at 41,000 women dying
of breast cancer every year,

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:04.060 position:56%
that averages out if you just do the
simple math of one every 13 minutes.

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.280
We will be here 45
minutes to an hour.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.950
So you get a sense of the impact
that has across the country.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:19.530
It is still a terrible,
devastating disease.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:24.190
And it has tremendous implications
for public health, for economics --

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:27.760
not just the human condition.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.210 position:56%
We have to do much better than this.

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:38.480
Now, interestingly, 70 percent

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.910 position:56%
of those breast cancers express a
protein called the estrogen receptor

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.320
that binds to that
female hormone, estrogen.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.250
And we've known that
if you target that,

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.310
it has a significant survival
advantage for most women.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.870
And we've known that
since the 1970s.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.870
First ever molecular-targeted
therapy

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:06.690
for any cancer was
tamoxifen for breast cancer.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.540
This shows you that the
importance of the estrogen receptor

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.840
because it shows you

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.910
that estrogen-receptor-positive
breast cancers

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.220
and estrogen-receptor-negative
breast cancers don't behave exactly

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:26.560
the same -- the risk of the
breast cancer coming back,

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.300
which is distant recurrence
in that panel,

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.450
or the risk of dying
from breast cancer.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.830 position:56%
The patterns of those over a woman's
lifetime are really quite different

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.290
-- the risk of dying

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:41.500
from estrogen-receptor-negative
breast cancer is higher

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.580
than estrogen-receptor-positive
breast cancer

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.000
in those first few
years after diagnosis.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.300
After that, the risk
begins to get higher

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.200
for estrogen-receptor-positive
breast cancers.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.930
And although those women often live
much longer, they actually have

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.360 position:56%
on an annualized basis a higher risk

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.680
of their breast cancer coming
back the longer they live

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.590
than those women who've
managed to survive that long

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.010
with an estrogen-receptor-negative
breast cancer.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.210 position:56%
So I said we can target the estrogen
receptors; how do we do that?

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.120
And there are basically
two types of drugs

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.960
that target the estrogen receptor.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.640
There are some that will bind there
and stop estrogen binding there,

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.020 position:56%
and those are called anti-estrogens.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.790
And tamoxifen is a
good example of that.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.650
And that's shown in
this bottom part.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.900
So it's binding to
the estrogen receptor

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.960
so estrogen can't sit there.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.920
The other group are
called aromatase inhibitors

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.040
because they block the ability
of the body to make the estrogen

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.950
that would otherwise bind
to the estrogen receptor.

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.900
So you either block that
protein that binds estrogen

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.220
or you block the ability
to make estrogen.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:52.080
And those two classes of drugs
have been really quite remarkable

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.870
in reducing the risk of
recurrence and death.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:59.730
And that's shown here on
this particular table,

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:05.050 position:56%
that the risk of recurrence is cut
almost in half and the risk of dying

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.520
from breast cancer if you have
estrogen-receptor-positive disease

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.270
is reduced by about a third.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:17.350
That's pretty good, but
it's not good enough.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:21.980
Because you can see on that
graph at the bottom here,

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:25.620
you can see the survival
advantage --

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.300
the overall survival advantage
of taking tamoxifen --

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.450
but you can still see
that there are plenty

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:32.730
of women who don't survive still.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.760
Now, they may live longer and
still die of their breast cancer,

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:39.640
which is a fabulous thing to do.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:45.030
If you think about that top bar for
the incidence is highest for women

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:48.030
who are 50 to 60 years of age,

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:52.540
if you could shift
their survival 20 years,

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.940
they get to see their
kids get married,

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.190
they get to see their grandkids
grow up, they may even get

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:01.960
to see their grandkids
graduate from college.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.430
Even if they still
died of breast cancer,

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:10.020
you have transformed the lives of
those women and their families.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:15.260
If we could make breast cancer
a disease you died with,

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.810
not a disease you died from,

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:24.090
that alone would be
utterly transformational.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.770
So think in your own minds
how you might choose --

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:30.670 position:56%
how you might choose to define cure.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:35.580
Because if you die of something
else and you've had a good life,

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.870
if we can get that far,
that's a great step.

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:41.530
Curing it is the last step, then.

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:42.830
So think of it that way.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.760
So here's some basic questions.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.500
I'm going to speed up a
little bit, and don't worry

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.780
if you get left behind because I'll
bring it all together at the end.

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:54.490
And if you want me to -- if you
get lost and you need to stop,

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.980
just raise your hand
and ask your question.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.470
So I posed a couple of
questions here because I'm going

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:05.140
to give you some insight
into how we think about them.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.840
So I showed you that
recurrence curve

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.050
that some breast cancers can
come back 20 years later after --

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.820
when there's been no
evidence of disease at all

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.400
and you think you're done.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.410
Are the ones that come back 20
years out the same as the ones

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.750
that come back three
or four years out?

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.220
We don't know.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.730
So maybe we can begin
to ask that question.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.630
And if we could find
that they were different

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.150
and we could understand
how they were different,

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.250
maybe we could take all those ones
that recur in three and four years

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.040
or five years and not have
them recur for 20 years.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.740
And for many women, as I just said,

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.700
you'd basically have cured
breast cancer for those women

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.000
because they die of old
age or something else.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:59.510
So how you define where the finish
line is frames the way you ask the

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.970
questions, the questions that you
ask and where you look for answers.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:10.650
So if we could learn something from
any differences that we might find,

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.210
we might have different ways of
identifying the women who were

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.310
at the highest risk of recurring
early and we might be able

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.870
to finds ways of not having them
recur at all or having them recur

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:24.200
to light that they would
hopefully never experience --

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.170
have that experience.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.480
And the fundamental question
is: If these drugs are so good

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.520
for a high proportion
of those women,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.400
why aren't they good for everybody?

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.310 position:56%
What is it about some breast cancers
that have that estrogen receptor

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:43.670
that we know we can hit and
hit hard that still come back?

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.070
Because if we could
understand that difference,

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.980
we might be able to cure them.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.630
So there's some of the
questions I want to sort of pose.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.480
And then I want to show you
where research is going.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.970
We can talk about the clinical
implications in the questions.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.760
I can only answer those vaguely
because I'm not a clinician.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.100
So let's ask the question,
first of all,

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.400 position:56%
are all tamoxifen failures the same?

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.280
Are those tumors that
come back late different

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.720
from those that come back early?

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.300
And there are different
ways to do this.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:18.000
And I wanted to give you a
sense of the power of the tools

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.840
that we have today that we didn't
have 10 or 15 or 20 years ago.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.350
Because this is where the hope is.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.830
We can ask and answer
questions in ways today

00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:36.350
that when I was a student getting
my PhD I could not have dreamt

00:26:36.350 --> 00:26:39.500
of in one lifetime.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.710
And I'm not done yet.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.010
Don't think so.

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:50.710
I've seen a transformation and
an acceleration of our ability

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:55.330
to create knowledge and turn that
knowledge into actionable outcomes

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.750
that can make a difference
in the lives of people.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:02.610 position:56%
I've seen that change so quickly and
so much in the last 10 or 15 years.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.770
This is the most exciting
time to be trying

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.270
to find a cure for breast cancer.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:13.010
And it's the best time we've
ever had to get there quickly.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.090
So this is an example of
one of those technologies.

00:27:16.090 --> 00:27:19.080
This is a technology that
allows us to take a little piece

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.550
of a breast cancer and
look at the expression

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:26.130
of every gene that's
present in that piece

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:30.750 position:56%
of breast cancer, in one experiment.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.730
So we can measure the
expression of 40,000 genes

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.110
in one biopsy from a woman.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.790
And if we can do that,
maybe we can take biopsies

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:46.590 position:56%
from those breast cancers that will
recur early and those breast cancers

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.180
that will recur late
and see if they're --

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.460
there's a pattern of gene
expression in those two groups

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.980
that predefines the outcome.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.420
So we'd be able to say which
women are at the greatest risk

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.670
of recurring early or late.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.950
And then we could ask
why are they different

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:08.700
and why do they recur early
or late and learn something

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.050
about the biology that
would allow us to look

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.140
at new ways of creating treatment.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:17.450
So this is a study we did
where we did exactly that.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:21.630
We took breast cancers
at the time of diagnosis

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:23.640
but we had 20 years
of clinical follow up.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:29.060 position:56%
So we knew which women recurred
early and which women recurred late.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.700 position:56%
And we measured those 40,000 genes
in each one of those breast cancers.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.970
What this shows you -- and
you don't need to be able

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:40.320
to understand the figures --

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.230
if you look at those
two boxes in the middle,

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:46.350
you'll see there's a red
line and a blue line.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.660
So the red line --
each line tells you

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.320
when that breast cancer
recurred or that woman died.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.570
And you can see that the red line
is very separate from the blue line

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:05.550 position:56%
and that the ones on the red line,
their breast cancers came back early

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.170
and the ones in the blue
line came back late.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:14.180
So we were able to find a pattern
of genes that told us whether

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.720
that breast cancer was going
to come back early or late.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.590
And we were able to
find another set of data

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.510
that was completely
unrelated to our data --

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.280
this is a scientific question --

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.420
and show that we could
do the same thing.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:31.450
So for us that told us -- our
interpretation was, "Well,

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:36.150
there's something different about
breast cancers that recur early

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.040 position:56%
and breast cancers that recur late."

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.550
Now, I'm not going to
tell you that this is --

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.260
this tool is useful
for telling any one

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.950
of you whether your breast
cancer is early or late

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.330
because we didn't ask
the question that way.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.990
We asked the question
just to learn something

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:53.380
about the biology this disease.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.130
So they're -- they
seem to be different.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.110
That's good, we've
learned something.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:03.490
So now we do what scientists
do: We set up hypotheses.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:09.540 position:56%
We say, "Well, if that's the case,
what might explain those differences

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.330 position:56%
and how would we ask that question?"

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.400
And so we took a different
approach from others.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:22.280
We had 40,000 measurements
on 140-odd breast cancers.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:27.330
And we said well, what do
we really want to know?

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.130
And rather than look
for a single gene --

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:30.540
because we've always
looks for single genes.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.110
And the best we could come up with
was BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations,

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:36.720
and that's less than ten
percent of all breast cancers.

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.540
We have to think differently.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.700
And you think about what
the estrogen receptor is,

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.860
it controls everything that
breast cancer cell wants to do.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.450
You take it away and
those breast cancers --

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.210
some of those breast cancers die.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.330
It's that important.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.260
So what is different between those
where you take it away and they die

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.530
and those you take it
away and they don't?

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:04.790
So we're going to think
of this as a system.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:07.890
It's called systems biology.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:12.300
We're not going to try and
find one gene or one pathway;

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.030
what we're going to try and find

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:19.540
out is how does these breast
cancers cells work as a system?

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.320
How do they coordinate
everything that they do

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.940
to survive the stress
of these drugs?

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.670
And will that teach us
about breast cancer?

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:33.420
And so we have a network idea,
that concept doesn't matter so much

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.910
as where do you start looking?

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:38.290
I mean, you've got 40,000
genes, you've got all the things

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:41.840
that cells do; what do
you really care about?

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.440
Well, this is cancer.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.790
So we thought let's not ask all
of the questions that we could,

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:54.090 position:56%
let's just figure out what it is
that makes cancer cells live or die.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.350 position:56%
Because if they die, we can go home.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.900
We're not there yet, obviously.

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:06.520 position:56%
But if they don't die and they never
made another copy of themselves,

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.820
that would be a case
where a woman would die

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.230
with breast cancer,
not of breast cancer.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:16.580
So then we want to know if
they're going to not die,

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.010
what is it that makes
them make copies

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.220
of themselves when they shouldn't?

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.650
So let's not worry
about the other things,

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.320
which are very important
questions to ask about biology --

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.630
how do they spread, how do they
get to other parts of the body,

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.350
how do they live in other
parts of the body --

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:31.100
let's just ask alive or dead
or making a copy of yourself

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.720
or not as a place to start.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.710
And so that's -- so that then
constrains where you look in all

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:40.010
of the data for the answers

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.720
because you already know
what some of these genes do.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.390
And they're not doing what --

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.770
anything that's related
to being alive or dead

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.170 position:56%
for the cell or making a copy of it.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:49.630
So you can ignore those.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:53.550
And it gives you a place to look in
a focused sense to learn something

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.000
about the biology of the disease.

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.420
So I've shown you that we could --

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:03.110
we had all these breast patients'
tumors and we had all of this data.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.400
And we knew we could separate them.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.480
So now we knew which were
early and which were late.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.010
So what are the genes that
are different between early

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.830
and late recurrences, and
do they teach us anything

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.020
about why they may be different?

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:20.310
So you don't need to know
the tools that we used.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:26.400
We used a computational modeling
tool that basically said, "Okay,

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.110
we know the estrogen
receptor's important.

00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:32.660
Let's first find out all the genes
that we think or all the proteins

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.030
that we think are likely to
interact with the estrogen receptor

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.090
or interact with the
protein that interacts

00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:39.850
with the estrogen receptor."

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.530
And we're not worried
about anything else.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:47.000
We'll just say what is that
close in that data space

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.180
to the estrogen receptor?

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:54.370 position:56%
And then when we find those, and
there's about 50 of them that are --

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.830
no matter how you look --

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:58.700
keep coming up as being related
to the estrogen receptor.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.350
We just look and see how
are those expressions

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.460
for those genes different between
breast cancers that come back early

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.040
and breast cancers
that come back late?

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:11.940
So once you have a focused
question and you have the data,

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.670
you can begin to look
at it in different ways

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:17.400
and answer a very focused
specific question.

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.220
So that's kind of what we did,
and this is what we found.

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.600
Basically, it's complicated.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.620
You kind of knew that
was coming, didn't you?

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:37.740
But also, it suggests that
there are some relationships --

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:40.550
some genes that are always up,
some genes that are always down,

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.660
some that are always
probably talking

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.280
to each other no matter what
estrogen-receptor-positive breast

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:51.590
cancer you look in that would allow
us to think if we were to knock

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.630
down one of those,
maybe we could stop all

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.700
of this signaling from happening.

00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.770
So now it gives us a place to
think about where we want to look

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:04.850
to understand the biology and
how we might want to think

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:08.140
about where we want to
look for new treatments.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:14.620
This is one way of looking at one
dataset -- one or two datasets.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.120
So that's something.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.020
Now we've got some genes and
some ways they talk to each other

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:23.300
that tell us that we
think that's important.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.980
So what if we take cells
-- breast cancer cells --

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:30.270
and culture that we know can be
killed by an endocrine therapy

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:33.710
like tamoxifen or [inaudible]
and we treat them and we look

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:36.870 position:56%
at the changes in genes at
expression over time and we can look

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.680
at how genes -- how
cells respond quickly

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.290
when they're first treated
with an anti-estrogen.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:45.270
And that gives us another model.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:50.460
And what we find is some of
the things that are present

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.170
in the patient's tumors
that seem to talk

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:57.960
to each other also
happening very quickly --

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.810
literally within hours of those
breast cancer cells being exposed

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.530
to the drugs.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.430
So are any of those
hard wired later?

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:14.490
Does the cancer learn how to
use some of those to survive?

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:18.490
So yeah, they kind of do.

00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:21.380
Because if you take the same cells
and you treat them long enough

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.470
so that a small number of
them survive and they grow out

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.420
and they're resistant, you can ask

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.370 position:56%
"How are the resistant cells
different from the sensitive cells?"

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:34.310
So what's now hard wired into
those breast cancer cells

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:36.720
that now are surviving the drug?

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.960
And it's some of same genes
that predict from early

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.300
or late recurrence that
are changed very early

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.310
when the breast cancer cells
are exposed to the drugs.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:49.320
They're now wired in hard.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.330
The cells have adapted
their biology,

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:57.920 position:56%
their signaling to survive the drug.

00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.270
They've learned.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:03.010
We have to learn how they learn

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:07.370
and what they learn to
be able to stop that.

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:11.060
So we know what some
of these genes do.

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:16.010
We know what functions they control
within the cell that might allow

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:21.060
that cell to survive, or die,
or make a copy of itself or not.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.630
And when we start to put
that information together

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:27.330
in a systematic way,
we begin to get insight

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:30.280
into how the breast
cancer cell works.

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:37.170
And I'm going to tell you one
way that we think it works.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:43.110
So these words on the
far right in red

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:49.380
and blue represent
functions that cells perform.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.920
So apoptosis is a process
of cell death.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.220
We like that in cancer cells.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:38:00.440
We want them to do more of that.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.990
Autophagy is a fascinating process.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.920
That's the cell's recycle plant.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.730
So when bits of it
get old or damaged,

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:14.700
it eats them up so they can be
replaced and the cell can continue.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.240
But it doesn't waste the
byproducts of what's chewed up;

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.190
it uses those to live off.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:25.340
Because nature and
life is very careful

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.520
in how it uses its resources.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.230
So there's something going
on here about alive or dead,

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:35.070
whether that apoptosis
piece is switched on or not,

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:39.150
and whether that recycle
plant is activated.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.820
And that UPR -- I'm going
to tell you what that is

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.740
in a minute, so just hold on.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.610
It doesn't get too complicated.

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:55.200 position:56%
So what we're really looking for now
is how does the cell coordinate all

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.900
of the things it needs
to do to survive

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.530
and to make a copy of itself?

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:03.260
What all does it need to do
just to do those two things?

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.090
We -- that's the piece
we care about.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.670
We know that when we give
these drugs, they are --

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:11.770
the cells become stressed
and some cells can't deal

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.980
with that stress and die.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.610
This is good.

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:21.390
But some cells are stressed by
these drugs and they don't die.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.310
And that's bad.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:24.610
And, again, we're trying

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.880
to understand the difference
between those two.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:33.270
Now, we know that to do
anything the cell needs energy.

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.550
We all need energy.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:39.860
So one of the places we want
to look is how the cell --

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:45.350
the breast cancer cell --
controls its cell metabolism.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:47.780
Because without energy,
it can't do anything.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.950
We've known a lot about
cell metabolism

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.800
for a very, very long time.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:01.610
But we've always studied yeast,
or simple cells, or normal cells.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:05.250
So a lot of what we know is how
normal cells do what they're

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:06.550
supposed to do.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:07.850
But these are cancer cells --

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:10.390
though don't do what
they're supposed to do.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.940
So can we learn something about
how they manage their metabolism

00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.590
so they have the energy
to make a copy

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:18.840
of themselves in order to survive?

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.140
Hang in there.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.610
This is going somewhere.

00:40:21.610 --> 00:40:23.050
I -- I assure you.

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:27.670
So we can do that, too.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:32.040
We can actually measure thousands
of metabolites at the same time

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:37.100
on a single specimen, just like we
could measure all of those genes,

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.490
we can measure all
of the metabolites.

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.980 position:56%
And we can look at which metabolites
are being used more frequently

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.800
and which aren't, and that
will tell us which processes

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.230
and pathways the cell
is preferentially using.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.800
And so some of these are listed
here -- glutamate and glutamine.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.950
You see, we've actually
known for a very long time

00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:04.890
that cancer cells are addicted to
glucose -- the sugar glucose --

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:07.740
and to the amino acid glutamine.

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:11.510
We've actually known that --
I'll show you in a minute --

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.810 position:56%
for even longer than I've been here.

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.780
That's how -- age-wise
on this planet.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.600
That's an example of some things
we've known for a long time.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.300
And we haven't known
what to do with it.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.370
So the bottom tells you some of
the functions that are changed.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:27.050
And you've got cell
death, that's good.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.120
Cancer, well, we knew that.

00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.890
Glucose metabolism.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:32.250
So we know that there's so much --

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.200
that glucose metabolism
must be important

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:39.340
in how these cells become resistant
and evade the anti-estrogens.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:43.570
And autophagy, that process,
that recycle plant process,

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:47.300
that's also been upregulated
in these cells.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.950
So now we have to think
"How are they connected?

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:54.050
And what way does that connection
allow the cells to survive

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.780
and make copies of itself?"

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.880
And I've shown you that we've got
-- we can measure the metabolites

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.540
and we can measure the
genes that are expressed.

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:06.750 position:56%
Well, we can take those two types
of data and map them onto each other

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:10.170
and begin to understand how
the cells uses its proteins

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.170
and its genes to regulate
its metabolism.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:19.210
Now we can begin to understand
how it functions as a system

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:21.160
and how it makes choices.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:26.730
And we find things like cell
survival, we find insulin and IGF,

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.610
which would regulate glucose
metabolism normally are

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:30.910
also changed.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:32.210
They do other things.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:35.480
And we see that some of the
high-energy metabolites,

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.640
the levels of those are
different in the cancer cells

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.180
that are sensitive and resistant.

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.530
So this is what we've known
since about the 1930s.

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.570
So when my mom was born,
this guy, Otto Warburg,

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:55.410
was figuring out that cancer
cells are addicted to glucose.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.850
And they metabolize glucose in a
way that's very, very different

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:02.000
from most -- but not all
-- but most normal cells.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.080
Because cancer cells -- cancers
don't have a proper blood supply.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:11.940
So they don't have all of the
nutrients and oxygen and all

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.220
of the bits and pieces
they need as easily.

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:18.270
It's not as easy for them to get
as it is for the rest of our body.

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:19.720
And so there's not enough oxygen.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:23.970
And normally that would change the
way cells would metabolize glucose,

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.600
but cancer cells don't care.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.090
They've learned to do this
whether there's oxygen --

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:32.010
enough oxygen present or not.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:36.680
And they just love glucose.

00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:41.610
And glucose gets broken
down naturally

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:47.390
to produce the chemical energy that
the cells use to build everything.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.680
One of those molecules
is called ATP.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.350
And you don't really
need to know much more

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:56.710
than there's a chemical that's made
from glucose, that's a byproduct

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:59.730
of breaking up glucose, that
the cells use to store energy,

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:03.720
and then they can release
it to build other things.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:08.490
So we looked at whether the glucose
levels are changed in sensitive

00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:11.130
or resistant cells and
whether that's effected

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:13.060
by the anti-estrogens.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:14.360
Because that's fundamentally --

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.300
if we're changing their ability
to make energy, maybe that's one

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.010
of the reasons they're dying.

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:22.360
It turns out that that's the case.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:26.080
But what's really interesting
is actually

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.050
on that ATP graph on the right.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:31.820
You -- I'll tell you what it
says so you don't have to worry

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.170
about whether you can read it.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:38.100
It says if you give an
anti-estrogen to sensitive cells,

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:41.420
they take up less glucose
and they have less ATP.

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:43.230
They don't have enough
energy to do everything.

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:47.120
And what that normally does
is first that causes the cells

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.590 position:56%
to stop making copies of themselves.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.780
And if you can hold that
glucose levels low enough

00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.620
and the ATP levels low enough,
some of those cells will die.

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.950
They -- they just can't
survive any longer.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:04.110
The resistant cells have figured
out how to take up glucose and make

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:08.880
that APT even though they still
have the estrogen receptor present

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.500
and the drug is present.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.800
They don't care anymore.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.900
They've figured out a
way to get around that.

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:19.650
So we don't quite know
yet how they've done that,

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.870
but we know that they've done it.

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:26.120
But the other thing that told us
we needed to look elsewhere, too,

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:30.260
was -- and that's these
panel on the far right --

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.900 position:56%
the cells that are resistant and
are growing happily at the same rate

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.200
as the cells that are sensitive

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:38.440
when they're not being
inhibited actually have less ATP.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.100
They don't need as much energy.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.750
Well, why do resistant cells that
are doing all the same things

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:47.380
as sensitive, normal cells are,
why do they need less energy?

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:55.750
That's where the recycle
plant begins to come in.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:46:00.060
So they're clever little suckers.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.390
So what happens in a cell if
you don't have enough energy?

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.900
Well, the first thing is
you actually can't make

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.470
and fold your proteins properly.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:13.310 position:56%
You need proteins through all of the
business that the cell needs to do.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:19.020
And cells have across
evolution been exposed

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.100
to very different environments
when their nutrient supplies

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.950
and their ability to make
energy was constrained.

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:28.950
But they still survived because
they developed a system to deal

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:31.620
with not having enough
energy to fold your proteins.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.800
It's called the unfolded
protein response --

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.100
that's that UPR thing I
promised I would tell you about.

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.830
And you can find this
in yeast cells.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:43.310 position:56%
It's a little different in mammalian
cells, but it's not that different.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:48.150
And it's a damnably clever
system, as you would imagine.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:50.950
Because if you don't have enough
energy to fold your proteins

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:56.200 position:56%
and you want to survive first --
survive first, grow second is a sort

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.030
of priority for the cells.

00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:00.220
Normal cells have that priority
just like cancer cells do.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:04.360
And if normal cells
are able to do this,

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.760
why couldn't cancer cells
use this as a way to survive?

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.630
And what the unfolded
protein response does

00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:15.830
in this cell is it
says "I have a problem,

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.270
I can't fold my proteins properly.

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:23.490
Let's make less protein, figure
out how to get everything back

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:27.170
to normal, and then we'll
make a copy of ourselves."

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:31.510
In the process it doesn't
want to die.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:36.250
So it also sends a signal
out to the mitochondria,

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:37.550
the energy piece in the cell.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.760
It says "Wait a minute,
we've got a plan here.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.460
I know we have a problem;
we're not going to die yet.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.730
So signal, just don't die yet
because we're going to fix this

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:50.720
by making less protein, making only
what we need until we can survive.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.260
And then we're going to
go off and we're going

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.920
to make a copy of ourselves."

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.270
And that unfolded protein
response coordinates all

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.710
of those decisions in the cell.

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:04.150
And cancer cells can
use the same thing.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:08.730
And that takes us back to this
little model that I briefly went

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.530
over and told you none
of the details.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:14.820
Because what that model
from our study said was

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.380
that seems to be important here.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:20.370
Of all the things that this -- that
the breast cancer cells could do

00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:23.850
to survive the drugs
that we're giving them,

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:28.100
they seem to be using this
unfolded protein response.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:35.290
And we learned that one of the
coordinating signals that comes

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:41.880
out of from the unfolded protein
response also coordinates the

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.180
recycle plant signal.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:50.600
So now we're beginning to see how
what the cell's doing doesn't have

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:54.350
enough energy, so it's not
trying to make copies of itself.

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:56.700
It's going to survive first.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:01.190
To do that, now it doesn't need as
much energy because it doesn't have

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:03.430
to make a whole other
cell to make a copy.

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:05.880
So it can live with a lot less.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.480
And at the same time it's sending a
survival signal to allow it to see

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.110
if this is going to work or not.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:16.040
And that's what these
resistant cells do.

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:21.270
They upregulate at the same
time that recycle plant

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:26.010
because there they were happily
going along, making lots and lots

00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.030
of copies of themselves,
and now they don't need to.

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:32.840 position:56%
So all the machinery that they had
to make another copy is superfluous.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:37.210
They don't need it anymore,
so they just recycle it.

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:41.080
And they kind of live off
their little bit of belly fat,

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.950
if you like, and find
a way to survive even

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:47.600
when all their metabolism
is being shut down.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.980
And some of the cells next
door haven't figured this

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:54.910
out and they die.

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:58.130
And what happens to the
bits of the dead cell?

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:01.840
The one that's alive
just sucks them in.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.080
So they start to feed each other.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.740
So they start to feed themselves
off what they don't need anymore,

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.710
and they start to pull in
the nutrients from the cells

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:14.190
that are dying next door.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:16.370
So it's really an ecosystem.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:20.070
It's a whole system where all the
cells are talking to each other

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.950
and working together
and some are dying.

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:25.000
And because they're dying,
they're actually helping some

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.740
of the other ones to live.

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.650
Cancer is smart.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:35.530
And this simply shows --
so I'm just about done.

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:40.020
And I'm going to live you an
analogy of how we've come to this

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:45.190
to understand just these basic
principles and why that's beginning

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:47.830
to change the way we think
about dealing with breast cancer

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:49.940
and dealing with particularly
this drug-resistant --

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.840
type of drug-resistant
breast cancer,

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.610
which is in effect
ultimately up to 70 percent

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:56.990
of all breast cancer patients.

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:59.350
Imagine a car.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:05.770
Okay. You could have Mini,
you could have a Maserati.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:09.520
I know which one I want.

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.420
But it doesn't matter.

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:14.220
The basic principles of the
internal combustion engine

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:19.360
that drives the Mini and drives
the Maserati are exactly the same.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.270
What's different is all
the bells and whistles

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:27.360
in the Maserati that's
not present in the Mini.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.750 position:56%
But all the control systems -- the
brakes, the engine, getting the fuel

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.350
in -- all of those things
are basically the same.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:38.470 position:56%
And that's kind of a little bit like
looking at cancer and normal cells.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:42.860
The cancer cells are using
what they've inherited

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:49.180
as from their having been once
normal to allow them to survive

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.980
when they're cancer and
we're trying to kill them.

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:55.560
So think of where we are on a car.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:52:00.130
So we kind of know where
to put the key in the car.

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:01.880 position:56%
And it's like the estrogen receptor.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.110
It's kind of like the switch
that turns on everything.

00:52:04.110 --> 00:52:08.550
And if we turn it off, notice
that car's not going anywhere.

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:09.850
It's stopped.

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:15.000
If you leave it stopped long
enough, it rusts away and it dies.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.040 position:56%
So we know where the key goes and we
know that if we mess with that key,

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.520
we can cure some breast
cancer patients.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.990
So it's a great place to start.

00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:26.220
What happens, then, when
that key gets broken

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:29.660
and turned on all the time?

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.210
So what it's doing is it's
turning on the engine.

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:39.540
It's firing up the engine and it's
going to make a copy of itself.

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.790
Now, we know how cells
make copies of themselves.

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:43.090
We know how yeast cells do it.

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:46.830
We know how normal
cells in humans do it.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:52.020
So that piece of what happens in
cancer is often very much the same.

00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:58.970
What's not the same is the signal
between the switch and the engine.

00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:02.120 position:56%
That's what's got changed in cancer.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.270
So that now begins to tell us
where to look to understand

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:08.850
in more detail, a much
finer place to start looking

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:13.210
to understand how these
cancer cells are different.

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:17.250
We know, like, the car ain't going
anywhere without gas in the engine.

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:21.400
And the cancer cell
isn't going anywhere

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:24.960
without the same gas in the engine.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.700
It makes it differently.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.750
It's like it's got a different
grade of fuel, if you like.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:36.370 position:56%
But it's still ultimately the same
energy source, the same fuel source.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:40.370
If we could understand how that
was different, we might be able

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:43.460
to stop it from making its energy.

00:53:43.460 --> 00:53:47.540
And in a sense that's what these
anti-estrogens do when they work:

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.590
They turn off the switch
and they take away the fuel.

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:56.540
The real thing is how
does that happen?

00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:01.230
Now we know where we
really need to focus.

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:04.440
And the basic principles,
when you think of it that way,

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:08.550
are on my last -- or
my almost last slide.

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:12.840
So this is how we think
it works as a system.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:15.090 position:56%
This is where it all comes together.

00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:21.790 position:56%
You give an anti-estrogen, you don't
take up enough glucose or glutamine,

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:26.610
fatty acids, but you don't have
what you need to have enough energy

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:29.100
so you can't fold your proteins.

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.780
You can't fold your proteins,

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:35.080
that activates the
unfolded protein response.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:40.570
And that coordinates the don't
die yet signal and lets turn

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:44.540
up the recycle plant because we're
going to live off that for a while.

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:47.380
And maybe we can pull some
other things in from outside.

00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:53.080
That's the way the
integration works.

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:57.730
That's where if you look
at it as a whole system,

00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:01.420
you see a very different
picture than if you just try

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:04.260
and find a single gene
or a single mutation

00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.450
that you think might
drive the whole system.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:09.560
Because the estrogen receptor gets
mutated in some breast cancers.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.440
And that's not the whole answer.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:16.200
It's when you look at it
as a system that you begin

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.620
to see now there are
some vulnerabilities.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:21.400
There are vulnerabilities in
how the cell makes metabolism.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.320
There are vulnerabilities
in how it coordinates

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.280
that -- that recycle plant.

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.520 position:56%
We could turn the recycle plant off.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:30.100
We could turn that off, we could
turn down the cell metabolism,

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.880 position:56%
and we might get a completely
different response using drugs we've

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.660
never thought of using before.

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:38.600
So that's kind of the bottom line.

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.140
And what have I told you today?

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.730
Because I've covered
a lot of ground,

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:45.620
and I've probably talked too long.

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:47.480
We have to fix this problem.

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:51.900
We have to understand
how this works.

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.270
The cancer doesn't
exist as a single cell;

00:55:54.270 --> 00:56:00.110
it exists as an organism
almost within the patient.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:01.410
It talks to itself.

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:02.710
The cells talk to themselves.

00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:07.360
They use the host's response
in some cases to survive.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.290
At the same time the host is trying

00:56:09.290 --> 00:56:11.700
to eliminate the cancer
with its immune system.

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.130
Why hasn't that worked?

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:17.900
That's another piece of the puzzle
that we haven't cracked open yet.

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:20.170
Because if the immune system
worked, you'd never have cancer.

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:23.320
They would just be identified
as being foreign or screwed up

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.130
and eaten up and removed.

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:28.650
That's obviously another
piece of the problem.

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:32.110
So there's a lot more to think of.

00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:34.990
But if you start thinking of it as
a system, you begin to ask "Well,

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:37.060
what is it that's in the
immune system that's talking

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.360
to the breast cancer?"

00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:40.440
You know, just think
why does it not work?

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.410
You look at the question
in a different way

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:47.830
and you see different
parts of the jigsaw puzzle.

00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.480
With one woman dying
every 13 minutes

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:55.100
and 70 percent having this
biology when they start,

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:58.840
we need to do something that's
fundamentally different.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:02.150
We have drugs that work for some
women, we have drugs that kind

00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:05.830
of work for some more women, and we
have the same drugs that don't work

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:08.530
at all for another group of women.

00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:10.830
We need to be able to do better.

00:57:10.830 --> 00:57:14.780
And there are drugs coming along
that are playing in this area

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:17.240
that are probably going
to be very helpful.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.990
We have drugs now that are
called CDK/46 inhibitors.

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:22.690 position:56%
What that means is they're very good

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:25.680
at also turning off the
proliferation signal.

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:29.050 position:56%
So when the anti-estrogens come
along and shut down some but not all

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:30.530
of the cells, these other
drugs come can come in

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:33.310
and shut the rest of them down.

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:36.040
Don't know if they'll cause them
to die, but maybe if they're shut

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.340
down long enough, they will.

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:43.010
We have the tools -- and I've given
you just an example of a couple --

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:44.790
to ask the questions
of these systems

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:47.690
in ways we could never do before.

00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:52.570
Our ability to generate data
first, and then translate that data

00:57:52.570 --> 00:57:54.770
into knowledge, and from

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:59.080
that knowledge identify the
actionable items that can lead us

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.590
to better preventions
and better treatments

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:04.970
for breast cancer is
moving very quickly.

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:06.560
And it's very exciting.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.080
And the potential for making a
big difference is greater now

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.850
than it's ever been in
any time in the past.

00:58:12.850 --> 00:58:17.850
Those are tremendously
exciting things to think about.

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:19.300
We have the ability to do this.

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:22.530
Now is the time to do it.

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:24.510
We shouldn't wait any longer.

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:29.560 position:56%
We shouldn't constrain the resources
that we put to curing this disease.

00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:34.490
This is a time to do the opposite
because now we have the tools

00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:36.810
that will allow us to
answer this question

00:58:36.810 --> 00:58:40.290
in ways we could never
have done before.

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:44.460
Obviously, what I've told you
involves a lot of different people,

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.870
and it's nice that I'm able
to put their names up there.

00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:50.680
And you're welcome to read them.

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:54.060
But there are names
that are not up there.

00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:58.780 position:56%
And they will never be up there
because I'll never know their names.

00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:03.250
I'm not allowed to know
their names, and that's fine.

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:04.630
It's fine that I don't
know their names;

00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:07.810
it's not fine I can't thank them.

00:59:07.810 --> 00:59:13.400
Those are the women who gave us
the tissue in the first place,

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.850
some of them 20-odd years ago.

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:20.180
They're not here anymore.

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:21.830
Some of them died of
their breast cancers

00:59:21.830 --> 00:59:24.540
because they had early recurrences.

00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.300
Some of them died of
their breast cancers later

00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:27.940
because they had late recurrences.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:33.060
Some of them probably I'm
certain are still alive.

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.360
I don't know their names.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.660
I can't thank them.

00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:41.530
Without what they did, we
could not have got even started

00:59:41.530 --> 00:59:43.960
on this pathway.

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:47.500
So the people that are most
important are the patients

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:52.280
who contributed to the
study in the first place.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.330
Thank you.

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:59.210 position:56%
It is so important to hear from
patients what their experiences are,

00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:01.500
what their needs are,
what their questions are.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.830
It's not just about the research.

01:00:03.830 --> 01:00:06.830
And it's just lovely to
see someone say "I had it

01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:10.140
in the 1970s and I'm still here."

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:13.860
Because we'd love that to
be the story for everyone.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.780
Now, can we take what we've
learned and make it --

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:22.110
and turn it into new treatments
for prevention, or to eliminate

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:25.230
that cancer, or make
it never come back?

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:27.310
I think we can.

01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:31.490
But we started to think about
how we do that very differently.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:35.620
So the way that -- I use
the example of a car.

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:40.880
So the same way of thinking
is the way we're beginning

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.720
to change how we -- I
think we should be thinking

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:48.370
about how we combine drugs to get
a better effect than just randomly

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:51.870
or following a logical
linear way of thinking.

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:54.530
This is a non-linear
way of thinking.

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:58.880
If you really wanted to stop
the car, you'd break the switch,

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:03.590
you'd take out the battery,
you'd drain the fuel tank.

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:06.640
We've kind of thought of different
ways of breaking the switch,

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.770
but we never thought of "Okay, I
should really take the battery out

01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:12.940
and drain the fuel tank
as well because, you know,

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:18.650
we want to make darn sure
this cell can't function."

01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:22.550
So in the past -- and it
was a fine way to go --

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:27.820
and the CMF therapy that you got is
a good example of we took drawings

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.150
that had different
mechanisms of action

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:33.920 position:56%
and didn't have the same toxicity so
we could give them in combinations

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.820
at the highest doses we could.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:40.550
And that's fine, but it's --
it's a practical, pragmatic

01:01:40.550 --> 01:01:44.380
but not hypothesis-driven approach.

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.240
It's what you can do.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.420
It doesn't mean it's
what you should do.

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.090
Sometimes it is.

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:52.060
Sometimes there's better ways.

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.920
So we're trying to
think differently.

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.110
So let's not just take
three drugs like that

01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:01.850
because they have different
mechanisms of action.

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:04.990
They're not -- not that different.

01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:06.390
[Inaudible] are similar in a sense.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:11.300 position:56%
But we want to now target
different parts of the whole system.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:15.970
The more pieces of the system
that we can knock out at once,

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:20.510
the less chance that cell has
to figure out how to survive.

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:22.980
And that's a different way
of thinking because we had

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:27.210
to understand what those functions
were, how they might be wired,

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.680
and talk to each other
before we could even think

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.980
of doing it this way.

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:35.570
And we still don't know enough
to do this rationally yet.

01:02:35.570 --> 01:02:39.630
But it's taking -- it's allowing
us to begin to think differently.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:42.080
And sometimes that's just enough.

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.560
You think differently, you may get

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.290
to a place you never
thought you'd get to,

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:47.940
but it's still the right place.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:51.730
We do know that there are
different types of breast cancer.

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:53.030
We know

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:54.390
that estrogen-receptor-positive
is different

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:56.250
from estrogen-receptor-negative.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:03:00.140
We know that -- that a
mutation in a gene called HER2

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:06.320
or ERBB2 also creates a special
group of cancers that we can target

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.710
by targeting that growth
factor with drugs

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:11.970
like [inaudible] as
you probably heard.

01:03:11.970 --> 01:03:16.360
So at the very least there are
those that have the expression

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.870
of the estrogen receptor,
those that have expression

01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:24.180
that mutated oncogene HER2, and
those that don't have any of those.

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.970
And the other one that goes
with the estrogen receptor is

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.270
progesterone receptor.

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:31.790
And that's why that last group is
sometimes called triple negative

01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:33.520
because it doesn't
have estrogen receptor,

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.050
progesterone receptor,
or mutated HER2.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:41.620
At that level there's
at least three.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:47.520
Once you start asking "Are
there other groups within that?"

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:50.740
then is opens a whole can of worms.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:53.730
There are, depending
on what you look for.

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:57.130
Different mutations you'll find
are scatter in a different way.

01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:58.920
Other pathways that
are differentially --

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.160
you'll find that as subgroups.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:07.190
Ultimately, for the moment
the type of treatment

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:10.200
that a woman gets is
determined by whether

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.030
or not there's the estrogen
receptor there to target,

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:15.220
whether there's HER2
there to target,

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.270
or whether there's
neither of those to target.

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.960
And that's the triple negative,

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.990 position:56%
and they unfortunately have the
highest risk of recurrence and death

01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:26.890
in the shortest period
of time since diagnosis.

01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:29.480
And we only have chemotherapy
for the moment for those.

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:32.220
And they seem to be a
quite heterogeneous group

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:34.080
of breast cancers.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:41.330
And it's about 12 to 15
percent of all breast cancers.

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:45.020
The subgrouping is useful
in my personal view --

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.500 position:56%
and this is only my personal view --

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:51.630 position:56%
if it teaches us something about the
biology we didn't know that leads

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:54.960
to an actionable outcome
that allows us to identify

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.670
which women should be
treated with which treatments

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:01.340
because that's the best for them.

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:04.010
I'm not sure we've quite
got there yet with a lot

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:06.580
of these subtype analyses.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.970
We can say from some of them

01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:14.210
that this woman has a
worse outcome likely

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:16.900
or a really good outcome likely.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:21.330
So some of the tools are
good in a prognostic sense.

01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:26.910
And the real value there
is who not to treat.

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.030
Because some of the very
early stage breast cancers

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:31.120
like I described [inaudible]
if the surgeon gets in

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:36.070
and the radiotherapist gets in and
it's gone, you don't need chemo.

01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:38.630
So why would you take it?

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:41.030 position:56%
It's not a very pleasant experience.

01:05:41.030 --> 01:05:46.760
So the real goal there is if your
risk of recurrence is so low,

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.370
why would we use chemo
at this point?

01:05:50.370 --> 01:05:55.300
So those are the sort of questions
that we're able to do better at.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.410
But which chemo should you get?

01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:58.760
We're not there yet.

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.800
What new drugs, what combinations

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:06.090
of current drugs would give us the
best outcome for you versus you?

01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:08.290
We're not there yet.

01:06:08.290 --> 01:06:12.080
But those are exactly the
directions that we want to go in.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:15.020
We'd like to be able to say that --

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:18.320
that your cancer is unique in
some way, and we understand

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:21.210
that uniqueness, and that
uniqueness is a vulnerability

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:24.680
in that cancer that we can target.

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.850
That's the sort of
precision medicine concept --

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:30.850
one way of expressing the
precision medicine concept.

01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:36.780
I think we will find better ways

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:42.930
of using the existing
drugs first, I suspect.

01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:46.150 position:56%
And we'll see the benefits of that
earlier simply because we don't have

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:49.300
to wait for a single drug to be
approved and sure that it's safe

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.720
and efficient, and then identify
the patients that need to be used,

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.840
and then figure out how to use it
in combination with other drugs.

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.140
That's a long process.

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:59.810
And we need to keep doing that
because we need to find drugs

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:03.460
that hit different parts of
that machinery more effectively.

01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:07.250
From where I sit, we have
drugs that target metabolism,

01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:08.870
we have drugs that
target proliferation,

01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:11.630
we have drugs that target survival.

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:15.680
We've never understood
how we should use those

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.850
or whether they're the right drugs
to hit those targets if we were to.

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:23.510
But now we can build mathematical
and computational models

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:26.400
with the data that allow
us to ask those questions.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.700
And those questions
because they're done

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.280
in the computer can be asked
hundreds of thousands of times

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.950
and very quickly and
make predictions

01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:37.130
as to what we can do quickly to
test first in cell culture models

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:39.390
and then in preclinical
animal models to see --

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.380
make sure that those drug
combinations are safe effective

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:46.050 position:56%
and then quickly get them into women
because the drugs are approved.

01:07:46.050 --> 01:07:51.170
That is -- so that's
a drug repurposing

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:54.150
or redesigning the cocktails.

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:56.830
And there are some really
interesting clinical trial designs

01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:58.660
that I won't go into today
because I'm not a clinician

01:07:58.660 --> 01:08:00.450
and I wouldn't be able
to answer your questions.

01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:04.010
But there are some really
powerful new clinical trial designs

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:06.930
that are beginning to try and get
at that, where women can come in

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:08.510
and they can get treated
with one set --

01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:11.650
series of drugs, and then upon
recurrence they automatically get

01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:13.310
into a different box.

01:08:13.310 --> 01:08:16.860
We think that there might
be ways of better selecting

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:20.430
when a woman gets what drug
and what box to go into next.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:25.320
And so these new designs which
are using existing drugs --

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.880
and a small number -- will probably
teach us how to do that better.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.130
And we'll be ready, then,
to do those experiments --

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:34.100
to do those trials in women once
we've completed the experiments

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.460
that tell us how to mix and match.

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:39.360
So my prediction?

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.180
I -- I make this as a
prediction for my lifetime,

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:46.150
and since when it's over, I won't
be here to know I was wrong,

01:08:46.150 --> 01:08:49.780 position:56%
I think we will make
estrogen-receptor-positive a disease

01:08:49.780 --> 01:08:55.960
that women die with but not
of in my lifetime -- I think.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.840
Triple negative?

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:00.930
A little longer.

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:04.510
If there was a BRCA12 mutation,

01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:09.530
the risk of ovarian cancer is also
increased along with breast cancer.

01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:13.490
So that's the Angelina Jolie story.

01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:18.340
So -- and that's -- I mean, again
that's a very personal choice

01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:23.190 position:56%
for every woman in consultation with
her physician, removing the breasts

01:09:23.190 --> 01:09:26.460
and then removing the ovaries to
eliminate the risk of both breast

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:31.690
and reduce -- greatly reduce -- the
risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

01:09:31.690 --> 01:09:36.360
So, again, that's -- we have -- we
have professionals who help women

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.730
and families work through those

01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:41.040
and find what is the
right solution for them.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.600
So that's probably the
rationale for that.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.710
So HER2 is a protein that
sits in the membrane of --

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:52.140
of breast cancer cells, and
it's mutated in a way that means

01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:54.680
that it's constantly
sending a growth signal,

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.290
a proliferation signal, a survival

01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:59.010
and proliferation signal
to the breast cancers.

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:03.340
And they are -- a significant
proportion of the ones that have

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:07.070 position:56%
that are depending on that
signaling in a way that's similar --

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:10.380
conceptually similar -- to being
driven by the estrogen receptor,

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.720
not as being driven by HER2.

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.780
And so if you come along with
drugs that block that signaling,

01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.740
the cells can't survive
and they can't proliferate.

01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:21.570
And about half of those have no
estrogen receptor and about half

01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:24.020
of those have estrogen receptor.

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:28.180
The ones that don't usually get
a chemotherapy at some point.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:31.980
The ones that do can still
take tamoxifen or letrozole --

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.030
an anti-estrogen aromatase
inhibitor --

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:35.440
and they will sit gel some benefit

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.400
from that even though
they've also got

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:41.370
that driver mutation
in the HER2 gene.

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:44.980
So it's an interesting
intermediate biology in one sense

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:49.880
and a completely different
biology in another.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.510
