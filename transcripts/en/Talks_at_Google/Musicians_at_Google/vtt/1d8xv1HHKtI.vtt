00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.300
LANG LANG: Good morning.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.130
Thanks for being here.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.180
I'm very happy to be here
for the second time.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.540
But the first time I wasn't
on this stage.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.355
I was just visiting
the office.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:24.890
It's a very cool office,
I must say.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:32.159
And so I prepared some morning
songs for you to wake up.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.480
So a few Chopin pieces.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.560
I will start with one of the
very beautiful nocturnes and

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.060
then one or two etudes, and
then a Chopin waltz.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.340
So hopefully, we will get really
waked after 20 minutes

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.200
of performance.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.999
Thank you.

JEFF SPURGEON: Hello, I'm Jeff
Spurgeon from WQXR, New York's

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.750
classical station, 105.9
FM, online at wqxr.org.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.550
You may not know, because
nobody told you,

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.970
this is Lang Lang.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:11.144
He's a classical pianist,
reasonably well known

00:17:11.144 --> 00:17:13.339
all over the globe.

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:18.290
And it's quite a wonderful
thing to hear you play.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.619
Let me ask you, what was
your warm-up for

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:22.664
this just this morning?

00:17:22.664 --> 00:17:23.839
Did you warm up this morning?

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:24.970
When's the last time you
touched a piano?

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.910
LANG LANG: I didn't warm up.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.275
I woke up around 10:20.

00:17:29.275 --> 00:17:33.274
I'm like, oh, god.

00:17:33.274 --> 00:17:38.590
And we were running like crazy
down the street to get here.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.730
And I'm really grateful
that you are here

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.270
today waiting for me.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.912
And thank you very much.

00:17:44.912 --> 00:17:46.328
JEFF SPURGEON: It's
really wonderful.

00:17:46.328 --> 00:17:49.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.310
JEFF SPURGEON: It's
extraordinary to have all that

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.410
music just in your hands,
just at your command.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:56.080
But that's what you do.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.810
LANG LANG: By the way,
Rubinstein said-- one of the

00:17:57.810 --> 00:17:58.800
greatest pianists.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.850
And he said he has 60 piano
concertos in his head.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:09.390
And basically during his
70s or 80s he said

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.780
just call me up.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.450
Wake me up in the middle
of the night-- like,

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.630
let's say, 4:00 AM--

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:19.570
and I can play whatever piece
you want, in concert level.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.710
JEFF SPURGEON: Well,
I believe it.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:22.840
But so can you.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.100
But so can you.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.590
He had a little more practice
over time than you so far.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.080
But you'll be there.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.740
In China, Lang Lang is credited
with influencing some

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.590
40 million kids to take
up classical piano.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:40.370
Now, I know that 40 million
is not maybe a

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.070
huge number at Google.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:47.030
But still, it's a reasonably
large number of people to

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.190
persuade to take up.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:50.100
And when you think about all
the pianos that have to be

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.170
made, and all the music that has
to be printed, and all the

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.600
lessons that have to be paid
for, I would say that you are,

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.570
without question, classical
music's greatest job creator.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.450
JEFF SPURGEON: I don't think
there's anybody who's going to

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.450
do more than that
than you are.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.030
Lang Lang's new album on the
Sony label is "The Chopin

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:12.462
Album." It contains, at its
heart, the Opus 25 set of a

00:19:12.462 --> 00:19:16.150
dozen etudes, studies for piano,
that you have been

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.240
studying since I think
you were what?

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.720
Eight is when you started
to play those things?

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.400
LANG LANG: Yeah, I started
to play the Chopin

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.780
Etudes when I was eight.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.390
JEFF SPURGEON: Took them
on the road when

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.430
you were 12 or 13?

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:29.100
LANG LANG: Yeah, I played the
complete etudes when I was 13.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.292
JEFF SPURGEON: Right.

00:19:30.292 --> 00:19:35.750
LANG LANG: And it was very
tiring to play those pieces.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:39.235
I mean, it drives me nuts and
drives my neighbors nuts.

00:19:39.235 --> 00:19:39.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.680
LANG LANG: I really feel
bad about it, you know.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.300
Recently, I started practicing
at my apartment here and

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:49.910
started practicing the
Chopin etudes.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.190
And then my neighbor
knocked at my door.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.810
And he said could you stop?

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:53.200
Could you stop?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.510
JEFF SPURGEON: Really?

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.180
Did they really?

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.620
You're making that up.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.230
LANG LANG: No, no.

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:58.810
I mean, there's a one neighbor
who knows who I am, so she's

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.020
always like, oh, that's
really wonderful.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.000
But then another neighbor, I
think, living downstairs--

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.090
because I always like to
practice after 11:00 to find

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:10.810
inspiration.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:13.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.900
LANG LANG: And this
lady, I think she

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.295
hate me all the time.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:20.560
JEFF SPURGEON: So you've been
playing these since you were

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.100
eight, playing them in public
since you were 13.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.040
Why record them now?

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.310
Why not a little earlier?

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.600
Why not wait a couple
more years?

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.150
Maybe the wine will mellow a
little more in the bottle.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.820
Why decide to do these now?

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.610
LANG LANG: Ever since I'm 30,
I like to do some more

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.610
repertoire which I played a lot
when I was a kid and also

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:44.820
putting in some new pieces.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:47.970
I actually thought to
do the 24 etudes to

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.930
complete the cycle.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:56.240
But actually, I thought maybe
I should do something, not

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.890
just technical pieces, but
also very artistic pieces

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:04.120
combined for the Chopin
first solo for me to

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:09.170
record and also to hear.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:12.640
I was actually watching the
video that I did when I was

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.620
13, playing the complete
etudes.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.310
And I find a few wrong notes.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.660
I'm like, yeah.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:25.530
But I'm now playing a few of
those pieces, like the "Winter

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.940
Wind" and the "Ocean" etudes.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.280
Now it feels slightly easier--

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.410
slightly.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:34.540
So that seems like
a good sign.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:42.000
After 17 years of practice, my
technique is going somewhere.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.170
But more importantly, it's
the musical sense.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:50.270
There are so many new things
I'm trying to interpret in

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.350
this album to try to find
different colors, like you

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:58.420
have here, different levels of
colors and the combination of

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:03.500
the styling of Chopin, and the
romantic period of repertoire.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.510
And especially last
year, I did Liszt.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.130
So I thought this was a nice
momentum to do Chopin.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.230
So next year will be
very different.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.130
JEFF SPURGEON: What's
next year?

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.350
LANG LANG: Next year I will
do Prokofiev and Bartok.

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.690
JEFF SPURGEON: Wow.

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:16.440
OK.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.840
LANG LANG: So it's very,
very different--

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:18.260
JEFF SPURGEON: Gnarly.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:18.802
LANG LANG: --approach.

00:22:18.802 --> 00:22:19.900
JEFF SPURGEON: Yeah,
totally different.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.120
A totally different world.

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.120
There's some unusual pieces
on this album.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.400
The "Andante spianato" and
"Grande polonaise." big

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.100
favorite of yours, done with
orchestra sometimes, but

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.780
there's the solo version.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.120
You've always liked
this piece?

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:32.660
LANG LANG: Not really.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.800
I mean, when I was a
kid, I hated it.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:42.420
Because no matter how great the
works are, if there are so

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.670
many pianists playing the same
piece not at a very good

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.430
level, then you will
feel kind of bored.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.912
And so that exactly happened
when I was a kid.

00:22:52.912 --> 00:22:55.330
I heard so many interpretations
of this piece

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.090
that I got totally
overwhelmed.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.900
And I didn't like it.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.430
Then I came to America.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.865
And I studied at Curtis
in Philadelphia.

00:23:05.865 --> 00:23:07.180
Do you know the Philly
cheese steak?

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.430
It's pretty good.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:19.890
Anyway, in Philadelphia, a boy
from Kiev, he also studied

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.540
with the same teacher as
me, Gary Graffman.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.240
JEFF SPURGEON: Gary Graffman.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.530
LANG LANG: And he played
in the student recital.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.450
I was shocked by his playing.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:30.180
I'm like, wow, this piece
is spectacular.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.710
And then I started to
loving this piece.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:33.940
Thanks to him, of course.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:39.350
And so sometimes one amazing
performance really changes

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.780
your entire view of a work.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.420
And that's what happened in
the "Spianato" and "Grande

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.400
polonaise."

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.250
JEFF SPURGEON: Nocturnes.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.250
You played, actually, a
wonderful cross-section of the

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.640
album just a few minutes ago.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.650
There's a piece on this album.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:54.630
It's the last selection.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.630
It's called "Tristesse." And it
features a singer named Oh

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.610
Land who is from--

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:01.180
LANG LANG: Sweden, I think.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.570
JEFF SPURGEON: Sweden.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.810
She lives in Williamsburg,
because most people do.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.950
LANG LANG: Yeah, Brooklyn's
getting big.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.010
JEFF SPURGEON: It's beautiful.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.360
And can you tell me
the story of this?

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.380
Because it's from a
film, "Tristesse."

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:13.170
LANG LANG: Right.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.790
We did a film during the Chopin
year called "The Flying

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:22.540
Machine." So it's basically
adapted to a novel about

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.570
Poland today.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.310
And it's compared to
Chopin's days.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:35.290
So actually, I was an
actor in this movie.

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.945
And my partner was Heather
Graham from "Austin

00:24:38.945 --> 00:24:41.610
Powers," the girl.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.590
JEFF SPURGEON: Yeah,
Heather Graham.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.560
Many, many faces lit up when
you said those words.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.400
LANG LANG: But that one
was pretty classic.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.452
I need a hungover thing.

00:24:53.452 --> 00:24:55.600
I miss the baby, yeah.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:01.560
And so that film, actually, was
quite inspiring, because

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.900
it was Chopin's music,
and takes the

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.950
journey of a piano, actually.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.990
The piano became a
flying machine.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.680
So we take the kids
over the world.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.140
And so the theme song, we
actually thought the

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.470
"Tristesse," which is Opus 10,
Number 3, etudes, is such a

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:23.060
beautiful melody, which I played
second to the last.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.890
And so we transcribed that to
the theme song, so we got this

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.900
beautiful voice.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.070
Her name is pretty
fun, Oh Land.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:37.760
So in the beginning, I didn't
know if it's a he or a she.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.170
Then when I heard the voice, I
most certainly said, it's she.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.970
And she did a wonderful job.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:46.910
JEFF SPURGEON: It's
a sweet song.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.360
And a lot of popular
songs have been

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.460
written on Chopin themes.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.380
LANG LANG: Yes.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.310
JEFF SPURGEON: And this is
another one, which is great.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:58.130
Your foundation, let's talk
about that because that's such

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.510
a big deal.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.540
The Lang Lang International
Music Foundation, it's going

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.160
great guns.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.430
You had some kids, I think, from
part of that program on

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.170
"The Tonight Show" recently?

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.600
LANG LANG: Yeah, two weeks
ago, I was on Jay Leno.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.980
JEFF SPURGEON: Four minutes of
classical music on network

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:11.600
television.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.636
It was extraordinary.

00:26:12.636 --> 00:26:14.620
It was four whole minutes.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.850
It was amazing.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.050
LANG LANG: These days,
it's hard to get

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:19.080
classical music on--

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.465
JEFF SPURGEON: That's
exactly right.

00:26:21.465 --> 00:26:23.460
LANG LANG: Anyway, I mean,
Jay is a good friend.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:28.690
And I mean, his name is Jay
Jay now, you know, after--

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:28.890
JEFF SPURGEON: After
Lang Lang.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:32.310
Right, sure.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.020
LANG LANG: Oh, my god,
he has 400 cars.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.120
Anyway, let's not
talk about that.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:44.360
So we actually had a very
fortunate selection of

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.400
wonderful tenants from
the Los Angeles area.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.120
I mean, some of the kids,
actually, I know them before,

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.060
because they performed with me,
my foundation, actually.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.960
JEFF SPURGEON: They were
young kids, too.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.980
There were 10 of them.

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:57.950
So Lang Lang played.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:02.170
You play some "La companella,"
and the E-flat waltz that you

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.280
heard part of here.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.110
And then 10 kids, five other
Steinways around in the room,

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.405
and they all joined you for the
Mozart "Ronda alla Turca."

00:27:09.405 --> 00:27:11.740
LANG LANG: Yeah, Turkish
March [HUMS TUNE].

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.060
I'm sure you know it.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.670
And it was so beautiful
that I really enjoyed

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:17.860
working with them.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.160
But the way they played,
it was magnificent.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.390
JEFF SPURGEON: Yeah,
very sweet.

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:26.410
LANG LANG: And I mean, I thought
everyone watching our

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.640
next generation perform,
it's a special moment.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.210
And for me, it's
very inspiring.

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:36.990
And that's what our foundation
is wanting to do, to work with

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:41.330
the next generation of artists,
and helping them to

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:44.780
support them to achieve their
dreams, just like many of the

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.480
mentor helped me when
I was very young.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.950
JEFF SPURGEON: So it's about
helping the next generation,

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.000
not necessarily about
classical music.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.700
I mean, it is classical
focused, I think.

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.110
LANG LANG: Yeah, it will be a
focus on classical and piano.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:04.360
But at the same time, we will
also do some event, let's say,

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:10.690
with the Grammy people
and VHI people.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:16.930
So we are trying to break the
boundaries through this

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.080
wonderful project.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.855
And I created this 101
Pianists project.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:26.250
JEFF SPURGEON: You have 100
pianists with you on stage?

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:26.950
Is that the idea?

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:27.310
LANG LANG: Yes.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:30.560
And 50 pianos, so people
play four hands.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.830
So the reason is that--

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.560
JEFF SPURGEON: That's also a
great job creator, too, just

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.440
for the movers.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.230
LANG LANG: Yeah, the movers
were quite happy about it.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.210
But the reason we want it is
that as a pianist, we always

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.010
practice by ourselves.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.180
It's sometimes very lonely.

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.856
You are in a dark room, much
darker than this room.

00:28:52.856 --> 00:28:55.140
And I practice hours, hours.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.680
And it's hard training.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.450
And for kids, it's important
to have a partner.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.850
So two kids on one piano, so
they can talk a little bit.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.230
It's like doing your homework,
that type of thing.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.070
And then the teachers can teach

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.280
them how to play together.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.470
And in the end, we all
get together and play

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:17.890
and enjoy the music.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.730
JEFF SPURGEON: The music-making,
yeah.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:23.100
October 30 at Carnegie Hall,
the Lang Lang International

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.960
Music Foundation is having a
big benefit concert in the

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.400
evening with Joshua Bell, and
Dee Dee Bridgewater, and the

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.970
formerly mentioned Oh Land.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.410
LANG LANG: And Alec Baldwin.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.490
JEFF SPURGEON: And Alec Baldwin
will be the host.

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:35.490
And some scholars.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:36.790
So what's going to happen
that night?

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.970
Just a big bunch of music
making, I guess?

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.000
LANG LANG: Yeah.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.090
JEFF SPURGEON: Do you
collaborate with everybody?

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.490
Are you doing something with
Dee Dee Bridgewater?

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:44.080
LANG LANG: Yeah.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.860
So here I start to
play some Chopin.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:51.880
And then with Josh, we play
the Grieg Piano Sonata.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.930
JEFF SPURGEON: Is he Jay
Jay also to you?

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.085
LANG LANG: Josh Josh.

00:29:55.085 --> 00:29:56.910
JEFF SPURGEON: OK,
just checking.

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:00.990
LANG LANG: And then in the
second half, we start with

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:05.730
four hands, six hands, eight
hands, and 10 hands.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:06.420
JEFF SPURGEON: On one piano?

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:06.940
LANG LANG: No.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.750
JEFF SPURGEON: OK,
just checking.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:09.420
Just checking.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.940
LANG LANG: Yeah, 10 hands
on one piano.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.320
JEFF SPURGEON: Well, you'd know
each other very well by

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:13.890
the end of the piece.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:14.710
You'd be very familiar.

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.958
LANG LANG: Sounds like subway
in New York, yeah?

00:30:16.958 --> 00:30:18.208
JEFF SPURGEON: That's right.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:21.830
You are a master.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.390
At the age of 30,
you are a master

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:26.120
recognized around the globe.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.730
But are you still a student?

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.510
And do you see any of
your old teachers?

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.200
Gary Graffman was your
teacher at Curtis.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.900
I know you've done
a little bit of

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.920
work with Daniel Barenboim.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.720
LANG LANG: Absolutely.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.340
JEFF SPURGEON: When you see
them, do you play for them and

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.520
ask them for their thoughts?

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.490
Is it a lesson?

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:41.400
Do they give you notes?

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.920
How does it work at this level
where you are in your stage of

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:49.540
artistry with these
older mentors, I

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:50.190
guess you'd call them?

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.570
LANG LANG: Yeah, I mean,
my teachers were--

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.330
and still are--

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.130
Gary Graffman, Christoph
Eschenbach, Daniel Barenboim.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:01.320
And they helped me tremendously,
not just

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.100
technically.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.270
JEFF SPURGEON: I was going to
say, they're not going to say,

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.650
you missed the E-flat
on the 40th bar.

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:06.440
That's not what they do.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.290
So what do they--

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.980
LANG LANG: Well, sometimes
they do that, too.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:16.250
But because the great musicians,
like those names,

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:20.080
they are much more focused on
the understanding and also on

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.410
the traditional interpretations,
so they will

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:29.590
show you how the traditional
sound.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:33.250
And then we will start
discussing about new

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:38.510
possibilities of how we recreate
those moments, the

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.070
traditional lines.

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:45.750
And then they will help me
to find out my ways.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:50.350
I will start to explore some of
my ideas on those passages

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.450
how I'm going to do it.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:58.020
And obviously, we know that in
music, there are certain

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.450
styles, but there's
not certain rules.

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.620
And so basically there are
a lot of alternatives.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.600
And the important thing is how
to organize the alternatives

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:13.000
and how to balance them,
having a right pause.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.520
And this is the challenge
because you can do a lot of

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.390
interpretations.

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.940
But even it doesn't balance, if
it in the end doesn't make

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.590
sense, then all those
feelings are wasted.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.290
And so first, you should
explore, and then you need to

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:31.920
limit your interpretations
into certain ways.

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.980
And then in the concert, you
start everything new again,

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.580
try to get inspired from the
actual stage and to recreate

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:47.910
new feelings, new emotion, but
aware of the tradition lines,

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:53.700
which will hold every
interpretation in the right

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.710
speed and right pause.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.070
JEFF SPURGEON: Well, you're
part of that tradition.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.560
You're recreating
it and making it

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.550
new at the same time.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.320
I should say, too, that there's
time for questions

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.190
from all of you here at
the end a little bit.

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:08.590
Just think of your question.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.660
LANG LANG: Hold the line,
hold the line.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.910
JEFF SPURGEON: Yeah, exactly.

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:16.550
I've wondered about the
transition from Chinese

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:21.580
culture to Western culture for
you in music as well, because

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.990
you grew up playing this music
for a very long time.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:31.180
For me, Chinese classical music
is a little bit strange

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:34.480
and maybe a little bit difficult
to listen to,

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.975
because I haven't had as much
experience with it.

00:33:35.975 --> 00:33:38.550
You've been steeped in
both traditions.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:39.690
Do you hear them the same way?

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:44.240
Or do you switch sort of
from one to another?

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.270
And you've put them
together, too.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.560
Because you've done lots of
piano transcriptions of

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.850
traditional Chinese pieces
that weren't

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.920
thought of on the piano.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.500
LANG LANG: Just like this, when
you hear American music,

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:59.550
when you hear German music, when
you hear African music,

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.230
it's different.

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:04.290
But at the same time, it's
all called music.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.960
It's like language, you know.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.159
In the end we try to expressing
similar subjects,

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.639
similar feelings, but using
different wording and

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.650
different language.

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:19.130
That's a bit like
the music world.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:25.469
I mean, obviously, you need to
switch fast with the taste of

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:27.330
music making.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:32.750
But in the end of the day, for
example, I grew up both in

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.310
Chinese traditional music and
the Western classical, because

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.159
my father plays erhu, which
is Chinese melody.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:48.020
Recently, I found a different
interesting thing of the

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:54.350
difference between a fork and
chopsticks and the difference

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:57.810
between erhu and violin.

00:34:57.810 --> 00:34:58.810
Do you see the similarity?

00:34:58.810 --> 00:34:59.530
JEFF SPURGEON: Yeah,
I understand.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.620
LANG LANG: The erhu
has two strings.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.360
And violin has four.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.860
And chopsticks--

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.360
JEFF SPURGEON: Two.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.040
A fork, usually four tines.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:09.890
LANG LANG: So here I go.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.140
So that's the difference.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:14.820
JEFF SPURGEON: Very good.

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:16.070
That's a very good answer.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.780
I mean, one of the things with
your foundation, you're

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.450
helping people to explore
classical music.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:27.880
Do you feel like you can make
people like classical music?

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.770
I feel like sometimes
it's a sales job.

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.090
Nobody says, oh my god, you've
got to hear rock and roll.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.980
You won't believe what
this stuff is.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:36.510
Nobody says it.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.540
But about classical music,
sometimes people say, oh,

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.750
well, if you haven't heard it,
you should maybe listen to a

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:41.400
little bit of it.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.690
Do you feel like you're
ever having to sell

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:47.620
it, the idea of it?

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.290
LANG LANG: I mean,
one experience I

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.540
got was pretty funny--

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.090
two experiences.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.750
The first was seen in America,
and then I'll

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:57.830
talk about China later.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:35:58.790
So first, in America.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.620
I came when I was 15.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.730
And then I was in a regular high
school in Philadelphia,

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:09.010
all those dudes and [INAUDIBLE],
you know.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:11.890
And then they asked
me, what do you do

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.020
here in this country?

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:16.230
Oh, I'm studying classical
music.

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.690
They were like, classical
music?

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.850
What is that?

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:23.860
Oh, I know, I know.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.210
Are you playing the dudes
who's already passed

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.710
like 500 years ago?

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.690
You do his work?

00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:33.450
I say, yeah, it's kind
of like that.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.760
I said, just think about
Shakespeare.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.777
He's dead for many years.

00:36:37.777 --> 00:36:41.520
He passed, but still his work
is a classic, right?

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.890
So then I know we have
a serious problem.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:47.780
And then a few years
later, I went back

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.490
to China for concerts.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:55.145
And then during the CD signings,
this one guy came

00:36:55.145 --> 00:36:57.510
and was like, I saw that
you are recording the

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:58.760
same label as Mozart.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:05.850
So you see, it's totally
opposite.

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.740
But somehow, it's quite funny.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:16.150
So in a way, that gives us the
room to have some work to do.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:20.870
But I don't think we need
to sell this art because

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:23.500
classical music is
so wonderful.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.885
People sometimes don't know it.

00:37:25.885 --> 00:37:26.590
That's it.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.030
We just need to--

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.270
using social media networks
and platforms.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.450
JEFF SPURGEON: Can you give an
example of social media?

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:33.880
Just kidding.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.280
Just kidding.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.125
It's Google Talks.

00:37:35.125 --> 00:37:35.780
It's Google.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:36.710
It's Google Talks.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.120
Sorry.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.640
LANG LANG: Yeah, I mean,
remember a few years ago,

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.170
YouTube had a YouTube symphony
orchestra competition?

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.380
And it was a big phenomenon
on the internet.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.030
And I had a great privilege
to be the

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.670
ambassador for the project.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.460
And so in the future--

00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:00.100
today even, when I tweet
or Facebooking--

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:05.230
I start to share some of the
musical thoughts, not just

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:10.660
talking about food and movies,
but to share a little bit of

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:13.420
feelings to the music I play.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.950
And then I share some of my
favorite links of the great

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:23.160
musicians perform to try to
inspire some fans to listen.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.570
JEFF SPURGEON: Very
good, thank you.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:25.500
All right.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.100
There are microphones
over there.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:30.640
So if you have questions, please
go to a microphone.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.560
And we'll line you up and knock
you down with Lang Lang.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.604
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:36.604 --> 00:38:37.990
My name's Samir.

00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.860
I'm here at Google.

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:40.040
I am a father.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.990
I've got a five-year-old
and a two-year-old.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:46.820
And for better or worse, my kids
are into popular music.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.030
LANG LANG: Good for you.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.960
I'm wondering--

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.830
so making them sit down and
listen to better music, to

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:55.715
classical music, feels a
little heavy handed.

00:38:55.715 --> 00:38:57.940
LANG LANG: Oh, thank
you very much.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.640
AUDIENCE: It feels a little
heavy handed.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.410
I was wondering, what have you
found really works with kids

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.950
to get them engaged and
interested in new kinds of

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.600
music, in particular,
classical music?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.430
LANG LANG: There are a few
composers which I felt quite

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.160
have a really good connection
to kids.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.060
One is Tchaikovsky, pieces like
"Nutcracker" or "Swan

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:25.500
Lake." And Mozart, Mozart
probably is the best composer

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:29.080
to inspire the kids.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.800
And Chopin, also, I would
say is melodic.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.710
But you wouldn't start with
Wagner's "Ring Cycle," right?

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:37.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:39.474
LANG LANG: That's
a little hard.

00:39:39.474 --> 00:39:42.790
So good luck.

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.320
Maybe there's some new
Lady Gaga coming out.

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:49.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.860
AUDIENCE: Hi, quick question.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.960
Along those lines, I have a
four and a six-year-old.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.305
LANG LANG: Baby time.

00:39:54.305 --> 00:39:57.080
AUDIENCE: And they just start
and stop things, especially my

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.200
six-year-old daughter.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.840
She's interested now in piano.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.240
How do I get that going,
keep that going?

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.810
Because I imagine there will be
challenges along the way.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:10.875
LANG LANG: First, get
a good teacher.

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:13.550
That's very important.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:20.280
And very important, if you have
time, please take her to

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.450
a kids event, a kids concert.

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.410
I'm sure Carnegie does
a lot of those

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.250
things and Lincoln Center.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:31.740
Or take her to some
of the concerts

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:34.110
that other kids perform.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.950
Because for me, it
was the same.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:41.295
The reason I start liking
performance when I was very

00:40:41.295 --> 00:40:45.760
young is because all my friends
were musicians, and

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.300
they were actually playing
something.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.190
And we can actually play
together, like, two pianos or

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.010
three pianos.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:56.200
Or violin, play a trio,
a little trio.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:59.070
And music's like language.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.420
We need a communication.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.900
We need to use our language.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.250
You know, if you learn a new
language, if you don't use it,

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.490
you're not interested, and
you forget about it.

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:13.450
So communication is
very important.

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:17.200
JEFF SPURGEON: I know there's
at least one more question.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.160
AUDIENCE: I think I could
just ask here.

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:20.880
JEFF SPURGEON: I'll repeat it.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.560
AUDIENCE: First of all, as a
Chinese, I am very proud of

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.330
your-- you know, everything.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:25.331
LANG LANG: Thank you.

00:41:25.331 --> 00:41:28.488
AUDIENCE: Like [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:28.488 --> 00:41:30.090
Really good job.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:35.770
My question is do you have any
plan to do some record like

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:38.540
Bach or something more classic
like "Goldberg--"

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.400
LANG LANG: "Goldberg
Variation."

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:41.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like
like that.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.360
JEFF SPURGEON: OK, so the
question was what are your

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.760
plans for your next
recordings?

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.720
And will you do Bach,
specifically?

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.130
LANG LANG: I mean,
I love Bach.

00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:54.260
When I was a kid, I played
Bach's work every week.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.753
And I tried to memorize
a work by Bach every

00:41:56.753 --> 00:41:59.102
week to train my brain.

00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:02.360
By the way, after that, you can
remember every cellphone

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.610
number you want.

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:12.540
And Bach is really, really
challenging, but incredible.

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.970
Certainly, I would love to
record the "Goldberg

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:18.060
Variation." Certainly,
I will do more

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.100
classic repertoire records.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.960
But it needs to be balanced.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.790
So this year and last year
I did all the romantics.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:28.770
And then next year, it
will be contemporary.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:29.360
And then, you know.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:35.050
So I'm trying to balance
the recordings.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:36.771
Thanks for bringing the
"Goldberg," by the way.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:42.150
AUDIENCE: So there's a
lot of talk about--

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.880
sorry, I'm very tall.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.530
There's a lot of talk
about bringing

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.620
classical music to children.

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.905
And I am, in some sense,
a product of that.

00:42:49.905 --> 00:42:52.850
My father went way out of his
way to play classical music.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.040
He really enjoyed it.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.720
And I hated it as a kid.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.460
And I'm here.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.350
So that's obviously no
longer the case.

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:06.356
But I studied, or at least I was
taught, classical guitar.

00:43:06.356 --> 00:43:10.610
And that lapsed for several
years while I went to

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:11.300
university.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.650
And now I'm here, so I guess
the lapse was a little

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.275
worthwhile.

00:43:14.275 --> 00:43:18.550
But what advice would you give
towards adults who have a

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:24.040
musical sensibility, who have
musical appreciation and, I

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.110
guess in my case, have or, in
more general cases, do not

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.260
have some degree of
musical training?

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:33.300
Because children are taught at
a very early age to begin to

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:37.560
play classical music or
any music in general.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.230
Is there any fear that I should
have in terms of lack

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.750
of dexterity, I guess,
plasticity of mind?

00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:46.680
What advice would you give
towards adults who want to

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:51.970
begin to hopefully, with a lag,
reach the kind of level

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:54.590
you operate on?

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.960
LANG LANG: You are
getting deep.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:57.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.850
LANG LANG: Wow.

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:02.350
Adult.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:06.770
I mean, there's an app called
Magic Piano, which I

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:08.020
co-produced.

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:13.710
If you feel difficult to play
the real piano, try that.

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:17.080
It will be easier to play.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.250
Because somehow it's
played by itself.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:26.830
And you can certainly buy a
piano which has a kind of

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.610
high-tech disk.

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:33.830
And then you just push whoever's
Chopin, whoever's

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:37.220
Tchaikovsky, whoever's
Beethoven.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:41.100
And then you can maybe start to
see the positions down on

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.660
the piano and try
to follow it.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:49.960
But again, I am really welcoming
of adults actually

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.700
learning an instrument.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.580
And especially, you
had a musical

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:55.510
training before, right?

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:59.170
So for you, it will be very
easy, actually, to pick it up

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:03.410
again, the great work
you did before.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.820
And maybe now when you do
it, you will feel more

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.590
comfortable.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:11.090
Maybe you will like it more
than when you were a kid.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:14.790
And also, you know, classical
guitar is pretty cool.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:21.000
And I'm sure when you
play, you get some

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.220
new dates or something.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:24.940
LANG LANG: I mean, that's
very encouraging.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:29.850
I know some of my friends, who
are adults, study piano.

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:31.230
I say, why are you doing it?

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.620
Oh, I to impress the girls.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:35.410
So I know lots of
those people.

00:45:35.410 --> 00:45:41.520
So it's good encouragement.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.750
JEFF SPURGEON: Choice of
instrument could be important

00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:43.870
for that, too.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:45.330
You'll get more dates with
a guitar, probably,

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:46.740
than with an accordion.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:47.690
Just a thought.

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:50.080
LANG LANG: Guitar is very
popular these days.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.520
Probably one of the instruments
I can think of

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.500
more popular than piano,
it's probably guitar.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.440
I would like to learn
it, actually.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.240
Guitar, I mean.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.950
Maybe I should learn
some classical

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.830
guitar skill from you.

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.750
AUDIENCE: I'd love
to give you a--

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:09.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.670
LANG LANG: I got new
lessons from you.

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:14.330
AUDIENCE: So the point is a
competent teacher, right?

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:14.830
LANG LANG: Great.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:16.020
Thank you.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.170
JEFF SPURGEON: Yes, sir?

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:21.180
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask, when
you memorize a piece, is

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.650
it only technical?

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:24.990
Or do you also memorize
how you feel?

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:28.910
Is it like, before you start
playing, do you have to get

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:30.750
into the emotion
of that piece?

00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:34.210
Or is just the music getting
you there when you hear it?

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:45.080
LANG LANG: First, sometimes I
hear great music in my ear.

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:51.350
Whether it's any type of music,
I'm just trying to

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.580
memorize the melodies first.

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:59.180
And I want to somehow play
it on the piano.

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:02.430
But some work, I know it for
many years, and it doesn't

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.920
mean that you start to love
those repertoire right away.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.030
Some pieces take a few
years to digest.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:13.250
And then you're like,
wow, I should do it.

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:16.490
So first comes to the
general stuff.

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:19.580
You read a score after you're
really liking this piece.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.490
You want to learn it, right?

00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:26.310
So you learn it from the score,
and you play simply,

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:31.160
whether just play by your
right hand or putting it

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.000
together, practice.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:41.140
And after that, you are trying
to analyzing the piece and

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.560
using everything you learned
from the past.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.790
And your head should be like
a multimedia screen.

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:53.370
Try to pick a lot of elements
and try to put those things

00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:55.000
inside of the music.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.220
Because the most important
thing is not the note.

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.680
It's the things behind
the note, the

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:00.670
meaning behind the note.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:06.080
So the more meanings you're
getting, it's better for the

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.790
first work session.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.450
And then later, you're
just trying to

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:13.990
balance the right ones.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:16.870
And you will know the right
ones when you are ready.

00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:18.140
In the beginning, you
don't really know.

00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.600
So you try a lot of things.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.020
And then later you will know,
wow, this will not work.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:26.110
Because this maybe doesn't
fit in the style.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:29.880
And then later, after you really
understand the dynamics

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:34.920
of the score, you start
to recreate things.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:40.030
And then you play for several
of your teachers or your

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:43.270
colleagues to get more ideas.

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:46.680
And then you start looking
into this work again.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.200
And then you start
performance.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.350
And when you perform, every day,
every time, you should

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:52.880
try different things.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.600
And after a year, I think, you
are ready for recording.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:58.540
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:01.260
LANG LANG: Lot of
alternatives.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.640
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is Zettai.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.070
I work in Google.

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:07.690
And I actually have the opposite
problem from Samir

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:10.090
with my two-and-a-half
year-old daughter.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:12.320
She actually loves
classical music.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:12.610
LANG LANG: Yay!

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.080
Here we go, yeah.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:16.520
AUDIENCE: She even goes to sleep
while hearing Andrea

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:20.120
Bocelli and you playing there,
which is very nice.

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.560
And I have a different
question.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.160
I want to learn playing the
piano myself as well.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.460
LANG LANG: Wonderful.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:27.890
Wonderful.

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:29.910
That's a great idea, yeah.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:30.645
AUDIENCE: I'm pretty
old, you know.

00:49:30.645 --> 00:49:32.620
I'm 35.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.700
And my question is actually
two part.

00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.100
First of all, I heard
about something

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.960
called the Suzuki method.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.100
But I heard conflicting
opinions about it.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.310
So I wonder what's
your take on it.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:49.440
And the second part, is it--

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:50.650
how do you say it?

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:55.850
Real ambition to learn to play
the piano at such a late age?

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:59.091
And to do even something
minimum?

00:49:59.091 --> 00:50:00.940
LANG LANG: It's never
too late.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:08.550
Suzuki method, actually, I
didn't know that method when I

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.040
was practicing.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.140
And then later, I
know the method.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:17.320
But I've been brought up
by just playing scales.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:21.520
So I didn't really
have any method.

00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.050
Try this method or not.

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:25.860
I think that maybe it's
important for some people.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.430
But it's not necessary to be
focused on one method.

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:32.250
Because in the end of the day,
there's so many ways of

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:33.460
playing piano.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:37.470
And you don't want to start
with one thing in the very

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:39.765
beginning, and you're
just stuck with it.

00:50:39.765 --> 00:50:43.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but I understood
the Suzuki method,

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:47.170
both the father and the child
are learning together.

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:48.890
I thought that's what--

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:49.980
LANG LANG: My father
also did that.

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:53.720
But it was a different
kind of method.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:58.158
He's playing, like,
the strict method.

00:50:58.158 --> 00:50:59.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.680
LANG LANG: It doesn't matter.

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:04.850
But I'm sure it will work
for many people.

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:08.760
I just didn't brought
up by that method.

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:16.480
But this is a very challenging
way to know what is the real,

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:22.160
right beginning method for
kids to learn piano?

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.640
We'll still trying to
figure that out.

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.810
So once I know more about
it, I let you know.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:31.120
But seriously, you can always
learn piano, no

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.640
matter how old you are.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.325
I have a doctor friend.

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.370
He's a wonderful doctor,
lives in Germany.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:43.320
And he's now, I think,
50 years old.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.610
JEFF SPURGEON: Good god, 50.

00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:46.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:47.760
LANG LANG: Because he always
loved the piano.

00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:51.766
But he never had money to learn
when he was very young.

00:51:51.766 --> 00:51:54.170
He was focusing on medicine,
you know.

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:58.790
Then somehow, after he became
a very successful doctor, he

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:03.740
wanted to establish his
childhood dream, which is to

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.410
play beautiful songs.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:13.100
And so he started to learn
piano when he turned 42.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.980
Seriously.

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.920
And he found a teacher who was
very young, like, early 20s,

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:23.770
but a very good guy, and
a very solid pianist.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:25.870
So he started learning
from him.

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:28.080
And you what?

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.240
This 50-year-old doctor just
made his family archive

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.800
recording of 10 of his favorite
pieces, including the

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:40.740
Schumann Traumerei, "Dreaming,"
including the

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:45.300
Schubert Impromptus, including
Chopin's Waltz, including

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.140
Liszt Consolation.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:50.680
So this guy's only learned a
few years, but he has his

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.070
golden Top 10.

00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:56.440
So he can open a radio show,
you know, Top 10.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.750
And he plays very beautiful.

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:00.420
I mean, the technique maybe
is not really there.

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.340
But he's certainly put his
emotions there, which is more

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.840
important, somehow.

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.330
And so I'm sure you
can do the same.

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:09.110
And I'm sure you're much
younger than he is.

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.120
JEFF SPURGEON: One
more question.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.470
You.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:17.730
AUDIENCE: So given the level
of evocativeness that you

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:20.920
achieve, I have to wonder,
do you have some sort of

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:24.460
meditative practice other
than at the piano?

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:28.020
What are your favorite ways to
tap into, say, greater levels

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.270
of humanity?

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:39.070
LANG LANG: I mean, the first
really important thing is

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:40.200
taking naps.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:42.860
LANG LANG: You're talking
about meditation, right.

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:48.450
I mean, that's the first thing
that come to my mind.

00:53:48.450 --> 00:53:50.550
Because I'm such a night
person, I don't

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:52.180
sleep well in the night.

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:58.580
I just get over in my mind
with some strange ideas.

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:01.230
But during the day, I like to
take a one-hour nap, and then

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:05.110
somehow that calms me down,
and I feel great.

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:13.570
And also, I think the best way
for ourselves to get ready

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:16.130
mentally is reading books.

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:18.540
Read as much as you can.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:23.880
And also, after reading, take
a little walk in a park.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.110
Or go to museums.

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:28.780
This, for me, is the best
way of learning new

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:31.570
knowledge and relaxing.

00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:33.150
And this makes me a much better

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:36.810
musician and a human being.

00:54:36.810 --> 00:54:38.080
JEFF SPURGEON: Thank you.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.250
And thanks to everyone
here at Google today.

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:41.610
And thanks to Lang Lang.

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:41.860
Great.

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:42.460
LANG LANG: Thanks.

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.710
Thank you.
