one of the things you pointed out too

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589
one of the things you pointed out too
 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.610
one of the things you pointed out too
was that what you most need to know will

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620
was that what you most need to know will
 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.590
was that what you most need to know will
be found where you least want to look

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600
be found where you least want to look
 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.150
be found where you least want to look
and that's because you haven't already

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160
and that's because you haven't already
 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.640
and that's because you haven't already
looked there and so it's a little

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.259
looked there and so it's a little
different for everyone right because

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
different for everyone right because
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.970
different for everyone right because
you're a particular place you don't want

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980
you're a particular place you don't want
 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.230
you're a particular place you don't want
to look isn't going to be the same as

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240
to look isn't going to be the same as
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.000
to look isn't going to be the same as
your place but you're going to have a

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010
your place but you're going to have a
 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.279
your place but you're going to have a
place you don't want to look and what

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289
place you don't want to look and what
 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.900
place you don't want to look and what
you haven't discovered that's where it

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
you haven't discovered that's where it
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.290
you haven't discovered that's where it
is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
is
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.509
is
and so that's all partly going to be

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
and so that's all partly going to be
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.849
and so that's all partly going to be
discovered by you looking at what you're

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859
discovered by you looking at what you're
 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.800
