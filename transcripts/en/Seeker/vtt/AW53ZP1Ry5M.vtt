00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.910
In 1600, William Gilbert published a paper
detailing how Earth behaves as a giant magnet.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.940
That seems like a long time ago, but in geologic
time, that’s nothing.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.590
It’s taken hundreds of years to understand
how Earth's magnetic field works… but now

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.900
that we do, scientists are trying to find
hints from Earth’s history that might reveal

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.900
the future of this ever-changing invisible
field all around us.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.320
Specifically, archaeologists are studying
the handles of ancient pottery.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.320
Yeah.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.430
But before I can explain it, we have to get
to how the field affects you.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.930
Scientists believe Earth’s magnetic field
is generated by the spinning of the Earth’s

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.930
core.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.500
Our planet’s magnetic field is super important,
as it blocks harmful rays emanating out of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.100
the sun from hitting us on the ground, destroying
the possibility of life as we know it.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.100
No big deal.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.040
It’s always around us, and it strengthens
and weakens over time -- sometimes, it even

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.040
flips.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.550
If it were to flip, the magnetic north pole
would become the south, and suddenly all magnetic

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.940
compasses in the world would be backwards.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.010
Everything else would be fine though.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.600
It’s not like it would turn off and back
on.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.510
NASA knows a magnetic field flip happens about
every two to three hundred-thousand years.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.020
We know the magnetic field has flipped, because
there’s evidence in the geologic record.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.390
Scientists pulled lava from the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, where two tectonic plates meet.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.780
The ridge is spreading, giving easy access
to very old, cooled lava flows.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.220
Minerals embedded in the lava are sensitive
to Earth’s magnetic field as the lava cools,

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.920
so, by collecting samples of lava, called
“cores,” and analyzing the rock...

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.299
I think you see where this is going…

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.410
It reveals a record of Earth’s magnetic
field over hundreds of thousands of years.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.159
This shows the last “major field flip was
about 780,000 years ago.”

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.689
The problem is, cooling lava rock can’t
be precisely dated...

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.369
Lava rocks don’t have timecodes or calendar
reminders detailing when they oozed and then

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.369
cooled.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.640
Geologic timescales can encompass thousands
of years at a time, meaning we know this lava

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.330
cooled within a few millennia of whatever…

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.920
So, while these rocks can give us an ancient
picture of the magnetic field, imagine a pictures

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.549
that is really zoomed out, or blurry!

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.410
We definitely would need a better image to
fully understand whats happening.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.380
Now, a paper published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences in February

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.480
2017, found a way to enhance this hypothetical
image by using ancient pottery.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.260
Clay is also subject to the same Earth’s
magnetic field record keeping, but the dates

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.820
are far more precise.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.480
So, by analyzing the clay in 67 jar handles
from the Iron Age kingdom of Judah, archaeologists

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.060
have found evidence of the magnetic field
strength rising and falling over the 600 years

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.640
preceding 200 BCE!

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.960
All from jar handles made of clay!

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.980
The results were so clear, they could map
the field picture down to a span of give or

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.190
take 15 years.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.920
Imagine how much clearer a 15 year picture
is compared to a 1000 year picture from geologic

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920
time!

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.269
It looks like Earth’s magnetic field strength
was super high in the 8th century BCE, then

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.330
weakened from the 6th to 2nd century BCE.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.349
The kicker for making this picture so clear,
was the precise dating on the jar handle because

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.880
of royal stamps present on the handles of
these 67 jars.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.660
. Similar to how writing technology has gotten
better since the Sumerians in 3000 BCE; over

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.709
time, stamp technology has changed… allowing
the archaeologists to give atmospheric and

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.959
cosmological scientists a leg up in studying
magnetic fields by precisely dating when things

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.629
changed, and of, by proxy, giving physicists
studying the interior movement of the Earth

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.190
a little bit of help too.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.360
A magnetic field flip is coming!

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.440
Exact magnetic north has moved more than 600
miles further north since it was first pegged

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.629
in the early 19th century, first at about
10 miles per year , and now closer to 40 miles

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.629
per year!

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.190
On top of that, the field has lost “10 percent
of its strength over the last two centuries”

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.889
This causes more vibrant aurora, but don’t
fret.

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.099
The field continues to shield the surface
of the planet from harmful charged particles,

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.250
and has the thick atmosphere to catch any
that may eek through.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.129
Long story short, go take a pottery class.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.709
You might help scientists thousands of years
in the future!

When the magnetic field flip does happen.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.300
Earth’s magnetic north will become magnetic
south, and all the compasses in the world,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.900
and any technology based on that, would be
backwards!
