1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,090
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab and we're back.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:08,110
Now I'm going to take you back live on
stage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,780
And this next story you'll hear
some references to some pictures,

4
00:00:10,781 --> 00:00:12,190
which obviously you won't be able to see,

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,470
but we've got them for
you@radiolab.org um,

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,360
so we wanna finish the night with a
salute to a guy who's been on our program

7
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:22,060
and part of our family pretty
much from the beginning.

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,020
I have known him for more than 35 years.

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,880
Early on when radio lab started,

10
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:30,490
I asked him if he'd help us out
and send us a few story ideas.

11
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:35,380
He didn't send us a few. He sent us
bushels, tales of chemistry and medicine,

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,330
hallucinations, music people,

13
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:42,250
so many extraordinary people that he
knew or found or help cause the guy just

14
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:44,800
doesn't run out. Dr. Oliver Sacks,

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,310
your honor, [inaudible]

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,450
is a guy who noticed it.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,760
Everything is deeply interested in
everything that happens around him and to

18
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:57,911
him.

19
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:01,660
And tonight we're bringing them back
on tape for what lasts may be his final

20
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,430
offering for us. As many of you know,

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,080
Dr Sachs recently was diagnosed with liver
cancer and he wrote about this in the

22
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:12,400
New York Times. He said he plans to spend
the time that he has a left writing,

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,710
being with friends, not doing interviews,

24
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:17,160
but he did agree to share his
thoughts exclusively with,

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,060
with us tonight for you gathered here.
Um, cause he's one of our family.

26
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,430
So as I've done for decades now,

27
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:27,610
I went over to his house in Manhattan
with my mic and I said to him,

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,380
I just need to know what, what just
happened a month and a half ago.

29
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,290
You were fine. And then what? Um,

30
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,700
at the beginning of the year I was fine.

31
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:45,750
On the 3rd of January I felt a little
queer and I pass some dark urine.

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,770
I thought I had a little
gallbladder attack and um,

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,960
didn't pay that much attention,

34
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,890
but thought I better get
things checked. And um,

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,390
the extra which was expected. Ou
need to show a couple of gallstones,

36
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,950
showed hundreds of cysts in my liver.

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,680
Uh, although my doctor said he
didn't know what the, here's one,

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,510
I would need further tests.
I, I knew what they were.

39
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,520
I said it's happened.

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,821
And he was right.

41
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:24,930
The doctors eventually confirmed that
a cancer that had been found in his eye

42
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:28,370
nine years ago had spread
to his liver. Where you

43
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,890
frightened or relieved or console or what,

44
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:36,940
what? No, I am,

45
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,970
I think my first feeling was
one of, of overwhelming sadness.

46
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:49,150
Um, now all sorts of
things I won't see. Um,

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,150
and I won't do one or two people
have written to me in the, you know,

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,890
consoling me and said, well, you
know, we all die, but fuck it.

49
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,120
It's not like we all die. It's
like you have four months.

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,120
Has that, has your PR, what is
your prognosis at this moment?

51
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,810
Cause I know you had an [inaudible]
well, it, it gets revised.

52
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,740
It depends of course,

53
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:16,741
on how the cancer responds to treatments
and or how quickly it spreads so far.

54
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:22,000
Um, the metasticies from
my eye, only in my liver,

55
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,950
I'm told they love liver.
Actually, I love liver as well.

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,520
And one of the magical
things I did was to go and,

57
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,320
and have lived one Allianz
sued after the doctors

58
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,680
and thinking that liberal looks better
than mine. He, this is what he's like,

59
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,320
instead of being frightened by the
thing that's trying to kill him,

60
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,580
he's thinking about loving liver and
liver lovers and looking for connections

61
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:47,020
and wondering if he doesn't stop. He,

62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,310
he just notices that the case in point a
few months ago, his doctor said to him,

63
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,450
we're going to run a line up your liver
and in effect we're going to try to

64
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:58,420
shave off or starve some of the
cancer cells first on one side,

65
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,670
then on the other to see if we
can give you a little more time.

66
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,450
But they weren't him
as the metasticies die.

67
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,620
They put out various unpleasant
chemicals that may exhaust you,

68
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:12,250
tax your system badly.
And um, at one point,

69
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,900
shortly after the procedures,

70
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,580
I started talking a little
strangely and um, as I was talking,

71
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:21,130
I was also writing, um,

72
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,010
you will be the first person to see this.

73
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,370
So he showed me a notebook and were
showing it to you in just a moment.

74
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:32,260
You can see they're sort of
writing there on the left.

75
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,670
It's all he's writing a book,

76
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:37,510
actually a children's book about the
elementary table, but as he was writing,

77
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:39,610
if you, if you look to the next page,

78
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,590
if you can see that it gets a little
bit wobbly, the letters and then,

79
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,810
and then there was some crossing
out there. Yes, I see it.

80
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,820
And then rather dramatically the
lighting changes it actually there's,

81
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,610
there's a large slash
across it and then you,

82
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,850
it seems a little incoherent
and the partners, okay.

83
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,330
And then it turns to pure scribble
that has delirium and crept up on me.

84
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,140
All this happened over the course of 10
minutes and I see what he's doing here.

85
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:14,410
He's figuring, okay, I'm
writing at a constant speed.

86
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,610
I know pretty much how fast I,
right. And so I can time this out.

87
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:22,930
I can figure out exactly how long it took
me to slip into delirium and then out

88
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,450
of this delirium and he's
doing this very, very sick man.

89
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,680
It's science to write it
out in a more medical way.

90
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,050
I think this would form
a lovely illustration.

91
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,120
You put in a timeline of
delirium just coming like that.

92
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,160
Why aren't you more frantic?

93
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,640
Unusual for any doctor
and a man of science.

94
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,320
You don't seem to worry at all when
things become incoherent or strange.

95
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,230
You're now showing it to me as
if like, Ooh how interesting.

96
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,110
I was crazy here for a little bit. Um,

97
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,650
the truth is Oliver is fascinated by
what goes on in the human mind no matter

98
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:58,040
how strange he gets up there

99
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,120
at one time when he was a young
resident in California driving his bike.

100
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:02,511
And by the way,

101
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:06,710
I should show you what he looked like
back then when he was driving his bike.

102
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:10,490
This I think is him in New
York. Uh, Kinda, you know,

103
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,600
in the 60s he was also a champion
weightlifter. They called him Dr Squat.

104
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,060
And in this picture
that you show you here,

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,250
that's him raising 600 pounds in order
to win a trophy. Like, this is a,

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,320
the, he was a champ and,

107
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,260
and you can see more pictures like these
cause we have signed copies of Oliver's

108
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,590
new memoir out for sale in the lobby.
It's pretty good book too by the way.

109
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,610
So in any case at this
time, and then 1960s,

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,130
in addition to being all muscled out,

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,810
Oliver was a serious recreational
drug taker. And because he's Oliver,

112
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,800
he was extremely curious about his
highs no matter how weird they were.

113
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,720
One time for example, he took 20
pills that he shouldn't have. And then

114
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,660
to my surprise, um, uh,

115
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,010
there was a spider on the
wall which said hello.

116
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,090
It had a voice like and famous
mathematician and it, um,

117
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,820
it asked me a lot of the
technical question as to
where the Russell had exploded

118
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,040
for egos paradox. And, um,

119
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,150
we had this conversation
answered the spider,

120
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,720
I'm sure I onto the spine discussed
fragrance paradox with this minor.

121
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,740
I didn't deed Chris, you, you
trust your perceptions. Okay.

122
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,770
Many years later when I mentioned this
to an entomologist friend of Cornell and

123
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,130
the philosophical spider, he said,
yes. He said, I know the species.

124
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,710
So thinking Oliver's way, taking it
all in, talking spiders, whatever.

125
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,420
The generosity of his
curiosity becomes profound.

126
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,730
The moving and transformative
when he's treating his patients.

127
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:51,300
I want to tell one story here really
quickly to, to demonstrate what I mean.

128
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,950
Oliver once had a patient
whom he called Mrs o c

129
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,850
she was an old woman.
She was 88 years old,

130
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:02,790
living in a nursing home and
one night she was awakened,

131
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,220
jarred awake by a loud sound.

132
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,823
Um,

133
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,183
it was a song

134
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,083
[inaudible]

135
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,250
and she thought, well, somebody's left
the radio on, but when she looked,

136
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,880
the media in the room was off,
her roommate sound asleep,

137
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:25,680
which was odd because the song
was really loud. Good. Doris.

138
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,310
After that, there was another song.

139
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,520
Ah,

140
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,400
and then another song is a home.
Great. Mrs [inaudible] thought,

141
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,210
well, maybe my roommate can't hear
the songs because the songs are,

142
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,980
are coming through the fillings in my
teeth. I've heard that's possible. But no,

143
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,590
her doctors told her, this
is something in your head.

144
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:49,970
You need to see a neurologist,
which led her to Dr Sachs.

145
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,910
Now. When he met Mrs Ossi, he,

146
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,840
she could barely hear the song sung by
the female voice were coming and coming.

147
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,110
She was frightened and justifiably
worried that she was going crazy,

148
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,440
but Oliver said, no, no, no, I'm going
to do some tests. And when he was done,

149
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,000
he said he'd found a slight stroke or
condition that had triggered musical

150
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,520
epilepsy. These sudden
production of music in her brain.

151
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,090
Now a normal doctor might say,
okay, we've got the diagnosis,

152
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,880
and he thought that the songs would
probably fade and it will pass,

153
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:22,050
so they would be done. But Oliver
did not stop. He doesn't stop

154
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,370
[inaudible]

155
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,540
he kept talking to her.

156
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,140
She told him she was born in Ireland in
the 1890s her father died before she was

157
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,490
born. Her mother, when she was only five

158
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,480
often alone,

159
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,640
she was sent to America to live
for the welder for beating maiden.

160
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,170
She had no conscious memory as
the first five years of her life,

161
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,840
no memory of her mother of Ireland.

162
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,290
She had always felt this as
a key in and painful sadness,

163
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,460
this lack or forgetting of the earliest,
most precious years of her life.

164
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,950
So we asked her about the songs, what
are they like? And Mrs [inaudible] said,

165
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:05,850
well, I think they're lullabies.
Can you sing them for me? She did.

166
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,470
And then after checking with,

167
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,370
I'm not sure who Oliver figured out that
these songs were happened to be popular

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,720
Irish ballads from the 1890s
when Mrs OSI was a little baby.

169
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:19,770
And that gave him an idea. Now
what he does next isn't science.

170
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,260
It isn't in any traditional way medicine.

171
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,200
He just told her a story
and it goes like this.

172
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,740
You know how nobody remembers anything
that happens to you when you're one or

173
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:32,580
two or three? Well, there was a
theory once, not honored much today,

174
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,910
but it's sad that those earliest
memories get locked away,

175
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:39,480
deepen our brains in a special
safe that we can never open.

176
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:44,780
So let's suppose Mrs o c your stroke
by some crazy chance open the lock that

177
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:50,841
none of us can break and release those
first memories in you just for a little

178
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:53,880
while. So that the voice
you're listening to,

179
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,430
there's at home by grade a, then Mo,

180
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,630
maybe that isn't a radio voice. Let's
say that it's your mother's voice.

181
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,190
That's your missing mother.

182
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,210
And so at the ripe old age of 88 you
finally get to be back in your mother's

183
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,640
arms. You get to be a baby again.

184
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,660
And Mrs [inaudible] thought
about that and said, okay,

185
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,500
it sort of fits.

186
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,220
I'm an old woman with a stroke
in an old people's home,

187
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:28,040
but I feel I'm a child to Kyle on the
gate. I feel my mother's arms. I see her,

188
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,470
I hear her voice soon,

189
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,470
the green, it clean.

190
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,000
Who's around run, sweetie.

191
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,510
Shortly thereafter, the songs
began to fade. The pauses widened.

192
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,130
Mrs OSI had been so frightened by this
music in her head was now sorry to see

193
00:11:46,131 --> 00:11:50,900
the songs go. But it was Oliver who
noticed how those songs had touched her,

194
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,910
who noticed that the songs might become
a comfort to her because that's what he

195
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:58,990
does. He listens closely. He
can hear another person's heart.

196
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,540
And this is really the profound puzzle
for me of Oliver because reading the new

197
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,261
autobiography,

198
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:09,820
you see that while he was so full of
heart as a doctor in his own life and in

199
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:11,860
the relationships that really mattered,

200
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,970
it turns out he didn't get a whole lot
of affection. He was for a long time,

201
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:16,810
a lonely guy.

202
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:21,811
I'd say he was very lonely and he's
talking about that now for the first time.

203
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,380
Let me, let me talk about
love for a minute. Um,

204
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,450
in this book you tell the story of your,

205
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,990
of your very first love a fellow
by the name of Richard Selleck.

206
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,053
Can you just tell me that

207
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,740
what happened with him? Um, yeah. Um,

208
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,770
he was a road scholar at Oxford and I'm
a poet and handsome and beautiful beyond

209
00:12:44,761 --> 00:12:49,380
belief and I sort of fell for him. Um,

210
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,660
although I didn't say
anything because I was um, uh,

211
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,640
very haunted by my mother's
accusations. What did your mother,

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,360
um,

213
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,360
well to go a couple of years back then
my father had opened a conversation,

214
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:11,040
I was about to go to Oxford and have
sort of father son conversation.

215
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,050
And he said, um, we don't seem to
have many girlfriends. And I said,

216
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,200
no, wishing the conversation
would stop. He said, um,

217
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,140
something wrong with girls. And
I said, no, that they're fine.

218
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,570
Perhaps you prefer boys. And I
said, well, yes I do. I said,

219
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:33,150
I've never done anything, but I do.

220
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,030
And then you knew that then I knew
that. Then I'd known it for six years,

221
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:42,810
probably since I was 12. Um, and I said,

222
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,870
don't tell mom she will
be able to take it.

223
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,770
But my father did tell my mother and
the night and the next morning she came

224
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:54,210
down with them.

225
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,220
I somehow want to say a face
of funder and raged at me.

226
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,670
And among other things
said, you're an abomination.

227
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,290
I wish you had never been born.

228
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,660
And then she suddenly shut up
and said nothing for three days.

229
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,950
And, um, uh,

230
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,520
the matter was never mentioned
again in her lifetime.

231
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,780
And then two years later I found myself
for the first time in my life falling in

232
00:14:23,881 --> 00:14:24,570
love.

233
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,350
This was the gun guy, Richard
Oliver at the time was in college.

234
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,390
It was a very positive feeling though.
I didn't know whether it was one,

235
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:34,570
which I did express, but I did say,

236
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:37,510
so with my heart and my mouth
to Richard, what did you,

237
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,640
you remember what you said? Uh, I
said, I'm in love with you, Huh.

238
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:45,460
And, uh, Richard gripped me
by the shoulders and he said,

239
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,850
I know he said, but I'm not that way,

240
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,280
but I love you in my own. And um,

241
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,900
I was glad I had said that I'm glad that
it had been received in such a warm,

242
00:14:56,901 --> 00:15:00,590
friendly way. I thought we might be
friends for the rest of our lives,

243
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,140
but then one day he came into me,

244
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:08,141
he said he'd been bothered by finding
a lump in his groin and he was worried

245
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,950
could I have a look at it?

246
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,670
And I looked at it and I felt
it and it was hard and tethered,

247
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,790
uh, turned out to be a,

248
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,000
a particularly malignant
form of lymphoid to my,

249
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,240
what was called the
lympho sarcoma. And, um,

250
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,460
he never spoke to me again after that.

251
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,820
I don't know whether since I'd been the
first to recognize the ominous import,

252
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,950
I don't know whether he saw me as a
harbinger of death or messenger of death,

253
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,970
whatever. But you were left with
the, with that silence. Yeah.

254
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:42,873
Yeah, yeah.

255
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,450
A few years later, Oliver met and man
named Mel, he was young, he was a sailor.

256
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,500
He like Oliver, he was into weightlifting,

257
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,290
they became close friends and
they began living together.

258
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,460
I adored him and was in love with him
and loved physical contact with him

259
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,700
and they'd work out and they'd wrestle
and ride motorcycles kind of tightly.

260
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:05,060
And they never talked about what might
or might not be happening between them.

261
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:09,440
But one day they were together and
Oliver was giving mil a back massage,

262
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:11,120
which mill often asked him to do.

263
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,660
And uh, I love doing that. And Oliver
says sometimes he'd get a little,

264
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,460
you know, excited.

265
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,410
And so long as I gave no explicit
indication it was okay but, but,

266
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:26,790
but one day things went a bit
too far and I got sort of um,

267
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:31,850
I went over the bridge instead of just
before the big metal immediately sort of

268
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,760
got up and had a shower and said, I,

269
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,250
I can't stay with you anymore. And um,

270
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,330
I found that very cruel and upsetting
and heartbreaking and it made me feel I

271
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:51,570
don't want to have anything to do with
people. I must have fallen in love.

272
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,020
I cannot share life's with anyone again.

273
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,250
And he didn't share his life with
anyone for a long, long. Yeah.

274
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,000
In fact,

275
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:06,810
he told me a story about something that
happened to him maybe eight years ago.

276
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:12,270
I was just joining the faculty at Columbia
and I was having this interview and

277
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,460
at one point the interviewer
said to me, she said,

278
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:19,030
I have something whether private
to our school, we do like Ms Edgar,

279
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,950
your system to leave. And I said,
no, she's privy to all my affairs.

280
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,840
And I then sent thinking she was
going to ask me about six. I said,

281
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,720
I haven't had any sex for 35 years.

282
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,000
I bet in fact what she was going
to ask me, my social security

283
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,760
and she burst into laughter. She said,
Oh, you poor with this. She said,

284
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:46,260
we must do something about it.

285
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:48,340
Well, the truth is Oliver,

286
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,230
I didn't do about it because he didn't
think he could. I mean he chosen,

287
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,700
Richard Lost, Richard Chosen, Mel lost.
Now it wasn't the point he was thinking.

288
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,780
And then finally, and who knows when
or why these things happen to people.

289
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,250
But a man came along who for
the first time chose Oliver.

290
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,900
I have met Billy is I meet a number of
people because I'd been sent a manuscript

291
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:17,250
or proof for book and um,
intimacy grew between us.

292
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,610
I don't think I quite
realized how deep it was.

293
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,640
But then there was a particular episode
in Christmas of Oh nine when he came up

294
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,100
and in a sort of serious way,

295
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:35,220
he has a serious careful way. He said, I,

296
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,890
I have conceived a deep love for you.

297
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:42,190
I have conceived a deep
love for you. Yeah. Um,

298
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,660
there is a trait that's like, got
a few extra words I have concealed.

299
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,770
Okay. Was He scared to
say I love you or um, no,

300
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,330
he likes the English language.

301
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:56,850
[inaudible]

302
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,510
I think it, I think it
couldn't have been put, um,

303
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,490
more cautiously and yet more strongly.

304
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,670
I think it was a beautiful
way of putting it.

305
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,920
And then I realized at that
moment with his saying that,

306
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,950
that I had conceived a deep love
for him and I am among other things.

307
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:20,370
I thought, good God, it's happened again.

308
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,163
Two

309
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,020
and I'm in my 77th year and um, and,

310
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,110
and what next

311
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,780
and the things, um,

312
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,440
basically have gone happily ever since

313
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,840
[inaudible]

314
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,000
and surprisingly look loosely. Um,

315
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,720
because then again, I'm
not dealing with, oh,

316
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:56,300
what I'm dealing with or who
I'm dealing with an individual.

317
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,300
I'm not dealing with a, um, uh,

318
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,470
a condition defined by medicine or law.

319
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,610
So Oliver's still doesn't know how much
time he has left. But for the moment,

320
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:15,390
as you can hear, his mind is
totally intact. He's still writing.

321
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:18,660
He has two books in addition to the one
you'll find in the lobby B that he's

322
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:20,220
writing. Then the children's book,

323
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,120
bunch of New Yorkers stories in the last
few months and in New York review of

324
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,250
books story, he's got energy to spare.

325
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:30,060
So I want to do one last thing before
we close and this comes from yet.

326
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,560
Another conversation I had with him,

327
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:35,810
and it's a story I know Oliver would hate
because he's not a capital r religious

328
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:36,630
kind of guy,

329
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,630
but he is somebody who definitely embraces
mystery and for a long time he's been

330
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:46,170
mystified by a color
called indigo, indigo,

331
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,340
which hadn't suited

332
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,660
between blue and violet and no,

333
00:20:51,661 --> 00:20:55,480
no two people seem to agree
as to what indigo was like.

334
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:00,700
And so I built up a sort
of chemical launchpad,

335
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,110
meaning he took a lot of

336
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,190
base of amphetamine from general a while,

337
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:09,700
so then some assets and a little cannabis,

338
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:14,460
and when I was sufficiently
stoned I said I want to see

339
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,690
the indigo now

340
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:20,970
[inaudible]

341
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,970
as if it were reply and does
it phone by giant paintbrush.

342
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,740
That appeared a huge trembling,

343
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:34,160
pear shaped blob of what I instantly
realized was pure indigo on the white wall

344
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,590
in front of me. It had had
a wonderful luminosity,

345
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,480
and in particular I am, although
I am not a religious person,

346
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,480
I thought this is the color of heaven.

347
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,530
And I lit towards it in a sort of ecstasy

348
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,830
and then suddenly disappeared. And he
says he had one more moment like that.

349
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:01,820
This time, no drugs. He was in a
museum staring at an Egyptian artifact.

350
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,360
He sees this re and color
back again just for a beat.

351
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,220
I was given five tantalizing
seconds of, of, of radiant,

352
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:11,080
ineffable

353
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,640
beauty. And then again, it vanished.

354
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:18,320
And that was in 1965 and
I've never seen indigo since.

355
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,000
But who knows? You know,

356
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:25,450
someday I like to think Dr Sachs
may get to see that color again.

357
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,733
