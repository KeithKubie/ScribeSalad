probably the most common argument

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759
probably the most common argument
 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.090
probably the most common argument
against what i was presenting in today's

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100
against what i was presenting in today's
 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.399
against what i was presenting in today's
table flip and that is that there's a

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409
table flip and that is that there's a
 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.020
table flip and that is that there's a
lot of user pressure or dissatisfaction

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030
lot of user pressure or dissatisfaction
 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.959
lot of user pressure or dissatisfaction
because users quote don't know how to

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969
because users quote don't know how to
 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.120
because users quote don't know how to
quit the program and I think I covered

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130
quit the program and I think I covered
 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.980
quit the program and I think I covered
sort of the argument against that pretty

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990
sort of the argument against that pretty
 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.599
sort of the argument against that pretty
well but let's be a little bit more

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609
well but let's be a little bit more
 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:00.760
well but let's be a little bit more
specific in two examples so in Jacobs

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770
specific in two examples so in Jacobs
 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.160
specific in two examples so in Jacobs
case he's talking about to internet

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170
case he's talking about to internet
 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.770

radio apps that he has built an in his

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780
radio apps that he has built an in his
 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.330
radio apps that he has built an in his
experience uses a failed to find the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340
experience uses a failed to find the
 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.779
experience uses a failed to find the
stop button to stop the music now he's

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789
stop button to stop the music now he's
 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.070
stop button to stop the music now he's
pointed out that in his particular use

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080
pointed out that in his particular use
 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.690
pointed out that in his particular use
case he's not allowed to make the stop

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700
case he's not allowed to make the stop
 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.370
case he's not allowed to make the stop
button more prominent and so this is a

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380
button more prominent and so this is a
 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.830
button more prominent and so this is a
genuine problem so what I would say is

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840
genuine problem so what I would say is
 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.690
genuine problem so what I would say is
have a look at the way that Google Music

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700
have a look at the way that Google Music
 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.030
have a look at the way that Google Music
actually solves this and so really it's

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040
actually solves this and so really it's
 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.460
actually solves this and so really it's
about making sure that stop stopping the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
about making sure that stop stopping the
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.020
about making sure that stop stopping the
music stopping the resource consumption

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030
music stopping the resource consumption
 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.930
music stopping the resource consumption
is really really easy to

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
is really really easy to
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.240
is really really easy to
mind so Google Music does this by having

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250
mind so Google Music does this by having
 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.490
mind so Google Music does this by having
the stop controls along the bottom of

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500
the stop controls along the bottom of
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.680
the stop controls along the bottom of
every activity whenever the act is

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690
every activity whenever the act is
 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.590
every activity whenever the act is
running or if the app isn't running but

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600
running or if the app isn't running but
 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.330
running or if the app isn't running but
the music is playing then there's an

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340
the music is playing then there's an
 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.280
the music is playing then there's an
ongoing notification which has rich

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290
ongoing notification which has rich
 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.960
ongoing notification which has rich
notifications as well which again allows

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970
notifications as well which again allows
 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.630
notifications as well which again allows
you to stop the music and in addition to

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640
you to stop the music and in addition to
 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.820
you to stop the music and in addition to
that there's also the lock screen which

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830
that there's also the lock screen which
 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.230
that there's also the lock screen which
you can then configure in which Google

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240
you can then configure in which Google
 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.660
you can then configure in which Google
music does to allow you to stop playback

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670
music does to allow you to stop playback
 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.730
music does to allow you to stop playback
as well and so the solution here

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740
as well and so the solution here
 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.560
as well and so the solution here
particularly for music playing apps is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570
particularly for music playing apps is
 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.270
particularly for music playing apps is
that all of those things I've just

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280
that all of those things I've just
 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.950
that all of those things I've just
described a totally available to any

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960
described a totally available to any
 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.710
described a totally available to any
third party app and so by doing things

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720
third party app and so by doing things
 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.390
third party app and so by doing things
like this it makes it really really easy

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400
like this it makes it really really easy
 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.040
like this it makes it really really easy
even if the stop button doesn't have to

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050
even if the stop button doesn't have to
 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.690
even if the stop button doesn't have to
be half the screen it's just everywhere

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
be half the screen it's just everywhere
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.820
be half the screen it's just everywhere
they look there's a really obvious place

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830
they look there's a really obvious place
 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.200
they look there's a really obvious place
to find it and that's going to be much

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210
to find it and that's going to be much
 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.030
to find it and that's going to be much
more reliable than having an exit button

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040
more reliable than having an exit button
 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.710
more reliable than having an exit button
which a lot of users aren't going to

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720
which a lot of users aren't going to
 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.000
which a lot of users aren't going to
find anyway user demands for an exit

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010
find anyway user demands for an exit
 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.680
find anyway user demands for an exit
button almost always correlate to an app

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690
button almost always correlate to an app
 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.270
button almost always correlate to an app
that has confusing navigation or

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280
that has confusing navigation or
 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.980
that has confusing navigation or
hard-to-find controls or as a resource

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990
hard-to-find controls or as a resource
 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.020
hard-to-find controls or as a resource
hog so adding an exit button is going to

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030
hog so adding an exit button is going to
 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.420
hog so adding an exit button is going to
stop users from asking you to add an

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430
stop users from asking you to add an
 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.600
stop users from asking you to add an
exit button but it's it's kind of like

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610
exit button but it's it's kind of like
 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.250
exit button but it's it's kind of like
giving an aspirin to a place patient

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260
giving an aspirin to a place patient
 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.590
giving an aspirin to a place patient
complaining of chronic abdominal pains

computer so those sorts of features

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180
computer so those sorts of features
 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.759

and I was just good as if there are any

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300
and I was just good as if there are any
 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.379
and I was just good as if there are any
other options yeah I mean are there

people that think that the exit button
 

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.029
people that think that the exit button
makes any sense there are there are a

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039
makes any sense there are there are a
 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:22.010

surprisingly high number of people which
 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.409
surprisingly high number of people which
disagree with the basic premise I think

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419
disagree with the basic premise I think
 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.180

it's usually around users that seems to

it's usually around users that seems to
be the feedback I get from most

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419
be the feedback I get from most
 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.330
be the feedback I get from most
developers is that they're like yeah we

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340
developers is that they're like yeah we
 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.709
developers is that they're like yeah we
don't want to do it but I users keep

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719
don't want to do it but I users keep
 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:32.959
don't want to do it but I users keep
asking for them and so I think a big

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969
asking for them and so I think a big
 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:35.409
asking for them and so I think a big
part of it is is trying to explain

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419
part of it is is trying to explain
 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.879
part of it is is trying to explain
explain and a lot of the time what

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889
explain and a lot of the time what
 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.320
explain and a lot of the time what
they're saying is well that's fine but

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330
they're saying is well that's fine but
 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:40.969
they're saying is well that's fine but
you need to explain to users why they

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979
you need to explain to users why they
 

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:43.070
you need to explain to users why they
don't need an exit button but what I've

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080
don't need an exit button but what I've
 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.360
don't need an exit button but what I've
actually found is that it's easy to

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370
actually found is that it's easy to
 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.100
actually found is that it's easy to
explain to developers how to build apps

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110
explain to developers how to build apps
 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.839
explain to developers how to build apps
that people aren't asking for those exit

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849
that people aren't asking for those exit
 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:49.670
that people aren't asking for those exit
buttons because that kind of tends to be

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680
buttons because that kind of tends to be
 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.899

didn't want to do it but people kept
asking for it so I had to build it in so

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289
asking for it so I had to build it in so
 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:56.959
asking for it so I had to build it in so
it's really about trying to explain to

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:56.969
it's really about trying to explain to
 

00:06:56.969 --> 00:06:59.059
it's really about trying to explain to
devs how you can build apps which don't

00:06:59.059 --> 00:06:59.069
devs how you can build apps which don't
 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:05.330
devs how you can build apps which don't
have people asking this question if they

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340
have people asking this question if they
 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.980
have people asking this question if they
if the client does ask for it it seems

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:09.990
if the client does ask for it it seems
 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.170
if the client does ask for it it seems
right they're paying for it they get it

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180
right they're paying for it they get it
 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.719
right they're paying for it they get it
absolutely no of course that's I guess

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729
absolutely no of course that's I guess
 

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:17.119
absolutely no of course that's I guess
that's the other the other case which I

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:17.129
that's the other the other case which I
 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:19.129
that's the other the other case which I
haven't really talked much about is what

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:19.139
haven't really talked much about is what
 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:20.480
haven't really talked much about is what
happens when you're building an app for

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490
happens when you're building an app for
 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.279

client says but really it's about trying

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639
client says but really it's about trying
 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:28.710

in those life cycles yeah i think the

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:18.350
in those life cycles yeah i think the
 

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.960
in those life cycles yeah i think the
life cycle stuff it's kind of the most

something so now I always think that's
 

00:09:43.199 --> 00:09:45.050
something so now I always think that's
kind of a big challenge once you really

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060
kind of a big challenge once you really
 

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.179
kind of a big challenge once you really
get the the lifecycle stuff in your head

00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:47.189

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:18.660
an exit button when a reality you really
 

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.900
an exit button when a reality you really
don't need one um so you definitely not

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:20.910
don't need one um so you definitely not
 

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.819
don't need one um so you definitely not
you know crazy I see where you're coming

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:22.829
you know crazy I see where you're coming
 

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:24.470
you know crazy I see where you're coming

let's put them on this is Dave hey Dave
 

00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:43.100
let's put them on this is Dave hey Dave
go ahead and you're like yeah I just

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.110
go ahead and you're like yeah I just
 

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.350
go ahead and you're like yeah I just
want a quick comment about what the

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360
want a quick comment about what the
 

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.650
want a quick comment about what the
previous speaker said I think you know

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660
previous speaker said I think you know
 

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.509
previous speaker said I think you know
it's going to take a little while for

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519
it's going to take a little while for
 

00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:52.759
it's going to take a little while for
people to get used to that I think we're

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:52.769
people to get used to that I think we're
 

00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:56.749
people to get used to that I think we're
so even a few years ago or a couple

00:10:56.749 --> 00:10:56.759
so even a few years ago or a couple
 

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:58.129
so even a few years ago or a couple
years ago maybe with a vesture or

00:10:58.129 --> 00:10:58.139
years ago maybe with a vesture or
 

00:10:58.139 --> 00:10:59.960
years ago maybe with a vesture or
something like that we're so used to

00:10:59.960 --> 00:10:59.970
something like that we're so used to
 

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.929
something like that we're so used to
closing down stuff and making sure Ram

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:02.939
closing down stuff and making sure Ram
 

00:11:02.939 --> 00:11:04.999
closing down stuff and making sure Ram
is available in all that's enough that

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:05.009
is available in all that's enough that
 

00:11:05.009 --> 00:11:07.730
is available in all that's enough that
we need to really get used to knowing

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740
we need to really get used to knowing
 

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.549
we need to really get used to knowing
that if an app is done properly sitting

00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:10.559
that if an app is done properly sitting
 

00:11:10.559 --> 00:11:12.110
that if an app is done properly sitting
in the background not consuming

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120
in the background not consuming
 

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.150
in the background not consuming
resources not pinging the server and so

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160
resources not pinging the server and so
 

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.920
resources not pinging the server and so
on and so forth that's I think that's

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:15.930
on and so forth that's I think that's
 

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:16.970
on and so forth that's I think that's
really going to take a couple of years

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:16.980
really going to take a couple of years
 

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.879
really going to take a couple of years
before people understand and are aware

00:11:19.879 --> 00:11:19.889
before people understand and are aware
 

00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:21.619
before people understand and are aware
of that and are comfortable just leaving

00:11:21.619 --> 00:11:21.629
of that and are comfortable just leaving
 

00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:23.660
of that and are comfortable just leaving
apps open you know just by hitting the

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:23.670
apps open you know just by hitting the
 

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.889
apps open you know just by hitting the
back button and back to the home screen

00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:24.899
back button and back to the home screen
 

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:27.199
back button and back to the home screen
so oh absolutely I think there's a big

00:11:27.199 --> 00:11:27.209
so oh absolutely I think there's a big
 

00:11:27.209 --> 00:11:28.790
so oh absolutely I think there's a big
challenge there for us as developers as

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800
challenge there for us as developers as
 

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.129
challenge there for us as developers as
well it's making sure that the users

00:11:31.129 --> 00:11:31.139
well it's making sure that the users
 

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:32.840
well it's making sure that the users
feel really comfortable doing that in it

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:32.850
feel really comfortable doing that in it
 

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.220
feel really comfortable doing that in it
I mean this this is the thing if you

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:34.230
I mean this this is the thing if you
 

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.389
I mean this this is the thing if you
have a whole bunch of apps and then you

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399
have a whole bunch of apps and then you
 

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:36.740
have a whole bunch of apps and then you
go back to the home screen and your

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:36.750
go back to the home screen and your
 

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.749
go back to the home screen and your
device starts running real slow that's

00:11:38.749 --> 00:11:38.759
device starts running real slow that's
 

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:40.249
device starts running real slow that's
that's a terrible experience you know

00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:40.259
that's a terrible experience you know
 

00:11:40.259 --> 00:11:41.720
that's a terrible experience you know
it's no wonder it uses the thing and

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:41.730
it's no wonder it uses the thing and
 

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:42.949
it's no wonder it uses the thing and
it'd be like I just want to know how to

00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959
it'd be like I just want to know how to
 

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:45.650
it'd be like I just want to know how to
exit all of these arts and so I think

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660
exit all of these arts and so I think
 

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.780
exit all of these arts and so I think
the framework team

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:46.790
the framework team
 

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.090
the framework team
here at Google done a lot of work in

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.100
here at Google done a lot of work in
 

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.580
here at Google done a lot of work in
that direction to try and make the blame

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:51.590
that direction to try and make the blame
 

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.530
that direction to try and make the blame
more visible so things like battery

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:53.540
more visible so things like battery
 

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.240
more visible so things like battery
drain and those sorts of things you can

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.250
drain and those sorts of things you can
 

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.910
drain and those sorts of things you can
see which apps are doing it and so the

00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920
see which apps are doing it and so the
 

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.500
see which apps are doing it and so the
blame goes to them rather than to the

00:11:59.500 --> 00:11:59.510
blame goes to them rather than to the
 

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.670
blame goes to them rather than to the
system and if you're doing these things

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680
system and if you're doing these things
 

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.620
system and if you're doing these things
right if you're suspending all of your

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:02.630
right if you're suspending all of your
 

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.240
right if you're suspending all of your
listeners turning off your updates not

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.250
listeners turning off your updates not
 

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.890
listeners turning off your updates not
doing background brief brushes or any of

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:05.900
doing background brief brushes or any of
 

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.100
doing background brief brushes or any of
that stuff then your app will never get

00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.110
that stuff then your app will never get
 

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.180
that stuff then your app will never get
blamed for anything and no one's ever

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.190
blamed for anything and no one's ever
 

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.370
blamed for anything and no one's ever
going to you know call into question as

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:12.380
going to you know call into question as
 

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.960
going to you know call into question as
to how can i how can I get rid of this

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:13.970
to how can i how can I get rid of this
 

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.760
to how can i how can I get rid of this
because it's just there and it just

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:15.770
because it's just there and it just
 

00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:18.370
because it's just there and it just
works but yeah I think that's the

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:18.380
works but yeah I think that's the
 

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:19.390
works but yeah I think that's the
challenge and you're going to reach that

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:19.400
challenge and you're going to reach that
 

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.040
challenge and you're going to reach that
critical mass where most apps are doing

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.050
critical mass where most apps are doing
 

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.240
critical mass where most apps are doing
the right thing and then users are going

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:22.250
the right thing and then users are going
 

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.090
the right thing and then users are going
to be like why would I exit it that just

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:25.100
to be like why would I exit it that just
 

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.700
to be like why would I exit it that just
just going to slow stuff down mm-hmm

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:29.710
 
 

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:35.280
 
cool um so

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:35.290

actually just starting to start you know
 

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.300
actually just starting to start you know

are there any resources that you can
 

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.400
are there any resources that you can
actually provide or that Google provides

actually provide or that Google provides
 

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.340
actually provide or that Google provides
about learning more about the life cycle

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:01.350
about learning more about the life cycle
 

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.530
about learning more about the life cycle
absolutely so I posted a link so links

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:04.540
absolutely so I posted a link so links
 

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.210
absolutely so I posted a link so links
to all of those stuff that i showed in

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:06.220
to all of those stuff that i showed in
 

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.910
to all of those stuff that i showed in
the sort of the intro video there on the

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:08.920
the sort of the intro video there on the
 

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.259
the sort of the intro video there on the
youtube site a person it should be

00:13:10.259 --> 00:13:10.269
youtube site a person it should be
 

00:13:10.269 --> 00:13:13.110
youtube site a person it should be
possible as well but to answer your

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120
possible as well but to answer your
 

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.930
possible as well but to answer your
question more specifically if you go to

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940
question more specifically if you go to
 

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.360
question more specifically if you go to
developer.android.com / training we have

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:18.370
developer.android.com / training we have
 

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.519
developer.android.com / training we have
a bunch of sort of intro level classes

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:20.529
a bunch of sort of intro level classes
 

00:13:20.529 --> 00:13:23.340
a bunch of sort of intro level classes
to help really sort of explain the basic

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:23.350
to help really sort of explain the basic
 

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.870
to help really sort of explain the basic
building blocks of android and I think

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880
building blocks of android and I think
 

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.449
building blocks of android and I think
the life cycle stuff is lesson one it's

00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:27.459
the life cycle stuff is lesson one it's
 

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:29.069
the life cycle stuff is lesson one it's
kind of that fundamental so if you want

00:13:29.069 --> 00:13:29.079
kind of that fundamental so if you want
 

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:30.389
kind of that fundamental so if you want
to sort of get a better understanding of

00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399
to sort of get a better understanding of
 

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:32.490
to sort of get a better understanding of
what it means how does it work what's

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:32.500
what it means how does it work what's
 

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:33.870
what it means how does it work what's
the right way of dealing with it then

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880
the right way of dealing with it then
 

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.189
the right way of dealing with it then
yeah definitely check that out and that

00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199
yeah definitely check that out and that
 

00:13:35.199 --> 00:13:38.790
yeah definitely check that out and that
should help you get started thank you no

um basically what i wanted to refer to

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.170
um basically what i wanted to refer to
 

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:56.510
um basically what i wanted to refer to
was the exit button in our app we used

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:56.520
was the exit button in our app we used
 

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.850
was the exit button in our app we used
we who is a video social communication

chat and i am messaging and so on and
 

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.200
chat and i am messaging and so on and
basically we have users and wanting to

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.210
basically we have users and wanting to
 

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.580
basically we have users and wanting to
exit the application in fully not just

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:13.590
exit the application in fully not just
 

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.920
exit the application in fully not just
doing a sign out and leaving the service

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:15.930
doing a sign out and leaving the service
 

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.140
doing a sign out and leaving the service
and running or something like that or

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.150
and running or something like that or
 

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.350
and running or something like that or
killing the basically they want to exit

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360
killing the basically they want to exit
 

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.890
killing the basically they want to exit
the application so our service will die

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:24.900
the application so our service will die
 

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.870
the application so our service will die
at the same point day one so i'm

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880
at the same point day one so i'm
 

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.780
at the same point day one so i'm
referring to it as a bad pattern because

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:32.790
referring to it as a bad pattern because
 

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:37.910
referring to it as a bad pattern because
that's more like a single task device

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920
that's more like a single task device
 

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.540
that's more like a single task device
and not the hand root system but

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:40.550
and not the hand root system but
 

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.480
and not the hand root system but
basically if we need to implement such a

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:44.490
basically if we need to implement such a
 

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.560
basically if we need to implement such a
behavior then the exit button should be

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:48.570
behavior then the exit button should be
 

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.920
behavior then the exit button should be
a part of the android pal although the

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:51.930
a part of the android pal although the
 

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.310
a part of the android pal although the
android system is killing tasks by

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320
android system is killing tasks by
 

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.770
android system is killing tasks by
itself i think the the challenge in a

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:57.780
itself i think the the challenge in a
 

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:00.080
itself i think the the challenge in a
situation like that is sort of similar

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:00.090
situation like that is sort of similar
 

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.190
situation like that is sort of similar
to all you're going to see things like

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:01.200
to all you're going to see things like
 

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.770
to all you're going to see things like
google talk or any any ongoing messaging

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:03.780
google talk or any any ongoing messaging
 

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.710
google talk or any any ongoing messaging
thing where you want the user wants the

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720
thing where you want the user wants the
 

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.810
thing where you want the user wants the
ability to basically say disconnect from

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820
ability to basically say disconnect from
 

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.850
ability to basically say disconnect from
your server and stop consuming

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860
your server and stop consuming
 

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.360
your server and stop consuming
everything so in that case a combination

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:14.370
everything so in that case a combination
 

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:16.220
everything so in that case a combination
of sort of hitting log out or sign out

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:16.230
of sort of hitting log out or sign out
 

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.590
of sort of hitting log out or sign out
from the service and then and listening

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600
from the service and then and listening
 

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.140
from the service and then and listening
for on pause should be enough so the

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.150
for on pause should be enough so the
 

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.970
for on pause should be enough so the
once once they say disconnect that

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980
once once they say disconnect that
 

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.830
once once they say disconnect that
should be the equivalent of hitting exit

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:24.840
should be the equivalent of hitting exit
 

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.070
should be the equivalent of hitting exit
basically yeah that's that's what that's

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:28.080
basically yeah that's that's what that's
 

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.080
basically yeah that's that's what that's
what we implemented we have both

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.090
what we implemented we have both
 

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:33.260
what we implemented we have both
features we have the feature sign out so

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:33.270
features we have the feature sign out so
 

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.410
features we have the feature sign out so
we'll

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:34.420
we'll
 

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.740
we'll
show the user the home screen to login

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:38.750
show the user the home screen to login
 

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.190
show the user the home screen to login
via Facebook or his username and

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:42.200
via Facebook or his username and
 

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.010
via Facebook or his username and
password and we also have the exit

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:45.020
password and we also have the exit
 

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.530
password and we also have the exit
button that keeps the load the user

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:47.540
button that keeps the load the user
 

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.050
button that keeps the load the user
logged into the system but basically

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:50.060
logged into the system but basically
 

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:52.570
logged into the system but basically
exit all the applications and kills the

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:52.580
exit all the applications and kills the
 

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.880
exit all the applications and kills the
service another thing and then all

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:54.890
service another thing and then all
 

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.510
service another thing and then all
messaging or notifications comes GCM

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:58.520
messaging or notifications comes GCM
 

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.230
messaging or notifications comes GCM
word c2dm to all those devices so that's

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240
word c2dm to all those devices so that's
 

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.690
word c2dm to all those devices so that's
it then actually that brings up a really

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:04.700
it then actually that brings up a really
 

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.920
it then actually that brings up a really
good point in kind of what I was

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:05.930
good point in kind of what I was
 

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.199
good point in kind of what I was
alluding to earlier like if you hadn't

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:08.209
alluding to earlier like if you hadn't
 

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:09.550
alluding to earlier like if you hadn't
told me that if i just opened your

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:09.560
told me that if i just opened your
 

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.650
told me that if i just opened your
apples will walk out and exit as two

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:11.660
apples will walk out and exit as two
 

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.870
apples will walk out and exit as two
separate options i would have no idea

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880
separate options i would have no idea
 

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.670
separate options i would have no idea
what the exit button would do i

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:15.680
what the exit button would do i
 

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.560
what the exit button would do i
certainly wouldn't expect that if i hit

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:17.570
certainly wouldn't expect that if i hit
 

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:19.780
certainly wouldn't expect that if i hit
exit that i still get messages from GCM

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:19.790
exit that i still get messages from GCM
 

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:22.090
exit that i still get messages from GCM
i would expect it if you hit exit

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:22.100
i would expect it if you hit exit
 

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.160
i would expect it if you hit exit
everything turns off so i log out and i

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.170
everything turns off so i log out and i
 

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:25.990
everything turns off so i log out and i
stopped getting messages and I think

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000
stopped getting messages and I think
 

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.100
stopped getting messages and I think
that's the challenge right if you

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.110
that's the challenge right if you
 

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:28.810
that's the challenge right if you
introduce something like exit which

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:28.820
introduce something like exit which
 

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.610
introduce something like exit which
doesn't have a clear semantic meaning

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:30.620
doesn't have a clear semantic meaning
 

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.710
doesn't have a clear semantic meaning
then different users are going to open

00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720
then different users are going to open
 

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.310
then different users are going to open
it in different ways and so like logout

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320
it in different ways and so like logout
 

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.990
it in different ways and so like logout
totally makes sense disconnect me from

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000
totally makes sense disconnect me from
 

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.520
totally makes sense disconnect me from
your services I don't want to get any

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:39.530
your services I don't want to get any
 

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.790
your services I don't want to get any
more messages 100% makes sense exit it

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:42.800
more messages 100% makes sense exit it
 

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.170
more messages 100% makes sense exit it
doesn't like basically what you're

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:44.180
doesn't like basically what you're
 

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.970
doesn't like basically what you're
describing what the exit button does

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:45.980
describing what the exit button does
 

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.710
describing what the exit button does
sounds to me like what should happen

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720
sounds to me like what should happen
 

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.200
sounds to me like what should happen
when I hit back or home from within your

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:50.210
when I hit back or home from within your
 

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:52.870
when I hit back or home from within your
app yeah yeah that's what that's what

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880
app yeah yeah that's what that's what
 

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.990
app yeah yeah that's what that's what
I'm saying but because we're we're doing

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000
I'm saying but because we're we're doing
 

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.990
I'm saying but because we're we're doing
cross-platform so we we want our users

00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000
cross-platform so we we want our users
 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.590
cross-platform so we we want our users
to know that the device or application

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:02.600
to know that the device or application
 

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.470
to know that the device or application
handles the same situations all over the

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:05.480
handles the same situations all over the
 

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.780
handles the same situations all over the
platforms so basically if you have an

00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:07.790
platforms so basically if you have an
 

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.000
platforms so basically if you have an
exit button on iphone or you have an

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.010
exit button on iphone or you have an
 

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.700
exit button on iphone or you have an
exit button on Windows or on windows

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:12.710
exit button on Windows or on windows
 

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.090
exit button on Windows or on windows
phone tablets and so on or even are

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:16.100
phone tablets and so on or even are
 

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.760
phone tablets and so on or even are
given on Matthew press and command qu

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:18.770
given on Matthew press and command qu
 

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.530
given on Matthew press and command qu
you exit the app and on Android the

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:22.540
you exit the app and on Android the
 

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.270
you exit the app and on Android the
ecosystem is just hit the home button

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280
ecosystem is just hit the home button
 

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.360
ecosystem is just hit the home button
and let Android deal with all the memory

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:28.370
and let Android deal with all the memory
 

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:32.400
and let Android deal with all the memory
and all the task on going and so on so

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:32.410
and all the task on going and so on so
 

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.710
and all the task on going and so on so
how what is the best

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720
how what is the best
 

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.330
how what is the best
option to handle the situation for us

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340
option to handle the situation for us
 

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:46.280
option to handle the situation for us
and also give the user the same

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:46.290
and also give the user the same
 

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.910
and also give the user the same
atmosphere the same experience when

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:50.920
atmosphere the same experience when
 

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.760
atmosphere the same experience when
moving from device to device is

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:53.770
moving from device to device is
 

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.700
moving from device to device is
basically the user can connect from an

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:56.710
basically the user can connect from an
 

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:02.070
basically the user can connect from an
ipod and I an iphone and ipad Nexus 7

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080
ipod and I an iphone and ipad Nexus 7
 

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:06.180
ipod and I an iphone and ipad Nexus 7
Nexus 10 a Google TV you name the device

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:06.190
Nexus 10 a Google TV you name the device
 

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:09.330
Nexus 10 a Google TV you name the device
we have so basically we want the user to

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:09.340
we have so basically we want the user to
 

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:12.210
we have so basically we want the user to
know that Ovoo connects people all over

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:12.220
know that Ovoo connects people all over
 

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.850
know that Ovoo connects people all over
the world no matter what the same same

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860
the world no matter what the same same
 

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.470
the world no matter what the same same
experience the same features are

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.480
experience the same features are
 

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.909
experience the same features are
available on all devices so that's the

00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919
available on all devices so that's the
 

00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:26.490
available on all devices so that's the
main issue here so yeah no that's okay

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:26.500
main issue here so yeah no that's okay
 

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.380
main issue here so yeah no that's okay
so that's a good question and it's it's

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:28.390
so that's a good question and it's it's
 

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.480
so that's a good question and it's it's
actually an interesting one because I

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:30.490
actually an interesting one because I
 

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.909
actually an interesting one because I
sort of hear this a lot from from

00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919
sort of hear this a lot from from
 

00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:34.200
sort of hear this a lot from from
developers who are building sort of

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.210
developers who are building sort of
 

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:36.810
developers who are building sort of
these cross platforms where they want to

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:36.820
these cross platforms where they want to
 

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:38.400
these cross platforms where they want to
have something really consistent across

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:38.410
have something really consistent across
 

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.830
have something really consistent across
all of the different devices now the

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:40.840
all of the different devices now the
 

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.780
all of the different devices now the
thing is is sort of two different ways

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:42.790
thing is is sort of two different ways
 

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.190
thing is is sort of two different ways
that I would approach this and the first

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200
that I would approach this and the first
 

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.740
that I would approach this and the first
is that it was actually fairly unlikely

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:46.750
is that it was actually fairly unlikely
 

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.510
is that it was actually fairly unlikely
that you're going to have a significant

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520
that you're going to have a significant
 

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:51.060
that you're going to have a significant
number of users which have multiple

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:51.070
number of users which have multiple
 

00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:53.750
number of users which have multiple
different devices from the manufacturer

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760
different devices from the manufacturer
 

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.039
different devices from the manufacturer
so you know you're not going to have a

00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:56.049
so you know you're not going to have a
 

00:19:56.049 --> 00:19:58.799
so you know you're not going to have a
lot of people which having a red phone

00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:58.809
lot of people which having a red phone
 

00:19:58.809 --> 00:20:02.220
lot of people which having a red phone
yes there will be some that but and this

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:02.230
yes there will be some that but and this
 

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.690
yes there will be some that but and this
leads me to my second point which is

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:03.700
leads me to my second point which is
 

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.270
leads me to my second point which is
that people expect their devices to

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280
that people expect their devices to
 

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.280
that people expect their devices to
behave consider those it necessarily

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:08.290
behave consider those it necessarily
 

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.110
behave consider those it necessarily
affect maps to work exactly the same

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120
affect maps to work exactly the same
 

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.600
affect maps to work exactly the same
across different devices so if I've got

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:12.610
across different devices so if I've got
 

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.120
across different devices so if I've got
an iPad then I expect all of the apps to

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:15.130
an iPad then I expect all of the apps to
 

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:16.680
an iPad then I expect all of the apps to
work in a way that's consistent with the

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:16.690
work in a way that's consistent with the
 

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.659
work in a way that's consistent with the
way all of the other ipad apps work and

00:20:18.659 --> 00:20:18.669
way all of the other ipad apps work and
 

00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:20.460
way all of the other ipad apps work and
if I had android than I expect them to

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:20.470
if I had android than I expect them to
 

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.990
if I had android than I expect them to
all work with Android so what you don't

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000
all work with Android so what you don't
 

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.980
all work with Android so what you don't
have is an iphone user expecting their

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:25.990
have is an iphone user expecting their
 

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.230
have is an iphone user expecting their
android phone to work in the same way as

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240
android phone to work in the same way as
 

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.240
android phone to work in the same way as
their iphone because it's a different

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:30.250
their iphone because it's a different
 

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.860
their iphone because it's a different
device right there they're not they

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:31.870
device right there they're not they
 

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.810
device right there they're not they
don't have the same expectations if they

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:33.820
don't have the same expectations if they
 

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.850
don't have the same expectations if they
did they get really confused when they

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:35.860
did they get really confused when they
 

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.650
did they get really confused when they
started using things like mail and maps

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:37.660
started using things like mail and maps
 

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:40.140
started using things like mail and maps
and and music and Twitter and everything

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:40.150
and and music and Twitter and everything
 

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.430
and and music and Twitter and everything
else because they just inherently

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:41.440
else because they just inherently
 

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.100
else because they just inherently
behaved if

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:42.110
behaved if
 

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:43.630
behaved if
and it's the same with computers you

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:43.640
and it's the same with computers you
 

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.340
and it's the same with computers you
know you expect your computer to work in

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:45.350
know you expect your computer to work in
 

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.039
know you expect your computer to work in
a certain way you expect to have that

00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:47.049
a certain way you expect to have that
 

00:20:47.049 --> 00:20:50.980
a certain way you expect to have that
command queue to get out of a nap in Mac

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:50.990
command queue to get out of a nap in Mac
 

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:52.510
command queue to get out of a nap in Mac
if you've got windows you expect to be

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:52.520
if you've got windows you expect to be
 

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.210
if you've got windows you expect to be
able to hit alt f4 but you know what

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:55.220
able to hit alt f4 but you know what
 

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.549
able to hit alt f4 but you know what
you're not expecting is you know a good

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:57.559
you're not expecting is you know a good
 

00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:59.140
you're not expecting is you know a good
example is if you're building an app for

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.150
example is if you're building an app for
 

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.350
example is if you're building an app for
both windows and mac you're not going to

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360
both windows and mac you're not going to
 

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.990
both windows and mac you're not going to
build the command q shortcut into the

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000
build the command q shortcut into the
 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.390
build the command q shortcut into the
windows app so the people who are you

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400
windows app so the people who are you
 

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.830
windows app so the people who are you
know using it on Mac understand how to

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840
know using it on Mac understand how to
 

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.289
know using it on Mac understand how to
quit you're going to build in the same

00:21:11.289 --> 00:21:11.299
quit you're going to build in the same
 

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:12.580
quit you're going to build in the same
sort of user patterns that they're

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:12.590
sort of user patterns that they're
 

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.590
sort of user patterns that they're
expecting for windows and it's the same

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600
expecting for windows and it's the same
 

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.840
expecting for windows and it's the same
across mobile like I wouldn't tell you

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:16.850
across mobile like I wouldn't tell you
 

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.270
across mobile like I wouldn't tell you
to build your iPhone app so that they

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280
to build your iPhone app so that they
 

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.740
to build your iPhone app so that they
work and look the same as your Android

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:20.750
work and look the same as your Android
 

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.049
work and look the same as your Android
apps you want we want to have a

00:21:23.049 --> 00:21:23.059
apps you want we want to have a
 

00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:24.520
apps you want we want to have a
consistent experience between the

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:24.530
consistent experience between the
 

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:25.780
consistent experience between the
platform because that's what they're

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:25.790
platform because that's what they're
 

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.200
platform because that's what they're
doing within a given context so you know

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.210
doing within a given context so you know
 

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.510
doing within a given context so you know
for your app in particular what you want

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520
for your app in particular what you want
 

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.100
for your app in particular what you want
to do what your users is going to expect

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.110
to do what your users is going to expect
 

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.230
to do what your users is going to expect
is that if you're signed in but your app

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:35.240
is that if you're signed in but your app
 

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.789
is that if you're signed in but your app
is not in the foreground then it

00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799
is not in the foreground then it
 

00:21:36.799 --> 00:21:38.500
is not in the foreground then it
shouldn't be consuming any resources and

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:38.510
shouldn't be consuming any resources and
 

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:39.760
shouldn't be consuming any resources and
that's just going to be their

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:54.650
they're going to be happy you know
 

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.110
they're going to be happy you know
they're not going to be looking for

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120
they're not going to be looking for
 

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.580
they're not going to be looking for
something if there's no reason to look

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:57.590
something if there's no reason to look
 

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.650
something if there's no reason to look
for it so that would be my big piece of

00:21:59.650 --> 00:21:59.660
for it so that would be my big piece of

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:02.900
devices don't try to over simplify
 

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.230
devices don't try to over simplify
across devices because that in my

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240
across devices because that in my
 

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.270
across devices because that in my
experience it tends to be what what

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280

bosses what CEOs do because they look at
 

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.960
bosses what CEOs do because they look at
all of your apps across all of the

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:10.970
all of your apps across all of the
 

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:12.730
all of your apps across all of the
different phones in yeah that's that's

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:12.740
different phones in yeah that's that's
 

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:15.909
different phones in yeah that's that's
our issue here because the designers are

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919
our issue here because the designers are
 

00:22:15.919 --> 00:22:19.510
our issue here because the designers are
ours our product guys basically want the

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520
ours our product guys basically want the
 

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.590
ours our product guys basically want the
same features to be on all devices and

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600
same features to be on all devices and
 

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.080
same features to be on all devices and
my main concern or my main issue as an

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.090
my main concern or my main issue as an
 

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.000
my main concern or my main issue as an
Android developer is to show them that

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.010
Android developer is to show them that
 

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.120
Android developer is to show them that
the Android system is not the same as

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:31.130
the Android system is not the same as
 

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:34.120
the Android system is not the same as
the iOS system or is not the same so you

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:34.130
the iOS system or is not the same so you
 

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:36.400
the iOS system or is not the same so you
have the basic conventions in android

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:36.410
have the basic conventions in android
 

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:40.150
have the basic conventions in android
such as the HOME key or the not showing

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:40.160
such as the HOME key or the not showing
 

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.299
such as the HOME key or the not showing
the exit option I'm with you I agree

00:22:43.299 --> 00:22:43.309
the exit option I'm with you I agree
 

00:22:43.309 --> 00:22:45.310
the exit option I'm with you I agree
that you don't need an exit button on

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320
that you don't need an exit button on
 

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.650
that you don't need an exit button on
your application but basically I want

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:47.660
your application but basically I want
 

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.779
your application but basically I want
you to say so I can have a verdict

00:22:51.779 --> 00:22:51.789
you to say so I can have a verdict
 

00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:54.810
you to say so I can have a verdict
a judge overruled England on the matter

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:54.820
a judge overruled England on the matter
 

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:58.249
a judge overruled England on the matter
so I can show it to our designers and

00:22:58.249 --> 00:22:58.259
so I can show it to our designers and
 

00:22:58.259 --> 00:23:01.229
so I can show it to our designers and
let them know that basically what

00:23:01.229 --> 00:23:01.239
let them know that basically what
 

00:23:01.239 --> 00:23:04.950
let them know that basically what
they're doing is not is not native to

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960
they're doing is not is not native to
 

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.930
they're doing is not is not native to
android sure and that's and that's the

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:06.940
android sure and that's and that's the
 

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:07.950
android sure and that's and that's the
sort of thing which we're trying to do a

00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960
sort of thing which we're trying to do a
 

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.450
sort of thing which we're trying to do a
lot more of these days I think the thing

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:09.460
lot more of these days I think the thing
 

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:10.799
lot more of these days I think the thing
about android particular when we got

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:10.809
about android particular when we got
 

00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:13.229
about android particular when we got
started is that it's like it's open you

00:23:13.229 --> 00:23:13.239
started is that it's like it's open you
 

00:23:13.239 --> 00:23:15.840
started is that it's like it's open you
can do anything but now we're trying to

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:15.850
can do anything but now we're trying to
 

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.369
can do anything but now we're trying to
get to the point where it's like you can

00:23:17.369 --> 00:23:17.379
get to the point where it's like you can
 

00:23:17.379 --> 00:23:19.739
get to the point where it's like you can
do anything but we'd really like people

00:23:19.739 --> 00:23:19.749
do anything but we'd really like people
 

00:23:19.749 --> 00:23:22.109
do anything but we'd really like people
to do things in a consistent way to make

00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:22.119
to do things in a consistent way to make
 

00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:23.519
to do things in a consistent way to make
it easier for users and so we're trying

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:23.529
it easier for users and so we're trying
 

00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:24.719
it easier for users and so we're trying
to become a little bit more aggressive

00:23:24.719 --> 00:23:24.729
to become a little bit more aggressive
 

00:23:24.729 --> 00:23:26.820
to become a little bit more aggressive
about telling people what what are the

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:26.830
about telling people what what are the
 

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.979
about telling people what what are the
best practices you don't have to follow

00:23:28.979 --> 00:23:28.989
best practices you don't have to follow
 

00:23:28.989 --> 00:23:30.539
best practices you don't have to follow
them no one's going to take your app out

00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:30.549
them no one's going to take your app out
 

00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:31.769
them no one's going to take your app out
of google play if you do things

00:23:31.769 --> 00:23:31.779
of google play if you do things
 

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:34.049
of google play if you do things
differently but at least something you

00:23:34.049 --> 00:23:34.059
differently but at least something you
 

00:23:34.059 --> 00:23:35.909
differently but at least something you
can show your design team and your your

00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919
can show your design team and your your
 

00:23:35.919 --> 00:23:38.009
can show your design team and your your
management team and say look this is the

00:23:38.009 --> 00:23:38.019
management team and say look this is the
 

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:40.710
management team and say look this is the
way that that things work on Android and

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:40.720
way that that things work on Android and
 

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.629
way that that things work on Android and
if you want to do it differently you're

00:23:42.629 --> 00:23:42.639
if you want to do it differently you're
 

00:23:42.639 --> 00:23:43.529
if you want to do it differently you're
going to have to come up with something

00:23:43.529 --> 00:23:43.539
going to have to come up with something
 

00:23:43.539 --> 00:23:47.789
going to have to come up with something
very different oh I see what's happened

how does it work you know that's what's

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080
how does it work you know that's what's
 

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.510
how does it work you know that's what's
making all of these things work but

don't know any of that they don't care

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:00.590
don't know any of that they don't care
 

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.960

to them and so in that context exit

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:10.820

use the three and a half inch floppies
 

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:40.000
use the three and a half inch floppies
now but the five and a quarter is never

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.010
now but the five and a quarter is never
 

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:43.030

going away yeah it went away and then

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:43.040
going away yeah it went away and then
 

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.980

the 303 and a half inch run away not too

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:44.990
the 303 and a half inch run away not too
 

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.810

long afterwards and then hard drives

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:46.820
long afterwards and then hard drives
 

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.240
long afterwards and then hard drives
started to end up in the terabytes but

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.250
started to end up in the terabytes but
 

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.730

you know my point is that things change
 

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.470
you know my point is that things change
and i think as developers we need to

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:53.480
and i think as developers we need to
 

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.690
and i think as developers we need to
adapt to that and the trend is really to

00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:55.700
adapt to that and the trend is really to
 

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.860

you could do a session on unit testing

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:51.550
you could do a session on unit testing
 

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.010

okay yeah unit testing is a good one I

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:54.020
okay yeah unit testing is a good one I
 

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.290
okay yeah unit testing is a good one I
think testing is something which show we

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:56.300
think testing is something which show we
 

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.760
