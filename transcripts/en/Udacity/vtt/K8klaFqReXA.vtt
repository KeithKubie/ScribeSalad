00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.380
Okay Michael, so
I think I have basically

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.410
one more thing that I want to say before
I start writing out little formulas and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.680
trying to convince you that this
is something that we can do

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.100
with some of the framework and
infrastructure that we've built so far.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.900
And I want to do it by diving in and
sort of doubling down on this idea

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.920
drama management,
this idea of going through a story.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.920
So you're an AI person and you need to
kind of think about how you're going to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.420
build a system where a player can
learn how to go through a story or

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.790
can go through a story and
have a good time.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.190
So the first question I'm going to claim
you're going to have to ask yourself

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.520
is well, what's a story?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.200
What's a story really?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.710
And for the purposes of this discussion,
I'm going to just assert something and

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.050
you can tell me if it
makes sense to you.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.270
And that is that a story,
it turns out, is just a trajectory.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.970
It's just one of any possible many
number of possible trajectories

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.440
through a space that is
made up of plot points.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.600
So, does that make any sense to you?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.590
Do you know what I mean by that?

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.980
&gt;&gt; So you're being abstract
about what stories are.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.300
Yes I'm being very abstract.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.680
That abstraction is important
because we're computationalists.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.220
&gt;&gt; And plot points, I guess plot points
makes me picture a graph where there's

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.920
points and there's edges or
there's vertices and there's edges.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.060
So plot point is like a vertex?.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.580
&gt;&gt; Yes, right.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.400
So a plot point is like a little circle,
and that plot point might represent

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.330
something like, I don't know,
what's your favorite kind of story?

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.860
&gt;&gt; Mystery.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.510
&gt;&gt; You like mysteries.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.060
Okay cool.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.570
So I have a plot point, that's something
that has to do with the mystery.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.593
So what happens in a mystery?

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:27.848
So there's a murder.

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:29.590
What?
Yes that's a plot point.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.280
There's another plot point maybe and

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.320
that plot point is
there's an accusation.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.000
There's another plot point
which is a weapon is found.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.010
And there's a whole bunch of these and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.050
if they're set up right and
they're sequenced just right if of all

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.960
the possible paths of all the possible
plot points were set up just right.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.550
So you see the murder, you see the
accusation, a weapon is found and so on.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.508
Then you have something that
looks like a murder mystery.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:56.200
Now I want to point out that it's
possible to have good murder mysteries

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.100
and bad murder mysteries.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.480
So if you think about the way
a murder mystery works right,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.690
it's got this really neat structure.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.620
There's a murder.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.910
Nobody knows who did it,
that's what makes it a mystery.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.460
And then eventually you discover that,
every

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.370
single person in the house had a reason
to kill the person who was killed.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.990
And you find a weapon that
points to a particular person.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.925
&gt;&gt; It's, Michael.

00:02:17.925 --> 00:02:20.694
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Everyone know it's that person and

00:02:20.694 --> 00:02:22.080
then that person gets killed.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.540
&gt;&gt; That's Michael again
&gt;&gt; No!

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.610
&gt;&gt; And then you know
therefore it wasn't Michael.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.210
&gt;&gt; Or Curley.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.120
&gt;&gt; And so, then you keep going And
you discover it was in fact not Curly.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.040
And then you find out who
the real murderer is and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.260
there's a whole bunch of things
that happen very quickly.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
And it turns out it was
the butler all along.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.470
&gt;&gt; That would've been my guess.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.970
&gt;&gt; And
that makes it a good murder mystery.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.300
Now here's a bad murder mystery.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.385
There's a murder and you happen to see
it and so you know who the murderer is.

00:02:44.385 --> 00:02:47.030
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.350
&gt;&gt; So then a murderer has to go off and
start killing you and

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.540
everyone else they can.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.900
You run away and
you know what you've got instead?

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.690
&gt;&gt; A chasing movie.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.860
&gt;&gt; You've got a horror movie.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.540
So the difference between a murder
mystery and a horror movie, and

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.490
not that much difference,

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.890
it's really about whether you know
who's doing the killing or not.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.410
So if I have all these elements lined
up in some kind of virtual game.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.240
Depending upon what the player of the
game is doing I may have to interfere,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.980
interact with what's actually going
on underneath so that the player

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.470
experiences a murder mystery as opposed
to experiencing a horror flick.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.370
&gt;&gt; And when you say you might have that,
you mean the drama manager.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.270
&gt;&gt; Right, because the agent can describe
what it means to be a murder mystery.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.260
And as a player,
the author can't control the players.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.660
The player's going through.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.680
The system may have to interact
with that in order to make

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.900
certain that you still get a good murder
mystery as opposed to something else.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.620
And I'm going to claim that if we
think of these points as being key

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.710
things that happen in the story and
some sequences are better than others

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:50.280
then what we end up with
is a story is a trajectory.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.280
It's a trajectory through
these plot points.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.550
And that a good story is
a particular kind of trajectory.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.360
And there are bad stories which
are other kinds of trajectories.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.900
And we need to figure out
how to influence the player

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.150
in such a way that we go
down the good trajectories.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.140
Instead of the bad trajectories.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.540
&gt;&gt; And can you say a word about
what the player's doing here?

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.220
&gt;&gt; Well so
it would depend upon the situation.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.210
But imagine that.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.877
I mean you play games like Zork.

00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:12.590
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sure.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.470
&gt;&gt; And various other things.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.460
Right?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.870
Sure you have vague memories of
Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.930
And those like text adventure games.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.300
You're interacting with the system
somehow and you decide to go north or

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.870
you decide to open the door,
you decide to talk to somebody.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.480
It's just like you choose
your own adventure story,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.660
that's the kind of idea that
I'm trying to evoke here.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.740
&gt;&gt; Interesting.
Okay, and so

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.220
you're saying that we could think
of this as a kind of MDP and

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.050
then do reinforcement learning in it?

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.470
&gt;&gt; Yes,
that's what I'm going to talk about.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.520
I want to convince you, if you buy this
idea of story, as trajectory with plot

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.370
points and it's actually pretty
easy to turn it into an MVP.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.080
&gt;&gt; Okay,
I would like to hear about that.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.660
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's do that.
