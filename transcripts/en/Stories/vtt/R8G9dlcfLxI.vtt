00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.940
INTERVIEWER: Gold is maybe the
most universal shorthand there

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.080
is for value and for greed.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.350
The ancient Egyptians
were obsessed with it.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.170
European explorers marauded
through South America

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.430
in search of it.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.190
And American cities, like
San Francisco and Seattle,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.180
rose to prominence
because of it.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.710
It's a big part of
our history as humans.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.730
Looking at all that,
our obsession with gold

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.560
also seems historical.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.700
Sort of, old-timey.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.430
But that's not at all true.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.070
There's still huge
demand for gold today.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.740
The recession of 2008 helped
gold quadruple in value.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.750
And a full half of all the
gold mined in the world

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.470
has been mined in the
past 50 years, alone.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.120
But what is different about
gold today is how we get it.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.740
DIEGO CUPOLO: What happens
in gold producing areas

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.480
is not what we imagine,
where somebody's

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.990
in a cave using a
chisel and hammer

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.680
to get these big gold nuggets.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.190
INTERVIEWER: That's Diego
Cupolo, a photojournalist

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.610
who spent some time
in Cajamarca, Peru

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.510
near a modern gold mine.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.290
Actually, not just
any gold mine,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.780
the largest in all
of Latin America.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.512
And modern mining looks very
different than it used to.

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:17.720
DIEGO CUPOLO: Most of the
gold that we are mining now

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.470
comes in the form of
little specks of sand

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.340
and little flakes
mixed in with dirt.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.520
So basically, a lot
of these companies

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.030
are using open-pit mines to
grab as much dirt as possible.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.410
And then they process it
with different chemicals,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.507
including cyanide,
mercury, arsenic.

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:36.090
INTERVIEWER: Basically,
a laundry list

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.650
of all the things you want
to keep far away from people.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.020
But the mining process
creates a lot of wastewater

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.810
laced with those pollutants.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.880
And up in the Andes Mountains,
the water doesn't stay put.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.200
DIEGO CUPOLO: When you
take a mining operation

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.220
and put it on top of a mountain,
the water, as we all know,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.410
only follows gravity.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.812
it goes down in every direction.

00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:03.240
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.400
INTERVIEWER: And therein
lies the problem.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.550
According to Diego,
poisoned water

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.330
has seeped throughout
the region,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.970
causing stomach cancer in
people, illnesses in livestock,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.470
and decimated fish populations.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.550
And the people of Cajamarca,
who were promised new wealth

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.570
from the mining economy,
haven't all seen a benefit.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.710
DIEGO CUPOLO: They see
water that is contaminated

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.840
and economic opportunities
that haven't really

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.330
changed for them.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.140
Quality of life has remained the
same for many of these people

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.930
without any of the profits that
you assume a gold mine would

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.010
bring to a region.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.260
INTERVIEWER: And so the
people have done the one thing

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.770
that they're able to do
about the mines, protest.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.080
They're pushing back against
foreign corporate influence,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.410
ruined natural resources, and a
history that somehow has never

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.257
seemed to change for them.

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:55.590
DIEGO CUPOLO: They've been
exploited for about 500 years

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.630
now, ever since the
Spanish arrived and started

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.617
taking the Inca's gold.

00:02:59.617 --> 00:03:01.700
It's the same story that
happens wherever you have

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.530
resource extraction projects.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.330
It's a dirty industry,
which makes private profits

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.550
and public disasters.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.330
INTERVIEWER: For Diego,
it all comes back

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.240
to the value of gold.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.890
As expensive as gold is right
now, after visiting Cajamarca,

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.240
Diego sees it as
undervalued, dangerously so.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.730
DIEGO CUPOLO: I realize
that gold is cheap

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.480
because we pay through it
through the lives of people who

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.960
live in gold-producing areas,
through the lives of people

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.625
that live in Cajamarca or
any region in the world.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:33.000
INTERVIEWER: For
a very different

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.820
looking protest
movement, check out

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.730
this next video on the
infamous black bloc protests,

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.200
and why participants
choose to remain anonymous.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.400
SUBJECT: People that are
doing black bloc tactics

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.687
always have black bandanas.

00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:48.520
They always have some
king of face covering.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.080
Sometimes they're wearing
sunglasses or hats or masks.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.851
They always wear black clothes.

00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:56.100
INTERVIEWER: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.710
Thanks for watching.
