00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.520
-Thank you very much Judy for
the generous introduction.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.930
And I also owe a note
of sincere thanks

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.870
that the honor of being here
as a Radcliffe Fellow this year

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.780
to Liz Cohen, who's here in the
back, Rebecca Haley, who helps

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.080
keep us in order, and
of course to Susan

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.920
and Kenneth Wallach for
sponsoring the professorship

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.030
that I hold.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.480
It's been a welcome
time to delve

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.780
into the sources
necessary to begin

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.720
a new project on procedure in
early Islamic law and society.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.830
And it wouldn't have
been possible otherwise.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.930
So thank you to them.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.020
And thanks to all of
you for coming here.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.900
So the title of my
talk, as you know,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.730
is Qadi Justice--
Cases and Controversies

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.150
in Early Islamic
Law and Society.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.610
I'll spend the bulk of my time
unpacking three such cases

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.170
and controversies in attempt
to better map the content

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.170
and significance of procedure
to early Islamic law.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.870
Somewhat time in
tongue in cheek,

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.980
I call this project qadi
justice, where qadi simply

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.652
means judge in Arabic.

00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:21.360
And I say tongue in
cheek because there's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.850
a story behind this term.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.820
Max Weber defined
qadi justice, spelled

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.540
in the proper German way.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.850
He defined it as an arbitrary
judge sitting under a palm tree

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.565
dispensing justice
according to whim.

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:41.290
And he may have
gotten this notion

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.490
from reading Arabian Nights
as a manual for Islamic law.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.220
Or perhaps more
charitably, he believed

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.440
the conventional narratives
of Muslim scholars themselves.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.560
For them, the claim
with that Islamic law

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.600
was, in fact, an
unchanging sacred law

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.200
that descended from on high.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.650
They tended to
discuss it in terms

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.810
of substantive legal
rulings in their manuals.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.240
And they didn't pay much
attention to procedure.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.710
If Islam had a system
where the law was

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.640
all text and no
procedure, then a judge

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.480
might indeed have to
decide cases by whim.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.880
There'd be no escape valve
otherwise, as Weber supposed.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.390
But I have evidence
to suggest precisely

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.450
the opposite in
ways that may make

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.490
us redefine Islamic law itself.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.790
My main contention is
that judges developed

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.220
robust procedures to help
define Islamic law in response

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.070
to changing social and political
circumstances during Islam's

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.520
founding period, by which I
referred to the long founding

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.450
period from the seventh
to 11th centuries.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.290
These procedures were part
and parcel of Islamic law,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.350
even though they are rarely
contained in its manuals.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.680
So before elaborating
on that claim,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.860
I'll point out that the old
Weberian notion of Islamic law,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.930
this qadi justice, the judge
sitting under a tree, it's

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.650
unfortunately the case that
it dangerously persists today

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.580
as many who subscribe to
or comment on Islamic life

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.780
tend to believe
that it is somehow

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.261
divinely determined,
and therefore static.

00:03:30.261 --> 00:03:32.010
So let me start with
the first case, which

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.520
highlights the role of procedure
and change through a notion

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.440
of the Islamic law of doubt.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.900
This curious episode in
early Islamic history

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.510
illustrates the
problems posed by doubt

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.210
in Islamic criminal law.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:53.370
And I'll call it the case of
the falsely accused butcher.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.050
Not long after Islam's advent
in the seventh century,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.680
a type of early police force
in a small Arabian town

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.580
was out patrolling.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.490
Members of the patrol came
across a man in the town ruins

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.400
holding a bloodstained
knife in his hand,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.220
and standing over the body of
another man who had obviously

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.050
just died or been killed.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.850
The patrol arrested
the man with the knife.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.220
An upon arrest, he confessed.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.070
I killed them.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.480
The suspect was brought
before Ali, the beloved cousin

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.360
and son-in-law of
the prophet Muhammad,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.540
who had died less than three
decades before that in 632.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.790
Ali was the fourth caliph,
according to the Sunni account

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.460
of successors to the prophet.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.710
And he was the first imam in
the competing Shia account.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.200
He presided over criminal
trials in his capacity

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.150
as leader of the young Muslim
community from 656 to 661,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.570
as had the prophet before him.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.690
And upon hearing the
defendant's story,

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.710
Ali reportedly sentenced
him to death in accordance

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.160
with the Islamic
law of retaliation

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.460
or of [INAUDIBLE] for
homicide and personal injury,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.660
a life for a life.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.230
Before the sentence
was carried out,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.300
another man rushed forward,
telling the executioners don't

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.010
be so hasty.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.790
Don't kill him.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.650
I did it, he said.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.950
Ali turned to the condemned
man incredulously.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:26.370
What made you confess to a
crime that you didn't commit?

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.410
The man explained that
he thought that Ali never

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.720
take his word over that of
the patrolman who had perhaps

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.970
witnessed the crime, or at
least witness the crime scene

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.160
wherein all signs pointed
to him as the perpetrator.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.850
In reality, the man
explains, he was

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.220
a butcher who had just
finished slaughtering a cow.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.720
And immediately
after the slaughter,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.860
he needed to relieve himself.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.850
So he entered into the
town ruins, bloody knife

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.080
still in hand.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.370
Upon return, he came
across the dead man,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.270
and he actually stood
over him in concern.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.960
It was then that the
patrol encountered him.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.000
And figuring that he
couldn't plausibly

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.500
deny having committed
the crime, he

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.700
confessed to what
seemed to be obvious,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.910
and decided to leave the
matter in God's hands.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.110
The second man offered
a corroborating story

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.580
and explained that
he was the one who

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.870
had murdered the man
for money, and then

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.750
fled upon hearing sounds
of the patrol approaching.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.650
On his way out, he passed the
butcher entering the area,

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.700
and then watched the events
unfold just as the butcher had

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.460
described them.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.490
Once the butcher was
condemned to death,

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.420
however, the second man felt
compelled to step forward.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.450
He didn't want the blood
of two men on his hands.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.370
So this episode--
and again, we'll

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.060
refer to it as the
case of the falsely

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.970
accused butcher--
depicts the difficulties

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.500
that early and medieval Muslim
judges faced when attempting

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.970
to apply Islamic criminal law
without the benefit of being

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.420
able to discern the facts,
the law, or the morality

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.895
of punishment with
any certainty.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.200
As for the facts, confession
or witness testimony usually

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.180
sufficed to establish guilt
in Islamic criminal laws

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.590
of murder.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.810
But here, Ali as judge
was presented only

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.260
with circumstantial and,
eventually, contradictory

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.460
evidence.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.190
There were these competing
confessions which cancelled

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:32.610
each other out.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.070
And there was no
witness testimony

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.040
beyond the patrol that only
witnessed the crime scene, not

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.805
the actual crime itself.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.930
As for the Islamic
law of homicide,

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.130
the Quran and other
foundational texts

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.220
contained clear rules that
retaliation applied only

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.710
to intentional murder.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.940
But those rules didn't
cover the case before Ali.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.020
There was no claim
of premeditation,

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.810
at least not for the butcher.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.380
And as for the morality, and
consequently the legitimacy

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.200
of punishment, Ali
also had to decide

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.710
whether to enforce or avoid
the textual role of punishment

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:16.530
if he decided that it
applied in the face

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:21.900
of procedural uncertainties
about the law and the facts.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.100
And he chose to
avoid punishment.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.920
Now the question is
why and to what extent?

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.570
And the answer is shrouded
by a tangled web that

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.159
took Muslim jurists
centuries to weave,

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.289
and therefore takes serious
historical work to unravel,

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.770
which is what I do it in my
book that Judy mentioned,

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.000
Doubt in Islamic Law.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.870
But don't worry, I won't spend
centuries unraveling that story

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:48.700
here.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.000
I'll cut to the center.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.450
Muslims developed a
robust set of procedures

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.970
that they believed
were consistent

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.900
with Islamic legal
rules and values

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.780
to make doubt and avoidance
of punishment on its basis

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.640
a central pillar of
Islamic criminal law.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.510
So that's the book
in a nutshell.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.360
And read it for more
if you want to see how.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.840
So myriad episodes like
the case of the falsely

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.110
accused butcher recur in
early Islamic legal sources.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.880
And Muslim jurists explain such
cases consistently with respect

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.060
to doubt.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.500
They took cases like
this one as a precedent.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.330
And based on it,
they then promoted

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.580
a surprisingly
extensive tendency

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.350
of extending the benefit of
the doubt to the accused.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.245
They packaged that tendency
in the form of a legal maxim

00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:43.230
and oft repeated
saying whereby they

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.730
counsel judges to avoid criminal
punishment in cases of doubt.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.420
This was repeated
over and over again.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.980
Avoid criminal punishments
in cases of doubt.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.440
Avoid criminal punishments
in cases of doubt.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.950
So I call this statement
Islamic laws' doubt canon.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.380
And it's one of many
Islamic legal maxims that

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.920
were rooted in past cases
and in judicial practices

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.220
from those past cases
as a way of elaborating

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.110
a procedural rule.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.630
That became part and
parcel of Islamic law.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.930
And it's part of
Islamic law, I argue,

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:23.810
even though it manifests
less as text in the law books

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:28.030
and more as procedure in
the form of legal practice

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.120
that comes from other
sources, which I'll discuss.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.390
Now one more note about
doubt before we move on.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.530
For anyone familiar with
American criminal law,

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.150
I should note that
the Arabic term

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:48.240
for doubt in this canon,
[ARABIC], was a term of art.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.360
And you have a handout.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.800
That's the first
term on the handout.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.310
And you can ignore
it thereafter.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.120
And I'll tell you when
you can pick it up again.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.670
It assumes a much
more expansive meaning

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.630
than the common conception
of reasonable doubt

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.810
that we have in American law.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:11.210
So rather than presenting a
principally fact based approach

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.030
to standards of proof,
the Islamic doctrine

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.780
covered factual uncertainties,
legal ambiguities,

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.490
even extralegal considerations
that I call moral doubt.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.090
And moreover, the
Islamic doctrine of doubt

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.800
corresponds to analogous
American doctrines

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.730
as seemingly disparate as
the principle of legality,

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.820
the rule of lenity, which
instructs judges to construe

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.980
criminal statutes narrowly
in cases of doubt,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.680
the presumption of innocence,
the requirement for proof

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.590
beyond a reasonable
doubt as to the facts,

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.440
mens rea requirements
or the state of mind

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.540
having to be criminal before
criminal culpability can be

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:57.400
assigned, mistake,
ignorance, impossibility,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.800
and other potentially mitigating
circumstances, and even mercy.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.470
And the concept of [ARABIC]
or doubt in Islamic law

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.380
also covered notions
unique to Islamic law.

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.030
There's a notion of
contractual doubt

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:14.180
whereby a contract could
create a cause for doubt

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.390
as to criminal liability.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.930
And of interpretive
doubt, whereby

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.900
multiple legal
interpretations that

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:24.680
were considered equally valid
yet different in Islamic law

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.320
could also create a
cause for doubting

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.470
whether a criminal
sanction would apply in one

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.240
circumstance where
the underlying act

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.787
would have been permissible
in another school of thought.

00:12:39.787 --> 00:12:41.120
And we can talk more about that.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.820
So why should we care about
doubt or the role of procedure

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.320
to which it points?

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.590
This current project
on qadi justice

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.330
which seeks to elucidate
the role of procedure

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.960
in early Islamic law grows
out of that earlier project

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.520
on doubt.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.110
So in the book, Doubt
in Islamic Law, which

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.020
was published
earlier this year, I

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.350
what turns out to have been
a long history of discretion

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.176
and doubt in Islamic criminal
law as I just described.

00:13:19.176 --> 00:13:21.300
But the fact that I published
a book on the subject

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.110
is not the reason we should
care about the Islamic history

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:28.860
of doubt or about the judicial
procedures that grew out of it.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.560
Instead, I submit that the
procedure is important here

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.340
because it reveals
an underrecognized,

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.430
but I think all important
aspect of Islamic legal history

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:45.890
that may redefine notions
of Islamic law itself.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:49.070
Now if that seems like
a grand claim, it is.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.470
But let me explain what I
mean by that with respect

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:55.840
to both modern and
political developments,

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.520
or modern political developments
and scholarly debates

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.730
concerning Islamic law.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.060
And I'm more concerned
with the scholarly debates

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:04.890
as a historian.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.600
So it will be my focus.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.410
But I want to say something
about the modern political

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.230
relevance as well.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:14.200
So as for the modern
political developments,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.960
the history of
doubt and procedure

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:20.530
matters for ongoing questions
of Islamic law today.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.330
For starters, Islamic
law has reemerged

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.760
in the past half century
in constitutional

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.720
and in criminal context.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.420
Since the 1970s,
over 29 countries

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.070
have incorporated an
Islamic law or sharia

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.170
clause into their
constitutional text,

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.730
a clause saying
Islamic law shall

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.300
be a source or
the source of law,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.600
or they've announced
intentions to do so as has

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.270
the Gambia just a few days ago.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.720
And during the same period,
at least a dozen states

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.630
have passed Islamic
criminal law codes

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.940
or applied Islamic criminal
law in various regions.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.550
And these countries range
from Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.080
Arabia to provinces in
Malaysia, northern Nigeria,

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.150
and now in Syria.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:11.520
In this country there
are raging debates

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.820
about the definitions
of Islamic law

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:18.900
and the role for doubt or
discretion in criminal law.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.630
And to be sure, many of those
who seek to apply Islamic law,

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.640
and particularly Islamic
criminal law in these areas,

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.880
adopt ill conceived
and ahistoric versions

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.320
of rigidly harsh Islamic
criminal law, particularly

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:40.890
in places like northern
Nigeria, Mali, Iraq.

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.140
And the barbarism that results
from this ignorant application

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.200
has prompted, more
than anything,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.970
fears of Islam punishments,
or Islamic law more generally.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.320
In fact, those
punishments have sometimes

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.780
come to define the
face of sharia itself.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.360
It's often left
untranslated in order

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:05.430
to highlight its exoticism and
the danger that it can evoke.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.590
So the book called into question
this erroneous but popular

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.100
notion of Islamic law,
which incidentally

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.030
is upheld by many
Muslim adherents

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.580
and non-Muslim critics alike.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.310
And to put that in
more vivid terms,

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.330
you might say that the Isis
leader and Donald Trump or Ben

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:29.360
Carson share an idea
of what sharia is.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.720
The notion is that
Islamic law is

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.450
a divine legal tradition with
little room for discretion

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:36.410
or doubt.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:40.200
And what I want to
intervene and say

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.970
is that despite the contemporary
popularity of that notion,

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.150
it turns out, based
on research today,

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:50.920
to have been far outside the
mainstream of Islamic law

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.840
for most of its history.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.180
And the surprising
reality is that, as we

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:00.190
saw in the aftermath of the case
of the falsely accused butcher,

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:03.780
instead of rejecting doubt,
historically Muslim scholars

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.200
embraced it.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.210
And they came to
hold it so closely

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:11.349
that it came to be at the
heart of Islamic criminal law.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.180
And through the doubt
canon-- and here

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.569
is where the new
project comes in-- it

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:18.630
was Islamic criminal
procedure that

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:23.790
came to be central to notions
of Islamic criminal law itself.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.530
And that was manifested
through this maximum

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.569
here, the doubt canon.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.605
Avoid criminal punishment
in cases of doubt.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:34.980
So in the political
and policy arenas

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.580
today, this history
is significant

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.190
not only to further
our understanding

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:45.870
of a forgotten notion of
doubt in early Islamic law,

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.910
but because of the importance
for early Islamic law

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.330
to modern interpretations.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.490
In many ways akin to
conservative visions

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.820
of the American legal
tradition, Islamic law

00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.980
is a textualist and
originalist legal tradition.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.090
Appeals to Islamic
law are really

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.370
appeals to the founding
moment or founding

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.560
history of Islamic law in which
directives from the prophet

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.560
and from other
authoritative figures

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.190
were most authoritative,
just like references

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.980
to the American founding fathers
carries some weight in debates

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.466
about American constitutional
and statutory interpretation.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:31.580
So that's a word about
the political and policy

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:36.230
significance of discretion,
doubt, and procedure.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:41.490
As for the scholarly
debates about Islamic law,

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:44.840
the history of doubt and
the role of procedure

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.180
matters for gaining a
better understanding

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.150
of the nature of Islamic law
during that founding period.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.270
Any misunderstanding,
in my view,

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.380
has to do with impoverished
understanding of Islamic law

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:03.990
from a narrow use of sources
to enrich those understandings.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:06.060
So my approach
combines the tools

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.370
of a historian and a lawyer.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.870
Wearing both hats,
I approach questions

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.200
of interpretation
in early Islamic law

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.580
and society with
insights from theories

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.230
of constitutional and
statutory interpretation,

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.420
which is a field, at least
in the American context,

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:27.940
that's witnessed significant
advances in the past few years

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.460
or decades.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.190
So starting from
two basic insights,

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:40.880
one that procedure is law,
and vice versa, and two,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.500
that interpretation
helps define and manage

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.840
institutional and
social relations.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.750
I've been able to identify
ways in which procedure

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.520
and interpretation helped
construct and were constructed

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.870
by institutions, values,
and social norms that

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.960
informed Islamic legal rules.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.450
Moreover, by taking Islamic
law as law in the broad sense

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.780
that modern lawyers
understand law,

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.570
and by thus examining a
broad range of sources

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:17.370
for Islamic law and society
in its early period,

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:20.800
my project speaks both to
the nature of Islamic law

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.080
and to theories
of interpretation

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.720
with which all legal
systems are concerned,

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.270
but which typically
developed with respect only

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.210
to American or Western
legal traditions.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.980
So in that sense, I also
aim for this project

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:37.590
to help critique and expand
our notions of procedure

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.270
and of legal interpretation.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.420
My examination then
of qadi justice

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:49.930
is necessary to round out
the rather square notion

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.330
of Islamic law in the
books at the expense

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:58.480
of the law in action, both for
a more accurate understanding

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.700
of Islam's early
history, and for a more

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:07.400
expanded notion of modern legal
theory in comparative context.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.310
So with that long
introduction to the subject,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.760
I'll proceed within the
remainder of the talk

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.610
as follows.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.640
In part one, I'll layout
some basic building blocks

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:21.270
that will help map the
players, the legal sources,

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.170
and the institutional
structures that

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.450
are integral to
understanding Islamic law

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:31.140
and so that you have some
blocks to play with, as it were.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.120
In part two, I'll give
an example-- I'm sorry,

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.560
in part three I'll
give an example

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:41.010
of a case from a literary
source in 10th century

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.480
Baghdad that
exemplifies problems

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.210
of caliphal excesses
in punishment

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.050
to which the jurists writing
about doubt and procedure,

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:53.270
and developing procedure
were responding.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:22:00.840
And then in part
four I'll circle back

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.550
to the question of the sources
for this current project

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:08.160
and the importance of an
expanded set of sources

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.590
to better
understanding the scope

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.240
and content and operation of
Islamic law in its early period

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.360
with respect to procedure.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.220
What is the availability,
significance,

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.950
and use of this wide range
of sources for developing

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.560
the early history of
Islamic law through a focus

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.830
on actual cases-- or reported
I should say-- reported cases

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.480
and controversies.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.340
In short, I'll argue that
these cases are important not

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.470
for their historical
truth value,

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:43.310
but to uncover the legal aims
to which jurists put them,

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.510
and to chart how and why
judicial procedure emerge

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.690
from certain developments in
early Islamic law and society

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.070
that they represent.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.270
And this last part is
essentially a [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:54.270 --> 00:23:00.610
or a mini version of the project
that I'm working on this year.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.280
And so I very much welcome
comments in that vein.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.540
So on to part two, the basic
building blocks of Islamic law.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.250
And here is where your
handouts come in handy.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.330
There are two basic
building blocks

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.570
that lay the foundation on
which medieval Muslim jurists,

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.470
the main players, historically
constructed Islamic law

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:26.030
and procedure--
the textual sources

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.530
and the institutional
structures.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.240
As for the textual
sources, there

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.740
is the Quran, which
is Muslim scripture.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.060
And this is a picture of
one first century Hijri

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:46.450
or seventh century
manuscript and hadith,

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:52.310
or prophetic reports of the
words and actions of Muhammad.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.920
Now Muslims believe
that Muhammad

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.260
was a prophet who received
revelations directly from God

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:00.240
and that he recorded the
Quran during his lifetime

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.190
in the seventh century.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:06.700
And so this is the first
textual source of Islamic law.

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.310
It's constitutional text.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.780
In addition, early Muslims
recorded the prophet's

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.900
statements in multiple
books, collecting

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.300
thousands of prophetic
reports over the course

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.090
of two centuries.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.180
And so this forms a
second textual source.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.270
Now significantly,
none of these sources

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:31.740
were-- of the second type--
were contained in a single book.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.940
There's no single law code.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.380
There are thousands of
reports that were gathered

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.550
over the course of time.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.820
Now Muslims took
Mohammed's statement

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:45.550
to be normative
sources of Islamic law

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.150
when he issued those
statements in his capacity

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:52.280
as a divinely inspired prophet
and when they could ascertain

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.390
the authenticity of these
multitude of sources

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:59.470
that they were recording some
decades, and in some cases,

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.230
centuries after the
prophet's death.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:08.760
But they didn't look to these
statements as normative sources

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.590
where the authenticity
could not be ascertained,

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:14.770
or where he was speaking
in his personal capacity--

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.080
for example,
expressing preferences

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.080
that had little to do with law.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.900
In this personal
capacity, even he

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.200
was bound to the rules
of the divine law.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.050
And the thorny task
then for hadith scholars

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:35.890
and for jurists dealing with
such a fluid textual corpus

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.910
was distinguishing the
personal from the prophetic,

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.610
and the authentic from
those falsely attributed.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:50.960
Now Muslims also believed
that God legislated

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.510
a comprehensive set of
laws through these two

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.300
textual sources, the
Quran and hadith.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.330
Those laws included a short
list of fixed criminal laws.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:04.916
And that's [ARABIC],
the third on your list.

00:26:04.916 --> 00:26:06.540
And these fixed
criminal laws were also

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.870
supposed to provide the
upper limits of punishment

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:14.080
for any discretionary
penalties that a caliph rather

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.540
than a judge might impose.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:20.140
The idea was that criminal law,
more starkly than other areas

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.470
of law, expressed
Islam's absolute form

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.860
of divine legislative supremacy.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:31.310
God was the sole legislator,
so legislator with a big L.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.470
And he tolerated no
departure from the text.

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.730
In the textualist strict
constructionist version

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.510
of Islamic law, divine
legislative supremacy

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:44.090
meant applying Islamic
criminal laws broadly

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.400
whenever there was some
text and some evidence

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.270
to suggest cause for
punishment, and otherwise

00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.450
to suspend judgment altogether.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.680
And this approach
stood in stark contrast

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.030
to the one that went
out through the doubt

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:00.780
canon and the development
of procedure through it.

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.340
And that was the push to
construe text narrowly

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.740
in the style of the rule of
lenity, American law, whenever

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:12.950
there were ambiguities that
arose from applications of law

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:15.130
to facts.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:20.260
And it also cautioned judges to
avoid conviction and punishment

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.330
in the style of reasonable
doubt in American law

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:26.020
when the evidence was
questionable to proving

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.275
the claim with
absolute certainty.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.900
So this brings us to the
second building block,

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.470
the institutional structures.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.080
Historically
Islamic governments,

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.050
like all premodern
government, did not

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.490
have three
constitutionally defined

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:47.440
separate branches of power.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.040
They often did not have
Constitutions Instead,

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.490
there was an informal
constitutional arrangement

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:56.070
that unfolded in
the Islamic context

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.970
after the prophet's
death in 632.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.490
In this scheme, a class
of scholar jurists

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.290
asserted the authority
to interpret Islamic law,

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.380
to say what the law is.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.700
And monarchical rulers
called caliphs enforced it.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.180
Now between the two,
there where judges

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.200
whom the caliph appointed,
but who looked to the jurists

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.700
for definitions of Islamic law.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.550
In some sense the
jurists were learned

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:29.800
scholars of the law,
much like professors.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.430
But unlike professors,
Muslim jurist's

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.260
definitions of Islamic
law actually mattered.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.980
They were crucial
for definitions

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:44.180
of Islamic law itself and
for questions of legitimacy.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.260
So this much is now well
known in the literature.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.240
We have a basic outline
of three institutions.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.580
We have the jurors
and their actors--

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.730
we have the jurists, the
judges, and the caliphs.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.320
But the existing
scholarship does not

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.550
give us the full picture of
how Muslim jurists expanded

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.750
their discretion
over Islamic law,

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:08.170
and how they did so with
respect to procedures

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:11.340
informed by the social
and political realities

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:11.970
of their times.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.560
So this is a part of
the picture that I

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.540
see to fill in with reference
to the cases and controversies

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.030
from the early period.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:29.310
And to that end, I argue
that in response the cases

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:33.500
like the case of the
falsely accused butcher,

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.610
Muslim jurists of the time
appealed to authoritative cases

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:43.350
to identify, define,
and expand procedures

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:47.830
to better guide legitimate
criminal punishment.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:49.820
So to add some
color to that claim,

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:52.750
I'll use a 10th
century case that

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.520
inspired judges of the time to
construct and better articulate

00:29:56.520 --> 00:30:01.470
procedures based on the
more authoritative cases

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:05.260
like the falsely accused butcher
case from the seventh century

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.400
and just after.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.830
Now I said I wanted to
add some more color.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.770
And the 10th century case
is actually really colorful.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.990
It's called the
case of the tailor

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:18.650
and military sexual misconduct.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.610
It's essentially two
cases wrapped up in one.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.640
And the first load case has
the do with debt repayment.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.270
Now in the eastern
section of Baghdad

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:30.490
sometime in the late
1900s-- and Baghdad

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.770
was a round city that
had four quadrants

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:37.900
at the time-- an
elder merchant came

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:43.420
to the local judge, [INAUDIBLE]
to demand repayment of a debt

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:45.100
from one of the soldiers.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.730
The soldier had been
avoiding repayment.

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.980
And every time the
merchant went to demand it,

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.220
there would be a guard
at the soldier's home

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.850
brushing off the request.

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:58.500
So even if the judge could
issue a decision declaring

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.440
that payment was due,
he had no authority

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.800
to enforce the decision
or to force payment.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.800
And accordingly, he had
to submit a complaint

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.250
to the caliphal court of
[INAUDIBLE], the caliph

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.740
at the time, for enforcement.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.850
The vizier, who worked
under the caliph

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.730
and who first entertained
such claims, [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.290
received the complaint.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:25.130
But he didn't do
anything about it.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.630
So the case seemed
hopeless, as if there

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.620
was no justice to be had.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.460
The judge applying Islamic law
might have entered a judgment

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.420
requiring repayment, but he
lacked enforcement authority.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.780
The caliph's vizier who did
have enforcement authority

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:40.930
ignored the complaint.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.590
And it seemed that
the soldier was

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:46.220
to be left to do
exactly as he pleased.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.020
But then a friend of the
merchant intervened, presumably

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.500
one of the officials
of the town.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.810
And he directed him
to a local tailor.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.730
The tailor, upon
hearing the case,

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.970
accompanied that
merchant and the official

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.570
to the soldier's house.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.910
And they were immediately
well received.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.960
The soldier said come
in, how can I help?

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.920
What can I do for you?

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.840
And the tailor told him
the story that the merchant

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.300
had recounted to him.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:18.630
Immediately, the soldier offered
to give whatever money he had.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.890
All I have is 5,000
dirhams or silver coins.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:25.110
Please ask him to accept that,
he said to the tailor, along

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.820
with these riding reins
made of gold and silver

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:33.657
as my security deposit until
I can come up with the rest.

00:32:33.657 --> 00:32:35.490
And so the merchant
took possession of both,

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.070
and he was satisfied.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:43.030
Now back at the ranch, or the
tailor shop to be more precise,

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:44.960
of course the merchant
wanted to know

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.520
what was up with the tailor.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.120
Why had the tailor
held such sway

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.200
over this otherwise obstinate
and intransigent soldier?

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.390
And so the tailor rather
reluctantly told the story

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.270
as follows.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:05.530
And this is the second case,
the really colorful case

00:33:05.530 --> 00:33:11.200
of the tailor and the
military sexual misconduct.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:13.340
So the tailor had
been the prayer leader

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:18.980
at the local mosque, again in
this eastern section of Baghdad

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.380
near to his tailoring
shop, for over 40 years.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.000
And so one day on his
way home from work,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.830
he passed by a drunken
Turkish soldier

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.450
and saw him grab a
beautiful young woman who

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.660
was just passing by his home.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.260
And he forced her
into his house.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.210
She called out for help.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.170
No one was around to respond.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:43.595
And so the tailor took
it upon himself to help.

00:33:43.595 --> 00:33:45.320
He knocked on the door.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:48.170
He kindly asked the soldier
to let the women go.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:52.740
And in response, he got hit on
the head with a mace and almost

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.660
got knocked out.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.340
So the tailor slowly
made his way back

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.780
to the mosque to pray
the late evening prayer.

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.130
And when he was done, he
tried to rally all those

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:05.620
in attendance to go
confront the Turkish soldier

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:08.449
and to free the woman.

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:10.900
The group agreed and they
went to the soldier's door.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.699
And then mayhem ensued.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:18.190
The soldier came out flanked
by a number of soldiers

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.830
around him.

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.090
And they all began beating
up this group of people who

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.620
had just come from the mosque.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:26.610
And they again hit the poor
tailor in the head, this time

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.800
injuring him even more.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.170
He barely recovered,
barely made it home.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.199
So the tailor was
annoyed to say the least.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:38.920
And so he thought,
what can I do?

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.310
So he devised a scheme.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:45.650
I bet if I were to make the
call to prayer early, the call

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.290
to the dawn prayer, the Turkish
soldier, who was clearly drunk,

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.820
would think the dawn
had come, in which case

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.489
he would release the
woman, not wanting

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.420
to be seen with her
in the light of day.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:01.470
Then he figured, that would
be the lesser of two evils.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:04.210
Both actions were
considered impermissible,

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.870
either him making the call to
prayer outside of its appointed

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:16.800
time or allowing a woman to
be raped by this soldier.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.860
Of the two, he figured
it was a lesser sin

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:25.550
to call for prayer outside
of its appointed time.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:29.810
And he may have had another
scheme in mind as well.

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.720
Because the police
chief immediately

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.970
asked why this man had made
this untimely call to prayer,

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:40.110
and commanded that he go
see the caliph immediately.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.440
So it was just as the
tailor wanted perhaps.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:47.050
He got an audience with the
caliph, who actually had power.

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:50.950
The caliph, [INAUDIBLE],
asked, well why did you

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:53.770
make the call to prayer
at the time that you did?

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:57.580
And the tailor recounted
the whole story,

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.520
to which the caliph
then ordered the police

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.236
chief to summon the Turkish
soldier and the woman

00:36:04.236 --> 00:36:04.735
immediately.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.050
The woman was
questioned separately.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.420
And she confirmed the tale
or the narrative of events

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.390
that the tailor had told.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.010
And then the soldier was
asked about what happened.

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:22.625
And even he confirmed
the narrative of events.

00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:24.900
And so the caliph
looked at him and said,

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.520
well are all the
stipends and the land

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.430
and the position that
you have from being

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.960
a senior soldier insufficient
to stop you from committing acts

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:37.170
of disobedience against
God, and from compromising

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:39.986
my power and my authority?

00:36:39.986 --> 00:36:44.240
And the soldier was at a loss,
unable to give an answer.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.700
The caliph then ordered
that he be shackled, beaten,

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.260
and eventually had him
executed and thrown

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.530
into the Tigris River.

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:59.010
The caliph concluded by saying
to the tailor, [ARABIC],

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.750
a term for wise man.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:05.350
Any wrongs you see,
whether large or small,

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.950
even if it's
against this person-

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:10.130
and he pointed to
his police chief--

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:15.790
please don't pass by it,
but stop by and forbid it.

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.890
And if anything happens to you
or is not accepted from you,

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:23.240
or if anyone violates the
law, the signal between us

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.060
will be that you'll
make the call to prayer

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.580
at a time like this.

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.360
And I will hear your
voice and summon you,

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.470
and do what I've
just done to whoever

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.320
does not agree with you.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.990
So news of this incident
and the caliphs admonition

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.880
spread amongst the
local officials

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.350
and the soldiers alike.

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:45.210
And from that day onward,
never did this tailor ask them

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:48.580
for anything, whether
to enforce the law

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.590
or to cease violating the law,
except that they obeyed him

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:55.060
without question and with
a great amount of deference

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.070
in the same way that the
soldier displayed when asked

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.570
to repay the merchant's debt.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.000
Then the tailor concluded
the case saying, never

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.080
have I needed to make an
untimely call to prayer again.

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.680
So such was the case.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.300
Where does the case come from?

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:20.000
Instead of an archive of
court records, which do not

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.480
exist for this early
period, the case

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.040
comes from a literary source.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.330
It's contained in one of
the work of the famous judge

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:32.690
and literary critic who hailed
from Baghdad in modern day

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:33.400
Iraq.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:38.000
His name was [INAUDIBLE]
Al-Muhassin al-Tanukhi,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.660
who died in 994.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.730
And this judge came from a
well known family of judges.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:49.040
Judgeships seem
to be hereditary.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.400
And they worked closely
with the Abbasid caliphs

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.190
in Baghdad and in
surrounding lands.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:59.810
He also had a front row
seat to unfolding plays

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:05.890
of law and society in both law
courts and in royal courts.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:09.430
So he's known less for
his explicitly legal works

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:13.670
than he is for his
literary compilations.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.810
And those literary
compilations are all court

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:22.250
focused anecdotes that provide
rich insight into themes

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.590
of early Islamic
law and society.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.350
There are two books in
particular that are important.

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:33.920
One is the book called Relief
After Adversity, [ARABIC].

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.340
And the second has
been translated

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:40.150
as Table Talk of a
Mesopotamian Judge, [ARABIC].

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.050
Both of these are at
the bottom of your sheet

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.960
under literary sources.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.620
So theses courts aren't
unique to Tanukhi, this judge.

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.980
The first known author of the
genre was {?_[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:58.370
who died in 894.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:03.240
And he wrote Collecting Cases
and Controversies of Relief

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.880
after Adversity, [ARABIC],
over a century before.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.870
But Tanukhi's work is the
most well known in the genre.

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:16.340
It's the most expansive and
it's the best preserved.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:22.270
And according to Tanukhi himself
in these works, he wrote down

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:27.310
or he compiled the work based
on written and oral informants,

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.620
and included stories about
contemporary officials, judges,

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.255
and other acquaintances
in the courts.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:39.190
So worth noting here is that
this source and the case

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:42.480
it depicts are atypical
sources of Islamic law,

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.640
unlike that of the
falsely accused butcher

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.930
from Islam's founding period,
which is found in some

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:51.910
of the early foundational text.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:54.130
But I want to suggest that
this case and other cases

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:56.820
like it nevertheless
did affect the jurists

00:40:56.820 --> 00:41:01.980
of the time in the construction
of Islamic law and procedure.

00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:06.380
And it did so through affecting
the readings of the earlier,

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:09.050
more precedential cases.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.730
From my reading of
multiple sources,

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.230
it seems that the judges
or the jurists circulating

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.960
in 10th century Baghdad
where these events reportedly

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.320
unfolded, they were
disturbed by at least

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.850
three aspects of the case.

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:26.070
First, there was a marked
departure from Islamic law,

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.940
and a marked lack of procedure.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.390
It was apparent in the
underlying case, the debt

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.930
repayment case,
that the judge had

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.500
no discretion or no
authority to enforce

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.480
the law of debt repayment.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.940
And more significantly,
in the second case

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:44.760
of the tailor and the
military sexual misconduct,

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.430
the caliphal court did
not appeal to the judge

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.580
or to any Muslim jurist to
decide the fate of the soldier.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.550
He didn't apply any
particularly robust procedures.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:42:00.580
And he didn't seem to
follow Islamic law at all.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:05.120
So second, the caliph asserted
absolute authority then

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.970
over the law in ways that were
at odds with the basic building

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:14.480
blocks of Islam law
that we covered.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.800
And those basic building
blocks were important

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.500
because they undergirded the
entire system of legitimacy

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.870
for the caliph himself.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:26.990
If he wasn't applying Islamic
law, as defined by the jurists,

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.290
then he didn't have
justification or legitimacy

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:34.180
to his rule.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.230
And that's just a statement
of the subtle understanding

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:43.010
of the sources of legitimacy
for early caliphs.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:46.200
And then third, and
perhaps most importantly,

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.170
the case arguably
exemplifies caliphal excesses

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.830
in punishment, to
which the response was

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:57.100
jurists' construction of
procedures at that time based

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:00.250
on earlier cases.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.970
So in executing the
man without what

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.480
we might call
Islamic due process,

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.190
the caliph was at odds with all
authorized Islamic punishments

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:11.370
for the crimes involved,
theft or failure

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:16.260
to repay debt, personal
injury, and rape.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:19.150
And his concern had more
to do with protecting

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:21.060
his own authority
than it had to do

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:27.470
with ensuring the Islamic
law basis for public order.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:30.140
And this was a thing
that was unacceptable

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.390
to the jurists
operating at that time.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:36.620
They responded by articulating
robust criminal procedures

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:39.650
to counter the caliphal
excesses in punishment.

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:49.090
So in short, the
case is important not

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:54.560
for its historic value as
to what actually happened,

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.345
but for the interpretive
output that it

00:43:57.345 --> 00:44:01.600
bore in the 10th century
with respect to early cases.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.360
It was used to define the
very procedure with respect

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.860
to ongoing controversies
that emerged

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:10.020
from episodes like the case
of the tailor and other cases.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.510
And obviously this is
from a literary source.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:19.230
And so it's not a report, most
likely, of an actual case.

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:23.770
But taken in the aggregate, such
cases reported in these sources

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:27.210
and others give us an idea
of the types of controversies

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:31.350
that were live at the time.

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:33.830
And judges, in response,
used it to buttress

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:37.670
the importance of procedure
for Islamic legitimacy.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:39.570
When the new rulers
in the 10th century

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:44.270
pressed for execution orders
or to otherwise violate

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.200
Islamic laws as they did
in the case of the tailor,

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.040
the procedures that the
jurists articulated in response

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:55.110
could be used by judges to
say that their hands were tied

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:59.750
by Islamic law, understood
not just as text,

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:03.670
but as text and procedures that
would prevent such executions.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.020
So with that background,
we're equipped

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:13.290
to circle back to the
question of the sources

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:18.470
for this overall
project on qadi justice

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:22.680
in which I think to map the
extent and growth of procedure.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.540
So returning to the
question I earlier posed,

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:29.290
what is the availability,
significance, and use

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:32.340
of a wide range of
sources for developing

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:36.010
the early history of Islamic
law through this sort of focus

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:37.405
on cases and controversies.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:43.240
In the doubt project,
I got an inkling

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.920
of the significance
and growth of procedure

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:50.760
in the course of uncovering an
obscure history of discretion

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.470
and doubt in Islamic
criminal law.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:55.930
This project on
qadi justice builds

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:59.130
on that one with a more direct
look at the significance

00:45:59.130 --> 00:46:00.910
of procedure and
the challenges it

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:04.190
poses to our understanding
of the meaning and operation

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.320
of early Islamic
law in criminal law,

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.030
but in other legal
contexts as well.

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.550
More specifically
in this project,

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.250
I will further explore the
development of procedure

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:16.770
and the ways in which
it informs the use

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:18.920
or inform the use of
discretion in context

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:23.720
that span criminal law, family
law, and commercial law.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:27.020
And I do so by appealing
to a wider range of sources

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:30.220
than does the typical
Islamic law scholar in order

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.115
to gain a richer sense of
the social and legal history.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.710
It is in that vein that
the cases and controversies

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:45.970
that we've discussed today
help provide vivid examples

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:48.550
of my overarching claim.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:50.750
And that is that
judges developed

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:55.070
a robust set of
procedures to help define

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.790
Islamic life in
response to changing

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:01.130
social and political
circumstances during Islam's

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:02.570
founding period.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:05.630
And these procedures,
moreover, were part and parcel

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:09.570
of Islamic law itself,
even though they're rarely

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:13.460
contained in the early
Islamic law books or manuals.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:20.120
So let me end then by
stepping back even farther

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.010
from the particular
subject matter at hand

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.580
to lay out the larger
picture into which

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.135
this project on qadi justice.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.240
And I'll say then a word
about law and society.

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:35.330
So scholars of law
and society commonly

00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:37.770
divide up the world
into spheres of law

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:41.860
in the books and law in action.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:45.100
And the dichotomy refers to
connections and disjunctions

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:48.670
between rules contained
in legislation

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:51.470
and other legal documentation
on the one hand,

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:55.790
and to real world events
on the other hand.

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:57.320
How is the
administration of justice

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.370
affected by
considerations like access

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:05.250
to courts, social status,
political context?

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.650
And reflexively, how
do these considerations

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:11.330
affect how laws are
made and modified

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:13.610
in the Islamic context?

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:15.350
So answers to
these questions are

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:18.220
essential for rounding out
the frame of any legal system

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:20.820
beyond the skeletal
composition written

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:22.992
on the pages of the law books.

00:48:22.992 --> 00:48:24.450
And they're also
the very questions

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:28.430
underlying debates
about the nature of law,

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.280
and particularly Islamic
law, to the extent

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.600
that this is a religious
legal system that

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.950
is in fact constructed, I
argue, by varied institutions

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:41.710
and evolving social
norms, despite the claims

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.860
to divine legal
origins and authority.

00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:52.060
Our contemporary view of courts
and of the lines connecting

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:56.290
them to society, to help shape
early Islamic legal history,

00:48:56.290 --> 00:48:59.880
it's hazy at best.

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.830
This book project
on qadi justice

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.380
aims to sharpen those
lines by examining

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.120
the inner workings of the
courts and the administration

00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.720
of Justice in Abbasid,
Baghdad, and surrounding lands

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.290
during this early
period of Islamic law.

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:17.070
And the court aims
are to investigate

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:18.930
the extent to which
judges constructed

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:21.890
a regular set of
procedures-- often

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:24.610
in the form of legal maxims
as we saw on the criminal law

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:28.630
context of the doubt cannon--
which in turn help construct

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.950
the operation of law.

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.640
The aim is also
to better identify

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.350
ways in which judges
drew on evolving

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:41.190
societal norms to
inform their conceptions

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:47.210
and their use of both procedure
and law, or procedure as law.

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:50.820
And finally it's to gauge the
extent of continuity and change

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.150
in the functional
use of procedure

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:54.960
as law over time and place.

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:01.560
So to be sure, this
approach differs radically

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.920
from the conventional narrative.

00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:06.920
As I noted earlier, the typical
understanding of Islamic law is

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.750
that it's a secret law,
in the words of Max Weber,

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:12.870
which cannot change through
human interpretation.

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:14.480
And indeed Muslim
judges and jurists

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.490
themselves claim simply to
execute divine legal text.

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.290
But then again,
what judge doesn't?

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:23.160
The United States
Supreme Court justices

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.830
claim not to insert
their own preferences

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.820
or to allow extra
legal considerations

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:32.070
into the law, preferring to
simply call balls and strikes,

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:35.080
as Chief Justice John Roberts
said during his confirmation

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:37.050
hearings.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:41.000
Scholars of constitutional
law, of legislation

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.380
and statutory
interpretation however,

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.000
have applied insights
from legal realism

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.010
and legal process, critical
theory, game theory,

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:54.470
and public choice, and the
lessons of historical method

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:57.970
to expose the fallacy
of neutrality,

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:01.250
the neutrality claim
in American law.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:05.600
And my book project seeks to
apply those same basic insights

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:08.700
and definitions of law to
the different structures,

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.000
histories, and
origins of Islam law,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.680
with a focus on the
construction of law

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.480
through procedure and
other social norms.

00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:21.510
So in conclusion,
in the end, I'm

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:26.660
in a sense arguing for a
redefinition of Islamic laws.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.680
Against conventional
narratives of it,

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.620
I contend that Islamic
law is not just

00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:34.950
a narrow range of
texts or textual rules,

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:38.590
but that it includes a
robust set of procedures

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:42.390
central to the actual definition
and operation of Islamic law.

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:45.950
And I further claim that those
procedures, and thus the law

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:50.220
itself, were dynamic,
both developed

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.690
in response to institutional
and social context.

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:55.490
And they change over time.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:59.230
Many we find elucidated
in some of the sources

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:01.940
we have for early
cases and controversies

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:06.010
that judges and jurists used
to construct Islamic law.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:07.950
The fact that
procedures often failed

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:10.770
to make their way into the
normative legal law book

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:12.870
should not obscure
the historical fact

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:16.890
of their existence or of
their prominence historically.

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:20.000
And this becomes clear only
if one examines a wider

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.390
array of sources for Islamic law
than has been done previously,

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:26.890
the way historians and
lawyers are trained to do.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:29.910
If this revised notion of
qadi justice that I tackle

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:32.480
in this new project
means anything,

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.500
it calls for rethinking
the methods, and thus

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.820
the history and
content of Islamic laws

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:43.140
to encompass more sources
and more procedure.

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:43.640
Thank you.
