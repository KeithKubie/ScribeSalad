psychiatrist who years before a decade

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279
psychiatrist who years before a decade
 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.269
psychiatrist who years before a decade
ago was telling us that the real action

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279
ago was telling us that the real action
 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.790
ago was telling us that the real action
in the brain is while the brains at rest

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800
in the brain is while the brains at rest
 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.250
in the brain is while the brains at rest
not while the brain is doing stuff and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.260
not while the brain is doing stuff and
 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.200
not while the brain is doing stuff and
so you have to understand that when we

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210
so you have to understand that when we
 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.670
so you have to understand that when we
were trying to find we're looking for

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680
were trying to find we're looking for
 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.470
were trying to find we're looking for
the biomarker we're looking for the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480
the biomarker we're looking for the
 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.750
the biomarker we're looking for the
equivalent of a blood test if you come

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760
equivalent of a blood test if you come
 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.950
equivalent of a blood test if you come
into a doctor's office and you're

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960
into a doctor's office and you're
 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.160
into a doctor's office and you're
coughing and you have a chest cold and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170
coughing and you have a chest cold and
 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.729
coughing and you have a chest cold and
the cold makes you feel terrible we can

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739
the cold makes you feel terrible we can
 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.740
the cold makes you feel terrible we can
do a blood test and tell you whether or

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750
do a blood test and tell you whether or
 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.650
do a blood test and tell you whether or
not it's a virus or if it's bacterial if

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660
not it's a virus or if it's bacterial if
 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.850
not it's a virus or if it's bacterial if
it's bacterial we give you antibiotics

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860
it's bacterial we give you antibiotics
 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.060
it's bacterial we give you antibiotics
if the virus we just wait for the virus

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070
if the virus we just wait for the virus
 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.190
if the virus we just wait for the virus
to die you will live longer than the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200
to die you will live longer than the
 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.260
to die you will live longer than the
virus so we give you stuff to make you

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270
virus so we give you stuff to make you
 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.939
virus so we give you stuff to make you
feel better with it's Tylenol or it's

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949
feel better with it's Tylenol or it's
 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.920
feel better with it's Tylenol or it's
aspirin it's plenty of fluids but

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930
aspirin it's plenty of fluids but
 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.290
aspirin it's plenty of fluids but
there's no medicine to make it go away

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300
there's no medicine to make it go away
 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.369
there's no medicine to make it go away
we don't have that in psychiatry that's

the Holy Grail

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160

what's the biomarker and so very when

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159
what's the biomarker and so very when
 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.609
what's the biomarker and so very when
the MRI came in or the cat scan first

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619
the MRI came in or the cat scan first
 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.300
the MRI came in or the cat scan first
but the MRI became the new way to look

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310
but the MRI became the new way to look
 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.039
but the MRI became the new way to look
at the brain these neuro imaging tools

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049
at the brain these neuro imaging tools
 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.530
at the brain these neuro imaging tools
and so first came the structural MRI to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540
and so first came the structural MRI to
 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.070
and so first came the structural MRI to
look at how does the brain how is it

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080
look at how does the brain how is it
 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.109
look at how does the brain how is it
built and is it built differently in

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119
built and is it built differently in
 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.510
built and is it built differently in
people who have a certain psychiatric

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520
people who have a certain psychiatric
 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.240
people who have a certain psychiatric
illness versus normal versus someone

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250
illness versus normal versus someone
 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.230
illness versus normal versus someone
with a different kind of psychiatric

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240
with a different kind of psychiatric
 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.240
with a different kind of psychiatric
illness and while that gave us some

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250
illness and while that gave us some
 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.289
illness and while that gave us some
hints as group differences it wasn't as

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299
hints as group differences it wasn't as
 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.080
hints as group differences it wasn't as
specific as the functional MRI which can

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090
specific as the functional MRI which can
 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.969
specific as the functional MRI which can
actually take a look at your brain and

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979
actually take a look at your brain and
 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.810
actually take a look at your brain and
see how it works now originally we would

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820
see how it works now originally we would
 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.590
see how it works now originally we would
put kids or adults into this machine and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600
put kids or adults into this machine and
 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.960
put kids or adults into this machine and
have them do a task so that if you were

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970
have them do a task so that if you were
 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.420
have them do a task so that if you were
at a social anxiety disorder and so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430
at a social anxiety disorder and so
 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.730
at a social anxiety disorder and so
mediate seeing faces that you knew

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740
mediate seeing faces that you knew
 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.130
mediate seeing faces that you knew
versus faces that you didn't know should

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140
versus faces that you didn't know should
 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.539
versus faces that you didn't know should
activate different parts of your brain

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549
activate different parts of your brain
 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.730
activate different parts of your brain
and it was very hard to find a

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740
and it was very hard to find a
 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.429
and it was very hard to find a
difference when you when you showed

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439
difference when you when you showed
 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.460
difference when you when you showed
these these tasks or made these tasks

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470
these these tasks or made these tasks
 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.559
these these tasks or made these tasks
and so what happened was Castellanos

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569
and so what happened was Castellanos
 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.320
and so what happened was Castellanos
said this is kind of like the post

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330
said this is kind of like the post
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.230
said this is kind of like the post
office when the post office is closed

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
office when the post office is closed
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.090

there's a lot of action going on there

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100
there's a lot of action going on there
 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.400
there's a lot of action going on there
that's when people are talking to each

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
that's when people are talking to each
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.960
that's when people are talking to each
other they're moving bags of mail

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970
other they're moving bags of mail
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.150
other they're moving bags of mail
they're organizing themselves when the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160
they're organizing themselves when the
 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.670
they're organizing themselves when the
window comes up to sell you the stamps

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680
window comes up to sell you the stamps
 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.460
window comes up to sell you the stamps
or to accept your mail there's really a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470
or to accept your mail there's really a
 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.950
or to accept your mail there's really a
lot less action going on so he basically

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960
lot less action going on so he basically
 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.470
lot less action going on so he basically
said the brain is talking to itself all

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
said the brain is talking to itself all
 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.780
said the brain is talking to itself all
the time when it's resting when it's

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
the time when it's resting when it's
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.550
the time when it's resting when it's
sleeping and we must have you can tell

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
sleeping and we must have you can tell
 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.560
sleeping and we must have you can tell
the difference between the way the brain

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570
the difference between the way the brain
 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.770
the difference between the way the brain
speaks to itself when you have ADHD or

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780
speaks to itself when you have ADHD or
 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.450
speaks to itself when you have ADHD or
when you have depression or if your

therefore he has been been able to find
 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.420
therefore he has been been able to find
a section of the brain where you can

a section of the brain where you can
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.000
a section of the brain where you can
actually see a difference that he

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010
actually see a difference that he
