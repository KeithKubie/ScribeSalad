00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.800
Before we represent those sentences in the language of logic, let us consider

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.280
another example of conceptual knowledge and its relationship to logic first. So

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.410
here is a concept of four. We have come across this earlier.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.760
They were a block and a block and a brick at the bottom and a brick at the top.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.680
And some relationship between these objects. Given this conceptual knowledge

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.740
about foo we can ask ourselves, what are the sufficient conditions for

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.370
something to be a foo? Here are several choices. Please mark all of those

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.000
choices that together make for sufficient conditions for the concept of foo
