00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.979
Ever since the Franco-Prussian
War in 1870 to 1871,

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:06.520
the Germans recognized
that they were

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.320
likely to face another
war with France.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.750
That was the war that
allowed Germany to unify.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.840
They humiliated France.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.460
They were able to capture
some very valuable territory

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.520
from France, in particular
Alsace and Lorraine,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.220
which is very mineral rich.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.109
And so the Germans were
plotting too, well,

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.650
what are we going to do if we
get into another war with them?

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.370
At the same time, once France
and Russia had this alliance,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.580
Germany fully recognized if
there is a war with France,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.420
it's likely to not
be just with France.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.290
It's likely to be
a two front war.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.160
On the Western Front, they'll
be in conflict with France.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.600
And on the Eastern
Front, they'll

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.530
be in conflict with Russia.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.160
And so to deal with
this eventuality--

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.701
this is all the
scheming that Germany

00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:46.590
did in the decades
going up to World War

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.230
I-- they came up with
the Schlieffen Plan.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.700
And I'm sure I'm
mispronouncing it.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.735
Named for Alfred
von Schlieffen, he

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:02.620
was chief of the German
Empire's general staff

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.810
from 1891 to 1905.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.330
And it was based on how do
you deal with a two front war?

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.030
And the general ides
here were that Russia

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.600
had a large and almost
inexhaustible army.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.201
But because it was so large it
would take a long time for it

00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:18.700
to mobilize.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.840
And the Germans are actually
able to approximate it

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.140
correctly because
this is how long it

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.514
did take the
Russians to mobilize

00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:31.710
at the beginning of World War
I. They estimated that it would

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.080
take them about six weeks.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.360
So the Schlieffen Plan called
for enough German troops

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.620
on the Eastern Front,
initially, in order

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.020
to keep the Russians at bay.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.780
But then the main fighting
force of the Germans,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.180
while the Russians
are mobilizing,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.330
is to go after France and try
to essentially knock France out

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.760
of commission, so that
they're not facing a two front

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.120
war anymore.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.710
And then have those
troops go back

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.630
to fight against the Russians.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.490
And the way that
they wanted to do it

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.971
is by rolling through Belgium in
a wheel like pattern like this.

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.470
And the reason why they wanted
to do this wheel like pattern

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.210
is that they correctly
predicted that the French were

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.140
very eager to get this
territory right over here.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.640
And the French
actually had a plan--

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.370
they called it
Plan 17- for going

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.530
after Alsace and Lorraine.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.000
It was an offensive plan.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.970
And the view is if
the French army is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.210
going in that direction,
if the German army

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.900
rolls through Belgium and is
able to get them from the rear,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.790
they could put the French
army out of commission.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.330
So in early August
1914, the Germans,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.770
once they declared war
on France and on Russia,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.380
the Germans tried to put the
Schlieffen Plan into action.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.220
And they frankly,
almost succeeded.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.530
So through August
and early September,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.470
the Germans were able
to essentially roll

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.740
through Belgium and keep the
combined, mainly French forces,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.030
but there was also some
assistance from British,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.350
to keep them on their heels.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.650
And this happened all the
way until early September

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.870
when they get near the
Marne, or a little bit

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.020
past the Marne River in France.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.930
And it was here that
the Sixth French Army--

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.070
and when we talk
about armies we're

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.860
talking about huge
numbers of troops.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.790
The Sixth French Army had
over 200,000 troops in it.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.940
When we're talking about
the Battle of the Marne--

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.730
which I'm about to talk to you.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.150
We're talking about the
first Battle of the Marne.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.440
We're talking
about a battle that

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.210
involves two million troops.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.250
So these are battles that are
occurring on an epic scale.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.770
Just each of these
armies-- this army

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.190
or this one, or even the
German armies-- we're

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.880
talking about tens to hundreds
of thousands of troops.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.110
In general, an army
characterize you're

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.260
talking about over
50,000, 60,000 troops.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.020
So what happens as you go to
early September, especially

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.350
September 5, 1914,
the Sixth French Army

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.260
recognizes a mistake that
the First German Army made.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.150
By trying to roll
around like this,

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.670
they exposed their right flank.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.960
So right over here would be the
right flank of the German army.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.820
And just as most
mammals, our flanks

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.339
are our weak spot, that
area between your ribs

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.710
and your hips, the same
thing is true for armies.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.900
The front of the
army tends to be

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.960
where you have the
strongest forces.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.380
And then you have your
supply routes going back.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.300
So if you can outflank
an army-- and that's

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.290
what a lot of military
strategy is designed around--

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.960
you can hit an army
in its weaker points.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.740
So by September 5, the First
German Army recognized this,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.590
but it was too late.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.840
By September 6, they
were essentially

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.900
being confronted by
the Sixth French Army.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.330
And by essentially
turning to meet them

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.180
they created an opening between
them and the Second German

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.680
Army.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.100
And that opening was able--
the French and the British

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.980
were able to take advantage
of that to essentially put

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.680
the Germans on their heels
after a month of advancing.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.660
And so right over here, you
have the various French armies.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.110
And they were assisted by the
British expeditionary force.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.090
And so from the Battle
of the Marne, which

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.590
was essentially, most historians
would say, between September 6,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.880
or September 5, September
6 and September 12,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.480
they were able to put the
Germans on the retreat.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.942
The Germans retreated
past the Aisne River.

00:05:37.942 --> 00:05:39.400
And then once you
get into November

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.150
and the end of the year of
1914, the Germans essentially

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.810
entrenched themselves.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.520
They were literally
building deep trenches

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.930
in northern France and a
little bit of western Belgium.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.910
And what I have
right over here-- let

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.910
me see if I can draw it.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.076
What I have right over here,
what the boundaries are

00:05:57.076 --> 00:06:00.110
eventually happened
after the Germans

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.140
suffered, essentially,
their first big defeat.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.950
They had to retreat and they
had to literally retrench.

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.510
And this is what the
borders would then be like.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.490
And these were literally
trenches getting dug here.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.130
This first stage of the
war was hugely dynamic.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.750
You had armies
moving fairly rapidly

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.090
over a period of
weeks and months.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.940
But then once the
Germans retrenched,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.290
you have roughly this position
being static for the next three

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.410
years and the famous trench
warfare of the Western front

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.140
that you might have
seen movies on.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.430
And I want to emphasize
this was a big deal.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.780
The first Battle of
the Marne-- sometimes

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.560
it's called the
Miracle of the Marne--

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.610
if the French,
with British help,

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.640
were not able to push
the Germans back,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.640
they might have accomplished
the Schlieffen Plan

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.960
and actually maybe would
have won World War I,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.610
or at least been able to win the
Western front fairly quickly.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.680
And then been able to
deal with the Russians

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.920
a little bit better.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.251
But because of the
Miracle at the Marne--

00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:00.250
which was hugely bloody.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.480
We're talking about 500,000
casualties on both sides.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.090
We're talking 100,000 to
200,000 dead on both sides.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.140
But because of that, that was
able to hold off the Germans.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.880
But it got the Western front
into this ugly three year

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.871
long trench warfare.
