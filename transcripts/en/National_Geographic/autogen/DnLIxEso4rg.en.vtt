really such a powerful feeling to know

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
really such a powerful feeling to know
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.570
really such a powerful feeling to know
that we're actually being able to

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
that we're actually being able to
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.480
that we're actually being able to
manipulate space and time and it's

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490
manipulate space and time and it's
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.700
manipulate space and time and it's
exciting because this shows that we may

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
exciting because this shows that we may
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.189
exciting because this shows that we may
be able to control time and that means

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199
be able to control time and that means
 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.630
be able to control time and that means
that ultimately we may be able to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
that ultimately we may be able to
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.160

that light could be used to control
 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.560
that light could be used to control
gravity and since gravity controls time

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570
gravity and since gravity controls time
 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.900
gravity and since gravity controls time
then that meant that I could use light

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910
then that meant that I could use light
 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.570
then that meant that I could use light
to control time and that's the basis of
