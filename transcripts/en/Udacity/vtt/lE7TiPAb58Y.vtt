00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.940
We've talked about slope and
we've talked about the horizontal and

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.810
vertical lines.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.290
So let's bring the two together now.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.860
And let's see if we can find
the slope of this horizontal line,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.321
whose equation it looks like is y = 3.

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:16.480
So like I've been doing, I'm going to
pick two points in this line.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.086
Let's do this one,
which looks like it's -2,3, and

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:24.470
this one, which looks like it's 2,3.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.050
Now to find the slope,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.010
I need to compare the vertical
change to the horizontal change.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.510
The rise to the run.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.160
And when I do that, well, look,
there's no vertical change, none at all.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.444
So the rise is 0, and
I divide that by the run,

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:43.650
which in this case is; 1, 2, 3, 4, 0/4.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.860
So the slope is 0.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.480
So I'm going to give you three lines.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.073
So for each of these three lines,
I want you to identify the slope as

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:57.879
positive, negative or zero.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.120
So you can just enter in either
a plus sign, a minus sign or 0.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.379
And you can do that in
the appropriate box.
