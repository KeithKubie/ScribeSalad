00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.040
We spend a lot of time trying to change other people.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.020
There is, after all, so much wrong with them:

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.000
they’re selfish, arrogant, bullying, weak, cold, needy and so on.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.880
So we try to point some of this stuff out

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.100
and often meet with resistance, denial or sheer indifference.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.200
This can be very agitating

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.360
and hence renders us cross and severe.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.360
Why won’t people take our lessons on board?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.240
In our behaviour, we tend to be making an implicit distinction between two projects:

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.940
getting other people to change – and changing ourselves.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.200
We know we may have to develop in certain ways, but for now, our focus is on altering others.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.720
We make an evolution in our own behaviour conditional on evolutions in other people’s.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.480
We vow that we’ll be nicer if they’re nicer, that we’ll be less strident if they give up shouting.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.900
However, we’re prone to miss an important insight:

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:03.680
changing how you behave to others can be the fastest way to alter how others behave towards you.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.920
People tend – to a remarkable extent – to mirror behaviour.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.220
If someone is aggressive around them, they become aggressive back.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.200
If someone is gentle, they become soft in return.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.560
If someone acts wisely, it’ll draw any latent reserves of wisdom out of the audience.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.680
We’re often in the paradoxical position of advocating one kind of behaviour while making use of quite another.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.100
We might quite angrily suggest that someone else calm down.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.460
Or we may bullyingly insist to a person that they try to be more empathetic.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.400
We deserve sympathy.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.140
It’s the agitation and anxiety of trying to teach that can easily take us far from the behaviour we’re advocating.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.560
Here it bears to remember a saying

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.700
often falsely attributed to Mahatma Gandhi though eminently useful nevertheless:

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.740
"Be the change you want to see."

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.720
It captures something key:

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.120
how sensible it may often be to give up on teaching directly in order to try teach by example.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.460
This has one great advantage:

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.000
we can control ourselves while it’s remarkably hard to exert any sort of direct control over anyone else.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.860
Our disappointment with other people

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.800
should be redirected towards exerting control over the one thing we can reliably command:

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.780
ourselves.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:28.160
Seeing us exhibiting certain virtues has a remarkable ability to inspire others into imitating us.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.480
And even if change is not immediate,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.680
we can at least take pride in the integrity of our position,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.300
knowing that we've had the strength and dignity already to started to become the change we want to see.
