00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.470
 This year you have the opportunity to go to Davos for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 And make your idea. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 My name is Rebeccea McQuigg 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
 I'm Julia Lalla-Maharajh 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Hi I'm Sloane Berrent 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500
 I was chosen to go to Davos in 2009 to attend Davos 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.900
 I was in 2010 MySpace Wallstreet Official Citizen Journalist 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.900
 I was elected in 2010 to attend Davos 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.900
 One of the key issues of this year's agenda is how everyone can benefit from economic prosperity - including growth 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
 Did you know that the global economy is worth over $ 70 trillion, 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.500
 And yet more than 3 billion people live for less than $ 2.00 a day? How can we close this hole? 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 Upload and submit your video that describes an idea that you think can drive inclusive growth. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 If your idea is chosen, you have the opportunity to present it in front of people who can make it a reality.
