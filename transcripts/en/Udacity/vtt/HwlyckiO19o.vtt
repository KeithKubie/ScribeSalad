Based on data from competitors at the expo, Grant thinks that he will sell

00:00:04.099 --> 00:00:08.356
14,000 wiper sets in a month if he let's them cost $20 per set. And he thinks it

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:12.555
will sell 2000 in a month if he let's them cost $80 each. I'd like you to write

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:17.043
an equation in slope-intercept form that relates the number of wiper sets sold

00:00:17.043 --> 00:00:21.287
to the price per wiper set. I'd like you to use this information to write an

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:25.977
equation in slope-intercept form that relates the number of wiper sets sold in a

00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:27.990
month to the price per wiper set.
