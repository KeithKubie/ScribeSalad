how fine,

10
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.540

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:12.510
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

15
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.510
I carried your oxygen and you walked beside me through the lobby commenting on

16
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.790
the decor when you needed to stop for breath.

17
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.170
Your hand ran light and steady

18
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.570
by the ocean of breath twice. I remember

19
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.620
I carried your oxygen. He was heavy.

20
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.000

<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

22
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.720
<v 2>this hour is a collaboration with poets like the ones you heard in while you're</v>

23
00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:58.270
more of musicians, reporters,

24
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.890
and of course the periodic table of elements. Speaking of which,

25
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.350
<v 0>I'm pretty sure Soren Wheeler,</v>

26
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.270
who's sodium spark brain conceive to this entire show, he will lead us off.

27
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.360
So this one starts with a story I heard from Jamie Lowe.

28
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.730
She's a writer in Brooklyn.

29
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.960
And at the heart of this story is this particular 24 hour period in Jamie's life

30
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:24.820
that um, she is uneasy about have, let's just set it up for one second.

31
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:28.900
So what are we about to watch? I'm not actually exactly sure where it starts,

32
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.010
but we're about to watch, I think the night before Valentine's Day,

33
00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:37.870
2001 I eventually convinced her to sit down with producer Latif Nasser and sort

34
00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:40.710
of just walk us through the tape. Go for it. You're,

35
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:45.420
you're in control there with the space bar. Alright. Yeah man,

36
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.680
you're on [inaudible] your starts.

37
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.650
It's nighttime. Uh, Jamie and her friend Mike,

38
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:56.710
he's the one filming there outside his apartment in Brooklyn and the cameras

39
00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:59.870
pointed at a bunch of high school students who were just walking by.

40
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.340
So it's a deal. So you want to be

41
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.360
<v 2>an actress, right? Yeah, I love that.</v>

42
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.220
So yeah. Really? Yeah. That's so cool. It was by any other name would smell is

43
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.770
my enemy though. Not a month ago. What's Montague? It is nor hand,

44
00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:23.670
nor foot, nor on north face, nor any of the [inaudible]

45
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.600
<v 0>on the camera. I'm like egging them on to recite it.</v>

46
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.150
<v 2>Retain the dear perfection, which she owes with that,</v>

47
00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:34.970
that title and Romeo [inaudible] name and for their name,

48
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.760
which is no part of the take on my [inaudible].

49
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.490
<v 0>This isn't a part of that. Sam Screaming, um,</v>

50
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.170
no wait, I load his camera eventually turns to Jamie.

51
00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:49.340
She's sitting on the stoop, a huge curly hair, wide eyes,

52
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.740
and she starts to sing the kids a song.

53
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.450
<v 2>It does, you know</v>

54
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.853
[inaudible] right,

55
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.140
<v 0>and we're pretty convinced that I was like a great singer and rapper.</v>

56
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.000
She liked to sound a little voice. You sing a lot in. No,

57
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.470
never, never.

58
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.020
<v 2>I just started thinking like that. I don't know. What was it like [inaudible]</v>

59
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.510
<v 0>it was fun to watch people react or she made people really happy wherever she</v>

60
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:21.344
went.

61
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.850
She went to flea markets and she would talk to people and she would pull this

62
00:04:25.851 --> 00:04:28.610
spark out of them. It, it just felt like New York loved her.

63
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.740
That's Mike Ryan Guy Holding the camera yet he'd only met Jamie just three weeks

64
00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:34.101
earlier,

65
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:37.520
not long after he moved to New York and they pretty much instantly became

66
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:41.030
friends. She was so positive.

67
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.190
Now married, as I recall. She's talking to some little kids on a stoop,

68
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.690
but then that next four or five hours was pretty defining.

69
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.920
Yeah, by camera. Okay. Cut to Mike's apartment.

70
00:04:55.921 --> 00:05:00.570
I think you're just walking around and Umbra and open dress,

71
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.660
sparkly red bra and plastic bag.

72
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.860
Plastic bag on the stomach. Belly dancing.

73
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.420
You might have to shield your eyes. Okay. There we go. That's boring.

74
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.170
Four hours.

75
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.610
<v 1>That's my case. Sleeping. Oh boy.</v>

76
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.710
Combining. It's Valentine's Day. 2001

77
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.380
that's come quotes and other codos the Kumquats I picked with my grandpa and

78
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.640
then come Quechee hope three or four days ago. And that's kind of true.

79
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.260
There's three breakfast bows.

80
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.820
<v 0>What is all that stuff? [inaudible] cutting board that cut up power bars</v>

81
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.031
<v 1>from the president.</v>

82
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:47.530
I gave you tidying the cup of wine that we're going to drink and a cup of wine

83
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:49.390
of course at seven 40 in the morning.

84
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.250
So do you need a nap or anything at noon or do you just keep pumping? Oh,

85
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:57.860
here's a dollar. Keep pouring my ink. Sure. Jamie,

86
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.720
<v 6>what's going to happen today? Today, I'm going to contact him to,</v>

87
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.920
to debate core flesh nadir or rock 10. Fidel Castro.

88
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.520
Yeah. He's an amazing man.

89
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.520
Sushil okay. I'm going to have to be about, um, can be about anything,

90
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.190
right? I didn't think those scientists, this one. Yeah. Fair in chocolate.

91
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.283
<v 5>Where were you?</v>

92
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.720
What were you meaning that literally that you were going to go on MTV intubate

93
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.890
Gore v Bush or [inaudible]

94
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.070
<v 0>and then that is exactly what I had in mind for the day.</v>

95
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.810
<v 5>I thought it was make-believe. It seemed harmless.</v>

96
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.650
It just didn't occur to me that what I was seeing with somebody who had deviated

97
00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:43.190
substantially from who they wanted to be.

98
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.260
<v 6>I had to change the world. Jesus Christ. Eventually Mike got up,</v>

99
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.110
<v 5>I had to go to work.</v>

100
00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:53.550
Jamie took off for a while and then later that day she showed up at his office

101
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.600
and at first everything seemed sort of fine, but within 20 minutes she said,

102
00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:01.230
hey, tell you what, can we go to the roof really fast?

103
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.163
<v 6>What?</v>

104
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.140
<v 5>And that immediately</v>

105
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.760
<v 6>got me uncomfortable. Yeah.</v>

106
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.480
<v 0>So, okay, over pants, flo wrap around skirt.</v>

107
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.580
We are now going to the roof. Are you ready to be blown up your feet?

108
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.640
You can hear he is done.

109
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:29.450
Like the day has been insane. This isn't the end of that day.

110
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.070
Snowy seventh avenue roof type.

111
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.870
<v 6>What do you, what does this anything,</v>

112
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.440
what is that what he said? Yarn.

113
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.413
Mr. Bryan

114
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.113
tonight.

115
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.410
Can I have to work

116
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.330
on top of the world at the World Trade Center

117
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.070
if you want tonight.

118
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.253
January.

119
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.160
<v 0>That's the end. At that point he was like done. We're done.</v>

120
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.443
<v 6>Wow.</v>

121
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.710
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

122
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.630
<v 5>yeah, that's when it, it hit me that um,</v>

123
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.310
there is no way that any of this reflects what she would actually want.

124
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.570
I don't know if delusional is a kind word here and if it's not, I apologize.

125
00:08:47.571 --> 00:08:52.010
But if she's delusional enough to think that we should get married,

126
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.470
is she delusional enough to think she can fly it?

127
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.400
Will she be distraught when I say no? No. And will she,

128
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.210
would she jump? And so I lowered the camera and I said,

129
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.580
I'm afraid of heights and I want to go downstairs immediately.

130
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.840
And I felt for the first time just fear. And I called her,

131
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.760
I believe I called her mother first. Leann and I just said, my name is Mike.

132
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.190
I'm a friend of Jamie's and um, I,

133
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.120
I think she may be going through something and I don't know what I'm dealing

134
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:22.470
with. I'm in over my head here.

135
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.670
<v 7>When Mike called, I, uh,</v>

136
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.990
I just got on a red eye that night. That's Leanne Lantos,

137
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:31.853
Jamie's mom.

138
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.950
It was my job to get her to go back to her therapist so that we could get some

139
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:40.920
medication in her for the end. This episode was not entirely a surprise.

140
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:45.210
It had happened once before when Jamie was in high school. At that time,

141
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.110
she was not sleeping at night, spinning around the room,

142
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:54.111
talking nonstop about how she had to save Central America from disaster.

143
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.270
During that first episode,

144
00:09:57.271 --> 00:10:01.470
Jamie ended up at a place called the neuropsychiatric institute at UCLA and she

145
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:05.490
ended up being treated by this guy, Dr Mark de Antonio. He's a psychiatrist.

146
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:10.350
She was in a very acute, manic, psychotic state.

147
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.460
<v 0>I remember being sort of tackled by nurses to actually take my meds because I</v>

148
00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:21.410
refused to. We didn't know if we would ever see our Jamie again. You know,

149
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:26.180
that was, that was the scariest part. Everyone around me I think was really,

150
00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:29.300
really worried that I wouldn't come back.

151
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.580
<v 7>But she did come back and it's what brought her back.</v>

152
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.210
That is actually the reason I got so interested in this story.

153
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.640
So shortly after she was admitted, uh,

154
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.720
Dr de Antonio told Jamie's parents know what this is and we know how to treat

155
00:10:42.721 --> 00:10:47.250
it. And he said, she's a classic case of, of bipolar. I,

156
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:49.500
there was no question, and I'm,

157
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.980
the drug of choice is lithium,

158
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.140
which is not even a drug, but just this salt.

159
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.680
And he's explained to us, um, you know, that she would need to, um,

160
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.470
take three tablets of lithium,

161
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.390
three tablets of the salt and it could bring her back when it works.

162
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.860
It's just remarkable.

163
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.920
Do you have memories of like what it was like to come back like that,

164
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.900
what you were thinking or what it felt like?

165
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.730
<v 0>Hi. It's really hard to describe.</v>

166
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.760
It's a little bit of like a slow realization of, uh,

167
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:32.600
of like, oh, that was a weird thing that I did a week ago.

168
00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:34.190
Like why did I do that?

169
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.870
The first time she was actually lucid and coming back to herself again.

170
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:44.270
The first words out of her mouth were, mom, it's not.

171
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.780
<v 7>Hm. And I just, uh, that just killed me</v>

172
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.010
a few weeks. It

173
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.340
<v 0>was like the incident never happened. It's so bizarre.</v>

174
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.550
I mean I felt like here was this thing that's assault that I get to just take

175
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.840
three of a day. And, and that was it. Totally normal,

176
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.390
no side effects, no issues.

177
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.410
She went off to college and just like flourish and it was great.

178
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.370
Things were good for a long time. And then after about six years, she said,

179
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:21.160
you know, I've been on this pill for six years. I've had no problems.

180
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.610
I'd like to go off it. Why don't we try to go off gradually?

181
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:28.330
Then about a month after she was totally off lithium, she was whack

182
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.690
<v 7>in Mike's apartment up all night. You were so tired just a minute ago.</v>

183
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.510
That's cause he told me I had to leave, but now I'm still here.

184
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.970
ISI totally manic episode all over cause I am whatever you say I am.

185
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.303
That's it.

186
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.310
One of the things that kind of makes the lithium that affected lithium has so

187
00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:52.820
spooky and you hear this from a lot of people that have taken lithium to treat

188
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.893
bipolar,

189
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:58.100
is that lithium itself is so simple.

190
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.040
<v 8>Lithium is an element, right?</v>

191
00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:05.130
It's a single atom. This is Ben Lilly, he's a writer,

192
00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.600
runs the story collider podcast.

193
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:09.720
He's had some personal experience with psychiatric drugs and he's written about

194
00:13:09.721 --> 00:13:10.470
lithium.

195
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:15.470
That to me was fascinating that that a single atom can change what we think of

196
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.160
who we are. I mean it's not even not just Adam, it's Adam number three.

197
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:25.110
It's the third element in the table. It's one of the simplest Adam's right,

198
00:13:25.111 --> 00:13:28.290
so we have these just three protons, four neutrons, three electrons.

199
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.770
That's a pretty simple matter. I mean it doesn't get much. It really is.

200
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.590
This had never struck me when I was on Lexapro or Wellbutrin,

201
00:13:34.591 --> 00:13:37.140
which was the other one they put me on. You know, if you look at them,

202
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.720
they look like what you expect a pharmaceutical drug to look like.

203
00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:43.800
There's a ring of carbon atoms and some other things stuck on that and they look

204
00:13:43.801 --> 00:13:44.490
like these

205
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:49.200
<v 7>big complex molecules and you're like, Oh yeah, I'm complex, my brains complex.</v>

206
00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:53.790
It takes this complicated thing to change it and then you're confronted with

207
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.190
just this Adam. It was found by accident that it works. You'd get,

208
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.430
it's not complicated to make us just assault that you distill out and yet it has

209
00:14:02.431 --> 00:14:04.620
this profound effect.

210
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.610
<v 8>The other thing I know about lithium that is that is profoundly weird,</v>

211
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.590
is that you're not just saying my mind,

212
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:16.480
my personality is being changed by an Adam.

213
00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.920
It's been changed by an Adam that was created directly in the [inaudible],

214
00:14:19.921 --> 00:14:21.000
the big bang itself.

215
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:26.220
So you have this Adam formed in the big bang goes through whatever it does,

216
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.970
winding path to come onto the earth, gets dug up,

217
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
turned into a pill given to someone and that changes their affect in the world.

218
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.550
And that to me is, is just,

219
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.020
it's this profound reminder that the,

220
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.280
the forces that shape everything in the universe are the same as the forces that

221
00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:51.260
are shaping who we are and what we do and, and what our identity is.

222
00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.760
<v 0>And it's possible that these forces shape not just the people with bipolar</v>

223
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:56.241
disorder,

224
00:14:56.241 --> 00:14:59.930
but all of us think it was a woman ended up talking to a clinical psychiatrist

225
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:04.850
and a fellows who told me about these studies. Huge epidemiologic studies.

226
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.510
Biggest one I think was in Japan, one in Austria, one was in Greece,

227
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.540
famous one in Texas in which they looked at communities that different levels of

228
00:15:13.701 --> 00:15:17.720
lithium, lithium in the water supply, and we're talking about tiny,

229
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.000
tiny amounts, micro grams.

230
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.600
Those are a thousandth of the amount and a milligram.

231
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:25.400
If you think of like a pill of lithium,

232
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.070
well we're talking about amounts like 10000th of a pill.

233
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.080
Like that's the amount that we're dealing with here.

234
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:34.940
And these studies found by and large in towns that had a tiny bit more lithium

235
00:15:34.941 --> 00:15:39.941
in than water suicide rates were lower in some cases as much as 30% wow.

236
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.630
I should say the Texas study,

237
00:15:41.631 --> 00:15:46.631
which is Stano Xing also shows a that the towns that have the highest lithium

238
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:52.040
level have lower felonies, thefts,

239
00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.750
rapes, and these are reputable, published studies. Nope.

240
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:59.360
These studies are, you know, only showing us correlations,

241
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:03.260
but there does at least seem to be some kind of connection and it may be if

242
00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:06.440
there is a connection, what the hell is it doing? Do they know why

243
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:11.320
<v 7>works in the brain? Like do they know what it does? Well, essentially no,</v>

244
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:16.030
it's still kind of a mystery. One of them. But here's a mark d Antonio's theory

245
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.590
<v 9>because he says,</v>

246
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.780
we know that bipolar disorder involves a defect in a certain part of the brain.

247
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.810
It's an area of the brain that has to do with controlling mood.

248
00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:33.010
So believe it or not, there's neurons in the brain that keep your mood.

249
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.420
Even these neurons,

250
00:16:34.421 --> 00:16:38.710
they do their job by sort of passing electricity back and forth and that

251
00:16:38.711 --> 00:16:41.650
electricity is carried by sodium ions.

252
00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.960
So the whole system is pretty much based on sodium.

253
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.370
Lithium is very similar to sodium, so if you have lithium in the brain,

254
00:16:48.371 --> 00:16:50.680
the neurons will use that to communicate.

255
00:16:50.681 --> 00:16:54.070
They'll send lithium ions back and forth. And here's what's interesting.

256
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.850
Lithium works just like sodium but not as well.

257
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:02.930
<v 7>Lithium is similar enough in properties that it can be an a posture,</v>

258
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.080
but whatever does it just doesn't work as well. That's the key. He says.

259
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.180
So then this area of the brain,

260
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.360
the defective area of the brain that makes these moods flip on and off so

261
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:19.170
intensely doesn't work as well and that stops a bipolar episode.

262
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:22.500
That's so interesting that maybe it's sluggishness is what makes it good. Yup.

263
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.210
Yup.

264
00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:28.200
Although he says that same trick where it can be a sort of sodium imposter but

265
00:17:28.201 --> 00:17:32.520
slower that can also cause the issues. Slight tremors in your hand.

266
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.240
You can have nausea. Um, they can affect the kidneys,

267
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:37.740
the balance of sodium.

268
00:17:37.741 --> 00:17:42.240
Your body is regulated partially through the kidneys and somehow lithium

269
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.780
replacing it can be toxic to the kidneys,

270
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:50.790
<v 0>which actually brings us back to Jamie before go after that episode in New York</v>

271
00:17:50.791 --> 00:17:54.570
with Mike in the video, she went back on lithium and again she was fine.

272
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:58.830
In fact, for the last 16 years she's been completely normal.

273
00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.600
But then a couple months ago I went to a new primary physician,

274
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:06.570
mostly because I'm lazy and I didn't want to go to the upper west side to see my

275
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:07.470
other doctor.

276
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:11.940
And this doctor basically took my blood pressure and was like,

277
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:14.160
you're gonna die. You need to go to the Er.

278
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.300
It turns out her kidneys were failing and so she suddenly had to make this

279
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:23.330
choice that I could sort of just stay on lithium and you know,

280
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.760
go to dialysis and get a transplant or that I had to switch and that now would

281
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:34.560
be when I would switch that I had enough function left that I could you have,

282
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.350
you are in the middle of that decision now you feel like,

283
00:18:37.351 --> 00:18:39.990
or do you feel like is decided? I think I'm going to switch.

284
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:41.640
I think I made that decision.

285
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.440
It's just that every psychiatrist in New York leaves for August because I don't

286
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:50.130
know why, but they all disappear for August, all of August,

287
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:54.720
and mine said you should probably wait to switch until I come back.

288
00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.180
But I, I feel like I have a good group of people around me.

289
00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.420
I have a solid job. I,

290
00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:07.590
it's terrifying to court mania,

291
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.630
but I also feel like there are a lot of effective drugs and that one of them is

292
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.510
going to work. They won't be as cool as lithium though. Depakote,

293
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.080
it sounds like, Oh God,

294
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.470
you're on Devo. Cra. As she was in the middle of that decision,

295
00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:29.310
Jamie did one last thing. She actually took a trip to Bolivia,

296
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.650
which is where much of the world's lithium comes from.

297
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:36.651
There's this place you can go and literally see these massive salt flats,

298
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:39.730
which are just covered in mountains of lithium. Right.

299
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.390
I just wanted to see them. I wanted to experience them.

300
00:19:42.391 --> 00:19:45.870
I wanted to be near them, so I went

301
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.310
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

302
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.050
<v 0>It just looks like a hallucination.</v>

303
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.940
It looks like somebody could not have conceived of this landscape. You know,

304
00:19:56.941 --> 00:20:01.941
you have red lakes and you have flocks of flamingos and this like long salty

305
00:20:04.501 --> 00:20:09.450
expands that goes on for ever. Like it's just huge.

306
00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:14.130
It's enormous. Do you go up to a pile and put your hand on it or, yeah,

307
00:20:14.131 --> 00:20:18.300
you can. You stand on it and you jump off the pile and like, yeah,

308
00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:21.080
it was makings kind of with the domain

309
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:24.900
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

310
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.340
<v 0>and it was awesome.</v>

311
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:32.140
I know I have to go off of it, but I really am.

312
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.450
I mean, gratitude is like, not even the word. It's,

313
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:41.540
I feel like this thing allows me to be me.

314
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:44.220
It doesn't define me,

315
00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.970
but it allows for, you know,

316
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:51.970
functionality and that sounds kind of Wonky,

317
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:56.971
but it's like every day I get to work and it's because of that,

318
00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.370
like everything, you know, I'm just,

319
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.620
I'm grateful to it for it service. I feel like it's

320
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.220
<v 3>done.</v>

321
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.120
<v 0>It's done a lot for, for me.</v>

322
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.450
It worked so hard to get to me too. From the Big Bang to now,

323
00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:27.623
<v 3>uh,</v>

324
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.560
<v 10>producers, Soren Wheeler. Uh,</v>

325
00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.740
Soren is made of elements though not of lithium,

326
00:21:37.741 --> 00:21:41.370
which we should say only some of which was made in the big bang.

327
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.180
Some of it was also made ne Supernova and we'll have one of those coming up.

328
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:50.340
Special thanks to Ben Lilly and Harrington Kay Redfield Jamison, Steve Lowe,

329
00:21:50.341 --> 00:21:54.290
and of course Jamie Lo. Jamie is working on a book about her experiences with,

330
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.060
with bipolar. It will be called grand delusions.

331
00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:04.460
<v 11>This is a song from the band Sylvan.</v>

332
00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:08.780
So we played them the last story in progress and they wrote a song about it.

333
00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.293
<v 12>Okay.</v>

334
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.350
Oh, space

335
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:41.503
go home.

336
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.230
Compassion scalp things.

337
00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.133
Wow.

338
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.430
It snapped me.

339
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:46.343
Slammed Bob

340
00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.613
[inaudible].

341
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.943
Wow.

342
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:04.643
[inaudible]

343
00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.210
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

344
00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.460
<v 13>That was Sylvan Esso with Jamie son.</v>

345
00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:24.990
<v 14>Do you want to talk? Bang.</v>

346
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:30.530
Hydrogen was there at zero hundred hours and the coke colored velodrome of dark

347
00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:34.830
matter gases, checking gases at Infinitum,

348
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:39.720
chartreuse Flair, then a deafening birth ions of cosmos.

349
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:44.610
Cartwheeling Pink, red, yellow, green, purple, blue,

350
00:25:44.611 --> 00:25:49.500
black and the spear of night. First I was a star,

351
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.810
then a stain of water, then a kindergartner.

352
00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:01.770
<v 13>These poems, by the way, come from the two events that we held in New York City.</v>

353
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.710
We went to a emotive fruition,

354
00:26:04.711 --> 00:26:08.850
which is a wonderful organization run by Thomas Dooley, who is himself a poet.

355
00:26:08.851 --> 00:26:12.210
He summoned poets from all around the metropolitan area and for two nights they

356
00:26:12.211 --> 00:26:15.750
came to the bell house in Brooklyn Botanical lab in Manhattan.

357
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:20.130
And so far we have heard hydrogen by Sarah Sala read by Ramsey for our gala,

358
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:24.240
helium by Christina Cantana, read by [inaudible], Abbott Pratt. And uh,

359
00:26:24.241 --> 00:26:28.020
I carried your oxygen a poem by David McLaughlin, read by Sam Breslin. Right.

360
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.550
So next up I'm going to give you three claps. I don't know if you need that,

361
00:26:31.551 --> 00:26:32.384
but just,

362
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.540
just in case you need to sync it. There you go. Good TV guy. Okay,

363
00:26:38.541 --> 00:26:42.680
so a while back we ended up talking to a guy named Derek Mueller who makes a

364
00:26:42.681 --> 00:26:44.160
youtube channel called [inaudible]

365
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.700
<v 15>awesome, super popular channel about science and engineering.</v>

366
00:26:47.701 --> 00:26:50.700
And we call them because he's making a documentary about uranium.

367
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.050
And we got to talking about what happens when you take two protons or neutrons

368
00:26:55.051 --> 00:26:58.930
and you just whack put them together. Yeah, it's,

369
00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:03.270
it's absolutely nuts and that led to this really interesting conversation about

370
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.960
the beginning of all elements. I mean,

371
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.230
I feel like a little bit of backstory is worth saying here.

372
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:15.830
One really important thing to know is that combining nuclei gives you energy.

373
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.420
He says when you slam two particles together,

374
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:21.540
they get squished and in the squishing they lose a little mass.

375
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.050
That mass gets emitted as energy.

376
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.950
This is equals MC squared. That's what's happening in the sun right now.

377
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:33.180
So the sun is taking protons, individual protons and smashing them together,

378
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:37.520
combining them, and that gives you energy. The energy of the sun there.

379
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.250
Last mass is the sunlight that we Baskin, it was mass.

380
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.750
I have never thought of light as as former math. Yeah, that's what a star does.

381
00:27:45.751 --> 00:27:49.350
He says it smashes little atoms like hydrogen together to make bigger.

382
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.250
Adam's like helium and then bigger Adams like carbon and then even bigger.

383
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:58.350
Adam's like oxygen and every little collision it's doing generates some energy

384
00:27:58.351 --> 00:27:59.580
which keeps the star going.

385
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:04.320
Stars live by this process of sticking nuclei together,

386
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:08.880
going from smaller nuclei, making bigger nuclei. The heavier the star,

387
00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.020
the more this smashing and bashing they can do in their core and the bigger and

388
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:16.230
bigger nuclei they can form. But there are limits

389
00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:19.320
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

390
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.010
<v 15>6 million years ago that there was a star giant star whey they good than our</v>

391
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.660
son. And uh, it was just doing its thing. Take an Adams and [inaudible]

392
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:30.160
smashing them together, combining

393
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.780
it's taking hydrogen atoms and making helium taken helium Addams and making

394
00:28:37.511 --> 00:28:40.810
carbon, making oxygen. And as it's smashing all these nuclei together,

395
00:28:40.811 --> 00:28:45.340
it's releasing energy and getting bigger and bigger and bigger. But then

396
00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:52.290
there comes a point where sticking nuclei together no longer gives you energy in

397
00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:55.600
that point is element number 26 iron.

398
00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:01.720
Once you formed iron, if you're a star, that's the end of life as you know it.

399
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.560
Cause iron. Iron is incredibly stable.

400
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:12.800
One of the most stable nuclei in the universe.

401
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:15.890
It's protons are tightly packed in there.

402
00:29:15.891 --> 00:29:20.690
And so you can't force any more energy out of them, which means you have a core,

403
00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.630
which is no longer going to give you energy.

404
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.200
You can't cook up anything higher than, than the iron. That's it.

405
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.470
But what happens to the star? Does it just become a big punk?

406
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.850
What happens is everything starts to collapse.

407
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:37.830
Gravity takes over. That's the thing.

408
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:43.010
A star maintains its size by the fact that there's all energy going out to this

409
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.080
dead iron core starts pulling everything back in and at this point,

410
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.250
all of that stuff which is headed inwards, aluminum, oxygen, carbon, magnesium,

411
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.170
silicon starts rubbing against each other and it starts getting real hot and

412
00:29:56.171 --> 00:29:59.710
real dense and all of a sudden you get

413
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.563
<v 3>the supernova.</v>

414
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.570
<v 13>That was the most pathetic supernova explosion. I wasn't afraid.</v>

415
00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.590
Can you put in a sound effect to make that sound back?

416
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.020
To put it in a much like that, it is actually our specialty.

417
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:17.340
So even though we know there are no sounds in space for the purposes of your

418
00:30:17.341 --> 00:30:18.900
enjoyment, we present to you

419
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.400
<v 15>this supernova. So here's the beauty of it.</v>

420
00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:29.350
Here's the beauty of the Supernova in the ridiculous excesses of energy that are

421
00:30:29.351 --> 00:30:33.280
there in the Supernova, right? In that ridiculously huge explosion,

422
00:30:33.281 --> 00:30:34.570
the biggest in the universe.

423
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.010
There is so much energy there that actually what happens is you form these

424
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:43.600
nuclei, which would not form under any other conditions.

425
00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.810
You know, iron hits carbon to form Germanium,

426
00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:49.540
silicon hits oxygen to form titanium.

427
00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:53.290
You start to get all of these bigger elements including like gold,

428
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.900
including the gold in your wedding ring.

429
00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:00.460
They need that extreme ridiculous excess of energy to form.

430
00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.133
And then

431
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:06.243
<v 3>[inaudible] it's done.</v>

432
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:11.460
<v 15>And what are you left with? You're left with a giant field of debris.</v>

433
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:13.510
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

434
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.370
<v 15>ah, there's carbon, there's oxygen, there's iron, there's silicon,</v>

435
00:31:17.371 --> 00:31:18.960
there's hydrogen, there's helium.

436
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:23.070
And it starts to clump together due to gravity.

437
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.620
And the center of that, uh,

438
00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:30.650
which clumps together is our sun is mostly hydrogen and helium and it's like 99%

439
00:31:31.291 --> 00:31:35.340
of all the mass in our solar system. And then the other chunks,

440
00:31:35.341 --> 00:31:37.620
other bits and pieces start to clump together as well.

441
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:39.420
They have a bit more angular momentum.

442
00:31:39.421 --> 00:31:42.360
So they're spinning around the outside and those of your planetesimals,

443
00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.560
your early planets and,

444
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.220
and that is eventually how you get the earth and all of us

445
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.060
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

446
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.871
<v 13>this is where we caught you.</v>

447
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:56.440
So you're saying this is the birth of everything past iron. Yeah, exactly.

448
00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.980
Exactly. It feels like an 80 but I think I get it for the very first time.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.770
It comes down as rain or snow and then over time it passes through the mountain

475
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.400
naturally and finally it's bubbled right at the spring source.

476
00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.560
Why bottle it at the source? Well,

477
00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:53.600
once you've tasted that pure alpine spring water,

All right. Um, okay, just for a luncheon.

488
00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:48.010
Yeah. So science

489
00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.320
and Yay. This is my,

490
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.600
this is my new thing with my sisters.

491
00:34:55.601 --> 00:34:59.530
I just always go hashtag science cause they get really sick of me trying to

492
00:34:59.531 --> 00:35:01.160
teach the kids sciencey lesson.

493
00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.170
It's Hashtag science it. Okay.

494
00:35:05.171 --> 00:35:10.171
So one of the biggest mysteries in biology is how old am I that that doesn't

495
00:35:15.161 --> 00:35:16.780
seem like a mystery. Well,

496
00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:21.700
I mean like obviously I'm Molly Webster who's 32 years old who has lived,

497
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:26.530
you know, through 32 birthdays I guess. Yeah. But this is a question of like,

498
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:31.840
we know that some cells in our body regenerate and so it's like how old are

499
00:35:31.841 --> 00:35:34.900
those cells? Like how old is my heart right now?

500
00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.400
Or like how old my eyeball or how old is my nose? Spleen,

501
00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.960
the northwest corner of my kidney. [inaudible]

502
00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.570
<v 2>is this like like a m, you know, if I'm three years old now I'm 33 years old.</v>

503
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.480
Do the cells in the 33 year old, are they the same as any of them?

504
00:35:49.481 --> 00:35:51.010
The same as the one when I was three. Is that

505
00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:54.340
<v 16>the question? Yeah. That's one of the questions. Are any of them the same?</v>

506
00:35:54.341 --> 00:35:56.530
If they're not the same, then how often do they change?

507
00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.400
Because if you understand that, then you might be able to like solve injuries,

508
00:36:00.401 --> 00:36:05.260
help people heal faster or fix diseases where cells are,

509
00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:05.770
you know,

510
00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:10.770
messed up like psoriasis or anemia or als or something like that.

511
00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.780
But also it just seems so cool to be able to be like, oh,

512
00:36:13.781 --> 00:36:17.540
that chunk of my heart is from 1997 yes.

513
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:22.600
Or as I get other chunk of my heart is from 1983 yes. Like that.

514
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.300
I would love to know that at the Party of Robert [inaudible],

515
00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.230
<v 2>I would want to meet the original Robert Sells. I.</v>

516
00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:33.290
If there's anybody who's been here since 1947 I'd love to just say hello and if

517
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.470
you just joined me in 2015 while that's nice, I mean, right.

518
00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.050
<v 16>It would be super cool. Yeah,</v>

519
00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:41.410
so one of the questions they've had for a long time is,

520
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:46.060
is there a way that we can try to date cells?

521
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:46.871
And so they're like, well,

522
00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:49.990
we can't really send anything into the body because that can be toxic.

523
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:52.870
So the answer for a long time had been no,

524
00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.670
and then 2002 ish, this little idea pops up

525
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:05.300
and it's something called the bomb. Paul's Bom,

526
00:37:05.301 --> 00:37:10.250
B. B. O, m B and then pulse p. U. L. S. E. Bomb.

527
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.100
Pulse. Yeah. To explain

528
00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:15.430
<v 6>five, four, three, two</v>

529
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:20.730
<v 16>in the 1940s and fifties we all know this. We</v>

530
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:26.010
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

531
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:26.890
<v 16>said a lot of atomic bomb.</v>

532
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:31.880
<v 6>Hello. Huge. Wow.</v>

533
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:36.740
<v 12>The first test was in 1945 Trinity Test New Mexico. A few weeks later,</v>

534
00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.800
the world will note that the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and

535
00:37:42.231 --> 00:37:46.850
Nagasaki. We shall continue to use it too. Then as World War II comes to an end,

536
00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.900
the rest of the world just tries to catch up to the u s [inaudible] explode a

537
00:37:50.901 --> 00:37:54.530
huge bomb of 50 mega con the Russians.

538
00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.380
Then after the Russians written the pliers,

539
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.860
its first age bought British French.

540
00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.110
The whole cold war basically just continues

541
00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:11.130
<v 16>to unspool all in all over 400 atomic tests when off above ground between 19</v>

542
00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.280
1945 and 1963

543
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.380
<v 2>just imagine if only one atom bomb were to be dropped on an American city,</v>

544
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.760
thousands of persons would be killed instantly. It was a sucky time.

545
00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:29.270
<v 16>Well Hashtag Zions there's one good thing potentially one good thing popped out</v>

546
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:35.530
and that is an answer to the question of how old are we that somehow out of the

547
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.750
bomb test? Yeah. How, um, let me explain, do it.

548
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.910
So with every one of those detonations when an atomic bomb goes off,

549
00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:48.140
that would shoot a whole bunch of stuff up into the atmosphere.

550
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.520
All of these like radioactive elements like CCM and Tony and all these things.

551
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:57.890
But also that explosion shoots up a bunch of neutrons and the new tron will

552
00:38:57.891 --> 00:39:02.891
crash into nitrogen that's floating in our atmosphere and create c 14 which is a

553
00:39:03.621 --> 00:39:04.910
very special type of carbon.

554
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:09.970
It has two extra particles in it now is all that bad radioactive stuff starts

555
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.770
falling out of the atmosphere back to the ground.

556
00:39:12.771 --> 00:39:16.940
C 14 doesn't fall out of the sky, it just sort of floats there.

557
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:24.970
And what happened is over time the wind currents carried c 14 from these test

558
00:39:26.151 --> 00:39:29.120
sites and just spread it all over the planet.

559
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.460
And this sea 14 which is just totally like normal carbon,

560
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:35.643
non harmful,

561
00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:40.010
it just bonds with oxygen and it gets sucked up into plants.

562
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:44.420
And then animals eat the plants and then we eat the animals or we eat the plants

563
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:47.790
and then suddenly the scene 14 is in us. Huh.

564
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:52.640
So we all have like a little bit of the atomic age in us way that I wasn't even

565
00:39:52.641 --> 00:39:55.580
born in 1963 so w why would it be in me?

566
00:39:55.610 --> 00:40:00.290
That is the cool thing because it hangs out in the air for a long time. So it's,

567
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.270
it's actually still up there. Hmm.

568
00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.000
But why does this have anything to do with dating? Anything? Yes.

569
00:40:05.001 --> 00:40:08.160
I'm about to tell you that. Hey, are you there? Hi. Yes I am. Yeah. Yeah,

570
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:09.200
her thick.

571
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.690
<v 0>I'm Bruce [inaudible].</v>

572
00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.600
I'm a senior scientist at Lawrence Livermore national lab.

573
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:18.130
[inaudible] professor of stem cell research at the Karolinska Institute in

574
00:40:18.131 --> 00:40:18.630
Stockholm.

575
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.790
So in the early two thousands [inaudible] staring down this question of like,

576
00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:23.620
how do I date cells?

577
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.950
And at a certain point he gets together with Bruce because he comes up with this

578
00:40:26.951 --> 00:40:30.280
idea, which is just, Oh, maybe we just look up.

579
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.250
<v 4>So Derek,</v>

580
00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.380
there are some groups in Europe and there's one in particular that's been

581
00:40:34.381 --> 00:40:39.381
measuring the atmosphere every two weeks since the late 1950s it's an incredible

582
00:40:40.201 --> 00:40:40.990
data record.

583
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:41.561
<v 0>Bruce says,</v>

584
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:44.950
what the scientists have done is they've taken all of these measurements and

585
00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:46.390
they put them into one chart.

586
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.810
So you can see the amount of see 14 in the atmosphere over time.

587
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:53.890
<v 4>So we, we have this basically a basically a calendar and I could,</v>

588
00:40:53.891 --> 00:40:57.130
I could send you a picture so you can see what, see what the graph looks like.

589
00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:00.230
<v 0>Yeah, I'd love to see a picture. What you see on that graph is this,</v>

590
00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.800
according to Uranus, up to 1955

591
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:08.180
<v 12>so pretty flat line with very little variation can suddenly in 1955 with all the</v>

592
00:41:10.521 --> 00:41:11.354
bomb tests,

593
00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:14.080
<v 0>there's a very sharp increase,</v>

594
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:18.820
<v 4>a lot of carbon 14 very drastic increase. That's why they call it a pulse.</v>

595
00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.400
<v 19>That increased goes all the way up to 1963 when Roman portraits of Communist</v>

596
00:41:24.621 --> 00:41:29.510
doctrine is a tearing Auburn's doric event in the u s the UK and Soviet Union

597
00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.010
agree to stop exploding atomic bombs above ground signing of an Adam test

598
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.843
<v 16>ban.</v>

599
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.033
<v 19>After that,</v>

600
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:40.600
there's a gradual decline and you know,

601
00:41:40.601 --> 00:41:43.990
they're just measuring it all the way down so they can just say, oh,

602
00:41:43.991 --> 00:41:45.450
like here's where it was. And Yeah,

603
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:50.670
<v 16>seen 80 years where it was in 99020002010 this right here is the coolest part</v>

604
00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:57.941
because the amount of [inaudible] in the atmosphere at any given moment is

605
00:41:58.341 --> 00:42:02.900
directly reflected in ourselves. Right. So if there's like

606
00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:09.640
h c 14 in the atmosphere in September,

607
00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.080
1972 yeah.

608
00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:10.913
<v 20>Then that is</v>

609
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:16.380
<v 16>going to be mirrored in cells that were born in September,</v>

610
00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:20.370
1972 so it is like this totally perfect birthday calendar.

611
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.800
We can see approximately how long have they been there for 10 years or 20 years

612
00:42:24.801 --> 00:42:27.350
or 30 years. It's like once this idea got out,

613
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:30.860
every like scientists all over the world were like, Oh yeah,

614
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:35.140
<v 3>oh give me your attention. There's been the new invention.</v>

615
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.970
<v 16>It didn't take long to see that this might be something cool to do</v>

616
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.270
<v 3>came about because they made a big atomic bomb.</v>

617
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.970
<v 16>So just to give you a quick sense of some of the work that came out of this,</v>

618
00:42:45.971 --> 00:42:47.700
I spoke to one scientist,

619
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:50.920
I'm Kirsty Spalding and I work at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

620
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:56.160
She was working with Yoanis and they figured out how to use c 14 in brains.

621
00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.880
I mean, first of all, the basic question was can adult humans make new neurons?

622
00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:02.740
She says that for like a hundred years,

623
00:43:02.741 --> 00:43:06.400
the dogma had always been that the neurons were born with other ones we die

624
00:43:06.401 --> 00:43:09.430
with. The problem was she had no way to investigate this.

625
00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.110
She couldn't use it in humans,

626
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.680
even if they were dead humans until she figured out a technique where she could

627
00:43:14.681 --> 00:43:18.490
like extract brain cells and see how much the 14 was in there. Yeah, exactly.

628
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:23.820
It turns out the next best thing to human is a horse because horses can live for

629
00:43:23.951 --> 00:43:25.510
quite some years, decades.

630
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:29.350
So every second Tuesday I would go out to the local Avatar,

631
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:34.150
the local slaughterhouse an hour away and I mean I was a vegetarian surrounded

632
00:43:34.151 --> 00:43:39.010
by caucuses where they would bring the horses head out to me and I had to figure

633
00:43:39.011 --> 00:43:44.011
out how to get the brain out of its head and what you actually had to like cut,

634
00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.020
open the skull and get to the brain yourself.

635
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:51.040
I mean the second time I went I took my boyfriend with me cause I was like I

636
00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:51.874
can't do this.

637
00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:57.110
Physically they actually had a circular saw and I actually discovered that the

638
00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:02.170
the skull, the bone across the top, the nose of the horses is quite thin.

639
00:44:02.171 --> 00:44:07.120
So that was a much easier access point. This is really gross discussion.

640
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:12.430
Did you ever see your research going that way? No, absolutely not. Not at all.

641
00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:17.020
But what she saw when she finally moved her research from Horseheads to humans

642
00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:21.850
was turnover. We found quite robust levels of new neurons in adulthood

643
00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.970
<v 3>can get, why do I take,</v>

644
00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.560
<v 16>once the onus is team show that this worked,</v>

645
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.530
scientists got excited and people to date things and not just cells.

646
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.760
So can I tell you the ages? Sure. Okay.

647
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:40.530
The baseline age is,

648
00:44:40.531 --> 00:44:44.700
we knew before seat 14 was that skin was like 14 days old.

649
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.110
14 Ford Olf only 14, 10 days. Yeah. So like two weeks.

650
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.390
Um, the surface level of your gut, the like the skin on your gut,

651
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.960
I guess was five days, five days.

652
00:44:57.961 --> 00:45:02.340
That's even shorter than skin does. That's like the surface of the intestine.

653
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.160
Oh, the surface of the, yeah, the line. The lining.

654
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:08.550
That's cause that's everything. Scraping all that food going down.

655
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.510
So though that doesn't surprise me. And then with sea 14,

656
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:15.090
the deeper muscly part of the intestine,

657
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.270
the average is 15.1 years.

658
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.400
15.1 years old.

659
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:24.390
Big Difference Between 15.9 15.9 years old. Point nine years.

660
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.130
Fat Cells was another one that they did a 10 years old.

661
00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:33.450
<v 21>10 years old. Yeah. Interesting. Why would a fat cell need to last that long?</v>

662
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.360
10 years. She says

663
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.340
[inaudible] cells. You've been, honestly, you've David, did they have any idea?

664
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:43.680
They don't know. Huh? Did they know that?

665
00:45:43.681 --> 00:45:46.290
Like what would be one of the oldest part of us?

666
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:49.790
<v 16>Your um, your Cortex, which is, uh,</v>

667
00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:54.140
like the part of your brain that does like abstract thinking or your voluntary

668
00:45:54.141 --> 00:45:58.970
movements. That's as old as you are. Really? Huh?

669
00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:02.000
So if you wanna know one of the oldest parts of you,

670
00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:06.060
the oldest cell is probably in your, ah,

671
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.960
<v 21>part of your brain. It'll be like your cortical neuron will that fits?</v>

672
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.710
If I think of myself as the stories I tell myself,

673
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:17.580
like when you get Alzheimer's and you lose your stories and you lose your mind,

674
00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.400
they people say,

675
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.910
<v 16>but the interesting thing though is the hippocampus is where you keep all your</v>

676
00:46:21.911 --> 00:46:26.911
memories and they saw that your hippocampus does make a bunch of new neurons in

677
00:46:28.661 --> 00:46:31.450
the hippocampus. That's Yunus Friesen. Again,

678
00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:36.930
the halt gets approximately 1400 new hippocampal neurons per day.

679
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:41.860
Really? Yeah. And then each of those neurons will live like 20 maybe 30 years.

680
00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:45.400
<v 21>So does that mean that the part of Robert's brain where he keeps the stories,</v>

681
00:46:45.401 --> 00:46:50.310
he tells himself that part is being made new every 20 or 30 years? Yeah.

682
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:54.940
It's a strange thing that like your oldest stories could be stored in baby

683
00:46:54.941 --> 00:46:57.190
little neurons. It is weird. Yeah.

684
00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:02.880
I remember going to Kyoto and it's like the oldest most beautiful temple in

685
00:47:03.101 --> 00:47:03.934
Kyoto.

686
00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:09.180
It has exactly the form that it had, you know,

687
00:47:09.210 --> 00:47:10.450
hundreds of years ago.

688
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:15.900
But when you walk in the the walls and the floors and the roofing and they've

689
00:47:16.991 --> 00:47:18.010
been restored,

690
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.790
they've been restored actually over and over again because in Japan what they

691
00:47:21.791 --> 00:47:25.900
call old is the form. It's the shape of the building.

692
00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.060
You go to happens though,

693
00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.980
and you go to the Acropolis and you stand in the Parthenon there you're standing

694
00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:37.540
in the very temple that para clis stood in. It's the same place.

695
00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.690
Exactly. Same materials, so I can,

696
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.270
in Greece they believe that the original stuff is the,

697
00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:48.670
is what you preserve and in Japan they don't, they think it's just the form.

698
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.910
And I was thinking of this thing you're doing is sort of a little bit like that.

699
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:52.260
Like I,

700
00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:57.220
I was thinking I'm much more Greek than I am Japanese because I want to know

701
00:47:57.221 --> 00:48:00.310
like what my original cells are. If they are where they are in me.

702
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:02.820
<v 16>Yeah. But my question is, Maxine meant more basic.</v>

703
00:48:02.821 --> 00:48:07.710
It's like why does part of me get to re reborn in the other parts of me don't

704
00:48:07.711 --> 00:48:12.150
like why not all of me get to be reborn? Because if all of you is being reborn,

705
00:48:12.151 --> 00:48:13.650
you would just crumble into dust.

706
00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:16.980
Nobody to be quite as white is only certain parts get to regenerate.

707
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.200
It's interesting because they don't know. They said the next,

708
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.560
they said basically this question of how old is a cell?

709
00:48:22.561 --> 00:48:24.900
They said no one was asking. Everyone wondered this,

710
00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:28.380
but no one was asking this question because they never had the tools to ask it.

711
00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:30.900
So now they're just starting to ask those questions. It's,

712
00:48:30.901 --> 00:48:31.800
but there's a problem.

713
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.233
<v 3>Okay.</v>

714
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:40.760
<v 16>This balm pulse that we've been dependent on in the last decade to start</v>

715
00:48:40.761 --> 00:48:43.040
answering all these questions is going away.

716
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.820
Really every day a little more of that c 14 gets sucked out of the air.

717
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:52.370
How much time do we have left? 15 years. It's gone by 2030 give or take. Yeah,

718
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:56.660
so we need to get questions answered now because we really are working against

719
00:48:56.661 --> 00:48:58.400
the clock for many things we want to look at.

720
00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:01.430
I talked to this Alzheimer's researcher who was trying to figure out like the

721
00:49:01.431 --> 00:49:03.050
chronology of the disease,

722
00:49:03.051 --> 00:49:06.770
like when certain like pathologies form in the brain and he was kind of just

723
00:49:06.771 --> 00:49:08.810
like, I just wish I had a little more time

724
00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:12.070
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

725
00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:16.100
<v 16>and when I think about this, thinking about this on the subway this morning,</v>

726
00:49:16.101 --> 00:49:19.370
like I was looking around and I was thinking, you know, I'm on the l train,

727
00:49:19.371 --> 00:49:23.630
it's a bunch of like 30 year old kids or something and has like these,

728
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:28.100
they're all reading or something drinking their expensive lattes and like these

729
00:49:28.101 --> 00:49:33.101
people are so far away from thinking about the Cold War or atomic bombs or

730
00:49:33.141 --> 00:49:37.220
anything like that and they're all walking around with like the secret signal

731
00:49:37.221 --> 00:49:41.000
from the atomic period inside of them.

732
00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:45.210
And then that little signal is like binging out like knowledge about

733
00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.740
<v 10>their shoulder and their elbow in their liver and the west side of the liver and</v>

734
00:49:48.741 --> 00:49:52.220
the east side of the liver and like different parts of their heart and the fact

735
00:49:52.221 --> 00:49:56.780
that it's now going away. And how like someone born in

736
00:49:58.980 --> 00:49:59.750
2040

737
00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:02.690
<v 16>too is just going to be really boring. And like,</v>

738
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:07.130
we know they're not going to have any insights into who they are,

739
00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:11.630
which sort of makes me inclined to very peacefully want to [inaudible]

740
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:15.520
explode another atomic bomb. What?

741
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:16.951
<v 21>No, no,</v>

742
00:50:16.951 --> 00:50:21.951
no one know why you forget all the poisons that that is not a benign event.

743
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:27.730
That's sort of an experimental picker upper that is extra extra stuff

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.850
happy Valentine's Day. Magnesium.

761
00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.070
<v 4>I'd go blind watching you burn magnesium.</v>

762
00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.840
Iodine is cute the way it sublimated and yes,

763
00:51:46.841 --> 00:51:49.420
I'll put lithium in water to watch it's scoot about,

764
00:51:49.421 --> 00:51:53.470
but my heart belongs to you. Magnesium,

765
00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.440
the hot white flame,

766
00:51:56.441 --> 00:52:00.550
the abandoned the slowness of you becoming your own fuse.

767
00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:06.060
Mercury is beautiful. Yes, but it's you.

768
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:07.140
Magnesium.

769
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:08.470
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

770
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:12.050
<v 4>The way you burn from me, the way you leave,</v>

771
00:52:12.051 --> 00:52:14.300
nothing of yourself behind.

772
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:19.700
<v 0>We are flying over Greenland. Yeah,</v>

773
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:24.650
elbow is too close to mine on the airplane armrest down there.

774
00:52:24.651 --> 00:52:29.120
They are excavating uranium from beneath the Arctic ice and selling

775
00:52:29.121 --> 00:52:30.230
indiscriminantly.

776
00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:36.040
Though from here I can only see the white tub ice sheets in glacier topped

777
00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:37.310
mountains.

778
00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:41.810
This is an island of fishing rigs and colorful houses,

779
00:52:42.020 --> 00:52:45.020
cod and cat fish stew and tomato cream.

780
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:50.990
Once I thought every isotope in me is radioactive.

781
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.770
I make the people who love me sick.

782
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.920
This is a teenage way of thinking,

783
00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:04.420
but you have uncovered a glowing spark in the pristine frozen places within me.

Come on up. We're gonna get into an elevator, push the button and go down.

<v 17>Hi, this is nick calling from Malden, Massachusetts.</v>

797
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:07.820
Radiolab is supported by crystal geyser, Alpine spring water.

798
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:11.000
It starts in the clouds. It comes down as rain or snow,

799
00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:14.900
and then over time it passes through the mountain naturally and finally it's

800
00:54:14.901 --> 00:54:18.920
bubbled right at the spring source. Why bottle it at the source? Well,

801
00:54:18.921 --> 00:54:20.990
once you've tasted that pure alpine spring water,

802
00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:24.140
you'll understand why it makes sense and why it makes a difference.

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:14.620
Okay. Elements. We're doing it.

815
00:55:15.730 --> 00:55:16.563
We're doing it.

816
00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.173
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

818
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:44.603
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

819
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:49.670
<v 13>Okay, so we have this periodic table of elements, which is</v>

820
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:54.280
<v 2>a list of the simplest bits of matter that we know of. And so theoretically,</v>

821
00:55:54.281 --> 00:55:58.600
everything that we see, everything that we are made of,

822
00:55:58.601 --> 00:56:01.870
the stuff that is in that table,

823
00:56:01.871 --> 00:56:05.170
that's sort of the beauty of the periodic table is that it describes everything,

824
00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:06.363
right? Yeah.

825
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.370
<v 21>Yeah. About 45 years ago,</v>

826
00:56:09.371 --> 00:56:12.880
a scientist named Vere Ruben was studying the motion of the galaxies.

827
00:56:12.881 --> 00:56:15.980
You know how the geology is just spinning in a beautiful way around like in

828
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000
spirals and her calculations did not explain why the galaxies were holding

829
00:56:21.251 --> 00:56:24.430
together and she figured, nope, there's be some stuff

830
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:28.840
<v 13>that I can't see around the galaxies that explain why they moved the way they</v>

831
00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:29.674
do.

832
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:32.210
<v 9>What is that stuff? Whatever it is,</v>

833
00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:37.160
it's not interacting with the matter of our world hardly at all.

834
00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.520
Otherwise we'd see it. It's indeed while we call it dark

835
00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.180
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

836
00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:46.410
<v 9>dark matter is the dominant, uh, uh,</v>

837
00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:47.753
component in the universe.

838
00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:55.370
That's experimental physicist Rick Gaitskell did the,

839
00:56:55.371 --> 00:56:59.120
the stuff you and I made of the, you know, there's these conventional protons.

840
00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:02.600
It's the flotsam and Jetsam ultra matter. Well it's,

841
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:05.300
it's cost on a sea of dark matter.

842
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:11.570
We're talking about in terms of the total composition of the universe,

843
00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:14.810
you and I, the stuff we made office four and a half percent,

844
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:20.930
the other 95.5% is this stuff that dark matter, dark energy,

845
00:57:20.931 --> 00:57:24.120
which theoretically is all around us. If you cup your hands,

846
00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:27.990
you have a dark matter particle in your hand, the brawl blow mold.

847
00:57:27.991 --> 00:57:32.991
The challenge is that it is so weakly interacting that it will pass straight

848
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:34.540
through you.

849
00:57:34.540 --> 00:57:38.620
And in fact we'll pass straight through the earth bed and will have very little

850
00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:39.820
probability of interacting.

851
00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:43.260
<v 13>But what if you could get one of these little best or sit interact</v>

852
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:47.703
<v 6>then,</v>

853
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:49.870
<v 13>I mean forget to be like table,</v>

854
00:57:49.871 --> 00:57:54.600
then you would meet the most fundamental element of them all city as lead a

855
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.823
store comb town.

856
00:57:56.830 --> 00:58:00.460
We're going to tell you about an experiment now and this is our experiment and

857
00:58:00.461 --> 00:58:03.880
we sent our producers, Andy Mills and Dameon Marchetti a check it out, right?

858
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:09.190
Do you think it's, this close is happening in South Dakota, in the black hills,

859
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:10.990
in this little town called lead.

860
00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:16.020
And I have not seen this many trees and so incredibly beautiful picture,

861
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.260
this little town, but right near the town as you crest over this hill.

862
00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:23.360
<v 9>Oh, that's a deep cut.</v>

863
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:28.530
You'll see this mountain that looks like it's just been torn open.

864
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.593
<v 6>No,</v>

865
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:31.530
<v 9>we uh,</v>

866
00:58:31.530 --> 00:58:36.530
we pulled over and we walked over to the edge of this thing and it was like

867
00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:39.090
peering down into an ancient volcano.

868
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:43.500
That's not what I thought it would look like carved out that ill in this town,

869
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:47.520
there is one of the deepest manmade holes on the planet.

870
00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.690
That's where the experiment is and it's there because way down deep in that

871
00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.620
hole, it's demonstrably the quietest place in the universe.

872
00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:57.263
<v 6>Okay.</v>

873
00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.930
<v 9>That is Ken Myers. He's a writer.</v>

874
00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:01.730
The quietest thing will make sense in a second.

875
00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:04.910
He wrote an article in Harper's magazine recently that is all about this

876
00:59:04.911 --> 00:59:06.500
experiment and this whole,

877
00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:11.290
I was interested in the idea of of these frontiers at the, you know here,

878
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:15.350
where are you from frontier? I'm from Minnesota. Oh, there you go.

879
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:19.190
People tell me I sound like I'm from, from the movie Fargo. Let me join them.

880
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.130
Anyway, Ken says that this

881
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.710
<v 23>story, it starts off way back in the old way.</v>

882
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.680
<v 9>Saw Hardy Bronte, wild, rugged,</v>

883
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:33.130
1874 general Custer and crew Custer comes out looking for this gold and finds it

884
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:39.800
gold on the mountain in the rivers and in the dock are below the surface of the

885
00:59:39.801 --> 00:59:40.970
earth and just like that,

886
00:59:40.971 --> 00:59:45.971
10,000 people within two years are just invading illegally invading the black

887
00:59:46.461 --> 00:59:51.020
hills, which were the great Sioux reservation, and by 1901 the miner's blast,

888
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:56.810
1,500 feet down by (927) 300-0500 feet down by 1975

889
00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:00.320
<v 23>it's 8,000 feet deep. To put that into perspective,</v>

890
01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:03.840
that's a sort of mile and a half, but usually a mile and a half,

891
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:06.840
they literally move mountains. Oh, it's a mess. Yeah.

892
01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:11.210
Imagine six empire state buildings going straight down and gold.

893
01:00:11.211 --> 01:00:15.140
Is that valuable that you could put that kind of effort and energy?

894
01:00:15.141 --> 01:00:16.540
Isn't that astonishing? Yeah,

895
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:21.440
but what happened is that eventually the price of gold dropped to the point

896
01:00:21.441 --> 01:00:25.250
where the size of the mine was just unsustainable.

897
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:30.230
When you're mining 8,000 feet down, you know, for every foot you go down,

898
01:00:30.231 --> 01:00:33.860
your price increases, your costs increase. You've got to haul it further.

899
01:00:33.861 --> 01:00:35.750
You've got an air condition, the mine,

900
01:00:35.810 --> 01:00:38.840
you've got to pump out the groundwater and you'll have to run electrical lines

901
01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:39.450
down there.

902
01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:43.910
You've been so in 2001 after 126 years of being an operation,

903
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:49.040
the mines shut down. Did it create a ghost town? I mean did, this was the fear.

904
01:00:49.041 --> 01:00:51.860
This was the fear that we were just going to have a whole,

905
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:55.640
the whole economy of this part of the country was going to fall apart.

906
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:58.160
But as this was happening,

907
01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:04.420
<v 4>we saw an opportunity though these physicists realize that this was a a golden</v>

908
01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:07.400
opportunity. Limited it before we,

909
01:01:07.401 --> 01:01:11.870
I don't remember like how I do physicists do fair mental physicists cause they

910
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:16.400
love holes traditionally. Yeah. They're just in love in halls.

911
01:01:16.401 --> 01:01:21.170
They just like dwarves. This is where we get to that idea of quiet,

912
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:22.550
this experiment.

913
01:01:22.551 --> 01:01:26.120
It needs a kind of quiet that you cannot find on the surface of the earth.

914
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:29.530
When you and I are sitting on the surface of the earth,

915
01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.000
we're not acutely aware of it, but we are

916
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:35.390
<v 9>being hit by cosmic rays.</v>

917
01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.160
At a rate that I think really rather amazes people,

918
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.160
that if you simply hold your handout three or four times a second,

919
01:01:43.810 --> 01:01:47.240
cosmic ray is going through your hand and it's going right through it.

920
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.320
And that's every second. Uh, so your,

921
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.700
your body is literally bathed in thousands of these.

922
01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:56.870
Every second we are just being bombarded with,

923
01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.910
<v 6>uh, IDN.</v>

924
01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:06.240
Rick Gaitskill talks about it like being in the middle of a stadium during the

925
01:02:06.241 --> 01:02:07.074
super bowl.

926
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:11.610
And this is as though everybody in this arena is clapping.

927
01:02:13.410 --> 01:02:16.410
Now just imagine that in the middle of all this chaos,

928
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:20.520
there is one person leaning over to their and whispering

929
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.300
<v 9>a secret into their ear. Dark matter is like</v>

930
01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:26.690
<v 7>the whisper.</v>

931
01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:29.970
<v 9>It will be lost in the noise.</v>

932
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
We have to cut out all this noise in order to even come close to hearing it.

933
01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:39.990
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

934
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.823
<v 9>and</v>

935
01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:48.390
it turns out putting a mile of rock between you and the, uh, is,

936
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:50.630
is taking you a lot of the way that [inaudible]

937
01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:53.430
<v 7>yeah, it's a great sound.</v>

938
01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:02.730
So Rick took us into this mind through these massive iron doors down these

939
01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:04.740
<v 1>woo</v>

940
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.510
<v 7>long underground tunnels.</v>

941
01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:08.740
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

942
01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:12.010
<v 9>into a room where we met this guy. What's your name and who are you?</v>

943
01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:15.100
Mike Sunni is grew up in lead South Dakota.

944
01:03:15.101 --> 01:03:19.090
I'm the fourth generation that's been hanging around and the Homestake mine.

945
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.280
Mike worked at the mine, so did his dad.

946
01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:24.280
Both my grandfathers were Homestake veterans. Uh,

947
01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.980
most kids that Mike went to school with and his dad went to school with.

948
01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:31.510
They worked at the mines and my grandmother's father on my dad's side was also a

949
01:03:31.930 --> 01:03:32.763
minor,

950
01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:33.880
<v 7>but now,</v>

951
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.080
now he works in a room where he basically equipped scientists with other safety

952
01:03:38.081 --> 01:03:42.100
gear and stuff. He gave us these boots and a respirator.

953
01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:44.230
Catch on fire. Do you want to be able to freeze?

954
01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:49.630
That's what you want to hear it in the morning and eventually over

955
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:55.360
the climate and this old steel surface elevator, a little farther

956
01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.480
south cage of the 41

957
01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.550
<v 9>Laura south cage, and then</v>

958
01:04:04.170 --> 01:04:06.030
you just start rocketing downward.

959
01:04:08.590 --> 01:04:09.990
Plus you're going so fast.

960
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:13.860
The speed at which we're moving instead of equivalent to the speed at which an

961
01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:18.750
airplane often, you know, when it's descending at a thousand feet, our ears pop

962
01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:25.620
2000 feet. This sort of wet, muddy smell sort of walks up

963
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:32.430
and as we're dropping, all that noise is getting

964
01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:34.570
<v 7>slowly.</v>

965
01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:39.080
<v 9>We're able to literally use the Rock, uh,</v>

966
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:43.790
to absorb these cosmic ray particles. After about 10 minutes,

967
01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:52.250
<v 22>elevator stops. Hello.</v>

968
01:04:54.020 --> 01:04:55.400
Thank you guys. Thank you.

969
01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.620
And we step out 4,000, 850 feet down.

970
01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:06.260
This is a cave man. It looks like a cave.

971
01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.880
It's got, um,

972
01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:13.300
a dome like ceiling and walls that are just carved rock.

973
01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:15.320
What does that sound? It's water.

974
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.000
That's the sound of rain coming through

975
01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.900
<v 6>a whole lot of rock.</v>

976
01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:26.480
<v 22>To be clear, it's not raining outside. It's not ready to go up in the world.</v>

977
01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:29.210
It's just groundwater. According to camp,

978
01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:34.600
it's costing over a million dollars a year just to run the pumps to drain that

979
01:05:34.941 --> 01:05:38.300
water. So that gives you some, $1 million a year. Yeah.

980
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:43.220
But Rick says down here like this is the least amount of radiation that we will

981
01:05:43.221 --> 01:05:45.920
ever experience in our lives. It is quite dramatic.

982
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:49.670
It's about 3 million less a cosmic rays.

983
01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:55.360
So when you hold your handout less than one every few months,

984
01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:56.200
January

985
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.310
<v 7>coming through your hand now</v>

986
01:05:59.850 --> 01:06:00.780
<v 6>march. [inaudible]</v>

987
01:06:01.260 --> 01:06:03.090
<v 23>but that isn't, that isn't the end of the story.</v>

988
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:05.460
So we're going to step inside here. The very first step,

989
01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:06.960
we actually even have an ice and the other doesn't.

990
01:06:06.961 --> 01:06:10.470
It turns out that even if you cut out all the rays coming from the outside

991
01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:13.590
there, still raised coming off of us, you and I,

992
01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:16.260
we carry us out in the amount of uranium and thorium,

993
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.870
these radioactive elements in us. So,

994
01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:22.050
<v 7>okay. So what we're going to do is you're going to take your cover off,</v>

995
01:06:22.051 --> 01:06:25.090
saw a woman named Robin Barlin, made us change clothes. Oh,

996
01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:29.610
can you take that machine out? Yeah. Scrubbed our stuff.

997
01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.120
Oh, the microphone. I'm gonna wipe this. That. Okay. Yeah.

998
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:37.860
And then Rick takes us into the lab where the experiment happens.

999
01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:42.120
It's this all white room with this huge tank in the middle. The, uh,

1000
01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.920
tank, uh, contains 70,000 gallons of high purity,

1001
01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.180
uh, water and was w w you know, directly inside it.

1002
01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:54.380
And we can without fear of disrupting experiment one cut. And, uh,

1003
01:06:54.590 --> 01:06:56.550
the experiment actually happens inside this day.

1004
01:06:56.830 --> 01:07:01.110
I'm going bang the outside of the, uh, the steel container.

1005
01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:02.800
The whole idea is that

1006
01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:06.580
<v 23>this water will actually filter out even more radiation that makes it very</v>

1007
01:07:06.581 --> 01:07:08.830
quiet, but still it's not quiet.

1008
01:07:09.810 --> 01:07:11.770
And so inside that tank of water,

1009
01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:15.130
they put an even smaller tink of the element xenon,

1010
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:17.500
about a third of a ton of liquid xenon.

1011
01:07:17.590 --> 01:07:20.230
Where do we find xenon on the periodic table? Where, what is it?

1012
01:07:20.231 --> 01:07:24.760
So you don't want this number of 54, 54, it's over on the right hand side.

1013
01:07:24.761 --> 01:07:27.100
So that, that we have this, uh,

1014
01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:31.660
imperially named a set of elements we call the noble elements. I mean,

1015
01:07:31.661 --> 01:07:34.900
they're just too good for everybody else. They interact hardly at all.

1016
01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:38.700
That's right. You really struggle to make xenon interact with, uh,

1017
01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.910
with any other atoms,

1018
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.300
which is just another way of saying that inside of this tank of Xenon,

1019
01:07:43.301 --> 01:07:44.980
which is inside of this tank of water,

1020
01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:48.970
which is down in one of the biggest holes ever dug by man,

1021
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:54.270
it is really, really, really, really, really quiet. It's demonstrably the,

1022
01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:57.240
the quietest place in the universe. I mean you can't, you,

1023
01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:01.330
you don't know that it is because there could be somewhere, some quieter place.

1024
01:08:01.331 --> 01:08:06.331
But as far as we know that the center of this lux detector is the quietest place

1025
01:08:06.881 --> 01:08:11.881
that we human beings know of and what's supposed to happen inside this super

1026
01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.990
quiet xenon space.

1027
01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:17.780
So the idea that you have here is that this cloud of Zenon,

1028
01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.550
it's just waiting.

1029
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:23.450
And the thought is that when a dark matter particle,

1030
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:27.610
that's like zooming around all the time when that zooms through this [inaudible]

1031
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:31.310
because it is so quiet in there because there is nothing else happening in

1032
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:32.990
there. That dark matter particle,

1033
01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:35.660
even though it's not supposed to interact with anything from our world,

1034
01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.240
that particle, if it disturbs, if it nudges in any way,

1035
01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:45.650
any of the atoms of the xenon will notice it and that tiny little disturbance

1036
01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:49.680
<v 5>whenever it happens. Ken says, you can think of that moment</v>

1037
01:08:51.210 --> 01:08:52.980
as the universe whispering to us,

1038
01:08:53.370 --> 01:08:57.900
the whisper and human nature though the whisper is a point where we really,

1039
01:08:58.570 --> 01:09:03.570
when we really want to speak intently to a single person,

1040
01:09:03.901 --> 01:09:07.470
we whisper when, when you know, we whisper at funerals,

1041
01:09:07.471 --> 01:09:11.550
we wish for in the presence of awesome things in nature.

1042
01:09:11.551 --> 01:09:12.870
We we,

1043
01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:14.020
<v 4>you know, it's sad. It's sad,</v>

1044
01:09:14.021 --> 01:09:19.021
reduced use of the voice that drops down and drops down to,

1045
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:24.260
it only goes into the ear it's intended for. It's,

1046
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.020
it's Isaiah's call, you know,

1047
01:09:27.021 --> 01:09:31.220
he's lying on his mat and he hears the whisper because he knows that's for me

1048
01:09:31.221 --> 01:09:34.040
alone. That call is for me alone. And that's,

1049
01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:39.310
that's that sense that this experiment gives to me is that here the universe has

1050
01:09:40.491 --> 01:09:44.330
been shouting and shouting and shouting and shouting at us.

1051
01:09:44.331 --> 01:09:49.160
And we've gathered all this scientific knowledge out of the shout,

1052
01:09:49.161 --> 01:09:51.290
out of the clapping, out of the cheers.

1053
01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:55.640
And now where we're at in the 21st century is,

1054
01:09:55.700 --> 01:10:00.700
is we're quick going down to what's it saying in the whisper.

1055
01:10:00.771 --> 01:10:05.620
And those whispers go clear back to conception. They had clear back birth.

1056
01:10:06.710 --> 01:10:09.650
If we understand these whispers,

1057
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:12.800
we're very close to understanding

1058
01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.290
<v 5>just station and, and [inaudible]</v>

1059
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:22.300
<v 23>I got carried away there, but oh, we love you. Really. Yeah. Okay.</v>

1060
01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:26.590
And did you get to hear the whisper, see the disturbance,

1061
01:10:26.591 --> 01:10:29.620
whatever it is, did you meet the dark matter? Well,

1062
01:10:29.621 --> 01:10:33.940
how can I give this to you lightly? Okay. So this, this is confession time.

1063
01:10:33.941 --> 01:10:34.300
I've,

1064
01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:39.300
I've been looking for dark matter for 27 years and so far we have yet to see a

1065
01:10:41.561 --> 01:10:45.850
convincing set of uh, interactions that are Stacey with this dark matter.

1066
01:10:45.851 --> 01:10:49.300
And that's nothing at all. Yeah. Nothing bucks.

1067
01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:52.750
Rick hasn't given up hope a, I mean he sort of never gives up hope.

1068
01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:56.950
I mean he says maybe we just need to build a bigger, more sensitive detector.

1069
01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.610
That's of course exactly what we're doing instead of their current one,

1070
01:11:00.611 --> 01:11:02.050
which has a third of a ton of Xenon,

1071
01:11:02.051 --> 01:11:06.580
we are now designing and building a detector that's going to be a 10 tons.

1072
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:12.040
You see it says even there, who knows. The uncertainty we have to deal with is,

1073
01:11:12.041 --> 01:11:14.460
is, is at least a factor of 10 million,

1074
01:11:18.750 --> 01:11:20.580
<v 24>10,040.</v>

1075
01:11:20.581 --> 01:11:24.030
The other 25 pretty disappointed thing is that when you're in this room,

1076
01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.520
like in the room with the Lux detector,

1077
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:31.270
that's supposed to be the quietest place in the universe. It's loud. It's crazy.

1078
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:32.603
Louder.

1079
01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:39.050
There are sounds that I can only describe as robots dying.

1080
01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:44.240
<v 6>Like, listen to this.</v>

1081
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.970
<v 2>Was there any moment that was quiet? Like quiet? He quiet like deep, quiet,</v>

1082
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.870
fairly quiet.

1083
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.810
<v 7>Well [inaudible] sort of</v>

1084
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:09.490
after we, we went to the Lux, we had some time to kill and um,

1085
01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:13.240
they took us into the raw part of the mind where it is to mine for gold. And,

1086
01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:18.070
um, they just sort of walked us through these, oops. The huddles. He's scared

1087
01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:22.450
a little bit. Yeah. And you're,

1088
01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:27.400
you're walking through the black and all you hear is like the sound of our feet

1089
01:12:27.401 --> 01:12:28.234
crunching,

1090
01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:34.640
the wind is being sucked down. It's kind of rushing through Thomas. Yes.

1091
01:12:41.170 --> 01:12:45.490
And it's the silence. It's, it's not like, it's not like the science of like,

1092
01:12:45.790 --> 01:12:48.610
oh, the street is really quiet outside of my bedroom.

1093
01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.880
It's got like an energy to it. It's like I got, it's got like this room.

1094
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:54.183
<v 6>Mm.</v>

1095
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:05.030
<v 7>It's kind of like when you're running and when you stop running and the absence</v>

1096
01:13:05.521 --> 01:13:08.040
of your exertion sort of fills you. Yeah.

1097
01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:12.150
It's like that moment where the absence of the noise sort of becomes palpable.

1098
01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:20.440
And that's, for me, the moment not standing in the laboratory. For me,

1099
01:13:20.441 --> 01:13:21.910
that moment was the moment where I'm like,

1100
01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:25.210
now I am standing at the center of the xenon.

1101
01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.940
I don't think I ever, ever have felt that before.

1102
01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.793
<v 6>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

1103
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:56.380
<v 2>producer, Damiano Marchetti and Annie Mills,</v>

1104
01:13:56.410 --> 01:14:01.150
we have had Damiana with us for almost a year and it's been a total pleasure.

1105
01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:03.250
He is moving on. But we wish him,

1106
01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.600
what are you going to wish him and wish him quiet? The good kind of quiet,

1107
01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.180
you know, the kind that has energy. Oh, that's nice. You know the wool walk guy,

1108
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:16.840
that guy. Thank you. Damiano huge thanks to Thomas Dooley.

1109
01:14:16.841 --> 01:14:19.990
We had original music this hour from one through six point, never sylvan.

1110
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.460
So Kevin Drum,

1111
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:26.020
Ken Campton and VJ iron to Matt capus and to Connie Walter and to the folks at

1112
01:14:26.021 --> 01:14:31.021
Sanford underground research facility for letting us visit them and stay and

1113
01:14:31.121 --> 01:14:35.020
stay and ask so many questions and finally leave. Yeah.

1114
01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:38.050
Which is what we're about to do. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

1115
01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.940
Thanks for listening.
