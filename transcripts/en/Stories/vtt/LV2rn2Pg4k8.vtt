LAUREN STOVALL: |
always wanted a dog

00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:03.850
that I could have off leash.

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.820
He sticks with me on
hikes, if I tell him to.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.280
My name is Lauren Stovall.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.060
I an a Bluegrass musician.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.110
[MUSIC PLAYING] Spreads
her wings to fly.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:22.880
LAUREN STOVALL: I first
got inspired by tiny living

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.227
a couple years ago.

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:25.810
There's a lot of
great hiking up here.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.660
That's one of the things that
appealed to me about Boulder.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.620
You have the town, and then,
literally, from downtown you

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.580
can walk to these
pretty epic trails.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.230
Living up here, about 25
minutes from downtown,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.520
there's that much more space.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.270
Skippy is my full time roommate,
my best friend, my little dog.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.490
He's a Jack Russell.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.110
He's a little under 20
pounds, depending on the day,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.060
and how many treats he's eaten.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.910
He's 9 years old now, and I
got him when he was almost 2,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.460
and I had developed a
pretty strong fascination

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.460
with Jack Russells.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.020
It just so happened
that a friend of mine

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.310
had a Jack Russell
that she couldn't keep.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.820
She shipped him out to
Colorado, and I met him

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.670
in the parking lot of
the Cracker Barrel,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.080
and I wasn't so sure if
it was going to work out,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.430
and the next day I fell in love.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.180
This tiny house is
really special to me.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.300
My dad and I designed it.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.290
He built it out in Mississippi.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.970
And brought it to
Colorado for me,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.890
and it's been something that
we've, kind of, worked on.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.590
The process has been something
that we went through together.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.955
And he had the skills
and the ability.

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:37.470
I've been ready to
minimize for a long time,

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.132
but living out of the suitcase
for the last year and a half,

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:41.590
with the band and
stuff, just makes

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.650
you realize that you really
don't need that much.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.910
It's really important to
have a spot for everything,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.697
and to have these, sort
of, multifunctional--

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:55.030
like I have a stool, that's,
you know-- it's my ottoman,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.150
it's my kitchen, table,
chair, and it's also

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.130
where I put my clothes.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.840
It was cool being able
to design my own house,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.320
because I did have a
bunch of things in mind

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.380
that I wanted, not just space
saving ideas, but things that,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.750
sort of, represented
me, from little details,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.096
like, oh, I want a ceiling fan.

00:02:13.096 --> 00:02:15.220
That's something that we
grew up with in the south.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.860
Of course, plenty
of storage is great.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.330
And I wanted a lot of sunlight.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.260
Skippy being in a tiny
house is pretty cute.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.360
I had the couch custom built
so that I could put my guitar,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.850
and some other things under it.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.600
And there was just
this little space where

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.940
Skippy's bed happen to fit.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.850
And another thing that was
really hugely important to me

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.310
was having a way for Skippy
to get up into the loft,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.060
without me having to carry
him up and down the ladder

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.690
each night.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.200
We designed the stairs to
cater to Skippy's needs.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.600
Actually, he can get up them,
and he can get down them.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.840
I do carry him down, though.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.630
It feels a little safer
to his paranoid mother.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.810
When people think of me,
they think of Skippy.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.720
He's just a huge part of
my life, every single day.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.420
And he really is my best friend.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.294
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:16.830
INTERVIEWER: Be
sure to check out

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.190
another episode with former
pro snowboarder, Mike Basich,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.890
in his off-the-grid tiny home.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.530
So this is your dream.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.530
MIKE BASICH: This is it.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.090
INTERVIEWER: Since
you were a little boy,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.400
you've been wanting to do this.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.200
MIKE BASICH: This is
my dream in reality.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.860
40 acres to do whatever I want.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.860
It's really fun.
