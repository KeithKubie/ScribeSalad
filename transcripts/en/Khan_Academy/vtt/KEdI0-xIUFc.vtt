00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:01.364
- [Voiceover] Hi grammarians.

00:00:01.364 --> 00:00:04.255
Today I want to talk about
this idea, in English,

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:05.731
that we call agreement.

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.078
So, I'm going to teach
you how to be agreeable,

00:00:08.078 --> 00:00:11.589
make it so that all of your
sentences get along really well.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.237
Let me give you an example.

00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:16.360
"The dog barks,"

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.578
as opposed to,

00:00:18.578 --> 00:00:21.371
"The dogs bark."

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:23.519
Do you see the difference?

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.165
It's funny because the 's' seems

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:30.640
to migrate, seems to move
from one part of the sentence

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.173
to the other.

00:00:32.173 --> 00:00:33.990
So what you wouldn't say is,

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.438
"The dog bark."

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.667
That doesn't work.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.538
And you wouldn't say,

00:00:41.538 --> 00:00:46.298
"The dogs barks."

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:48.249
I know that seems strange

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.209
that you wouldn't want to have the 's'

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:53.079
follow the other 's',

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.409
but you actually only
want to have one of these

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:58.315
in a sentence.

00:00:58.315 --> 00:00:59.847
So, "The dog barks."

00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:02.169
"The dogs bark."

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:05.109
When there's only one
of something, strangely,

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:08.604
in the present tense, it takes this 's'.

00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:12.900
So, "Jake bakes a cake."

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.336
"We bake a cake."

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:21.282
Not, "Jake bake a cake,"

00:01:21.282 --> 00:01:23.743
which, admittedly, is
a fun sentence to say.

00:01:23.743 --> 00:01:27.700
But this is not, in standard
English, this is not correct.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.394
It doesn't exhibit what we call agreement.

00:01:31.394 --> 00:01:33.833
Similarly, you also wouldn't say,

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:38.047
"We bakes a cake."

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:39.997
If you're familiar with
the Lord of the Rings books

00:01:39.997 --> 00:01:42.319
or movies, if you remember Gollum,

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.066
the character Gollum is a
weird little bug-eyed critter

00:01:47.996 --> 00:01:51.631
whose just kind of
obsessed with the one ring,

00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:53.662
and he has this very
particular way of speaking

00:01:53.662 --> 00:01:57.507
that is not, strictly speaking, standard.

00:01:57.507 --> 00:01:59.661
He's just wild about that ring.

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.891
And the way he refers to everything,

00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:08.465
he just throws on an 's' on the end

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:11.077
of every word he uses, every verb.

00:02:11.077 --> 00:02:14.202
So, if he's talking about, you know,

00:02:14.202 --> 00:02:17.184
this magic ring that he's very fond of,

00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:18.970
which he calls the precious,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.155
he wouldn't just say, "I love it."

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:23.810
He'd say, "I loves it."

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.971
Like so, and that's not correct.

00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:29.537
That does not show agreement.

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:32.463
So, the test here is really...

00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:34.982
You can figure out whether or not

00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:38.475
you are using agreement in your sentences

00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:41.703
if you sound like Gollum.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.980
Because if Gollum were being grammatical,

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.009
he would say, "I love it."

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.351
So this is the sense that
I want you to develop

00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:55.099
is you listen to yourself
speak and you ask,

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.084
"Do I sound like Gollum,
the little ring monster?"

00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:01.473
Because if you do sound like Gollum,

00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:03.136
then you're probably not operating

00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:05.772
under the agreement rules

00:03:05.772 --> 00:03:08.465
of standard American English,

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:10.962
or you're just doing a Gollum impression.

00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:14.212
That's the basic idea behind agreement

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:15.397
Is you just want to make sure

00:03:15.397 --> 00:03:18.241
that the parts of the sentence match up.

00:03:18.241 --> 00:03:19.978
Sentence parts

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:26.239
match.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:26.937
They agree.

00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:28.017
They get along.

00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:29.427
They work.

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:31.929
You can learn anything.

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:33.229
David out.
