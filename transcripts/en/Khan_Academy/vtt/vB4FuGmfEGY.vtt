00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.210
Find the probability of
rolling doubles on two

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.890
six-sided dice, numbered
from 1 to 6.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.100
So let's just think about it.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.720
Let's think about all of the
outcomes, all of the possible

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.030
outcomes, and then what fraction
of those outcomes

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.670
represent us getting doubles.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.380
We want to roll doubles.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.640
So let's make a little table
here that'll give us all of

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.740
our outcomes.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.450
You have 6 outcomes on the first
dice, or the first die I

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.900
should say.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.950
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770
So let's call this
the first die.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.270
And then the second die,
there are 6 outcomes.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.550
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.115
This is the second die.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.230
So all of the different possible
outcomes are going to

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.760
be some-- you're going to get an
outcome-- so you could get

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.710
a 3 over here.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.550
And then when you get a 3 on the
second die, you might have

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.260
gotten a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
or 6 on the first die.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.800
Or you might have gotten a 5 on
the first die and then you

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.560
could get a 1, 2 3, 4, 5,
or 6 on the second die.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.580
So if I draw a grid here.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.930
If I were to draw a grid here,
let me do my best to draw a

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.456
quick grid.

00:01:16.456 --> 00:01:20.310
Just draw it really fast. So
let me just draw this grid

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520
right here.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.280
Each cell of this grid, each
box in this grid, would

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.530
represent an outcome.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.990
All of the possible outcomes.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.520
Let me finish drawing it.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.540
So there you go.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.000
And so just to get an
understanding of what I mean

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.140
by it represents an outcome.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.280
This cell right here would
represent getting a 4 on your

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.750
first die and a 2 on
your second die.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.820
That's the outcome
it represents.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.680
It's one of the potential
outcomes.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.590
Now how many total outcomes
are there?

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.850
Well you could look at the
area of this right here.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.470
The area of this is going
to be 6 times 6.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.080
You have 36 possible outcomes.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.639
So 36 possible outcomes.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.260
And it makes sense.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.480
You can think about
the first die.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.970
There's 6 outcomes.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.380
And then for each of those 6
outcomes, you have 6 possible

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.830
outcomes for the second die.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.560
So 6 times 6.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.450
Or you can think of in
this grid, it has

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.850
exactly 36 cells in it.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.640
Now what are the outcomes that
satisfy our conditions?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.900
That entail us getting
doubles?

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.330
What are the outcomes there?

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.260
Well we could get a 1.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.100
If we get a 1 on the first die,
we have to get a 1 on the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.810
second die.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.150
If we get a 2 on the first die,
we have to get a 2 on the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.880
second die.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.190
If we get a 3 on the first die,
we have to get a 3 on the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.180
second die.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.360
I think you see where
this is going.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.710
4 and 4.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.940
5 and 5.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.720
And then 6 and 6.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.420
So how many of these outcomes
involve us getting double?

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.990
Well, it's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6 outcomes.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:11.420
So there's 6 outcomes
with doubles.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.690
So if someone asks
you, what's the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.990
probability of getting doubles?

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.250
The probability of getting
doubles when you rolled two

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.230
six-sided dice, numbered
from 1 to 6.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.390
It's going to be equal to the
number of outcomes that give

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.830
us doubles-- so it's going to
be equal to 6-- over the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.580
number of the total number
of possible outcomes.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.520
Over 36.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.360
And 6 over 36 is 1/6.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.670
Now I made sure that you kind of
understood that look, these

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.320
are all the possible outcomes.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.130
And 6 of them satisfy.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.240
So 6 of the 36.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.180
So there's a 1/6 probability
of rolling doubles.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.390
But another way you could have
thought about it is, you know

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.000
what, let's just roll
the first die.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.730
It's going to have some
number on it, right?

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.610
The first die is going to
have some number on it.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.630
Now in order for me to have
doubles, the second die has to

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.010
have that same exact number
on it, right?

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.410
So I don't care what
the first die is.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.950
It could be a 3, it could
be a 4, it could be a 5.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.960
I don't know what that is.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.400
But after I've rolled that first
die, in order to get

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.630
doubles, what the second die
roll is-- they might be almost

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.200
simultaneous-- but what the
second die rolls matters.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.890
And so whatever number I have
on the first die, there's a

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:27.070
1/6 chance that the second die
is going to have that same

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.770
number on it.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.430
So that's another way
of reasoning that

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.260
you have a 1/6 chance.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.180
The first die does anything it
wants, but there's only a 1 in

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.410
6 chance that the second die
is going to have the same

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.420
thing as the first die.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.050
Either way, you get to
the same 1/6 answer.
