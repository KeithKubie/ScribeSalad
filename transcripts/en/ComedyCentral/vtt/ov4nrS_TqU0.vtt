- You know, for the
past couple of nights,

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:05.271
here on the program,

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:06.539
we've been dealing
with the fallout

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.975
from the Grand jury
decision in Missouri

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:10.543
failing to indict the
officer responsible

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.178 align:start size:84% position:16%
for the shooting death
of Michael Brown.

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:16.683
We did our best, here,
to process those events,

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.952 align:start size:84% position:16%
even enjoyed,
actually, a bit of fun

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.520
at the expense of
the St. Luis Rams

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.423 align:start size:88% position:13%
and St. Louis Police
Association Twitter war.

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:27.227 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I know doing those
bits helps no one,

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:29.262
other than, maybe, us here
at the show, individually,

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:32.332 align:start size:84% position:16%
as a creative
outlet, a catharsis,

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.968 align:start size:97% position:3%
a way of processing emotion
that might otherwise

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.169
be undigested.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:39.072 align:start size:88% position:13%
By the way, that process
brought to you by:

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:39.973 line:0%
Arby's.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.574 line:0%
(audience laughing)

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:44.677 line:0%
Arby's: You think pain and
grief are hard to digest.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.680
(audience laughing)

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.418
But, anyway,

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.255
at least that process has begun.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.324
And we were glad to be able to
move forward, ever so slowly,

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.193 align:start size:84% position:16%
hoping that we
might, as a country,

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.662 align:start size:94% position:6%
have a respite from these
types of injustices,

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:06.232
and we did have a
respite for, maybe,

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.535
oh, (bleep), what time is it?

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:11.671 line:0%
- No indictment in the
death of Eric Garner,

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:15.175 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
a Grand Jury in New York City
has decided not to charge

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.811 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
a white New York City
police officer in the death

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.081 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
of an unarmed
African American man.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:22.982
- I just, I don't know.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.320
I honestly don't
know what to say.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.225 align:start position:0%
If comedy is tragedy plus
time, I need more (bleep) time,

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.994
but I would really settle
for less (bleep) tragedy,

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.229
to be honest with you.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.698
You know, I think what
is so utterly depressing

00:01:38.698 --> 00:01:41.000 align:start size:88% position:13%
is that none of the
ambiguities that existed

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.838
in the Ferguson case exist
in the Staten Island case,

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:48.007
and yet the outcome
is exactly the same.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.878
No crime, no trial,
all harm, no foul.

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:54.380
In Ferguson, at least you had
conflicting witness testimony,

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.849
you had conflicting forensics,

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.152 align:start size:97% position:3%
you had the specter, at
least, of police self-defense.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.988
But here, there is none of that.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.356 align:start size:81% position:19%
The coroner called
it a homicide.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:06.192 align:start size:97% position:3%
The guy's not acting
threatening, and we know that,

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.994
not through witness testimony,

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:09.395
unreliable biased standards,

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.398
but because we are
(bleep) watching it.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:14.100
Someone taped it.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.436 align:start position:0%
A couple of days ago, the White
House proposed more cameras

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:20.507
on cop vests as a solution
to this type of violence.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:22.742 align:start size:94% position:6%
I assume that the solution
they're proposing,

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:24.210
if implemented,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.779 align:start size:94% position:6%
would look something like
the Eric Garner case.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:30.283 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean, maybe, to look
at the bright side,

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.219 align:start size:97% position:3%
we're about to save ourselves
a (bleep) load of money

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.320
on cop camera vests.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.524
But, damn.

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.226 align:start size:97% position:3%
We are definitely not living
in a post-racial society,

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.628
and I can imagine there are
a lot of people out there

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:46.566 align:start position:0%
wondering how much of a
society we're living in at all.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:47.534
And, that's our show.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:48.501
So, cha-cha-cha.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.036
(audience laughing)

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.004
(yells)

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.706
I don't know what to say,

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:55.675
it just happened so I
have not had a chance

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:57.443
to really digest it.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.711
I'm gonna need a segue,

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.146
I'm gonna need a little
piece of video footage

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.081
to change the mood here.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:09.656
(audience laughing)

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:15.662
okay, it's nice, I like it.

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:16.563 align:start size:84% position:16%
Although, in my
current frame of mind,

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.830
I can't help but wonder,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.465
"Oh, of course the white
cat's getting a massage.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.967
(audience laughing)

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.236
(sighs)

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:25.471
(screams)

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:26.773
(bleep)

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:29.776
(audience laughing)
