00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.660
I grew up in a theater family. My

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.460
father produced Shakespeare festivals.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.590
We were all theater rats, me and my

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.260
siblings. The first time I acted on stage

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.800
I think I was about two years old. It was

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.930
my background and my father was my great

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.410
hero growing up. I mean Harvard as an

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.930
institution has never seen itself as an

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.130
arts conservatory, but you don't get into

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.690
Harvard if you don't have some

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.630
experience of the arts and, no question,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.579
there was no studying the arts at

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.320
Harvard when I was here, but those were

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.410
the four most creative years of my life,

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.760
bar none. And of course now there's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.360
the theater, dance, and media department. You

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.780
can get a degree for it. We created

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.170
horrible theater. I was a catastrophic

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.109
singer and yet, my god, I stopped the show

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.420
in a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta which

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.309
may just have been the very moment when

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.640
I decided to become an actor. The arts

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.240
define a culture, they define who we are.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.720
Country music defines us absolutely as

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.180
much as a Broadway theater. There is so

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.700
much concentration on the STEM subjects

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.280
so I came up with the image of a flower.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.960
The STEM subjects are the stem of the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.420
flower: they service the blossom but the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.439
arts of the blossom and they are what

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.170
define the flower. That's what gives the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.490
flower its beauty, its identity, its

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.400
ability to reproduce itself. Young people

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.409
should keep alive their interest in the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.420
arts for their whole lives. We all

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.189
benefit from self-expression and joy. I

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.640
mean, creative joy: there's something that

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.189
just keeps us all alive and it is so much a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.310
part of a human being's sense of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.280
himself or herself. I'm very flattered

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.590
when people say that I give back to the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.340
Harvard community, but believe me it's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.610
completely selfishly motivated.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.050
It took me a while for it to really

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.060
dawn on me how important Harvard has

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.220
been to me because off I went into the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.890
entertainment world, which is so

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.350
different from the Harvard world. But

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.840
since I've sort of come back to the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.880
community and been embraced by the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.570
community and re-embraced the community it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.440
really has been so much a part of my life.
