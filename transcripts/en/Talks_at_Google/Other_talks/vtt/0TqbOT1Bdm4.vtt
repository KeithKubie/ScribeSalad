having spoken to him to date I know that he
is going to keep us all quite enthralled.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.389
As a heart transplant patient and an amazing
athlete and someone that has achieved quiet

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.789
phenomenal things considering. So I am going
to invite Joe to come up here. We have got

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.440

tell his story and then if anyone has any

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.590
questions then please feel free to ask them
at the end as well. Ok, Joe.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.660
&gt;&gt; English Joe:
Cool.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:23.860
[background noise]
I'm not professional so don't expect anything

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.910
good.
[laughter]

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:38.870
Alright um, I am Joe Matthews. I am from Suffolk
in, well England, small fishing town called

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:46.280
Lowestoft. Ever since I was younger really
I have been into sports, played rugby since

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.220
I was like the age of four. And yeah, that's
my story basically. Yeah, so I started playing

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.430
rugby when I was four, touch rugby with my
dad was my coach, my brother played as well.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:10.440
Progressed quite swiftly though that to be
fair. Got playing for Captain North, I played

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.389
for Captain Norfolk from the age of like,
I think eleven. I played Captain Norfolk and

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:21.579
I went though and then for a few years. Then
I got selected to play for Eastern Counties

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:29.790
when I was fourteen, I think, yeah, fourteen.
And yeah, it looked like rugby was going to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.709
be my thing, you know, I was getting along
really well with it. Yeah, it was the life

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.560
I was going to pursue I guess. Anyway, um,
I've got some good family friends that live

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.999
in California in America and mum and dad come
up to me one day and they said "Well look,

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:53.860
you're going to go to America and spend Christmas
over there." And like every rugby guy my age

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.749
at the time it has been drilled into us wherever
you go you take your rugby boots cause there

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:04.459
is always a rugby team willing to you know,
let you join in to train and whatnot. So I

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.919
took my rugby boots over there and â€¦oops
that's early. Anyway, so I took my rugby boots

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:18.200
over there and basically, yeah, when I got
introduced to my uncle, I will call him my

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.139
uncle, he is not really my uncle, but a good
family friend anyway. Went and played for,

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.140
went and trained with one of his teams, the
team he used to play for. Anyway they fell

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.680
in love with me and they kindly invited me
back over the following summer to play seven-a-side

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.439
rugby in a few seven-a-side rugby tournaments.
Um, so I went back home, worked really hard

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:47.419
and you know got a Saturday job at the time
'cause I was really young. And went over and

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.730
played in the seven-a-side rugby tournaments
but like at a proper adult level and I was

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.740
only fifteen at the time. So went over there
played in all these tournaments across California,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.469
did Las Vegas, been like sevens, all big rugby
tournaments, you probably ain't got any clue

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:05.180
what that is all about but it is a big deal
over there anyway. So I played in these tournaments

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.440
and at the end, and at these tournaments they
had like these particular university scouts

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.959
and everything. And a few of them would come
and approach me afterwards and said you know

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.710
"What college do you go to? We would like
you to come and play for our University."

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.780
And um, you know, I turned around and I would
say I am on holiday, I am fifteen and I didn't

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:38.160
go to college yet. And they were like, Ok.
So they went and spoke to a few guys on my

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.760
team and one of the guys on the team happened
to be, worked in the international department

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.970
at the local college where the rugby team
was from. And come up to me and said "Look

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.280
Joe, this is something from which could be
a possibility. Go back to England and have

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.160
a word with your parents, you know, a lot
of Universities are showing a great interest

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:03.610
in you. Come out here and you know try and
get applied for your Visa. Come out and become

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:11.590
a student so you can work your way and obtain
the grades then you know ship on to a University.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.750
But obviously your scholarship would be all
paid for."

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.340
So that's what I went home and did. So I went
home and had to start a Saturday job. I was

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:26.920
a lifeguard at the time so I worked hard when
I wasn't at school. I did six forms working

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.720
part time. And then at the end of the sixth
form year got decent grades but I had applied

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:40.220
for my Visa and I got accepted. So I went
over to America to pursue a career in rugby

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.000
but to the US Government it was to pursue
a career in education so I could get my Visa.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:54.440
Anyway, um, I am bablin' on a bit. So I went
over there and I did really well at school.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.410
One of the things that it said in the Visa
is you have to do well in school. If you didn't

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:05.430
do well in school you would get sent back.
So I made sure I did well, achieved real high

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:13.880
grades. So basically I was eligible to go
to Berkley, you need a high GPA over there

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.010
or whatever. So anyway did all these different
tournaments and stuff and played in all these

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:22.741
games and all these leagues, at foster team
and was playing for and we managed to get

00:06:22.741 --> 00:06:30.090
to the national semi-finals. So out of the
whole of America we got to the semi-finals.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.500
We lost, we didn't become National Champions,
but we got in the semi-finals. So we got second

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.970
but of course we playing rugby over there
grew more interest from all these people outside

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:49.300
who were like "Who is this Joe Matthews?"
or English Joe is what I was called over there.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.790
Um, being English and my name Joe. [laughter]
Anyway, um, so they come up and they said

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:00.050
"Look we would really like, we are really
interested in you at San Francisco Golden

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.690
Gate," which is like the top premier ship
side say, in the country. I have the University

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.590
of Berkley really interested, the University
of Marigo basically they were fighting over

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:16.680
me. And I had the University saying "Come
to our University. No, come to our University.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.560
Well, if you come to our University we will
give you a Dodge Ram," or you know offer me

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.950
all these cars and all.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:31.540
Went back in Christmas of '05, so 2005 in
Christmas went back. I had developed myself

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:38.841
as a great athlete, I was really big, not
fat or anything, I was really big. You know

00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:45.050
I shot up, I filled out, I was a decent sized
rugby player, like someone you didn't want

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.920
to mess with on the field I guess. Anyway,
um I went back and showed off basically to

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.400
my family. "Look what I have made myself into.
Look what all these different colleges and

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:03.230
professional teams are offering me. Basically
told my mum and dad, well not just told them,

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.680
but basically said you know, sat down with
them and talked. I said I got this team interested,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.250
I got this professional club interested, looks
like I have made it as a rugby player. That's

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:18.820
going to be my career now. You know have to
worry about me anymore, I have made it. Anyway,

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:24.760
um, so that was Christmas '05 and then I went
back after New Year. Had New Year with my

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.360
family and my friends and everything, went
back after New Year and played in all these

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:34.080
tournaments again, um, all these games, all
these league games doing really well. Looked

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:42.240
like I was going to finish that season out
then move up and go into whoever was interested.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:50.360
And in February, um, a couple of games I started
feeling quite breathless and like I wasn't

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:57.960
the fastest on a loose ball on the ground.
I was always like the second one there and

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:06.140
it wasn't like me, I was always the first
one there. And my coach could notice and we

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:10.910
were playing against Berkley in a National
League game and seventy minutes into that

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:17.870
game I was over on my hands and knees basically
gasping for air. So my coach took me off and

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:24.270
said "Alright Joe, you have worked hard this
game. Come off and rest. We don't need you,

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.160
we won the game. You just rest for ten minutes
until the end." At the end of the game felt

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.860
fine so I sat down and had done nothing for
ten minutes. Went to the bar afterwards, had

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:42.970
a few beers with everyone, you know everything
like normal. My uncle, I call him my uncle,

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:46.840
the people I was living with at the time had
decided to go on Holiday. So they weren't

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:55.790
at home so I was all home alone, went home
and managed to sit in the hot tub and just

00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:01.601
chill out and recover after a hard game of
rugby. Anyway went home sat in the hot tub

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:07.610
felt fine, went up, um got out of the hot
tub, sat up and I coughed a bit. So I thought

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.270
I would give mum and dad a call, um, they
would be up now. I would give mum and dad

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:16.580
a call and just to tell them how I am feeling.
I text Rod and Kelly, who I was living with,

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:22.990
and just told them what the situation was
and mum said make sure you go to the doctors

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:29.550
tomorrow morning, you know being mum. And
I thought well I've only got a cold, don't

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.550
worry about it.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:37.270
Anyway didn't go to the doctors the next day
and um, actually went surfing I think. Felt

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:45.540
fine, did the gym. I used to do this thing
called CrossFit, which is like a big military-based

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:51.070
like workout plan with all the team. So I
did that on Tuesday, trained Tuesday night

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:59.490
with the rugby team. Wednesday, my mate come
and knocked at me door, kind of scared [inaudible]

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:08.760
tried to make it to college [inaudible] reached
the park at the sports side of campus. There

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.510
was a set of stairs that went over onto the
academic side. We used to race each other

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:18.090
up the stairs and I would always come first.
Got to around the top of the stairs and he

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:23.029
was miles in front of me and again I am crying
out like an old woman.

00:11:23.029 --> 00:11:27.020
[huffing sound]
He is like "Ah, man up, man up girl" stuff

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.680
like that.
[laughs]

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:34.830
Anyway I said do you mind if we go to the
college doctor after we have been through

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.160
our first class. Thinking, I am in America,
they are bound to give me something. They

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.440
got some kind of tablet for every type of
you name it; they got a tablet for it. So

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.800
I went to the doctor afterwards, she did the
general stethoscope of my heart, my lungs

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:57.080
and everything. Scared the hell out of her.
Um and she told me to go straight to the local

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.970
hospital to have a chest x-ray. She phoned
ahead to let them know I was coming. Um, didn't

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:08.850
go straight there, stopped off to have a sandwich,
I had my mobile phone going off. "Joe why

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.830
aren't you there? I told you to go straight
there. You told me you'd go straight there."

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:17.510
Um, I only just stopped off for a sandwich,
I'm hungry.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.330
[laughs]
Went there

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.510
[laughs]
I think about an hour later I get a phone

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:29.560
call back at home. Missed the phone call,
the house phone then goes off and I have got

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:36.310
the college doctor on the phone again basically
saying "Joe you need to get to Santa Cruz

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:42.230
Hospital ASAP. I don't want to scare you or
anything but you got something. Something

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.360
is up and I need you to get there straight
away." I thought well you are not scaring

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.420
me as such but I am feeling a bit on edge
now 'cause you have showed me that you are

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:54.690
in a bit of a panic and everything. She said
"Well, you need someone to drive you there,

00:12:54.690 --> 00:13:00.210
you can't drive yourself cause you will probably
be there over night." So my girlfriend at

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:06.890
the time she drove me there and she said "I've
called ahead to let them know that you are

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:11.470
coming." I said "Well, would you mind just
telling me what is going on now?" and she

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:17.180
said "Well, you have got an enlarged heart
and a load of fluid on the lungs." Well fluid

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.370
on the lungs I thought, well I am not the
first person to have fluid on the lungs, um

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:26.240
take something for that, get rid of it. Enlarged
heart, I thought well it's common in athletes

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.240
anyways 'cause they are always working out;
they are always doing physical activity. So

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.610
their hearts are generally a bit bigger then
someone that doesn't play sports or whatnot.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:41.300
Anyway, so I went to Dominican. Walked into
this massive hospital, there's all these patients

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:46.230
sitting there and they are like waiting to
see someone. I had a doctor there waiting

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:51.980
for me with a clipboard "Joe Matthews?" as
I walked in I was like looking around since

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.180
I didn't know the place. I was like "Yeah,"
and was like "Come with me," and they took

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:03.790
me and my girlfriend at the time, they took
me straight to a separate room so they could

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.790
check me out.

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:09.860
So basically I had all these tests. I had
all these different things they were testing

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:15.560
me on and basically I had an enlarged heart
and they couldn't reduce the swelling of it.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:20.770
So I had all these picc lines in me and, bear
in mind my mum and dad are in England and

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:29.330
the people I am living with, that I call family,
are on Holiday, high in the Alps doing whatever.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.860
And there is me in a bed. What's going on?
One minute feeling really fine, fit and everything.

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:40.040
The next minute being told you can't do anything
you just have to lay here and wait until we

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:47.709
tell you what's up. So they said that, I remember,
well if I am honest I can't really remember

00:14:47.709 --> 00:14:53.980
a great deal of it cause I will um, tell you
the story later. But um, basically I remember

00:14:53.980 --> 00:15:03.670
waking up there and my dad being at the end
of the bed and I'm thinking, um you were in

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:09.910
England which is quite a whiles away. Um you
know, from when I last remembered. And I wake

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.870
up my dad's at the end of the bed and I am
like "What are you doing here?" and my uncle

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:21.560
and aunt have come off their Holiday and they
are at the end of the bed. I'm like "What

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.000
are you guys doing here? I'm fine I only have
a cold I think." And they are like "Well,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.720
nothings up Joe. We just came in and we wanted
to, we heard you were in the hospital and

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.230
we just wanted to check up on you." My dad
was like "Oh I had extra time off work." 'Cause

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:40.431
my mum and dad were meant to come out and
see me before, in a bit later anyway, so he

00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:49.209
said "I got some extra time off work so I
come out sooner and I will meet your mum and

00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:56.610
your brother here." So basically I got admitted
into Santa Cruz Hospital. Told that I had

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:04.980
an enlarged heart and was taken to the cardiac
ward, my dad was there like I said and basically

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.760
all these tests were going on and they were
talking behind my back. They weren't telling

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.110
my anything, not telling my dad anything,
doing all these discussion. I had people coming

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:20.972
in and out of my room looking at me and the
clip board and I was like "What the hell is

00:16:20.972 --> 00:16:23.519
going on?" They are walking out, leaving,
and going to see someone else, going to talk

00:16:23.519 --> 00:16:27.620
to someone else. Then more persons coming
in with a clip board, ask me a few questions,

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:33.190
heading out and then basically [laughs] I
said basically a lot, didn't I?

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:42.240
Anyway and then Jim Glancy, the cardiologist
there, who was my cardiologist at the time

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.561
come in and he just did a few more tests.
I said "Look, do you mind just stopping and

00:16:46.561 --> 00:16:53.330
just telling me what is going on? I know I
am in young in America, but in England I would

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.410
know what was going on a few days ago. Just
treat me like an adult now and I am asking

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:03.190
you to tell me what is up." So he shut the
door and he basically sat on the end of my

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:12.559
bed and um, with my dad and basically told
me that I had an enlarged heart and I had

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:15.860
a very strong arrhythmia so my heart wasn't
beating

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:21.589
[pounds fist into hand]
normal like it was supposed to, it was like

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:24.230
kind of spasming in and out and going all
over the place. I would have to have a defibrillator

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:29.480
fitted which was a little device that fits
in underneath your collar bone and which would

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.480
shock my heart every time that it goes out
of control and it would make it back into

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:42.250
that steady rhythm. Um, so he told me that,
so basically he said that there is one side

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:49.510
effect, you can't do any physical activity.
Well you know before, it was quite emotional

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.780
for me, um before I had made it as a rugby
playing and my career had just been [ swishing

00:17:52.780 --> 00:18:00.260
sound] you know whipped clear. Anyway he told
me that and he said like we can't, we are

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:06.799
not going to do the operation here; we want
to transfer you to Stanford. Which is like

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:14.610
the best place in the whole world for cardiology,
you know you will be in better care there.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:20.920
Which before all this was happening to me
I didn't really give it, I couldn't really

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:26.540
care, to be honest. I just thought well that
is my life over. Um, went to Stanford and

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:34.080
my mum and my brother are there, again this
is all kind of faint. Went into the operation

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:40.250
to have this defibrillator fitted, it was
meant to take like an hour and a half to two

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:46.230
hours. And two hours and twenty minutes later
my mum was sitting, mum and dad was sitting

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:52.841
outside with my brother and they um alarms
go off and everything. At the end of the operation

00:18:52.841 --> 00:19:03.920
they slow your heart down to test the defibrillator
and my heart didn't respond to the defibrillator.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.870
Um, I am getting all emotional, well anyway.
My heart didn't respond to the defibrillator

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:13.990
and defibrillator worked; my heart was that
weak and didn't respond and I cardiac arrested,

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:22.490
I was like clinically dead for like five and
a half minutes. So um, mum and dad are in

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.971
wrecks and it is a relief that I didn't have
a clue what was going on.

00:19:25.971 --> 00:19:33.980
[audience laughs]
Um, yeah so, next thing I remember is waking

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:44.530
up in intensive care and going to sit up,
but can't sit up. Skip this one. Can't sit

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:52.170
up basically 'cause um you see this thing
here? [points at photo] that's the big machine,

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:58.210
it is about this big, there's pipes going
from in and leading all the way along and

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:07.290
going into me and basically pumping my heart
for me. Um, you can see it about there. Anyway,

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:13.470
um, so this machine comes out and it is pumping
my heart, so I wake up and I can't sit up

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:21.720
so I look and I see this machine and I see
like blood flowing down one and spinning around

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:30.140
and flowing up the other. Well I kind of panic
a bit, which I regret 'cause I made my mum

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.970
nearly have a heart attach to be fair.
[laughs]

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:44.130
So I panic a bit, I am trying to rip the pipes
out of my, they are in me, strapped to me,

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:49.400
and I am trying to rip them out. I have all
these IV lines and picc lines in me and I

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:56.940
am trying to rip everything out. I have got
cameras up my nose and a load of tubes and

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:02.970
everything and I am trying to rip all them
out. So if I am painting a bad picture I am

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:07.250
just trying to set the scene [laughter]. So
I am ripping all this stuff out, basically

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:13.809
I am being a complete, excuse my French, but
an asshole to everyone. Um and my brother,

00:21:13.809 --> 00:21:19.419
my dad and a few other doctors are basically
holding me down. I'm tied down to the bed,

00:21:19.419 --> 00:21:28.510
again I can remember the little things, to
me if just seems like a bad dream. I can't

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:35.570
remember everything. Next thing I remember
waking up in the cardiac ward and the doctor,

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:44.150
um, the doctor standing over me Bobby Robbins,
who I have mentioned before. Anyway, Bobby

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:52.630
Robbins is standing there and he basically
told me I've got two choices. I have a heart

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:58.440
transplant or I don't and I eventually die.
Which I kind of thought was a bit stupid you

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:05.510
know, why would I want to die? But in America
you have to do what all the Americans do,

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:08.520
you have to ask cause the law suits and stuff.
Like my family could sue if I had the transplant

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:16.410
and I didn't really want it or something like
that. So I basically say "Yes, I want the

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:22.230
heart transplant." I was then asked, right,
you need to be set. You can't be completely

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:28.490
weak when you have your transplant so you
need to get your fitness back and that's why,

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:38.309
on this slide here I'm on this, my dad, I
wake up the next morning, sorry if I am going

00:22:38.309 --> 00:22:42.120
on. I wake up one morning and there is an
exercise bike in my room. I'm like, my dad

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:51.970
is at the end of my bed or sitting beside
me, [points to slide of picture] he had spoken

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:57.630
to this professor Dr. Robins and basically
said "would you mind if we get Joe an exercise

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:07.740
bike? He will be a lot fitter for the transplant
if you put him on that." You know and Bobby

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:15.570
Robbins thought well he has just had cardiac
arrest, he has the machine pumping his heart

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:21.460
and that little thing went off in his head
and he thought, well he's got the machine

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.948
pumping his heart so he doesnâ€™t really need
to pump his heart himself. He is quite alright

00:23:24.948 --> 00:23:32.260
to go on the exercise bike. So for a week
I went on this exercise bike four times a

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:39.550
day, I had ankle weights on, and I had like
these wrist grip things. Four times a day

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:44.860
I was on this exercise bike trying to get
fit for this, so I was ready to have a transplant.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:52.450
I'd go for walks, but when I wanted to go
for walks, that meant that this big thing

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:56.510
here [points to slide of picture] needs to
come with me. And that meant one of the nurses

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:02.059
having to walk around and follow me basically.
So I could only walk for like five minutes

00:24:02.059 --> 00:24:07.410
'cause they wouldn't allow, not 'cause I wasn't
physically able to, but because the nurses

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.930
couldn't physically push this thing around.
My mum and dad weren't allowed to touch this

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:17.770
piece of equipment. So I would like walk around
the ward for like five minutes and I would

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.679
keep up I would go back and I would rest,
I would be like "I want to go for another

00:24:20.679 --> 00:24:26.169
walk." And the nurse would be like really,
really, you know, that's not happening. We

00:24:26.169 --> 00:24:32.289
are not doing any more today.
Anyway so I kicked up a bit of a fuss, I was

00:24:32.289 --> 00:24:41.870
a bit of a pain to be honest, but I kept up
a bit of a fuss, enough pace to have a nurse,

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:46.960
the person in charge of the machine. That
person to come out from whatever she was doing

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.789
to my room to teach my mum and dad how to
operate this machine if the power goes. So

00:24:53.789 --> 00:25:02.440
then my mum and dad could then push this machine
for, cause my dad is quite a big guy, push

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:08.860
this machine wherever I wanted to go I could
walk and my dad could push it. Um, so it's

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:17.000
on a battery and the battery lasts I think
four hours, but just in case it doesnâ€™t,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:26.020
there is a pump. And this nurse is basically
sat down beside my bed, my mum and dad are

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:33.340
around, and we like unplug it, it's running
on this battery, I need to show you how to

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:38.299
operate it if it was to switch off. So she
switches off this machine, she's got this

00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:44.260
pump and she is like sitting there and pumping
this pump for my heart basically in her hand.

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:49.420
Showing my mum and dad and she's like "Right
now it's your go." And she passes it over

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:55.280
to my dad and he was like pumping it and then
passes it to my mom and at this point she

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.790
is like shaking and everything. She gets the
pump and, no way am I lying, she drops the

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:07.049
pump and my heart goes in my mouth. I am like
"OHHH!" I'm holding my breath thinking what

00:26:07.049 --> 00:26:15.800
is going to happen now. The nurse who was
showing my mum and dad was like "If that happens

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.970
you just stamp on it like this" [audience
laughs] And then she switched it back on and

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:26.450
from that point on I didn't allow my mum to
operate that machine or anything it was just

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:33.490
my dad. Anyway um, cut a long story short.
That happened, I got fit and I was able to

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:41.980
have a heart transplant. Um April 2nd, I got
a phone call, had all these nurses in, ask

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:46.200
me a lot of this stuff, a lot of people coming
in my room like at five in the morning "We

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:51.350
want your blood, we want to do more test."
And I was like "Just leave me alone." And

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:56.240
I wanted to watch a movie, so I sat down with
my mum and watched Forest Gump, I think was

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:03.120
one of the DVD I could have chosen, choosed,
I chose. So anyway I watched Forest Gump and

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.190
at the end of Forest Gump a leaf falls from
the tree and no word of a lie, the phone rang

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:20.890
and I though "right, joked with her, it's
probably my heart" and mum went outside to

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:28.260
listen to the nurse, nurse looked over at
my mom and was like "It's Joe's heart." And

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.440
come in and room and told me I had a heart
and I was like ecstatic "Yes, I got a heart!"

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:41.770
They said right it is going to be in here
in like six hours, no more than like six hours.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:47.470
We need to clean you completely, so they did
the whole iodine stuff, cleaned me and made

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:54.610
me all sterile for the operation. Two AM,
or like one AM I went down to the theater

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:56.820
to have the transplant.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.620
The eve, don't know if you ever heard of a
guy called Dr. Norman Shumway, he was the

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:08.230
first guy to ever perform a heart transplant
in America. He is from Stanford, he died of

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:16.780
cancer earlier that year and they had a memorial
on April 2nd in the evening. Um, which all

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:23.220
these doctors who worked at Stanford and worshipped
this guy were meant to be going to, but for

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:28.870
some reason I had a heart come for me and
they couldn't go to this thing and they had

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:36.240
to perform you know, my transplant. So um,
went down, don't really remember too much.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.020
Just remember having Bob Marley on in my iPod
or something like that, saying goodbye to

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:46.130
mum and dad and saying that "I will see you
when I get out" and having this transplant.

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:53.120
Come out of the transplant, seven hours later,
went alright and they treated me really, really

00:28:53.120 --> 00:29:02.380
good. And I think, I just jumped, going on
a bit, um. Had the transplant, ICU, was in

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:10.290
there ten days and was out back on the cardiac
ward. Earlier before I went down for the transplant

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:15.840
and I was waiting for the heart and some guy
had come in and me being all competitive I

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:21.450
wanted to, you know, know who was the fastest
person out of the hospital and stuff like

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:27.610
that, who's had the heart transplant, what's
he done since, what's possible. So I thought

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.380
when I got told I was going to have a heart
transplant I thought, dang, my life is over.

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:37.490
That's me, wheelchair bound; stupid to think
that but at the time I never been familiar

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.710
with transplants. I was nineteen and you know
you donâ€™t expect a nineteen year old to

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:49.460
have to have a heart transplant. You think
of old people and pensioners and anyway, they

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.840
said we have this guy he has had a transplant
and six months later he is back skiing again.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.919
I'm thinking well all right, he is actually
coming in for a visit. Do you mind bringing

00:29:58.919 --> 00:30:05.679
him down and asking him if he would come and
have a chat with me please, um he basically

00:30:05.679 --> 00:30:09.370
came in and said, well he is all cocky and
said "Yeah, I had a transplant, I was out

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:16.520
of the hospital within I think two months
. I was back skiing six months later. I'm

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:22.380
the fastest there is and the fastest there
every well be." Well, the competitive nature

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.410
in me
[snaps fingers]

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:31.600
and I was , alright "That's great. I really
appreciate you coming down here. Just before

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:38.640
you go, [inaudible] he stopped and all your
records are now going to be broken, guaranteed."

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.120
[laughs]
Which I didn't have no control over, something

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.380
could have gone wrong in the operation and
it could have been slumped out. Anyways so

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:51.860
at the transplant, ten days later I was out
of intensive care and back on the cardiac

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:56.590
ward. And from that point on I was like, right,
my goal is to get out of the hospital as quick

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.110
as possible.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:03.690
A week later, I leave the hospital, so I had
just had a heart transplant. I think he was

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:10.020
in there a month he said to me, I was in and
out of there a week later, I was moved from

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:13.490
cardiac ward over to the home apartments which
is like a block of apartments for patients

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:20.180
who had to go back regularly for tests and
stuff. Moved out of the hospital to these

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:26.980
home apartments, was in the home apartments
for a month and then after that was given

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:33.270
the all clear to go back and get on with my
life. Um, I had little things happen, so I

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:37.500
would go back every day for tests. Before
that I went back they were like "Joe you need

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:46.220
to start walking a little bit now. Stop using
the little golf buggies to get to the hospital."

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.770
I'm like "There's golf buggies?"
[laughs]

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:55.460
Basically, I have walked everywhere from when
I left the hospital I never used a lift, they

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:01.240
had all these lifts. I was like on the fifth
floor and I walked to the hospital everyday

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.820
with my mum and dad. And mum would be like
"Can't we just get in the lift?" and I would

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:08.924
look at my dad and my dad is like "You want
to take the stairs?" and I was like "Yeah,

00:32:08.924 --> 00:32:12.340
Yeah." So we took the stairs every day, so
anyways, I am having this appointment the

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.330
fourth day in and this person I'm seeing goes
"Ok we need to start making you walk a bit."

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:21.030
And I laugh and he looked at me and is like
"What is so funny?" and I looked at my dad

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:27.820
and I laughed at him and my dad is kind of
like laughing and they go "What's so funny?"

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:33.990
and I go "Start walking a bit, what do you
mean by a bit?" and he's like "Well, you need

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:40.980
to start walking, you know like to the hospital
and everything." I'm like "Well me and my

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:44.370
dad yesterday and my brother we walked around
the entire campus." Well, I don't know if

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:51.280
you know how big Stanford is but I think the
circumference is like eight miles or something

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:57.020
stupid like that. So throughout the day we
got up really early and throughout the day

00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:01.631
I was just like walking around and different
places at Stanford. And he was like "Really?"

00:33:01.631 --> 00:33:06.810
and laughed cause he thought I was joking.
And I said "Seriously, here is a picture of

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:14.179
me there and a picture of me there." And he
was like "Wow, ok, well excuse me a second."

00:33:14.179 --> 00:33:21.559
And he walked out, went and told a few other
people, like Sharon Hunt come in. She is like

00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:29.010
the best cardiologist there is in the world.
Um, "Joe, I want you to be my patient now."

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:37.570
So now I had like [laughs] I went ok, um.
"We need to do a few more tests, physio tests

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:45.120
etc." Went to do the physio tests, um, they
score you on a chart from like 1-10. I was

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:52.540
like scoring like 30, so they couldn't actually
physically write down my score on the chart.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:34:00.260
Um, yeah, I was scoring off the charts and
everything they asked me to do I would look

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.929
at them and think "Is that it?" and do it.

00:34:02.929 --> 00:34:07.350
My friends, when I was in the hospital, cause
the bottom line of my insurance, cause I had

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:12.589
top insurance cause I was playing rugby. The
bottom line of my insurance policy basically

00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:18.339
said Joe, if you would require a heart transplant,
we would not pay for, or an organ transplant,

00:34:18.339 --> 00:34:25.070
we would not pay for the transportation of
the heart. Which in an organ transplant is

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:31.810
kind of the most important thing, you know
to get the organ from the donor to the recipient.

00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:38.280
So my friends raised money, and did like marathons
and all these fundraising events. And I said

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.429
to them on the bed, when they were doing it,
you know "Thanks very much, I will do it with

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:46.770
you next year." And the nurses heard me and
the doctors heard me and they come up to me

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:52.410
afterwards and said "Joe don't be stupid.
Set realistic goals. You won't be able to

00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:58.230
do anything like that for another couple of
years." There was this wharf to wharf event,

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:03.490
which I think is like 10k in Santa Cruz, which
is where you jog from one pier to the other

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:09.130
pier and a few friends were doing it. So I
said "I'll do it with you." And they went

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:14.470
"You sure?" and I went "Yeah, I will do it
with you." And I told the doctors about this

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:18.119
and they were saying "No Joe, don't you dare."
Anyway, "Don't be stupid" cause I was out

00:35:18.119 --> 00:35:23.390
of the hospitals responsibility and I could
do what I wanted. And I felt physically fine

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:29.670
with myself and I go and so I did it. Had
a checkup like a week later, walked into the

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.790
room with the medal around my neck.
[laughs]

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:37.609
I have done this, I have done that. And they
were just gobsmacked and I said "Look, I am

00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:41.560
going to be doing that marathon, I'll do the
half marathon like my friends did." Did the

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:50.599
half marathon, um, in training for the London
Marathon, so a year later, just over a year

00:35:50.599 --> 00:35:56.640
later, so I think April 3rd was the transplant,
mid-April was the London marathon the following

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.220
year. I had moved back to England, I have
done this half marathon with my friends like

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:07.540
I told them I would. In training for the full
London marathon and I have completed the London

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:14.770
marathon, did it in something stupid like
five hours or nothing special. But just to

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:20.180
say I completed it and proved to all the doctors,
"Hey, there is no limits here as long as I

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.490
am feeling fine."

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:26.850
It's my heart now, I don't look at my heart
like it is someone else's heart. I look at

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:31.680
it like it is mine, I can do what I want,
you know, as long as I feel fine I will go

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:38.430
ahead and do it. So I did this London marathon
and I was like, alright, I need to set up

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:47.170
a website so people who are in the shoes I
was in can see that, you know, a physical

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:54.180
life and the benefits of an organ transplant
and what you can do afterwards. So um I set

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:59.820
up Englishjoe.net being you know English and
the name Joe and that was what everyone called

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:07.339
me over there. Set up Englishjoe.net and I
now post, skip that slide, and I now post

00:37:07.339 --> 00:37:14.840
basically everything that I do onto this website.
So some little, some guy could be in bed,

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:20.640
some women could be in bed needing a lifesaving
transplant and they can go on there and they

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:28.290
can go "Alright, this is actually possible.
It is not as bad as what it sounds." Um, since

00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:34.280
the transplant, I have done the London marathon
twice. I've always been competitive and was

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:39.690
told I could never play rugby. So I took up
sprinting in the British Transplant Games

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:45.070
and took Gold in all the events I entered
in and got selected to represent Great Britain

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:53.840
in the World Transplant Games which were in
Australia in 2009. Didn't take Gold in everything,

00:37:53.840 --> 00:38:01.070
um which I was slightly disappointed about
but then at the time, but then at the time

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:07.420
I found out that I was the only guy, or the
only athlete on the track that actually had

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:12.820
a heart transplant. Everyone else had a kidney
transplant, so I was thinking, so there is

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:18.240
all these sprinting things. So like the 100
meter sprint for example, when someone lines

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:23.280
up for the race, their heart and their brain
is telling their heart "You are now going

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:29.390
to run 100 meters" so the heart naturally
starts beating faster. My, 'cause this is

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:35.231
a foreign heart, there is no brain endings,
there is no nerves going from my heart to

00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:39.330
my brain. So when I run 100 meters, when my
muscles start demanding more blood, that's

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:44.890
when my heart starts beating faster cause
my brain isn't in communication with it. So

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:54.560
I like the first 50 to 60 meters everyone
is like [whistles] the last 40, 45 meters

00:38:54.560 --> 00:39:02.200
I just start, I power through and I get past
everyone. But there was some fast guys there

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:07.820
so I only got bronze. Um and I was a bit,
I was a bit, I was really annoyed so at the

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:23.280
400 relay, the 4 x 400 relay and I took the
baton on third I think, no second. And the

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:29.440
person who ran before didn't give me much
hope. Um I receive the baton and there was

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:32.970
like four other runners in front of my like
100 meters around. And because of the heart,

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:39.250
with the 400 meter you donâ€™t go flat out
straight away, you kind of build yourself

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:48.349
up into it. When I get to like 200 meters
my heart is like "Oh, you are running here.

00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:55.760
We will start beating a bit faster." So you
gradually put on the pace a bit and timed

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:59.790
to meet is in, I went past everyone and then
I ran and finished with a good thirty second

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:06.220
lead on the people behind me. So we got round,
and so I got my Gold. It was a team event

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:13.870
but you know I got a Gold medal in the World
Games. So after that I did the British Games

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:19.560
again, the last couple of years did it in
Bath. Got selected to represent Great Britain

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:29.020
again in Sweden. Got given the all clear at
the same time to play rugby again. So I was

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:34.800
like "Right, I am back to playing, I am allowed
to play rugby again. The game I love." And

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:39.550
I am doing that now, I donâ€™t care so much
about the athletics, I am going to train and

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:41.780
I want to get good at rugby.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:47.349
So I went back training with rugby, joined
the local team. And we moved up to, I live

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:54.050
in Bradford now, North Nottinghamshire, so
I work just over in Sheffield which is right

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:58.099
next door to Doncaster. Doncaster Knights
have a good rugby team. So I thought alright,

00:40:58.099 --> 00:41:02.630
I'll pop in and see if I can get trained with
'em. So I am training with Doncaster Phoenix,

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:07.810
which is just like the team just below the
Knights. Trained and was playing for their

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:15.130
second team and in the end of this season,
just gone, I got called up the last two games

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:20.100
to play for the first team. Um, so it has
now gone into pre-season for this year, so

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:25.290
it looks like I got the first team spot. But
you know, I gradually worked my way up. Anyways

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:35.609
so I am playing that, so I haven't focused
completely on my running so when I told the

00:41:35.609 --> 00:41:40.280
Team Managers of the Great Britain team and
I am not running anymore I'm just doing rugby.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:47.380
They were a bit "Well we don't want you to
play rugby." and I am like "Well you are not

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:51.280
telling me not to play. I'm playing it whatever
you say. The doctors have given me the all

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:55.690
clear to do so, it's the game I love, I'm
playing it. End of." But they still want me

00:41:55.690 --> 00:42:03.280
on the team. So if I survive the season I
guess, like I did this year, I went on to

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:10.829
Sweden this year and end up getting the Silver
medal in the 4 x 100. And cause I am not sprint

00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:17.270
training anymore and just rugby. I missed
out on bronze in every event I did my about

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:24.359
a couple of hundreds of a second or something
stupid like that. But you know, um, I'm here,

00:42:24.359 --> 00:42:30.480
I'm alive, I'm feeling well, I'm playing rugby
which is the game I love again. So you know,

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:39.020
that's pretty much me. I feel I have kind
of lost you all but, oh yeah, just trying

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.020
to show the benefits of organ donors.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.020
&gt;&gt; Holly: You haven't lost us at all.

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:50.780
&gt;&gt; Audience Male #1:
Me. 

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.300
What are your plans for this year?

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:59.020
&gt;&gt; English Joe: Um, well I have got the British
Transplant Games in Belfast which is next

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:07.090
week. Um, I will be over there for a week
competing. I may have come to a couple of

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:11.740
decisions 'cause I am in the gym a lot with
my rugby training and I am not so much doing

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:19.140
all the running and everything. I will do
like the relays and I'll do something like

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:26.150
discus or javelin or something which that
body strength comes in quite nicely too. You've

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:31.930
got the feeling I will do quite well at that.
So I am going to do that in Belfast and I

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:39.160
also got to chatting to the cycle team of
the UK. So I have got, I can get on a bike

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:44.460
and I can work hard but I donâ€™t seem to
get tired on the bike cause my body weight

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:52.070
is taken off, is supported by the two wheels.
So I just stop pedaling when I am a bit tired

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:58.210
and I will start pedaling again. So I am going
to take up cycling I think, and do well in

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:07.930
that. So yeah, British Games next week and
I think tomorrow I start in a tag rugby tournament

00:44:07.930 --> 00:44:15.079
at Doncaster, which isn't contact but it is
like tag where you got like two flags on your

00:44:15.079 --> 00:44:22.060
hips and you get them ripped off then you
tackled. So I start tag rugby tournament tomorrow,

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:30.151
Belfast next week. Um, I snow board so I have
been selected to represent Great Britain in

00:44:30.151 --> 00:44:36.480
the Winter Transplant Games. I think I am
the only snowboarder so that is a few metals

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.190
there.
[laughs]

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:46.420
Snowboarding in March and then just rugby
really. Wherever I feel like going on tours

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:52.390
in America and I am in the middle of arranging
my team I play for now. So I have a game with

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:59.220
the team I played for in America. So it's
on the up. So I get to see a bit O' the world.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:05.210
The World Games are in Durbin in South Africa
in 2013. So I am looking forward to going

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:12.070
there and you know, fingers crossed, my health
will be in great shape like it is now. Keep

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:18.810
eatin' the right foods, doin' what everyone
should be doing really. Keepin' healthy and

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:22.374
hopefully I will be there in another couple
of years doin' my thing. Anymore?

00:45:22.374 --> 00:45:26.109
&gt;&gt; Female Audience #1:
Where did your heart, the new heart come from?

00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:34.470
&gt;&gt; English Joe:
This is getting recorded isn't it? Um, I can't

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:39.079
really say. I can't legally say, so I am not
going to say. I do know where it came from

00:45:39.079 --> 00:45:42.461
but I am not going to tell you where cause
of all the laws and stuff.

00:45:42.461 --> 00:45:43.619
&gt;&gt; Female Audience #1:
Oh, OKâ€¦ but its-

00:45:43.619 --> 00:45:45.630
&gt;&gt; English Joe
They can't expect a nineteen year old that

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:54.020
can't get out of a bed, with internet access,
not to have a look on all the old obituary

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.790
pages on Google.
[laughter]

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:03.690
which is what I did. 'Cause there is different
rules, the weather was really bad so I knew

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.550
it could only come from a certain direction,
and there is only allowed a certain amount,

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:11.180
I think it is like six hours to get from the
donor party to the recipient.

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.180
&gt;&gt; Female Audience #1:
So, basically what you are saying is that

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.140
people, while they are healthy, have to say
"Yes, I am willing to be an organ donor, or

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:19.880
whether I am not"

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.140
&gt;&gt; English Joe:
Yep, um, that-

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:25.400
&gt;&gt; Female Audience #1:
and then if something happens to that person

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.400
it can be donated.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:27.400
&gt;&gt;English Joe: Exactly, yeah.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.430
&gt;&gt;Female Audience #1: So that is how it works?

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:34.380
&gt;&gt; English Joe
Like um, I don't know if you know, who's English

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:42.240
in this room? Alright, on your driver's license
you might say you are an organ donor, but

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:49.760
that isn't enough. You need to actually physically
go online and register. That is just like

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.270
all you, you might be an organ donor, it's
not like "Yeah, I will be an organ donor."

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:55.271
So you can go on Englishjoe.net and there
is a link on there and you can sign up to

00:46:55.271 --> 00:47:02.589
be a donor, which I hope everyone does. 'Cause
if it weren't for the organ I received I would

00:47:02.589 --> 00:47:05.720
be here babbling on to you now, soâ€¦

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:12.589
&gt;&gt; Holly: Ok, I am going to bring it to a
close because of the timing. And Joe, thank

00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:19.030
you so much. It was an, I'm sure emotional
roller coaster for you. I think for us to,

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:25.099
but it has been an amazing story and amazing
to hear you tell it. It is so from the heart

00:47:25.099 --> 00:47:32.210
as well. So thank you, you are very Googly.
That is the highest compliment that we can

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:34.500
play, can pay to people. I'm sorry. And thank
you again for your time.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.500
&gt;&gt; English Joe: Thank you so much.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:36.500
&gt;&gt; Holly: Thanks guys.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:36.501
[applause]
