00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.736
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:05.511
CAROLINE WEBB: Thank you.

00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:06.010
Thank you.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.970
What a lovely welcome.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.360
Thanks a lot.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.400
So I have to start by admitting
that, despite the topic

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.050
of my book, not every day in
my past has been a good day.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.750
And in fact, as I stand here
in front of you in heels,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.270
I'm actually reminded of a time
that was early in my career

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.160
at McKinsey as a consultant.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.710
And it was the very
first time that I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.830
was being allowed to present to
the board, which was exciting

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.400
and also nerve-racking.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.410
And so I was nervous.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.060
And mostly, I was deciding
that I would project gravitas

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.960
and presence into the room by
striding about as boldly as I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.150
could, much like this.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.850
And I was, in my
mind, owning the room.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.850
I'd even looked down
and checked the cabling

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.580
to make sure I wasn't
going to trip over.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.330
So here I am owning the room.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.560
And then something happened
which I had not planned for.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.330
I took, perhaps, one
of my boldest steps

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.560
into the middle of the room.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.010
Some of you know what happened.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.770
Then I heard this crack.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.700
And it turns out
that it is actually

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.560
entirely possible for a
heel to shear completely

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.720
off a shoe, which is then,
obviously, what happened.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.100
So as I'm lying on the
floor, it turns out

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.150
that it was pretty impossible
to project any further gravitas

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.420
or presence into the room.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.200
So there are things
we can't control.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.730
There are wardrobe malfunctions.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.960
There are technology
glitches, miscommunications,

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.997
difficult colleagues,
difficult deadlines.

00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:45.830
Of course there are
things we can't control.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.350
But I've always been
interested in something

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.040
I call the philosophy of
realistic optimism, which

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.110
is not to say that
everything is awesome

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.230
and everything is amazing
if you just say it enough,

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.310
but to look harder
at the constraints,

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.780
look them in the eye and
say, OK, what can we do

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.350
around them and through them?

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.720
Where's our wiggle room?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.100
What's our scope
for action here?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.660
And for me, the toolbox
that I've turned to

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.500
is behavioral science.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.320
Because we only have to
understand a little of how

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.080
the brain works and
why we behave and think

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.720
and feel as we do and why
other people think and feel

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.170
and behave as they
do to see that we've

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.740
got a lot more control over
things that actually seem quite

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.710
random from day to day, but
aren't, things that seem

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.060
fixed in our lives that
we have to adapt to,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.440
but we actually can control
to a certain extent.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.480
So I'd like to tell three
stories today about things

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.980
that we think of as fixed
that we have to adapt to.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.080
I'm going to talk about
reality, the big one.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.620
How can we change the
reality we experience?

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.870
I'm going to talk about time.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.652
How do we get more
time in the day?

00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:58.360
And I'm going to talk
about intelligence.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.340
How do you boost
your intelligence,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.130
something that we also tend
to think of as rather fixed?

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.480
So that's the plan.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.250
OK.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.090
Let me start, then, by talking
about another day when reality

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.660
wasn't treating
me quite so well.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.539
I was a bit further on in
my career as a management

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:18.580
consultant at this point.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.090
I was a partner.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.150
But even as a senior person
there, I still had to do things

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.010
I didn't enjoy.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.660
And I'd been asked to join
this project that I was not

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.750
excited about.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.230
It was a huge corporate
change program.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.540
And by that time
in my life, I knew

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.110
that the kind of work that
I was most interested in

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.686
and that I most enjoyed
was more human-scale.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:42.060
I liked working
with individuals,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.480
coaching individuals,
and coaching teams.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.100
So I was grumpy-- extra grumpy--
about being on this program.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.680
And I was working
alongside a guy

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.210
who was kind of in the
opposite place-- he

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.480
was very excited about the
work-- a guy called Lucas.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.500
Picture a tall, wiry,
well-dressed, highly energetic

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.030
German guy, very
good at process.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.370
And he was all
over this project.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.810
And this day that
I'm remembering

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.590
was the first day
that we were supposed

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.329
to be meeting our clients.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.870
I was already grumpy
because I didn't

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.630
want to be on the project.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.554
And then I was also
extra grumpy because we

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.220
were supposed to be
meeting the clients,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.810
but it was a video conference.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.770
I thought this was
a terrible idea.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.590
We should be meeting
people in person

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.670
instead of being in
a video conference.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.090
And then I was
even more dismayed

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.580
when I walked into
the room and saw

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.770
that it was a long, dark
room-- a little bit like this.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.490
Less pleasant.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.820
Lower ceilings.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.050
Not as nice people in the room.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.230
And there was a
screen in front of us.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.550
And we were sitting
there disembodied,

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.730
faces floating in front of us.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.410
This was our kickoff meeting.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.290
And it was as bad
as I expected--

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.360
lots of misunderstandings,
miscommunications, people

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.570
cutting each other off, frowns.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.209
It wasn't great.

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:07.500
So afterwards, I thought,
well, I'll be a good citizen.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.170
I will sit down with Lucas.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.800
And I will share my worries that
we've gotten off to a bad start

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.960
with the project.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.200
And I can still picture
the conversation.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.020
He was sitting there.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.880
I was telling him all of these
things that had gone wrong.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.070
He was looking at me as
if I was a little bit mad.

00:05:29.436 --> 00:05:31.310
First of all, he hadn't
remembered the things

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.847
that I was talking about.

00:05:32.847 --> 00:05:35.180
But then he went on to tell
me about all of these things

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.700
that I had not noticed.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.280
People laughed several times.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.864
People were really happy with
the progress that we made.

00:05:42.864 --> 00:05:44.780
This deck that he was
powering through-- there

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.560
were lots of slides that
people had really loved.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.520
I had no recollection of this.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.810
And yet he was compelling
enough that I actually

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.550
realized on the edge
of my consciousness

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.730
he was not making this up.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:59.370
So what was going on?

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.377
I mean, yes, we had different
personalities, of course.

00:06:02.377 --> 00:06:03.710
But something else was going on.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.500
It was as if we'd truly
been in a different meeting

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.120
from each other.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.230
And of particular
interest to me--

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.460
why had he enjoyed himself
so much more than me?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.350
And this is where it helps
to understand the brain.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.090
Our brains are amazing.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.210
They can do sums.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.290
They can guess what
someone's thinking.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.240
They can even tell jokes
if they're connected

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.920
to a big enough mouth.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.230
But there are things
that they can't do.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.130
And one thing that
they can't do is

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.610
they can't take in
everything that's around them

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.180
at any one time.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.440
When you think about all of the
bits of information in a room,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.700
if you really focused on
every fiber of the floor tiles

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.990
and you focused on every hair of
the person sitting next to you

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.220
and every sensation
in your body,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.300
your brain would crash like
an overloaded computer.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.940
So there's an elegant solution
that your brain employs,

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.442
which is to filter
out most of what's

00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:04.025
going on around you
so that you're not

00:07:04.025 --> 00:07:06.510
even conscious of it.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.620
And as a result,
we're all experiencing

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:14.824
an edited, partial version
of reality all the time.

00:07:14.824 --> 00:07:16.240
This is a little
bit mind-blowing,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.480
because we don't
like to think of it.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.570
We think of ourselves
as being objective.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.230
But the reality that
we're experiencing

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.070
is not the same as
everyone else around us,

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.240
because their filters are
operating differently to yours.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.550
And then the question is,
well, what determines what

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.520
you filter in and filter out?

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.340
And this is where the
big opportunity lies,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.300
because it's quite predictable
what we tend to notice

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.990
and what we don't notice.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.410
It turns out that whatever
is already top-of-mind

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.420
for us will determine
what our brain decides

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.300
is important enough for us to
consciously notice, whatever's

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.100
top-of-mind for us.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.720
Let me give you an example of a
study that I like in this area.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.180
It's a field called
selective attention,

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.020
the fact that we can
only pay attention

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.660
to a selection of
what's around us.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.940
There were a bunch
of radiologists.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.570
It was a Harvard study.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.560
And they were given
a pile of lung scans

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.710
to look through-- sadly,
genuine lung scans.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.640
And they're looking
for nodules, of course.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.750
And the last of the
lung scans, there

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.430
was a gorilla printed
inside one of the lungs.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.960
Now, how many of the
radiologists do you think

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.518
saw the gorilla?

00:08:31.518 --> 00:08:32.820
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.620
CAROLINE WEBB: So
it's close to that.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:36.840
It's close to zero.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.960
83% of the radiologists
did not see the gorilla,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.290
even though eye-tracking
devices showed

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.740
that they looked directly at
it, even though the gorilla was

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.094
44 times the size of
the average lung nodule,

00:08:53.094 --> 00:08:55.343
and even though they're
trained to spot abnormalities.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.780
So why didn't they spot it?

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.220
Because gorillas were
not top-of-mind for them.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.080
So that wasn't what
they were looking for.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.930
And their brain completely
filtered it out.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.430
Now, the massive
opportunity for us

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.320
is to be more
deliberate about what

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.120
we want to have top-of-mind
going into a day,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.080
going into a meeting,
going into a task.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.560
Because if we fall out
of bed on the wrong side

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.160
and we're grumpy, our brain
will say, OK, so you're grumpy.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.097
That means that what's salient,
what's most relevant for you

00:09:30.097 --> 00:09:31.680
to notice is everything
that confounds

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.300
the world is a terrible place.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.876
So you'll spot the guy being
a jerk, the guy letting

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.000
the door slam in your face.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.560
And you won't notice the
person holding it open.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.090
You won't notice
the person who's

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.500
smiling at you in a
non-creepy way on the subway.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.630
And we can turn
that around and say,

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:53.480
how about I decide to set
my aims and my attitude

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.380
and my assumptions in a
more positive direction?

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.481
And that will determine
where I put my attention.

00:09:58.481 --> 00:10:00.730
And that's a little routine
I call setting intentions.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.530
And I do it each day.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.710
I do it sometimes
the night before.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.152
I do it sometimes as I'm
hurdling into a meeting

00:10:07.152 --> 00:10:08.610
and I've forgotten
to do it before.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.860
And I say, Caroline, what
really matters to you?

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.540
What's, therefore,
your real aim?

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.860
Check in with your attitude
and your assumptions.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.826
What does that mean you really
want to pay attention to?

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:20.700
And I've not had a
meeting quite like the one

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.380
I had with Lucas ever since.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.890
Because even if the
meeting is going badly,

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.290
I can take a timeout quietly
halfway through and say, OK,

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.752
now what's my real aim?

00:10:30.752 --> 00:10:32.210
What do I want to
have top-of-mind?

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.000
And it might be
to say, OK, I need

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.320
to learn from this experience.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.370
And then I experience
the rest of the meeting

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.340
in a different way.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.930
And I've even got
an emergency version

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.900
of this, which is when
I'm grumpy of a morning

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.830
and I'm walking along
and I say, OK, I'm

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.680
going to decide to notice three
good things in the next five

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.010
minutes.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.027
The power of that is
that you notice things

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.110
you wouldn't have noticed.

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:57.710
Plus, then, because you've
got good things top-of-mind,

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.340
you notice more.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.450
And that changes the
trajectory of the day.

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:05.020
So we can shape reality.

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.370
We can shape the reality
that we experience

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.100
really quite deeply and quite
powerfully and quite easily.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.730
So that's the first thing that
behavioral science teaches us

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.750
that we have more control
over than we think.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.400
Let me talk now about time.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.130
Who here would like
more hours in a day?

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.790
Yes, of course.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.257
Of course we would.

00:11:28.257 --> 00:11:29.840
There are a couple
of ways that I know

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.790
of getting more hours in a day.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.934
I like science fiction.

00:11:34.934 --> 00:11:36.600
I watch a lot of
science fiction movies.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.070
So I know that going to
the edge of a black hole

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.130
is, apparently, a great way of
getting more hours in a day.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.420
Hard to fit that into
the average workday.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.830
So let me talk about the second
technique, which you definitely

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.400
can fit in.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.250
And to demonstrate
how this works,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.070
I'm going to get you to
do a very small exercise.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.490
I'm going to ask you, first
of all, to count to seven as

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:07.770
fast as you can out loud
with some energy on my mark,

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.270
like this.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.390
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.625
Are you ready?

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:13.125
Go.

00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:14.610
AUDIENCE: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.310
Excellent.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:20.010
Now I'm going to ask you to
do the same with letters.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.310
I'm going to ask you to
say, a, b, c, d, e, f, g.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.670
Again, energy.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.070
On my mark.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:25.570
Go.

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.160
AUDIENCE: A, b, c, d, e, f, g.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.450
CAROLINE WEBB: Even sharper
and faster and more cultlike.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.130
Excellent.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.490
Now I'd like you
to mix the two up.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:42.670
I'd like you to say, a, 1, b,
2, c, 3, again, as fast as you

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.340
can.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.591
On my mark.

00:12:45.591 --> 00:12:46.090
Go.

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.490
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.810
CAROLINE WEBB: I don't think
you-- you just gave up, right?

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.890
So I'm going to ask
some obvious questions.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:03.290
I'm going to ask you, first
of all, which was quicker,

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.682
doing them on their own
or doing them mixed up?

00:13:06.682 --> 00:13:07.640
AUDIENCE: On their own.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.806
CAROLINE WEBB: On their own.

00:13:08.806 --> 00:13:12.160
When did you make more mistakes,
doing them on their own

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.146
or mixed up?

00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:14.060
AUDIENCE: Mixed up.

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.851
CAROLINE WEBB: Yes.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.990
You've just, basically, revealed
many, many years of research

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:26.770
which suggests that
when we multitask,

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.860
we actually slow ourselves
down dramatically

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.290
and we make between two and
four times as many errors.

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:37.190
When we multitask, we make
ourselves a little bit dumber

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.660
and a little bit slower.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.270
And yet that's how we
cope with our lives

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.450
where we have instant messages
coming at us all the time,

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.120
emails coming at
us all the time.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.419
We're tempted by all
the wonderful websites

00:13:49.419 --> 00:13:50.210
that are out there.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.520
And then you're having
to get your work done.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.720
You're talking to people.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.580
We're trying to
process in parallel.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.610
But our brain can actually
only do one thing consciously

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.460
at once.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:03.570
It's a single-tasker.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.829
Automatic stuff can
be done in parallel--

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:08.120
you know, brushing your teeth
while you're checking it.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.450
That's OK.

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.860
But conscious tasks, you can
only do one thing at once.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.500
So what your poor
brain is trying

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.270
to do when you're
checking your email

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.980
whilst you're getting on
with some task or other

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.310
is it's doing what you
were doing switching

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:24.100
between letters and numbers.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.930
It's going from here
to here to here.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.130
And in each of those switches,
you're losing a bit of time

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.080
and a bit of mental energy.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.980
And that's why you
slow yourself down.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:39.400
And that's why you
make more errors.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.350
So we actually get our work
done more quickly and better

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.170
if we decide to
single-task, especially

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.250
around the tasks that
really matter to us,

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.510
where it really matters
for us to get it right.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.730
And that means in our lives,
the kind of lives that we lead,

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:57.880
it means going offline
for periods of time.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.570
And since this is
something which

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:03.040
I've been talking and writing
about for quite a long time,

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.310
I've developed a
raft of techniques

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.000
that I used for this when
I was in corporate life.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.330
I was an avid user of
airplane mode on my phone,

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.610
very quickly flipping
that on whenever I really

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.090
needed to concentrate.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.730
I had an enormous pair of
noise-canceling headphones

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.990
that I used to wear not just to
actually reduce ambient noise,

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.340
but also to try and
signal to my colleagues

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.510
that I was focusing to
the point where even when

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.490
the batteries ran
out, I would still

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:31.910
keep on wearing the headphones.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.780
And I used to batch my
email as much as I could

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.540
so that I was blitzing it
two or three times a day,

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.584
rather than two or
three times a minute,

00:15:42.584 --> 00:15:44.500
which meant that I was
getting through it more

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.490
quickly because I wasn't
switching all the time

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.980
from email to other things.

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:52.050
And then when I started
writing the book,

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:54.030
I had a lot less
structure in my life.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.830
And I had to up my game, because
I was finding all sorts of ways

00:15:57.830 --> 00:15:59.710
to get around
airplane mode and then

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.760
going to my browser
and start finding ways

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.800
to be distracted that way.

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.240
So I used apps to block
my access to social media

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.900
during working hours.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.120
And in the end, I also
got myself a timer

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.990
to sit on my desk
which I would set

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.350
for a certain number of
minutes to stay focused,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.710
to single-task.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.110
And then it would
count down to zero.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.570
And the reason that
it helped, apart

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.120
from giving me a point of
focus and promising myself

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.330
I didn't have to do it
for that much longer, was

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.188
that when it got to zero, I
got an approving little beep.

00:16:34.188 --> 00:16:36.190
Beep.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:38.270
Which was like a
pat on the back.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.470
It made me feel good for having
been able to stay focused

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.599
for that length of time.

00:16:43.599 --> 00:16:44.390
And that's helpful.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.460
Because why do we stay online?

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.140
Because it's quite
nice to feel wanted

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.562
and to have the ping and
the buzz of the phone, like,

00:16:50.562 --> 00:16:53.060
oh, somebody wants me.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.550
So trying to give yourself a
pat on the back for actually

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.410
staying offline is
a very powerful way

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:00.860
of encouraging
yourself to do it more.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.519
So single-tasking, you'll
make your time go further.

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:05.060
And it will make
you feel as if there

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:08.260
are more hours in the day.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.790
Then let's talk about
your intelligence.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:15.270
This is a very
intelligent room here.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.560
Yes?

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.900
Yes.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.050
You're all very modest.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:23.369
But we know that we're
an intelligent room here.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:25.589
But even you know
that there are days

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.640
when you're firing on all
cylinders and days when you're

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.040
not or days when the
tasks in front of you

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.100
seem a little bit harder.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:39.000
Maybe it's something completely
new and you're a bit stuck.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.840
Is there a way that
we can suddenly

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.659
become more intelligent?

00:17:42.659 --> 00:17:44.450
Is there a way that we
can kind of suddenly

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.460
stick a second brain
onto our heads?

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.080
I'm going to tell
you about one day

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.950
that I learned a technique
which definitely does give you

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.800
a bit of a mental lift
when you most need it.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.170
I was getting
certified as a coach.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.930
I was doing this
course because I

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.490
worked a lot with
senior teams and boards

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.840
and I was often
finding myself getting

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.784
into one-to-one
conversations with people who

00:18:09.784 --> 00:18:10.950
were asking me to help them.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.325
And I thought,
wow, I really need

00:18:12.325 --> 00:18:14.920
to make sure that
I've got the coaching

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.020
credentials to do this work.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.380
So I went on this course.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.110
And it was a very
bittersweet experience,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:27.240
because I loved the course.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.490
Shouldn't be a problem, right?

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.760
Except that I loved the
coaching so much, I thought,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.900
oh, no, this is what I
have to do with my life.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.010
I have to be a coach?

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:37.260
But I'm a partner at McKinsey.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.690
And I quite like that.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.040
I quite like my job.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.110
I like my colleagues.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.600
I like the sense of belonging.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.990
I'm going to have to quit.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.650
I didn't want to quit.

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:51.920
I was in this career dilemma
and worrying about it a lot.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.570
And in a coaching
course when you're

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.730
learning to coach someone, the
way that you get your chops

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.420
is to actually
practice on each other

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:02.340
and really try to
learn by doing.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.150
So there was one
day that someone

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.970
called Jill needed to practice
her coaching skills on me.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.780
I needed to come up with a
real topic to be coached on.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.450
This was the thing
that was on my mind.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.360
So I said, OK,
bring it on, Jill.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.870
Coach me.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.430
She patiently did.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.570
And she started by saying, OK,
so tell me what's going on.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.097
And I told her that this
was a career dilemma,

00:19:26.097 --> 00:19:27.180
and it couldn't be solved.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:27.950
It was a disaster.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.120
And I was going to have to quit.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.840
And she said, OK, let's
just stop for a moment.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.680
Caroline, what's the
ideal situation here?

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.100
And at first, I
was a bit grumpy,

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:40.762
because I said,
well, the ideal--

00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:42.470
there's no point
talking about the ideal.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.860
The ideal is that I'm
a coach at McKinsey.

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.900
But that's not possible.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.030
So let's just move on, shall we?

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.750
She was very patient with me.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.060
She then said,
OK, let's describe

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.650
that a little bit more, what
that would actually look like.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:00.330
So I did that.

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:03.400
And then she said, now,
what would be the first step

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.580
towards that ideal?

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.280
And of course, the answer
was blindingly obvious.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.799
It was, well, if I'm
going to leave anyway,

00:20:10.799 --> 00:20:11.840
I've got nothing to lose.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.440
I might as well
tell my colleagues

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.180
that this is something I want
to do more of, that I want to do

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.060
more coaching in the workplace.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.270
Of course then
opportunities might arise.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.419
And if they don't, I
can still leave, anyway.

00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:26.210
And you're looking at
me like I'm an idiot.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.160
Because of course that's
an obvious thing to do.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.580
But it wasn't obvious
to me when I was stuck

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.890
in the mire of the problem.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:39.270
Because I was so focusing
on the negative that

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.800
my brain was doing
something very specific.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.460
It was going into
defensive mode.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.880
So when we are facing
a threat in our lives,

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.960
our brain has a very
wonderful defensive mechanism

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.920
which has kept us safe for
millennia, which you might know

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.280
as a fight-or-flight response.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.820
There's actually a third
response, which is to freeze.

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.890
So we might be snappish.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.050
We might run away or hide.

00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:07.320
We might actually
properly fight.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.320
There might be real fisticuffs.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.010
We might just keep our head down
and hope that nothing happens.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:16.306
Fight, flight, freeze is
still our defensive response

00:21:16.306 --> 00:21:17.680
to anything that
feels like a bit

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.590
of a threat in the workplace,
just as it was with charging

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.030
mammoths on the savanna.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.420
And there are two things to know
about this defensive response.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.310
The first is that it does
not take a charging mammoth

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:35.090
to trigger it, even
someone frowning at you.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:39.160
Certainly, someone cutting
you off in a meeting.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:43.450
Certainly a task that feels
just too difficult to solve.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.060
These things will trigger
that defensive reaction.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.310
And then the second thing
to know about defensive mode

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.930
is that when your brain
goes into defensive mode,

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.980
it's directing some
mental energy away

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.790
from the more sophisticated
part of your brain.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:59.700
That means you can
see on a brain scan

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.400
that when people are
even mildly stressed,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.870
that there's less activity
in their prefrontal cortex.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.730
So here's the rub.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.680
You're faced with a
challenging situation

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.390
just at that moment when
you need to rise to it.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:17.170
You become slightly less sharp,
slightly less intelligent.

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.540
So what Jill did
was very clever,

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.480
because she was lifting me
out of this defensive mode

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.940
by asking me a question, which
got me to focus on something

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:29.160
which was far more positive.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.400
What's the ideal situation?

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:34.540
And what's the first
step towards that?

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.630
It was very rewarding
to think about the ideal

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:38.180
and then also to
think about a step

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.364
that I could actually take.

00:22:39.364 --> 00:22:40.780
It boosted my sense
of competence.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.850
Bam, I'm out of defensive
mode and thinking

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:46.090
more clearly and creatively.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.270
And you see this
time and time again

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.900
in meetings where people
are getting bogged down

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.560
to ask a question like
that to pull people out

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.240
of defensive mode and get
them refocused on what

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.120
the ideal might be and what
a step towards that might be

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.040
or to say, when have we solved
a problem like this before?

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:07.190
And what can we learn from that?

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.972
It's a way of giving yourself
a few extra IQ points on days

00:23:10.972 --> 00:23:12.680
when you might be
struggling a little bit

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:18.060
or when you're facing problems
that seem insurmountable.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.650
So to recap, by
setting your intentions

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.500
clearly and positively,
you can shape the way

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.730
that you experience reality.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:29.660
Second, by single-tasking
as much as you can,

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.910
and especially in the work
that really matters to you,

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.010
you can steal back
more time in the day.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:39.330
And you can give yourself
a boost in intelligence

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:44.150
and in mood by using positive
task framing, asking yourself,

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:46.485
what's the ideal and what's
the first step towards that?

00:23:46.485 --> 00:23:50.090
And these are just three
tiny, tiny, tiny little steps

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.990
that emerged from the
behavioral science that

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.250
can have enormous impacts on
the way that every day feels.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:00.390
And more enjoyable
reality, more time,

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:04.870
and more intelligence-- that has
to be a recipe for a good day.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:05.760
Thank you.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.748
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.770
ANANT SHUKLA: So we have
some mics set up here

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.216
for Q&amp;A. Feel free to jump up.

00:24:21.216 --> 00:24:23.215
I have a few questions
for you myself, Caroline.

00:24:23.215 --> 00:24:24.440
CAROLINE WEBB: Ah-ha.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.490
And he's read the book.

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.490
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah, I've
read the book, as well.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:29.150
So I recommend it
to all of you guys.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.769
We were chatting a little
bit about this before.

00:24:31.769 --> 00:24:34.060
I know you mentioned it took
four years almost to write

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.620
the book, a little over four.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.130
What for you was most
challenging and rewarding

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.280
coming out of this experience of
taking the best of what you've

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.076
learned in your
professional life,

00:24:43.076 --> 00:24:44.700
reading the research
studies to come up

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.820
with these clear insights
that are actionable

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.970
for everybody here, and to
really have that better day?

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.150
CAROLINE WEBB: I would
say that it's the hardest

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:55.380
thing that I've ever done.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.150
But it's the most
rewarding thing.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.900
To take stock of everything that
you've done over the last 20

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.320
years professionally and say,
what's the essence of this

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.490
and how can I share this?

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.299
It's quite a privilege.

00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:08.090
And I never lost sight
of that, even when I

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.430
was feeling very lonely.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.020
Because it's a very solitary
experience to write a book.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.470
And I think that was the
most difficult thing.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.680
I was so used to doing
this work with people

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.050
that, inevitably at some points,
you have to actually say,

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.040
no, my job now is
actually writing the book.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.990
There's a great management
thinker, Lynda Gratton,

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.496
who told me this very
early on in the process.

00:25:28.496 --> 00:25:29.870
She said, at some
point, you have

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.260
to accept that your job
is writing this book.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.830
And so yes, that
period where I didn't

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.280
get the chance to actually
still be working with people.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.960
But it's been worth it.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.780
It's been worth it.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.738
Because now I get to go
back out into the world

00:25:43.738 --> 00:25:46.010
and talk to wonderful
people, like you.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.860
ANANT SHUKLA: Awesome.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.616
I know throughout the
book, as well, you

00:25:49.616 --> 00:25:51.990
mention sleep, which didn't
come up in any of the stories

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.260
you mentioned today.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.940
And everybody here at work
in our professional lives,

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.300
in our personal lives,
sleep and physical activity

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.000
are two of the first
things we let slip by.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.720
And you've shown in
countless studies

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.384
that you've researched, your own
experience, whether it drives

00:26:06.384 --> 00:26:07.800
fight-or-flight,
whether it drives

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.430
the unpleasant meeting that
we're having, it's something we

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.930
let go.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.432
So what are your few tips to
squeeze into an extra half

00:26:15.432 --> 00:26:17.890
hour or an hour that will really
then make that difference?

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.598
And I think maybe
share with the audience

00:26:19.598 --> 00:26:21.682
some of those kind of
findings that have come out.

00:26:21.682 --> 00:26:23.306
CAROLINE WEBB: We
all know on one level

00:26:23.306 --> 00:26:26.340
that the way we treat our body
affects the way our mind works.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.070
We know that when
we're under-slept,

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:32.560
we become somehow less
witty and charming.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.740
But we often behave as if
the connection isn't direct.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.880
We might accept that there's
a long-term connection.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.700
But actually, the research
is really compelling.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.210
It says that the way
that you treat your body

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:47.840
has an immediate effect
on your mental state.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.911
So the research on
exercise is fantastically

00:26:51.911 --> 00:26:53.410
encouraging for
someone like me, who

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.220
does not like going to the gym.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:57.580
I did a lot of sport when
I was younger as a kid.

00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:01.610
And then it's hard to fit
team sports into adult life.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.460
And so I always struggled
with getting enough exercise

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.180
into my day.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.980
I was personally very
encouraged by the research,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.770
which says in terms
of the benefits

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:17.250
to your cognitive state,
doing more exercise boosts

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.740
your emotional resilience.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.190
And it makes you
sharper and more focused

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:25.100
and more analytically
smart-- immediately.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:25.820
Goodness.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.760
OK.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.800
You can get that after 20
minutes of moderate exercise.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.310
I thought, OK, 20 minutes
moderate exercise.

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.890
That's a brisk walk.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:35.290
I can do that.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.330
I started walking a lot more.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:41.166
And I was even more encouraged
with more research that's

00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:42.790
been coming out in
the last year or two

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.400
which suggests that it's
not even just 20 minutes.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.980
You can break it down into
chunks of 5 or 10 minutes.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.420
There was one study that I
read that said, obviously,

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.300
more exercise might
be better than some,

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.070
but some is better than none.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.330
And I took that to heart.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.900
So I walk a lot more.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.720
I seize every opportunity.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.300
So we know that on one
level, that's a good thing.

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:08.440
But actually, just to
know that it's immediately

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.050
going to improve your
mood and your focus,

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.400
that helps you put the time in.

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.405
And then with sleep,
yeah, it's interesting.

00:28:17.405 --> 00:28:20.970
Actually, I spoke at Google in
London a couple of weeks ago.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.030
And someone came
up to me afterwards

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:26.310
and said, if there's
one thing out of all

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.430
of this physical stuff
that you're talking about

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.750
that I should be looking
after, what is it?

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.860
And I said, well, it is sleep.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.382
There's definitely
very clear research.

00:28:37.382 --> 00:28:39.840
You've probably heard about
this, that going short of sleep

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.960
is equivalent to
having a few drinks.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.080
And you wouldn't say that
someone at work who was short

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:51.790
of sleep was an excellent
worker if they were drunk.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.226
But we have a slightly macho
approach to saying, you know,

00:28:55.226 --> 00:28:56.850
yeah, I only got four
hours last night.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.510
I'm working really hard.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.660
The truth is that-- again,
all the evidence suggests--

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.190
that you have less
memory of what you did

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.980
and you learn less
from what you're

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.830
doing if you go short on sleep.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.550
So all of that, yes.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.270
So what do you then do?

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:17.950
I think some of it is just
about an attitude and a mindset

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.490
and not seeing
sleep as a luxury,

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.530
not seeing sleep as
downtime, but seeing it

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.930
as essential up-time.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.690
It's when your brain is doing
encoding and consolidation.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.320
And that subtle
shift into saying

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.040
that this is actually going to
make me smarter when I wake up

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.400
tomorrow morning, I think
that's been very helpful for me.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.310
That, and recognizing
that when you

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.060
have a lot of light around
you-- and particularly lights

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.320
from your devices-- it's going
to delay your sleep cycle.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.930
So there's research
at Harvard that's

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.060
more recent than some
of the sleep research

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:58.617
saying that we push our
rhythms back by half an hour

00:29:58.617 --> 00:30:00.950
for every half an hour that
we're sitting with our phone

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:01.794
late at night.

00:30:01.794 --> 00:30:03.460
So there's something
about sleep hygiene

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.490
and just making sure that your
room is actually dark enough.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.228
And that really helps, too.

00:30:08.228 --> 00:30:09.196
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah.

00:30:09.196 --> 00:30:11.850
In another chapter, I
think you mentioned--

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.330
the whole chapter is about
managing relationships.

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.840
And there are a few pages that
have common defensive mode

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.540
triggers that you might
elicit in a person you're

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.630
engaging with.

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.662
So can you touch upon
a little bit in some

00:30:23.662 --> 00:30:25.870
of these tense situations
where you don't necessarily

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.270
have the time to maybe
diagnose the situation

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:31.580
or identify the
telltale sign-- how

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.420
would you react accordingly?

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.580
How can we, again,
implement those types

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.340
of things on a quick notice?

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.480
And maybe even outline
for the audience

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.940
what those common defensive
triggers might be.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.815
CAROLINE WEBB: So what
Anant is talking about

00:30:43.815 --> 00:30:46.840
is that you know when someone
is behaving dysfunctionally.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.040
And you've got this
split-second decision

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.930
where you can kind of
declare that they're a jerk,

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.610
or you can decide that there
might be something going on

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.150
with them.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:58.120
And there's something
in psychology

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.380
which is called the
fundamental attribution error.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.744
And the way it works
is that if we show up

00:31:02.744 --> 00:31:04.160
and we're a bit
cranky at work, we

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.250
know it's because we
didn't get enough sleep.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.260
But if someone else
is cranky, then we

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.970
have a tendency to decide that
they're a terrible person.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.320
Because why?

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.660
Because your brain is always
trying to take shortcuts.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.310
And it's a lot simpler to just
declare that this person is not

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.705
that nice, versus
thinking about, well,

00:31:22.705 --> 00:31:24.420
what could be
going on with them?

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:28.500
It's just simpler to just
badge them in a certain way.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.020
So one of the things
that you can do

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.880
is just get yourself familiar
with the common triggers that

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.910
might be causing--
apart from lack

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.640
of sleep-- dysfunctional
behavior that might be putting

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.840
someone into defensive mode.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.870
So there are individual ones,
like competence, autonomy,

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:45.610
and security.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.320
Anything that undermines
someone's sense of competence,

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.656
their autonomy, their
sense of security

00:31:50.656 --> 00:31:52.030
will put them into
defensive mode

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:54.620
and make them behave badly.

00:31:54.620 --> 00:32:00.170
Then there are social needs,
like belonging and fairness

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:00.810
and respect.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:04.130
And as soon as any of
those are violated at all,

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.719
then you have a situation where,
again, that defensive mode

00:32:07.719 --> 00:32:08.760
is going to be triggered.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.640
So it helps to just
know the territory

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.590
and just to get into
the habit of saying,

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.780
OK, this is probably
not a psychopath.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.900
This is probably--
just statistically,

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.100
it's unlikely that
they're a psychopath.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:21.930
They're probably what
I call a good person

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:23.460
in bad circumstances.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:24.950
What are the circumstances?

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:28.402
You tell yourself a few
stories around those themes.

00:32:28.402 --> 00:32:30.110
Or it could be something
even more basic,

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:31.784
like their cat died, right?

00:32:31.784 --> 00:32:32.950
That's not even on the list.

00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:35.480
That's just something
that makes you sad.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.880
So just stopping and
giving yourself that pause

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.830
and saying, what could
be going on with them,

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.200
changes your demeanor
towards them,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.770
which de-escalates
the situation.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:49.070
Because you are not then putting
them further on the defensive.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.754
And that is a great first step.

00:32:50.754 --> 00:32:52.670
And then there's a whole
bunch of other things

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.040
that you can do, like showing
appreciation-- fantastic silver

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:56.750
bullet.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:02.120
It hits competence,
security, belonging.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.250
It makes for a quick way of
getting the other person out

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.354
of defensive mode.

00:33:06.354 --> 00:33:08.270
Should we ask the audience
for some questions?

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.316
Yes.

00:33:13.316 --> 00:33:15.315
ANANT SHUKLA: Do you want
to step up to the mic?

00:33:15.315 --> 00:33:15.939
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:25.440
So your discussion about
multitasking and productivity

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.930
was really interesting.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.040
A lot of people that
I've met, I feel,

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.130
want to believe that they have
some special ability to just--

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:37.174
they can juggle whatever
and check their email.

00:33:37.174 --> 00:33:39.590
And I'm just wondering if the
research that you saw really

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.540
showed a gradient from
what people can handle

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.304
and different people's
abilities, versus-- you're

00:33:46.304 --> 00:33:47.720
probably the best
person qualified

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.050
to answer this question.

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.200
So I might as well ask you.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.250
CAROLINE WEBB: Thank you
very much for asking.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:51.749
Yeah.

00:33:51.749 --> 00:33:56.685
So one of the reasons that we
tend to think we can multitask

00:33:56.685 --> 00:34:00.130
is that there are certain things
we can multitask with, right?

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.930
So if it's an automatic
task, the automatic system

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.000
in our brain generally can do
multiple things in parallel.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.270
So that's why you can find your
way to work without necessarily

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:13.790
concentrating on
where you're going

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:15.206
while you're doing
something else,

00:34:15.206 --> 00:34:16.590
maybe checking your messages.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:20.540
It's why when you're
driving, it might be possible

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.310
for you to have a
conversation with someone.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:27.130
But the moment that anything
changes in the situation--

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.449
perhaps you're driving
along and a car pulls out--

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:33.340
and it requires conscious
attention from you,

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:35.368
then you're back in
the mode of only being

00:34:35.368 --> 00:34:36.659
able to do one thing at a time.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:40.880
And that's why so many crashes
happen when people are talking.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:43.690
Because it feels as if
it's possible to do things

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.190
in parallel.

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:47.256
And then something changes,
requires conscious attention.

00:34:47.256 --> 00:34:48.880
So I think that's
one of the reasons we

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.239
tend to believe that we
can with conscious tasks,

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.650
as well as with
unconscious tasks.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.436
But there's really
interesting research

00:34:56.436 --> 00:34:57.810
out there showing
that people who

00:34:57.810 --> 00:35:00.460
are most confident of
their ability to multitask

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.460
are actually the worst at it.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.300
And why might that be?

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.900
It might be that
they've lost the ability

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.230
to be mentally agile, because
they're just totally bombarded

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.230
all the time.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.300
It's really interesting.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.930
And I think, also,
the trope that's

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:18.638
been out there for a
long time that women

00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:22.360
can somehow multitask, right?

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.930
For the women in the
audience, don't believe it.

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:27.750
When it comes to the kind of
conscious work that we're doing

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:29.580
at work, we really can't.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.010
We're no different from men.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.700
So just to lay
that one out there.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:33.720
Yeah.

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:34.876
Thank you.

00:35:34.876 --> 00:35:35.500
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.624
This is really interesting.

00:35:36.624 --> 00:35:38.120
Did you find that
your techniques

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.880
for having a good day and
turning a bad day into a better

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.500
day changed when you started
working at home and away

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.224
from other people with less
things to influence you

00:35:47.224 --> 00:35:48.640
and less things
to notice that you

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.655
could frame in positive ways?

00:35:50.655 --> 00:35:52.780
CAROLINE WEBB: That's a
good, interesting question.

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:56.770
I've had quite a few different
types of work and career

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.270
in my life.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:02.120
And I definitely think that when
you move into a new setting,

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.410
you don't have to take
a step back and say, OK,

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.320
some of the things that I
did before-- it is different.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.910
The multitasking example
was so vivid to me.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.510
I thought I really nailed this.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:15.250
And then, actually,
oh, my goodness.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.800
I really haven't because of
the change in circumstances.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.900
So I guess what I would
advocate is just checking in

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.060
with yourself and
developing a self-awareness

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.130
so that you maybe
take the principles.

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:29.640
The stuff in the
book I've seen work

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.149
across lots of
different settings

00:36:31.149 --> 00:36:32.940
and lots of different
industries and roles.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.880
And the stories in
the book reflect that.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:39.160
So I've tried to
create a manual that

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.450
can sort of apply to all
sorts of different settings.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.819
But the way that it translates
into your own life, yeah,

00:36:44.819 --> 00:36:46.610
you need to experiment
with that, for sure,

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.410
especially around
times of change.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.470
Yeah.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.980
This is fantastic.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.610
And I think it's--
certainly as, hopefully,

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.640
high-functioning adults, we
can take some of this to heart.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:02.100
I'm wondering if you have any,
well, A, if there's research,

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.660
or, B, if you have any
recommendations for how

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:11.520
you would coach children
to implement some of this.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.990
CAROLINE WEBB: Well, I have
to say that most of my clients

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:17.430
have children.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:21.290
And most of them tell me that
they practice on their children

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:25.350
before they practice
on their colleagues.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.460
I hear a lot about
teenage children.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.470
I hear a lot about
spouses, actually.

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:32.570
I've had a lot of people
tell me that the techniques

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.310
have improved their marriage.

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:38.620
I actually even had
one of my clients

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.887
tell me about how he had
used some of the techniques

00:37:40.887 --> 00:37:42.470
from the relationship
part of the book

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:44.300
with his one-year-old son.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.300
So they were worried
that their son

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.420
was slow in starting
to pick up language.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.960
And his wife was
particularly concerned

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.130
that Francesca wasn't
speaking enough to the child.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:05.550
And so Francesca, having fresh
from reading all the stuff

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.870
on relationships and rapport
and the power of actually truly,

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:12.450
deeply listening and
paying close attention

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:14.240
and playing back
what you're hearing,

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:17.820
decided to do that
with his young son.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.500
And so instead of
just talking at him,

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.840
he would listen so what
the little one was saying

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.780
and then repeat it back and then
add in one or two extra words.

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.180
And his language
acquisition skills

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.240
went off the chart so quickly.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.647
Because even at
that young age, all

00:38:35.647 --> 00:38:38.230
of the things that we're talking
about in terms of competence,

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.630
autonomy, security,
belonging, fairness respect,

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.130
these things kick in very early.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:51.190
So I would say that all of the
techniques, as far as I know,

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:52.950
can be tried with children.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:58.700
And I'd love to hear if
you'd like to give it a go.

00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.375
Thank you.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:02.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.940
The tip that you gave
about using a timer

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.330
sounds fascinating.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:08.340
I'm wondering if there's
an ideal amount of time

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.580
that we can focus.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:10.413
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:39:10.413 --> 00:39:11.390
That's a good question.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:14.620
There are lots of
different views on this.

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.190
You've got people who swear by
the Pomodoro Technique, which

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:19.299
is the 25 minutes.

00:39:19.299 --> 00:39:21.090
There are some people
who say 90 minutes is

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:22.589
optimal for really deep work.

00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:24.880
I guess it goes back to the
earlier point-- you do need

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.690
to experiment.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:27.610
I'll be honest.

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.270
When I came out
of corporate life,

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.990
I had to start
with five minutes.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.360
I had to retrain myself.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.150
And I started with five.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.650
And then I went up to 10.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:42.000
And eventually, I
went around to 90.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.510
And then for me, I ended up
putting it back to 45 minutes.

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:51.150
Because I found that I would
find it quite easy-- not easy.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:55.120
But I mean, it became second
nature to focus for 45 minutes.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.780
If I was really
engaged in a task,

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.390
then I'd go past the 45 minutes.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:59.790
And I'd feel really good.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:03.460
If I set it at 60
or 75 or 90 and then

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:05.890
I kind of lost
focus before then,

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.490
it would set up a dynamic where
I'd be slightly disappointed

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:09.810
with myself.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.196
And I discovered it was
a much better dynamic

00:40:12.196 --> 00:40:13.820
to set it for a
shorter amount of time,

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.540
and I'd feel really
great about myself

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:17.500
and then be more
inclined to try it again.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.000
So I would start
small and build up.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.625
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:40:19.625 --> 00:40:21.620
So set really low
expectations for yourself.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.720
CAROLINE WEBB:
[LAUGHS] Yes, yes.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.260
Yes.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.740
I probably shouldn't admit
the five-minute thing.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:25.365
But I just did.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.605
AUDIENCE: Do you have to
worry about realistic optimism

00:40:32.605 --> 00:40:36.510
or positivism
delaying change that

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.137
could help you in your life?

00:40:38.137 --> 00:40:38.970
CAROLINE WEBB: Yeah.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:41.520
Sometimes people say,
well, sometimes you just

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:43.540
need to quit your job, actually.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.180
You're just not in
the right place.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.580
You're not in the right fit.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.520
I think that sometimes you
do need to make big changes.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.630
And the one thing I
would say is that I

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:57.010
think that focusing
on the day-to-day,

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:01.100
focusing on improving the
small steps in your life

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.360
puts you in a better position
to make the big decisions.

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.300
If you're thinking about
making a career move,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:07.914
it's much more
likely that you'll

00:41:07.914 --> 00:41:09.580
make good choices if
you're not doing it

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:11.360
from a place of desperation.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.360
So the more that you can
improve the day-to-day, I think,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:18.760
the more that you'll, obviously,
enjoy the journey a bit more,

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.800
but you'll also probably
choose the destination

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.508
more effectively.

00:41:25.942 --> 00:41:28.150
ANANT SHUKLA: Do we have
any more audience questions?

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.990
AUDIENCE: This is
actually just more

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:37.790
of a comment about
the multitasking.

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:40.020
My 86-year-old mother-in-law
claims that she can.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.480
And there's no
arguing that point.

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.720
So where it became
really obvious to me

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.670
about the automatic and
how when the automatic

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.350
is no longer automatic-- it
really changes everything.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.040
I had a foot problem,
which was very painful

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.430
under the ball of my left foot.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.660
Every single step I took with my
left foot I had to think about.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.750
And if you don't think
your world doesn't

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.172
change when you have
to think about walking,

00:42:04.172 --> 00:42:05.130
it's pretty incredible.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:07.800
And I would even
actually on the weekends

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.750
not do things because
the sheer energy

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.770
of having to walk to lower
Manhattan or do something

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.660
actually would
prevent me from doing

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:18.340
that because of all the thinking
involved-- not the pain.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:19.730
I'm living with that.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.720
But it's the thinking
about the walking.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.803
CAROLINE WEBB: Absolutely.

00:42:22.803 --> 00:42:23.950
Beautiful example.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.500
Our brain's working memory
has such a small capacity

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:31.180
that even a blinking light or a
buzzing phone or something that

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.300
is as simple as walking can
take part of your brain's

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.860
mental energy and make it hard
to think about anything else.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:39.000
Really nice example.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.163
Thank you.

00:42:40.163 --> 00:42:42.270
Thank you.

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.061
ANANT SHUKLA: Cool.

00:42:43.061 --> 00:42:45.740
Well, hopefully everybody's
got a few insights and tips now

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.109
that they can take away.

00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:49.150
Let's give another round
of applause to Caroline.

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.191
CAROLINE WEBB: Thank you.

00:42:50.191 --> 00:42:53.270
