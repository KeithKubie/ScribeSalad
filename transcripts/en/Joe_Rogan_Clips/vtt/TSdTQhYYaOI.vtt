1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.610
The Joe Rogan experience.
Yeah.
Well,
if you're a guy who trains as much as you,

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:08.670
I mean every chance your body gets to actually rest,

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.230
your body's probably like right about now.
It's a good time.
It doesn't take much.

4
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:16.980
We're getting a car for we out to dry where she's driving.
Where am I going?

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.150
Oh,
we didn't want to travel yet.
My bad bay.

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.050
Well a guy who works as hard as you do because one of the things that you are

7
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:26.670
known for man is your cardio.

8
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:30.780
You have crazy fucking cardio and you notice it in fights where around the

9
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:34.620
second and the third round I started seeing your opponents start to slow down a

10
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:38.490
little bit and then you ramp up like a Lila Tfa.
A perfect example.

11
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.300
That was a great fight for you because that guy is a tank is a tank.

12
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.960
Very scary dude hits really fucking hard,
strong as shit.

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.400
But he's a,
he's a god that relies on that explosive power.

14
00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:54.540
He's like a sprinter and a lot of ways and you can only do that for so long and

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:59.430
you could say like somewhere around the second round it was real obvious that

16
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:03.020
you weren't slowing down at all and he was taking some big deep breaths and it's

17
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.880
just,
it's harder for him if you always had that kind of cardio.

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.150
I mean I got it in wrestling,
I guess I was big,
you know,
and I was,

19
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.120
especially when I got to 300 pounds and I was still working cardio,

20
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.210
trying to get down as a heavyweight to wrestle and B,

21
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.130
I always studied little guy's film,

22
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.280
you know like the Henry Cejudo filmed and shit like that when I was in college.

23
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:23.340
That's just what I watched my cousin like wash heavy ways.
Nobody,
Nah,

24
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.550
I want to move.
I won't footwork,
I want to fake,
I want to take shots,

25
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:30.270
like I lead my team and take downs as a heavyweight because I've moved around.

26
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.150
It's a big guy and the same thing I've had met the one match,

27
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:36.750
the guy was beating me.
What?
15 to one if you need one more point.

28
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:39.460
The technical ones,
the third point in third round,

29
00:01:39.461 --> 00:01:43.120
but he gas and I was still going.
I came back and beat them in overtime because,

30
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.460
because I can just keep going.

31
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:47.730
I was the mindset God is going to break eventually.
Yeah.

32
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.440
My coach always said Eq fresh.
Even if you're tired as dog shit,

33
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.800
stand up and act fresh like no matter what,

34
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.660
look fresh and you'll be surprised how your mind take over and you realized

35
00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:59.970
later on you're not really tired and when you're tired keep pushing because the

36
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:03.420
next time you usually get tired around at three minute mark and make it to about

37
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.440
the seven,
eight minutes.

38
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.400
That's like 15 you start doing those grind matches and you go 30 minutes lie and

39
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:09.600
when it's done I'm able to walk,

40
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.420
say code your hand and go grab another partner or we'll get on a treadmill.

41
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.510
There's,
because we always push as a big guy.
So you've got,

42
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:19.980
imagine when I came down to two oh five it was like,
yeah,
it was crazy.

43
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.180
Like this is it.
This is like magic.
I can do this all day.
Coach fire rounds.

44
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:24.840
At first.
Jim,

45
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.450
my five round fight with Jimmy when they called me off the main event.

46
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:31.460
Now you've got to train six rounds like okay,
like was moon occasion.

47
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.200
We did three rounds mark like you know you're doing six a day.
That's fine.

48
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.980
Gave me three new partners went and they was tired and I'll still go like,
dude,

49
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:41.640
your cardio is crazy.
It's just a mental.
Even when I'm tired I'll never show it.

50
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.580
He's like I just got to act fresh and get through it.
It can only last so long.

51
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.870
My father told me that forever.
It is a weird thing isn't it?
That your,

52
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.100
your mind can give you more energy.

53
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:52.410
Like you know that feeling that sometimes you're on a treadmill or something

54
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:55.830
like that and you're running and a great song comes on and all of a sudden

55
00:02:55.831 --> 00:02:58.590
you're like woo.
You like feel it.

56
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.190
Like you've got all sudden extra like where's I retired from?

57
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.820
It's coming from your mind,
your mind at one beat,

58
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.790
the UPTEMPO beat and start pumping.

59
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.070
Are you going to start dancing while you're running in like three to five

60
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.470
minutes?
I have a loan that some cause you like on a sprint.
Yeah.

61
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.730
They want that song in your head.
Then you really feel the tone changed your God.

62
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.490
Shit,
I'm tired of.
It's crazy isn't it?
That that's some,

63
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.840
there's a switch in your mind that you almost like you have to figure out where

64
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:25.930
it is.
You got to go find it in a song can find it for you.

65
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.250
But like for you just to be able to pull it out like especially in a fight or

66
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:34.090
something like that.
When you're battling doubt in this and that and you know,

67
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:37.510
you're wondering how he's doing.
You know,
is he okay?
Is he tired?

68
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.640
Am I on who's tired or me or him.
You know,

69
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.130
there's that switch in your mind that if you could just access that all the time

70
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:47.290
and keep it on.
One of the things,

71
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.720
I think one of the guys I looked up to when I was in college,

72
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.110
you know who has passed Steve Prefontaine.
I said,
watch this story at a time.

73
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.370
His quotes to do anything,
anything less than your best is a waste of a gift.

74
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.050
You know,
like everything he ran,

75
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:02.710
he didn't his cross country Bogash Trot and a pacing and day.
He said,

76
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:06.160
I'm running to like I'm sprinting.
You're like,
I watched all his movies,

77
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.110
the movies on him,
how his mindset,

78
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.750
even at one race when he was full of spray and they say it's hard,

79
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.730
it's gonna give.
He gave out right before the finish line.

80
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.290
Like I'd rather go out that way,

81
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.210
then pacing my whole the whole time and then try to sprint in and failed because

82
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:23.020
I wasn't ready.
So that's like in my fight,
I start off so fast,
that's just,

83
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:25.960
I'm going all out.
You're not,
there's no fill out period.

84
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.660
We're going to touch gloves and I'm ready to move.
And I already know,

85
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.300
like if I'm getting tired,
I know this guy's getting tired.
Right?

86
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:34.090
He's not trained like I'm training and if he is trying to like I'm training,

87
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.700
he might not be tired by Mama.
I'm thinking he's getting tired,

88
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.590
so I just keep pushing because eventually he's going to break.

89
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.030
He's going to break before me.
