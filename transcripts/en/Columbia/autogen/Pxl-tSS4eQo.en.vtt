afterwards what we do with the data in

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:09.100
afterwards what we do with the data in
 

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:12.180
afterwards what we do with the data in
terms of describing the population so

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.190
terms of describing the population so
 

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.850
terms of describing the population so
for example if you're going to have a

that in designing the race question and
 

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.290
that in designing the race question and

primarily we should decide what goals we
want the data to serve right and then

00:36:19.809 --> 00:36:19.819
want the data to serve right and then
 

00:36:19.819 --> 00:36:21.579
want the data to serve right and then
develop the question in order to achieve

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:21.589
develop the question in order to achieve
 

00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:26.020

that and so it is true that the data are

that we might want to put on the short

and also sort of raised the question as

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:27.340
and also sort of raised the question as
 

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.750
and also sort of raised the question as
to what other kinds of information do we

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:30.760
to what other kinds of information do we
 

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.400

we're able to document this stuff the
 

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:01.720
we're able to document this stuff the
problem is the interpretation of that

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:01.730
problem is the interpretation of that
 

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:04.840
problem is the interpretation of that
documentation it's over the years which

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:04.850
documentation it's over the years which
 

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:06.010
documentation it's over the years which
have been happening especially under the

have been happening especially under the
 

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.960
have been happening especially under the
Bush administration is that that stuff

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:07.970
Bush administration is that that stuff
 

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:09.640
Bush administration is that that stuff
has been turned and to kind of blame the

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:09.650
has been turned and to kind of blame the
 

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.620
has been turned and to kind of blame the
victim kind of thing no longer looking

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:11.630
victim kind of thing no longer looking
 

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:13.480
victim kind of thing no longer looking

at kind of structural inequalities
 

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:15.070
at kind of structural inequalities
because the data doesn't it's hard to

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:15.080
because the data doesn't it's hard to
 

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.500
because the data doesn't it's hard to
make those kind of connections so it's

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:17.510
make those kind of connections so it's
 

01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:19.420
make those kind of connections so it's
it's not a question so much of the data

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:19.430
it's not a question so much of the data
 

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.520
it's not a question so much of the data
but the interpretation of data these

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:21.530
but the interpretation of data these
 

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.670
but the interpretation of data these
days also the fact that I'd say under

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:24.680
days also the fact that I'd say under
 

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.840
days also the fact that I'd say under
the Bush administration there was a

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:25.850
the Bush administration there was a
 

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.720
the Bush administration there was a
tremendous effort to kind of really

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:28.730
tremendous effort to kind of really
 

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:30.310
tremendous effort to kind of really
weaken the enforce civil rights

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:30.320

federal government in these agencies so

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400
federal government in these agencies so
 

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.950
federal government in these agencies so
these data were not taken as seriously

01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:35.960
these data were not taken as seriously
 

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960
these data were not taken as seriously
as they should have when you see the

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:37.970
as they should have when you see the
 

01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.570
as they should have when you see the
kind of consistency of the kind of

01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:40.580
kind of consistency of the kind of
 

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:42.130
kind of consistency of the kind of
patterns that you see there but again

01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:42.140
patterns that you see there but again
 

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.790
patterns that you see there but again
the question is is kind of one of

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:44.800
the question is is kind of one of
 

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.140
the question is is kind of one of
basically your interpretation of those

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:47.150
basically your interpretation of those
 

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:49.390
basically your interpretation of those
disparities is it really the result of

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400
disparities is it really the result of
 

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.360
disparities is it really the result of
kind of a racism structural problems or

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:52.370
kind of a racism structural problems or
 

01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:54.190
kind of a racism structural problems or
is it an individual problem these people

01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200
is it an individual problem these people
 

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.780
is it an individual problem these people
just you know it can't keep jobs and

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:55.790
just you know it can't keep jobs and
 

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:58.450
just you know it can't keep jobs and
stuff like that so it makes it really

01:00:58.450 --> 01:00:58.460
stuff like that so it makes it really
 

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:00.880
stuff like that so it makes it really
difficult I think to kind of talk about

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:00.890
difficult I think to kind of talk about
 

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:02.740
difficult I think to kind of talk about
this these days and then there are these

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:02.750
this these days and then there are these
 

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:04.210
this these days and then there are these

question so that as I was saying so the
 

01:02:45.539 --> 01:02:47.929
question so that as I was saying so the
purpose I sort of split the purposes

01:02:47.929 --> 01:02:47.939
purpose I sort of split the purposes
 

01:02:47.939 --> 01:02:49.759

into two which is one for the law and

01:02:49.759 --> 01:02:49.769
into two which is one for the law and
 

01:02:49.769 --> 01:02:55.129
into two which is one for the law and
the other is for research and so for the

01:02:55.129 --> 01:02:55.139
the other is for research and so for the
 

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:57.319
the other is for research and so for the
law as i said the voting rights act I

01:02:57.319 --> 01:02:57.329
law as i said the voting rights act I
 

01:02:57.329 --> 01:02:59.179
law as i said the voting rights act I
mean all civil rights statutes in some

senses that in order to do that and what
 

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:08.400
senses that in order to do that and what
you could show for example is that that

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:08.410

the areas that are covered
by the voting rights act as he did

outside the covered jurisdictions and
not only did that sort of seems obvious

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:18.730
not only did that sort of seems obvious
 

01:06:18.730 --> 01:06:20.100
not only did that sort of seems obvious
because most of the areas that are

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:20.110
because most of the areas that are
 

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:21.540
because most of the areas that are
covered in the south so of course he's

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:21.550
covered in the south so of course he's
 

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:23.040

you know he's going to do worse among
 

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:24.570
you know he's going to do worse among
southern whites but then you could also

then the quite then we're going to have

then the quite then we're going to have
 

01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:30.630
then the quite then we're going to have
some kind of heuristic right as to how

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640
some kind of heuristic right as to how
 

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.900

we're going to then wreak attagirl

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:32.910
we're going to then wreak attagirl
 

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:35.550
we're going to then wreak attagirl
already now that that that's what we

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:35.560
already now that that that's what we
 

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.040
already now that that that's what we
have under the sum up as ken was hinting

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:38.050
have under the sum up as ken was hinting

category the census will take people out

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:42.040
category the census will take people out
 

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.980
category the census will take people out
of the some other race category and

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:43.990
of the some other race category and
 

01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:47.540
of the some other race category and
reallocate them to other racial groups

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:47.550
reallocate them to other racial groups
 

01:07:47.550 --> 01:07:50.250
reallocate them to other racial groups
and so this you know if you just have an

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:50.260
and so this you know if you just have an
 

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.630
and so this you know if you just have an
open-ended question allows for

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:51.640
open-ended question allows for
 

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.070
open-ended question allows for
self-expression if that's important to

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:53.080
self-expression if that's important to
 

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:54.960
self-expression if that's important to
people but then the question is how

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:54.970
people but then the question is how
 

01:07:54.970 --> 01:08:00.260
people but then the question is how
would we reallocate people afterwards I

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:00.270
would we reallocate people afterwards I
 

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:06.030
would we reallocate people afterwards I

OD said about the uses of these data and

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:11.890
OD said about the uses of these data and
 

01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:15.600
OD said about the uses of these data and
to what I said earlier about the uses of

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:15.610
to what I said earlier about the uses of
 

01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:17.430
to what I said earlier about the uses of
these data I think that the data is

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440
these data I think that the data is
 

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:20.040
these data I think that the data is
still very important and it's a terrible

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:20.050
still very important and it's a terrible
 

01:08:20.050 --> 01:08:24.530
still very important and it's a terrible
mistake to equate the collection of data

01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540
mistake to equate the collection of data
 

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:28.670
mistake to equate the collection of data
with discrimination itself that's a

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:28.680
with discrimination itself that's a
 

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.620
with discrimination itself that's a
terrible mistake but some people are

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:30.630
terrible mistake but some people are
 

01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:33.530
terrible mistake but some people are
doing that very deliberately with

doing that very deliberately with
 

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:38.780
doing that very deliberately with
respect to the questions as i said

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:38.790
respect to the questions as i said
 

01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:42.020
respect to the questions as i said
earlier at least i hinted i probably

01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:42.030

01:17:56.159 --> 01:17:58.580
wrong on this is this the first time in
two censuses that there hasn't been any

01:17:58.580 --> 01:17:58.590
two censuses that there hasn't been any
 

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:01.399
two censuses that there hasn't been any
changes to the race question this is

01:18:01.399 --> 01:18:01.409
changes to the race question this is
 

01:18:01.409 --> 01:18:03.500
changes to the race question this is
great because the 2010 census will be

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:03.510
great because the 2010 census will be
 

01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:05.839
great because the 2010 census will be
the same as the two thousand census form

01:18:05.839 --> 01:18:05.849
the same as the two thousand census form
 

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:09.739
the same as the two thousand census form
and so that's it so so what is this I

01:18:09.739 --> 01:18:09.749
and so that's it so so what is this I
 

01:18:09.749 --> 01:18:12.080
and so that's it so so what is this I
think you maybe suggest like I've kind

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:12.090
think you maybe suggest like I've kind
 

01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:14.089
think you maybe suggest like I've kind
of calcification you know the category

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:14.099
of calcification you know the category
 

01:18:14.099 --> 01:18:15.949
of calcification you know the category
I'll be very quick acting this question

01:18:15.949 --> 01:18:15.959
I'll be very quick acting this question
 

01:18:15.959 --> 01:18:17.899
I'll be very quick acting this question
but because you're both right and wrong

01:18:17.899 --> 01:18:17.909
but because you're both right and wrong
 

01:18:17.909 --> 01:18:19.640
but because you're both right and wrong
obviously you look at a question across

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:19.650
obviously you look at a question across
 

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:20.959
obviously you look at a question across
history and all kinds of things came and

01:18:20.959 --> 01:18:20.969
history and all kinds of things came and
 

01:18:20.969 --> 01:18:22.759
history and all kinds of things came and
went but the fundamental structure that

01:18:22.759 --> 01:18:22.769
went but the fundamental structure that
 

01:18:22.769 --> 01:18:24.439
went but the fundamental structure that
did not the fundamental structure went

01:18:24.439 --> 01:18:24.449
did not the fundamental structure went
 

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:28.909
did not the fundamental structure went
through three white black red 24 white

01:18:28.909 --> 01:18:28.919
through three white black red 24 white
 

01:18:28.919 --> 01:18:31.219
through three white black red 24 white
black red yellow now there was a period

01:18:31.219 --> 01:18:31.229
black red yellow now there was a period
 

01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:33.379
black red yellow now there was a period
while it was not clear the Chinese are

01:18:33.379 --> 01:18:33.389
while it was not clear the Chinese are
 

01:18:33.389 --> 01:18:35.779
while it was not clear the Chinese are
clearly some alien race but maybe the

01:18:35.779 --> 01:18:35.789
clearly some alien race but maybe the
 

01:18:35.789 --> 01:18:37.339
clearly some alien race but maybe the
Japanese arm because they're Christian

01:18:37.339 --> 01:18:37.349
Japanese arm because they're Christian
 

01:18:37.349 --> 01:18:38.419
Japanese arm because they're Christian
and maybe we're not going to sort of put

01:18:38.419 --> 01:18:38.429
and maybe we're not going to sort of put
 

01:18:38.429 --> 01:18:40.520
and maybe we're not going to sort of put
them into this category and that went on

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:40.530
them into this category and that went on
 

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:41.959
them into this category and that went on
for truck you know two or three decades

01:18:41.959 --> 01:18:41.969
for truck you know two or three decades
 

01:18:41.969 --> 01:18:44.060
for truck you know two or three decades
that argument but by the end of the 19th

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:44.070
that argument but by the end of the 19th
 

01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:46.310
that argument but by the end of the 19th
century we had decided all of those

01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320
century we had decided all of those
 

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.159
century we had decided all of those
kinds of people work asian they were in

01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:49.169
kinds of people work asian they were in
 

01:18:49.169 --> 01:18:51.439
kinds of people work asian they were in
a race group then we went through a

01:18:51.439 --> 01:18:51.449
a race group then we went through a
 

01:18:51.449 --> 01:18:53.509
a race group then we went through a
period where my gosh oh what about these

01:18:53.509 --> 01:18:53.519
period where my gosh oh what about these
 

01:18:53.519 --> 01:18:55.060
period where my gosh oh what about these
what about these wrong kind of whites

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:55.070
what about these wrong kind of whites
 

01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:57.500
what about these wrong kind of whites
he's Italian White's you after all a

these polish white so after all Jewish
 

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:04.339
these polish white so after all Jewish
and so there was some playing around

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:04.349
and so there was some playing around
 

01:19:04.349 --> 01:19:05.990
and so there was some playing around
with this new ethnicity a more refined

01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000
with this new ethnicity a more refined
 

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.290
with this new ethnicity a more refined
way but by when the dust settled they

01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300
way but by when the dust settled they
 

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.540
way but by when the dust settled they
were all white and when the dust settled

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:11.550
were all white and when the dust settled
 

01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:13.279
were all white and when the dust settled
everybody's a black everybody is one of

everybody's a black everybody is one of
 

01:19:13.289 --> 01:19:15.259
everybody's a black everybody is one of
these five primary groups just that's

01:19:15.259 --> 01:19:15.269
these five primary groups just that's
 

01:19:15.269 --> 01:19:17.509
these five primary groups just that's
where the dust settled we started with

01:19:17.509 --> 01:19:17.519
where the dust settled we started with
 

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:19.819
where the dust settled we started with
three we went to four and then we added

01:19:19.819 --> 01:19:19.829
three we went to four and then we added
 

01:19:19.829 --> 01:19:22.850
three we went to four and then we added
the fifth when we added the Pacific

01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860
the fifth when we added the Pacific
 

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:25.459

Islander and then the other incredibly

01:19:25.459 --> 01:19:25.469
Islander and then the other incredibly
 

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:28.220
Islander and then the other incredibly
interesting thing is we tagged along and

01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:28.230
interesting thing is we tagged along and
 

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:32.810
interesting thing is we tagged along and
ethnicity called the Hispanic and so now

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820
ethnicity called the Hispanic and so now
 

01:19:32.820 --> 01:19:34.279
ethnicity called the Hispanic and so now
whatever you want to call these groups

01:19:34.279 --> 01:19:34.289
whatever you want to call these groups
 

01:19:34.289 --> 01:19:36.770
whatever you want to call these groups
but we clearly have six major groupings

01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:36.780
but we clearly have six major groupings
 

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:40.370
but we clearly have six major groupings

in the society well in terms of size you
 

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:41.600
in the society well in terms of size you
know I just wanted to say that between

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:41.610
know I just wanted to say that between
 

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.390
know I just wanted to say that between
2000 and the current census there was

01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400
2000 and the current census there was
 

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.549
2000 and the current census there was
one little difference and that was a

01:19:46.549 --> 01:19:46.559
one little difference and that was a
 

01:19:46.559 --> 01:19:49.370
one little difference and that was a
they didn't include the examples on

01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.380
they didn't include the examples on
 

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:51.259
they didn't include the examples on
Hispanic did some other Hispanic and

01:19:51.259 --> 01:19:51.269
Hispanic did some other Hispanic and
 

01:19:51.269 --> 01:19:53.779
Hispanic did some other Hispanic and
that created all sorts of havoc but uh

01:19:53.779 --> 01:19:53.789
that created all sorts of havoc but uh
 

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.490
that created all sorts of havoc but uh
these little technical things but the

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:55.500
these little technical things but the
 

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:56.509
these little technical things but the
other thing I want to say in terms of

01:19:56.509 --> 01:19:56.519
other thing I want to say in terms of
 

01:19:56.519 --> 01:19:58.910
other thing I want to say in terms of
research purposes for example one things

01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920
research purposes for example one things
 

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.919
research purposes for example one things
that I find fascinating as Ken mentioned

01:20:00.919 --> 01:20:00.929
that I find fascinating as Ken mentioned
 

01:20:00.929 --> 01:20:04.640

that some other category in the Hispanic
 

01:20:04.650 --> 01:20:08.089
that some other category in the Hispanic
I mean in the race question is seen when

01:20:08.089 --> 01:20:08.099
I mean in the race question is seen when
 

01:20:08.099 --> 01:20:09.200
I mean in the race question is seen when
you talk to census people it's like a

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:09.210
you talk to census people it's like a
 

01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:10.879
you talk to census people it's like a
nuisance it's like this painted what do

01:20:10.879 --> 01:20:10.889
nuisance it's like this painted what do
 

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:12.259
nuisance it's like this painted what do
we do with this stupid thing let's get

01:20:12.259 --> 01:20:12.269
we do with this stupid thing let's get
 

01:20:12.269 --> 01:20:14.660
we do with this stupid thing let's get
rid of it last time that happened I

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:14.670
rid of it last time that happened I
 

01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:17.720
rid of it last time that happened I
remember congressman Serrano uh

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:17.730
remember congressman Serrano uh
 

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:20.660
remember congressman Serrano uh
you know a little amendment into uh wow

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:20.670
you know a little amendment into uh wow

you know a little amendment into uh wow
I did put in a call but uh butter and

01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:24.900
I did put in a call but uh butter and
 

01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:27.439
I did put in a call but uh butter and
and and there was resistance to changing

01:20:27.439 --> 01:20:27.449
and and there was resistance to changing
 

01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:28.790
and and there was resistance to changing
it but the other thing that the reason

01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800
it but the other thing that the reason
 

01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:32.390
it but the other thing that the reason
was that in the Latino community there's

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400
was that in the Latino community there's
 

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.910
was that in the Latino community there's
a certain this whole research program

01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920
a certain this whole research program
 

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.910
a certain this whole research program
around the fact that we reject American

01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920
around the fact that we reject American
 

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.040
around the fact that we reject American
racial categories and that's an

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:40.050
racial categories and that's an
 

01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:43.040
racial categories and that's an
affirmation that we reject it will put

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:43.050
affirmation that we reject it will put
 

01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:44.839
affirmation that we reject it will put
in things like some other races they'll

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:44.849
in things like some other races they'll
 

01:20:44.849 --> 01:20:47.569
in things like some other races they'll
put in Puerto Rican is a race those

01:20:47.569 --> 01:20:47.579
put in Puerto Rican is a race those
 

01:20:47.579 --> 01:20:49.700
put in Puerto Rican is a race those
types of things and it's a source of

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:49.710
types of things and it's a source of
 

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:52.040
types of things and it's a source of
kind of pride right that we're distinct

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:52.050
kind of pride right that we're distinct
 

01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.870
kind of pride right that we're distinct
from these other American people I just

01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880
from these other American people I just
 

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.279
from these other American people I just
fall into these stupid these get

01:20:55.279 --> 01:20:55.289
fall into these stupid these get
 

01:20:55.289 --> 01:20:57.620
fall into these stupid these get
categories that's part of it and also

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:57.630
categories that's part of it and also
 

01:20:57.630 --> 01:20:59.419
categories that's part of it and also
there's been a whole research program

01:20:59.419 --> 01:20:59.429
there's been a whole research program
 

01:20:59.429 --> 01:21:02.660
there's been a whole research program
around Latino Studies cultural studies

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:02.670
around Latino Studies cultural studies
 

01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:06.370
around Latino Studies cultural studies
around this issue of race is a lot of

01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:06.380
around this issue of race is a lot of
 

01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:09.200
around this issue of race is a lot of
research on racial identity of Latinos

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:09.210
research on racial identity of Latinos
 

01:21:09.210 --> 01:21:10.580
research on racial identity of Latinos
and how it's different than all that

01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:10.590
and how it's different than all that
 

01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:12.170
and how it's different than all that
stuff so what happens is

01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:12.180
stuff so what happens is
 

01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:13.880
stuff so what happens is
when you talk to the census people they

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:13.890
when you talk to the census people they
 

01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:15.260
when you talk to the census people they
go ahead this thing's a nuisance it's

01:21:15.260 --> 01:21:15.270
go ahead this thing's a nuisance it's
 

01:21:15.270 --> 01:21:17.540
go ahead this thing's a nuisance it's
not useful in the Latino community

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:17.550
not useful in the Latino community
 

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:21.050
not useful in the Latino community
that's taken as also kind of attacking a

01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:21.060
that's taken as also kind of attacking a
 

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:23.180
that's taken as also kind of attacking a
whole area or research within the Latino

01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:23.190
whole area or research within the Latino
 

01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:25.340
whole area or research within the Latino
community that is valued by a whole

01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:25.350
community that is valued by a whole
 

01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:27.620
community that is valued by a whole

person's skin color and we asked the
 

01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:10.900
person's skin color and we asked the
census questions and I did I remember I

01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:10.910
census questions and I did I remember I
 

01:24:10.910 --> 01:24:12.820
census questions and I did I remember I
did a paper on this and looking at the

01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:12.830
did a paper on this and looking at the
 

01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:14.800
did a paper on this and looking at the
correlation between skin color and the

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:14.810
correlation between skin color and the

actually very local correlation between

actually very local correlation between
 

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:23.200
actually very local correlation between
the two and so and then I look at the

01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:23.210
the two and so and then I look at the
 

01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:24.910
the two and so and then I look at the

there's a disconnect there and it's hard
 

01:24:40.489 --> 01:24:42.400
there's a disconnect there and it's hard
to explore because within the census you

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:42.410
to explore because within the census you
 

01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:44.290
to explore because within the census you
can't look at you can't look at it so

01:24:44.290 --> 01:24:44.300
can't look at you can't look at it so
 

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:46.419
can't look at you can't look at it so
and there's also the issue about which

disaggregate that minority racial ethnic
minority category there's a hierarchy

minority category there's a hierarchy
 

01:38:18.969 --> 01:38:21.300
minority category there's a hierarchy
there's a clearly hierarchy where you

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:21.310
there's a clearly hierarchy where you
 

01:38:21.310 --> 01:38:24.270
there's a clearly hierarchy where you
have for example Latinos in fact seeing

01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:24.280
have for example Latinos in fact seeing
 

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.370
have for example Latinos in fact seeing
in many places blacks as gatekeepers

01:38:26.370 --> 01:38:26.380
in many places blacks as gatekeepers
 

01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:29.370
in many places blacks as gatekeepers
it's all relative and then within the

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:29.380
it's all relative and then within the
 

01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:30.840

example Dominican see Puerto Ricans as
gatekeepers and it goes on and on and on

gatekeepers and it goes on and on and on
 

01:38:35.050 --> 01:38:37.800
gatekeepers and it goes on and on and on
so that yeah there is that kind of kind

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:37.810
so that yeah there is that kind of kind
 

01:38:37.810 --> 01:38:40.470
so that yeah there is that kind of kind
of competition comparing the experiences

01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480
of competition comparing the experiences
 

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.180
of competition comparing the experiences
and it but it's already relative right

01:38:42.180 --> 01:38:42.190
and it but it's already relative right
 

01:38:42.190 --> 01:38:44.310
and it but it's already relative right
because we've all been taught thought

01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320
because we've all been taught thought
 

01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.950
because we've all been taught thought
they say racial electric guitars are all

01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960
they say racial electric guitars are all
 

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:49.890
they say racial electric guitars are all
poor they're all of the same boat so it

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:49.900
poor they're all of the same boat so it
 

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:51.270
poor they're all of the same boat so it
gets kind of interesting when in a city

01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280
gets kind of interesting when in a city
 

01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:53.310
gets kind of interesting when in a city
like New York two-thirds of the

01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:53.320
like New York two-thirds of the
 

01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.900
like New York two-thirds of the
population is now communities of color

01:38:54.900 --> 01:38:54.910
population is now communities of color
 

01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:56.550
population is now communities of color
we have to think about them in a

01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560
we have to think about them in a
 

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.959
we have to think about them in a
different way it's no longer white

01:38:57.959 --> 01:38:57.969
different way it's no longer white
 

01:38:57.969 --> 01:39:00.750
different way it's no longer white
versus non white or you know majority

01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760
versus non white or you know majority
 

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.580
versus non white or you know majority
versus minority and it gets complicated

01:39:02.580 --> 01:39:02.590
versus minority and it gets complicated
 

01:39:02.590 --> 01:39:04.920
versus minority and it gets complicated
so that there are various reasons why

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:04.930
so that there are various reasons why
 

01:39:04.930 --> 01:39:07.050
so that there are various reasons why
there is that but I think the issue is

01:39:07.050 --> 01:39:07.060
there is that but I think the issue is
 

01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:08.790
there is that but I think the issue is
how you conceptualize kind of

01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800
how you conceptualize kind of
 

01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:11.370
how you conceptualize kind of
discriminatory regimes and in the sense

01:39:11.370 --> 01:39:11.380
discriminatory regimes and in the sense
 

01:39:11.380 --> 01:39:14.100
discriminatory regimes and in the sense
of do you see it as a situation where

01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:14.110
of do you see it as a situation where
 

01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:16.800
of do you see it as a situation where
there are certain indicators based on a

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:16.810
there are certain indicators based on a
 

01:39:16.810 --> 01:39:19.470
there are certain indicators based on a
pattern of discrimination that indicate

01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480
pattern of discrimination that indicate
 

01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:21.330
pattern of discrimination that indicate
that they will likely be discrimination

01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:21.340
that they will likely be discrimination
 

01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:22.620
that they will likely be discrimination
against a person because of their

01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:22.630
against a person because of their
 

01:39:22.630 --> 01:39:24.660
against a person because of their
language because of this skin color

01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:24.670
language because of this skin color
 

01:39:24.670 --> 01:39:26.939
language because of this skin color
because of their foreignness or whatever

01:39:26.939 --> 01:39:26.949
because of their foreignness or whatever
 

01:39:26.949 --> 01:39:30.930
because of their foreignness or whatever
and do you have to wait to as a group

01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:30.940
and do you have to wait to as a group
 

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:33.540
and do you have to wait to as a group
they develop a series of discriminatory

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:33.550
they develop a series of discriminatory
 

01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:35.790
they develop a series of discriminatory
experiences before you're legit and you

01:39:35.790 --> 01:39:35.800
experiences before you're legit and you
 

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:38.340
experiences before you're legit and you
can bring a case or can you in fact say

01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:38.350
can bring a case or can you in fact say
 

01:39:38.350 --> 01:39:40.320
can bring a case or can you in fact say
look it's likely that these people are

01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:40.330
look it's likely that these people are
 

01:39:40.330 --> 01:39:43.200
look it's likely that these people are
will be discriminated against can't be

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:43.210
will be discriminated against can't be
 

01:39:43.210 --> 01:39:45.270
will be discriminated against can't be
discriminated against tomorrow so it's a

01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:45.280
discriminated against tomorrow so it's a
 

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.070
discriminated against tomorrow so it's a
question of conceptually how you look at

01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:47.080
question of conceptually how you look at
 

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.810
question of conceptually how you look at
this stuff because there's a case for

01:39:48.810 --> 01:39:48.820
this stuff because there's a case for
 

01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:50.430
this stuff because there's a case for
example in the some people in the black

01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440
example in the some people in the black
 

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.600
example in the some people in the black
community for example let's say

01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:51.610
community for example let's say
 

01:39:51.610 --> 01:39:54.780
community for example let's say
Latinos don't have any legitimate cases

01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:54.790
Latinos don't have any legitimate cases
 

01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:56.189
Latinos don't have any legitimate cases
in terms to bring in terms of

01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:56.199
in terms to bring in terms of
 

01:39:56.199 --> 01:39:58.620
in terms to bring in terms of
discrimination this is really we talk

01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:58.630
discrimination this is really we talk
 

01:39:58.630 --> 01:40:00.120
discrimination this is really we talk
about the civil rights movement and you

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:00.130
about the civil rights movement and you
 

01:40:00.130 --> 01:40:01.859
about the civil rights movement and you
talk about trying to do this is

01:40:01.859 --> 01:40:01.869
talk about trying to do this is
 

01:40:01.869 --> 01:40:03.149
talk about trying to do this is
basically something that comes out of

01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159
basically something that comes out of
 

01:40:03.159 --> 01:40:05.100
basically something that comes out of
the african-american experience in the

01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:05.110
the african-american experience in the
 

01:40:05.110 --> 01:40:07.500
the african-american experience in the
US the holiday adding the Latinos to

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:07.510
US the holiday adding the Latinos to
 

01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:09.450
US the holiday adding the Latinos to
this thing and adding Asians and all

01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:09.460
this thing and adding Asians and all
 

01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:11.939
this thing and adding Asians and all
these groups so so it's really a

01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:11.949
these groups so so it's really a
 

01:40:11.949 --> 01:40:13.649
these groups so so it's really a
question of how you see this lead is

01:40:13.649 --> 01:40:13.659
question of how you see this lead is
 

01:40:13.659 --> 01:40:16.830
question of how you see this lead is
either kind of a narrow view of groups

01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:16.840
either kind of a narrow view of groups
 

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:17.850
either kind of a narrow view of groups
that have experienced discrimination

01:40:17.850 --> 01:40:17.860
that have experienced discrimination
 

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:20.280
that have experienced discrimination
because in the black community right you

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:20.290
because in the black community right you
 

01:40:20.290 --> 01:40:21.720
because in the black community right you
have the same problem like with Haitians

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:21.730
have the same problem like with Haitians
 

01:40:21.730 --> 01:40:23.669
have the same problem like with Haitians
and West Indians the hell are they doing

01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679
and West Indians the hell are they doing
 

01:40:23.679 --> 01:40:25.379
and West Indians the hell are they doing
claiming affirmative action and getting

claiming affirmative action and getting
 

01:40:25.389 --> 01:40:26.850
claiming affirmative action and getting
into all these programs whereas

01:40:26.850 --> 01:40:26.860
into all these programs whereas
 

01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:28.530
into all these programs whereas
african-americans experience you know

01:40:28.530 --> 01:40:28.540
african-americans experience you know
 

01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:30.479
african-americans experience you know
hundreds of years of discrimination and

hundreds of years of discrimination and
 

01:40:30.489 --> 01:40:32.459
hundreds of years of discrimination and
getting you know so you wind up

01:40:32.459 --> 01:40:32.469
getting you know so you wind up
 

01:40:32.469 --> 01:40:35.160
getting you know so you wind up
with those kinds of discussions is is

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:35.170
with those kinds of discussions is is
 

01:40:35.170 --> 01:40:37.590
with those kinds of discussions is is
that should you go that narrow is there

01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:37.600
that should you go that narrow is there
 

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.990
that should you go that narrow is there
or do you take a broader kind of view of

01:40:39.990 --> 01:40:40.000
or do you take a broader kind of view of
 

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:41.850
or do you take a broader kind of view of
trying to eliminate discrimination and

01:40:41.850 --> 01:40:41.860
trying to eliminate discrimination and
 

01:40:41.860 --> 01:40:44.550
trying to eliminate discrimination and

probably more likely be discriminated

01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:47.860
probably more likely be discriminated
 

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:50.490
probably more likely be discriminated
against so it's it's it's uh we've been

01:40:50.490 --> 01:40:50.500
against so it's it's it's uh we've been
