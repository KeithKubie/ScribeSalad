00:00:05.496 --> 00:00:06.870
INTERVIEWER: A
lone shopping cart

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.720
in the middle of a gravel
lot, its rusty wheels

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.620
bent inwards, sitting
without a purpose.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.540
This picture shows a
relic of a different time.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.290
Just kidding!

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.210
This picture shows a bunch of
crazy, oversized presidential

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.125
heads.

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:22.000
What's going on here?

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.060
The person who came across
this presidential head garden

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.204
is this woman.

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:31.120
JESSECA KEPPER: Hello.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.170
My name is Jesseca Kepper, and
I'm an amateur photographer

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.690
from Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.520
I have a special predilection
for roadside America.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.785
I have been visiting these
kind of sites my whole life.

00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:48.160
INTERVIEWER: The
sites Jesseca is

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.120
referring to are bizarre
American roadside attractions.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.030
JESSECA KEPPER: I love
roadside attractions--

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.565
or roadside distractions,
as I like to call them.

00:00:57.565 --> 00:01:01.410
I've been visiting them,
again, since I can remember,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.280
but this one is
really a highlight

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.400
because of its obscurity.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.480
INTERVIEWER: These seven foot
tall presidential busts-- 43

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.270
in all-- reside
in Texas and were

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.420
created by artist
David Adickes, who

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.460
specializes in oversize art.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.130
JESSECA KEPPER: Apparently
he was inspired after a visit

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.230
to Mount Rushmore.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.900
He said he was overwhelmed
when he saw the presidents,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.440
and he hated that he
had to use binoculars

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.800
to see all the detail
work up on the mountain.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.880
So on his drive
back to Texas, he

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.440
decided to create his own
presidential sculptures,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.910
and he wanted his visitors to
be able to get as close as they

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.250
wanted to the pieces.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.990
And sure enough,
when you're there,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.719
you can get as
close as you want.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:43.510
You can touch them.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.034
You can climb on them.

00:01:46.034 --> 00:01:48.200
INTERVIEWER: Jesseca's
travels have also brought her

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.860
to a giant pistachio, a giant
ball of twine, a giant clothes

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.680
pin, and of course, who
could forget the Idaho Potato

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.470
Museum-- each attraction
seemingly weirder

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.530
than the next.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.660
But no matter where her
next road trip brings her,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.460
no matter what big statue or
weirdly specialized museum

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.410
she visits, there's
a chance nothing

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.720
will ever top the
craziness of an empty Texas

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.140
lot filled with seven-foot
tall president heads.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.900
JESSECA KEPPER: It was just
another piece of randomness

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.590
to add to the whole
goodness pile.

00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:24.130
INTERVIEWER: "This
Happened Here"

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.370
aims to showcase compelling
photos and the stories

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.220
behind them.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.930
If you liked this one, be sure
to check out this one next.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.740
SUBJECT: I asked
someone to let me ride

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.120
doubles with her so I
can shoot action photos

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.690
of the girls riding in a pack.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.670
INTERVIEWER: And as always,
thanks for watching.
