[music playing]

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.200
MICHAEL: Russian
Orthodox Christianity

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.867
runs deep within the Night
Wolves motorcycle club.

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.367
They even have their
own bike riding monk,

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.367
a chaplain called Father Guriy.

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:32.033
How can I resist?

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:33.000
I have to meet him.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.233
Oh, Father Guriy himself.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.433
Ah, thank you for having us.

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:40.200
Another step to understanding
this new Russian vision.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.033
I meet him here at
Lavra, outside of Moscow.

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.567
Lavra is a holy Russian
Orthodox Christian

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:48.934
enclave of cathedrals
and monasteries,

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:50.333
akin to a mini-Vatican.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.800
So do you ride, Father?

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.667
Yes.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:53.867
Really?

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:55.233
What bike do you ride?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.033
One of your first
rides, and Surgeon

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:03.900
saw him, and said
that's what we need.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.800
[laughter]

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:16.266
The Night Wolves-- they
were trying to find something,

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:17.500
and they found it.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.133
Found it.

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:19.800
[choir singing]

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.200
MICHAEL: If I'm
trying to understand

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.567
the Russian identity, then
one must also understand

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:46.200
Russian Orthodox Christianity.

00:01:52.266 --> 00:01:55.266
[choir singing]

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.233
Every book, every
historical period--

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.734
it was based on the--

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:20.867
You see-- you can see the
church, the role of the faith.

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:23.166
This has been incredible.

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:26.467
This has really helped
my understanding.
