[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:09.850
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Excellent.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.220
So we've got a really
interesting panel session

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.340
today.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.484
It's about what are the biggest
obstacles to agency success.

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:19.900
And essentially,
what I want to do

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.110
is take a slightly different
approach, because in this room,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.430
we have people who
traditionally regard

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.020
each other as competitors.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.580
You're all chasing after
customers together.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.490
And actually, I want people
to take a step back from that

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.800
and think a little
bit differently.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.280
So what if the
people in this room

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.700
could be your
collaborators as well?

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.360
They could actually help solve
the issues and the challenges

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.610
that you've got.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.140
With that, we have an
absolutely brilliant panel here,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.810
with a ton of great
experience, representing

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.340
a range of geographies.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.584
So we have the US, India,
and the UK covered here.

00:00:57.584 --> 00:00:59.625
I'm actually going to take
a rather lazy approach

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.710
to this panel and
get our panelists

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590
to introduce themselves.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.890
So with that, let's
start off with Jeff.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.140
If you could introduce
yourself, and if you could also

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.840
give a one-line description
of your agency and what makes

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.290
it a little bit different.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.790
JEFF NAMNUM: My
name is Jeff Namnum.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.100
I am a partner at Touchlab.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.840
We're based out of New York,
do work all over the states.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.240
We are and the way we
describe ourselves is we

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.510
are America's Android-first
dev and design shop.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.055
We're the ones that do the
crazy shit with Android.

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:36.180
PRADEEP NALLURI: Hey, guys.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.030
I'm Pradeep here.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.580
I'm representing Mutual Mobile.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.712
I am partner at Mutual Mobile.

00:01:40.712 --> 00:01:43.440
Mutual Mobile also is
full-scale services.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.520
We do consulting, design,
engineering services

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.960
to Fortune 500 companies.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.670
Our USP is that we focus
on few niche verticals.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.830
And we are world-class at that.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.810
We work with Fortune
500 companies.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.110
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Excellent.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.318
RYAN BATEMAN: My name's Ryan.

00:02:01.318 --> 00:02:04.390
I'm a technical product
owner for Novoda.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.009
Novoda's been writing
software and working in mobile

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.657
for about seven years now.

00:02:09.657 --> 00:02:11.490
And we like to bill
ourselves as the world's

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.910
most ambitious mobile
product development agency.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.452
So feel free to talk to
me about that, please.

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:19.910
RUPERT WHITEHEAD:
It's interesting.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.670
Straight away, we can see
where differentiation comes

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.260
with each of those one-liners.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.040
And I'm sure
everybody in the room

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.250
has got their own
answer to that,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.700
their own source of
differentiation that

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.626
comes with it.

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:34.500
I'd like to come back
to one of the questions

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.450
we touched on very briefly
at the beginning, which

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.530
is about convincing customers.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.140
So what's your biggest
obstacles you've

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.330
had in getting a customer
to adopt a new technology

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.760
or feature that you're
convinced is going to be really

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.140
good to them or for them?

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.875
And how have you actually gone
about solving that problem

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:54.020
and convincing them?

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.800
And Pradeep, maybe you
can answer this one first.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.750
PRADEEP NALLURI: Yup.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.398
Every client is different.

00:03:00.398 --> 00:03:02.670
Some clients have a
lot of understanding,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.962
because they have
a good tech team.

00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:09.010
So their team come with-- they
actually choose a product,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.200
and they come to us.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.830
And sometimes we have to
push back, telling them,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.150
that is not the right
product for your app.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.649
Sometimes clients are-- we
work with the old economy.

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:23.690
They don't know anything.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.160
They trust us blindly.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.620
And those are the best
clients to work with,

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.883
because they believe in us.

00:03:28.883 --> 00:03:31.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.910
So they leave the complete
the implementation to us.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.610
So that's easy.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.140
Actually, working
with a client who

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.620
know and they bring their
own director of product

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.530
or somebody, sometimes we
had to jump through hoops

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.230
to convince them.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.150
We have to actually
do tech specs,

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.300
design specs to show them
that this is the best

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.920
way to actually approach it.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.710
Just don't take the
engineering approach

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.149
or the design approach.

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:56.690
Look at the entire
[? integrated ?]--

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.960
from how is [INAUDIBLE]
help you achieve your ROI?

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.270
Maybe it's the best
product, but we

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.760
have to be
product-agnostic when we

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.650
are coming with the solution.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.550
So that way, we
face difficulties,

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.854
but part of the game.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.130
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: So same
question to you. [LAUGHS]

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.921
RYAN BATEMAN: Yeah.

00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:19.872
I think it is, as
Pradeep sort of mention,

00:04:19.872 --> 00:04:21.455
I think it's about
establishing trust.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.920
I think this is a common thing.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.480
We're brought in as a source of
technical knowledge, a source

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.100
of technical expertise
either from the old economy

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.072
or from customers who
just trust us blindly.

00:04:35.072 --> 00:04:37.390
And you can use
that as a currency.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.706
I mean, trust is something
that can be exchanged.

00:04:39.706 --> 00:04:41.580
You can say, you know,
I believe this product

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.465
or this technology
would really help you.

00:04:44.465 --> 00:04:45.840
We're going to
spend a little bit

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.220
of this trust we built
through technical expertise

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.882
that we've demonstrated.

00:04:49.882 --> 00:04:51.590
And we'll take your
timing down the road,

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.590
and we'll use some kind
of KPI for measuring what

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.110
the return on investment is.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.974
But trust us this tiny distance.

00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:00.744
Yeah.

00:05:00.744 --> 00:05:02.160
RUPERT WHITEHEAD:
Anything to add?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.350
JEFF NAMNUM: Well, these
guys really covered it well.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.850
Right?

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.650
Trust is a huge thing.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.420
I think our approach
is a solution, trust,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.150
and a bit of obnoxiousness.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.850
We focus very heavily on what
the solution is the client

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.840
is trying to accomplish.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:33.690
And we build ourselves in such
a way that, where necessary,

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.220
we are obnoxious in refusal
to the point of sending people

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.870
away.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.970
We recently had the opportunity
to build a corollary

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.430
to a big Apple project
and sent that client away

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:56.230
multiple times, because
they refused to approach

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.880
the project in the correct way.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.380
It's a gutsy
direction sometimes,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.490
and sometimes it's a
terrifying direction

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.954
when you're a small shop.

00:06:10.954 --> 00:06:12.370
But it's been well
worth it to us.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.310
We believe you're
just as defined

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.062
by the things you say no to
as the ones you say yes to.

00:06:17.062 --> 00:06:18.020
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Yeah.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.080
It's interesting seeing
the role of trust

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.730
to build that
credibility and allow

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.890
you to build the reputation and
the quality of products that's

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.392
so important there.

00:06:26.392 --> 00:06:27.382
JEFF NAMNUM: Yeah.

00:06:27.382 --> 00:06:29.340
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: So the
next question I've got

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.660
is about how you actually
measure the customer

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.120
return on investment,
because you know,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.200
there's an increasing
appetite for

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.250
data-driven decision-making.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.040
And that's sometimes
quite challenging

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.580
to do within an agency
context when there

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.180
are a lot of unknowns around.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.880
So how have you
approached the problem

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.719
of data-driven decision-making?

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:49.510
RYAN BATEMAN: Yeah.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.750
I mean, the solution
to this is always

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.010
some kind of API-- sorry, KPI.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.790
So pick a goal.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.460
And everyone loves
kind of numbers,

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.440
graphs going up to the right.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.570
Aim towards that.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.020
And yeah, shoot for it.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.520
I think as we've grown
as an agency as well,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.150
we've bridged that gap between
just picking a dashboard

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.460
and hoping it goes
up, and trying

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.040
to understand the
business needs and where

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.960
that meets with the mobile
product kind of end result.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.460
And I think at that point, you
can take a step back and say,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.170
what is the broader
spectrum, what's

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.780
the broader context for
this mobile product we're

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.240
developing?

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.940
And do we need just
a KPI, or can we

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.040
actually understand what's the
impact of the greater business?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.630
If there's a number or a graph
behind it, that's fantastic.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.750
But all too often, as you say,
it's a bit more of a jump.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.642
JEFF NAMNUM: Ryan
hit on the nose.

00:07:45.642 --> 00:07:51.410
It is understanding the
business or the organization,

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.730
and whatever their goals are.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.225
Once you know what
their goals are,

00:07:57.225 --> 00:08:01.080
you can set a KPI, which
is the easiest way,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.550
and it's the way the clients
think that they love.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:11.260
Or you can help them understand
their goal better than they do.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.090
They generally don't.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:17.040
They think that they know
where they're trying to get to.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.770
But once they take the time,
and trust you, and describe

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.350
their business to you and what
they're trying to accomplish,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.420
if you can help
them set the goal

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:31.800
and help them understand that
they had misread what they were

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.667
actually trying to accomplish,
sometimes the KPI's

00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:35.500
much less necessary.

00:08:38.143 --> 00:08:39.559
RUPERT WHITEHEAD:
In terms of KPIs

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.780
that you see coming
up time and time again

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.919
that customers are
asking for, are there any

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.570
that spring to mind
as being things

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:49.420
that you see as recurring
requests or recurring things

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.530
that you need to
track and demonstrate?

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.210
PRADEEP NALLURI: They
usually are active users--

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.060
how many monthly active
users, engagement.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.620
Every customer is different.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.280
Some of them are coming--
they want an app to have

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.760
an e-commerce model on it.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.830
They want to sell.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.050
So they want to make sure
that customers are engaged,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.712
they're coming back
to the app to buy.

00:09:08.712 --> 00:09:10.670
So the design decisions
which go into their app

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.010
are completely different.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.315
Then we have content creators,
magazines like "Economist,"

00:09:15.315 --> 00:09:16.810
whom we've worked with.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.540
They publish their
magazine once a week.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.830
So they see a spike in
going up, but they also

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.580
actually want to monetize
their digital product, which

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.260
is struggling.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.718
So we actually
helped them increase

00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:32.180
their digital
monetization by 80% using,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.514
actually, Google Play, actually.

00:09:33.514 --> 00:09:34.680
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Excellent.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.530
PRADEEP NALLURI: By 80%
in the last quarter.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.321
They were not doing
that, and they were not

00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:40.766
able to buy digital subscribers.

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:45.240
And we actually used Google
Play to integrate with them

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.930
and increase their revenue
by 80% in a quarter.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.940
So not only-- we just
don't do the KPIs.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.020
We also actually
help the customers

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.320
to realize new revenue
models, actually.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.760
We had a customer called
Escort a couple of years back.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.660
They were selling
these phone radars.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.210
And it will tell Jeff
or Ryan that there's

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.720
a police radar right up front
of you-- like, slow down.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.140
What we have
figured out is there

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.450
is a business model around it.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.080
If we can capture the data,
put it on our private cloud,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.529
and sell it as a subscription
to all the Escort owners,

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:20.320
they'll pay for it.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.480
This is much before Waze.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.280
This was four years before Waze.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.940
So we actually helped customers.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.870
Now we are working
with Varidesk.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.150
I know people use
here Varidesk, right?

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.280
It's just a standing
desk, but we are actually

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.240
helping them open up
new revenue streams.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.200
We are building a
connector office.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.794
It's not just you
and your desk, how

00:10:39.794 --> 00:10:41.960
do you work with your
colleagues who are around you.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.501
Maybe you don't want
to be disturbed,

00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:47.940
so you use a small-- we
are putting a small device

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.250
on the desk which will
tell people around,

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.720
like, don't disturb me.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.550
So we are helping them build
a connected office space.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.260
And we help them to--
we hope that they'll

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.764
realize new revenue from that.

00:10:59.764 --> 00:11:00.930
JEFF NAMNUM: That's awesome.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.500
RUPERT WHITEHEAD:
Yeah, excellent.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.249
PRADEEP NALLURI: And
with Under Armour, we

00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:06.200
actually helped them
realize $1 billion

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.220
in sales per annum using B2C.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.730
We did their entire
Under Armour apps.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:14.440
So we launched the
HealthBox in CES 2016.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.080
We were the guys
behind the software.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.414
So.

00:11:17.414 --> 00:11:18.580
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Excellent.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.160
So how do you make that
move from, well, body shop,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.850
essentially, to strategic
advisor, where, actually, it

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.730
means you have an insight
into what's really driving

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.660
the business rather than just
being, I would love to do it,

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:35.250
but my customer says they won't
pay for it or I can't, so where

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.670
you can build that level
of trust that allows you

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.060
to have that relationship
of influence that

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.912
makes the difference?

00:11:41.912 --> 00:11:43.370
JEFF NAMNUM: At
the very beginning,

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:48.550
if you're not there-- and we
were not there three years ago.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:53.600
It's changing your own mindset.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.200
When you have been a body
shop-- that's a good term.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.020
When you've been a
body shop for so long,

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.190
you get used to
being a body shop.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.660
You diagnose the
problems with the car.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.932
And you say you have a ding
here and you have a ding here,

00:12:08.932 --> 00:12:11.390
let's take them out, let's buff
'em, and let's polish this,

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.510
and let's paint it.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.760
You have to internally
either change the mindset

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.590
or hire the capacity.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.470
And until you do, that's
a tough leap to make.

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.520
But once you do, then it's
a matter of boldly going,

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.420
I think.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.660
You got to put yourself in front
of that client and say, look,

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.440
we have looked at
your numbers, we

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.130
have looked at
what you're doing,

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.360
I understand that you
want to build this app.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.240
But if you're trying
to affect this,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.240
then this is the thing that you
really should be working on.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.640
And we would love to
help you get that done.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.480
And these are the reasons
why, and these are the numbers

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.200
that we see.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.330
And it's making that transition.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:58.370
It's as much a mindset
and an internal thing

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:00.720
as it is a branding situation.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.940
RYAN BATEMAN: Yeah, I would
say as well as Jeff said,

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.580
it's a case of getting a little
bit obnoxious occasionally

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.570
and saying, hm, we
have this demonstrated

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.700
technical expertise and
experience over the years.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.152
Trust us to help you
form your strategy.

00:13:14.152 --> 00:13:15.110
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Yeah.

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.210
Excellent.

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:17.760
Do you think there's
a greater role

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.710
that Google should
or could be playing

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:23.110
in terms of educating customers
to do the right thing?

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.330
I mean, we try and
produce the documentation,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.850
we try and talk to people
at conferences, and events,

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.762
and partners, and so on.

00:13:30.762 --> 00:13:32.470
Is there a trick that
we're missing here?

00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:34.636
Is there stuff we should
be giving you, as agencies,

00:13:34.636 --> 00:13:36.790
to make you more successful?

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.040
Anything spring to mind?

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.570
PRADEEP NALLURI: Yeah, I
think you can help us a lot.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.510
The big brands
know you very well.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.940
I think you are engaging with
the big brands-- the Nikes,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.560
ESPN.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.519
I think you have a
contact with all of them.

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:50.810
But when we are working with
old economy or the smaller

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:53.510
companies, when we try
to take, for example,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.390
a wearable-- last year when
the Google wearable came out,

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.740
when we tried to
ship products on it,

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.780
first thing they question us is
how many devices were shipped,

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.650
how many people bought Google
Watch, how many people actually

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.910
are using it, what
are the monetization.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.230
Probably, you can help
reach out by publishing

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:14.470
these reports, which will
help us to sell with authority

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.150
your products which you have.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:19.912
But we go and talk to Nike,
they know about you guys.

00:14:19.912 --> 00:14:21.370
They know what you
are going to do,

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.280
because probably,
they have early access

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.570
or your guys are already
engaging with them.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.050
And you have a single point
of contact talking to them.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.150
So that helps.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.910
But for the smaller
brands, which

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:36.450
is 80% of the market,
smaller shops, or smaller

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.870
companies, old economy
companies, they have no clue.

00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:42.430
JEFF NAMNUM: Yeah.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.060
Like hell yeah.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:51.150
But in addition to that,
I would say, specifically

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:54.685
for older economy companies,
I won't go on my tirade

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:57.850
that the glass barely
matters, it just

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.370
matters because
it's in your pocket.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:05.590
But I think one piece that we
are seeing increased demand

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:11.720
for daily now-- screens.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.490
Screens on things.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.170
In particular talking
about Android.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:23.610
It is relatively ridiculous
that there are $1,000 iPads

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.020
on conference room walls.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:30.840
Really?

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.120
You have to put it
in a special box

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.200
so that nobody touches
the little button,

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:43.780
where Android can be very
easily fitted to that situation.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.480
I am surprised not to hear
more discussion around Android

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.979
for screens on things.

00:15:51.979 --> 00:15:52.770
RYAN BATEMAN: Yeah.

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.555
I would class that almost as
what I would call the CEO's

00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:58.920
phone problem, as in
the CEO has that phone,

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.400
he knows it, that's
the Glass he has.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.610
It does the thing.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:05.535
And so he wants that
on the conference wall.

00:16:05.535 --> 00:16:06.910
So going back to
your question, I

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:13.290
would say something like
general mobile education

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.410
and return on
investment for something

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.325
like the old economies.

00:16:17.325 --> 00:16:18.190
What's your avenue?

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:22.940
What can investing in an
Android and an iOS app,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.690
what can that give
you as an end result

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.870
as somebody who's a newspaper
publisher or somebody who

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.854
doesn't know that world at all?

00:16:31.854 --> 00:16:33.730
And the general
economy would help.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:35.980
Sorry, that general education
would certainly help.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.070
I think agencies in
general be able to say,

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.232
the next step is
we need to do this.

00:16:41.232 --> 00:16:42.350
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: That's
certainly something

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:43.590
we're going to try and work on.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.810
And it's really
useful [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.490
PRADEEP NALLURI: If we can get
some firsthand reports from you

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.900
directly-- like how
the product's doing,

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.776
adaptation rate, all of
that, that will help.

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.150
RUPERT WHITEHEAD:
I mean, there's

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.210
always limits about what
we can share, but yes.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:54.430
PRADEEP NALLURI: To
give you an example,

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.800
we were talking to a client
recently-- not recently,

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.290
six months back.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.840
And they actually
choose us because we

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.292
said that we will go with
Swift rather than Objective C.

00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:08.640
And how the heck do they know?

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:10.829
They're an old-economy company.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:13.839
Entire media was
reporting about Swift--

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.670
it's the highest adapted
programming language ever

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.810
in the history of mankind.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.310
All of that kind of
headlines were happening.

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.150
So I think with Google
products, they're really nice.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:24.569
They're excellent.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:27.280
But if you can get more media
coverage and more reporting,

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.770
that will help us a lot
when we go to the customers.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.120
