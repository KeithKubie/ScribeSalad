00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.620
- Despite all of our
talk about genes and DNA,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.330
which they didn't know about,

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.000
we still, as Americans,
believe strongly, I think,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.200
in that Jeffersonian belief
that environments are crucial.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.370
Well, Adams wouldn't have any of it.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.590
He said, "All men are created unequal."

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.550
He says to Jefferson,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.890
"I was in a foundling hospital in Paris.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.270
"Babies four days old,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.770
"and I could see they were all unequal.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.650
"Some were beautiful and some were ugly.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.400
"Some were smart and some were stupid.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.020
"At four days," he said,
"and that remains the same.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.840
"Education can do very
little to change that."

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.110
That's not an American view,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.580
and that separates them
more than anything.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.020
Adams believed in nature, not nurture.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.020
That is not what
Americans want to believe,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.060
or can believe.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.660
And he denied that America
was exceptional, he said,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.910
"We are just as corrupt, just as sinful,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.520
"just as vicious as every other nation.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.710
"There's no special providence

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.640
"for the United States," Adams says.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.380
Jefferson says, "No, we
are a chosen country,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.500
"and we have a special responsibility

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.580
"to bring democracy or Republicanism

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.490
"to the rest of the world."

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.140
They really divide on that,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.560
and they divided on everything else, too.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.250
Jefferson was not much for religion.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.910
He had no religious
sensibility to speak of.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.100
Adams did.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.520
Although they're both
Unitarians in their beliefs,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.354
Adams had a respect for religion

00:01:40.354 --> 00:01:44.780
that I don't think Jefferson had.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.520
So, they differ on
almost every single thing

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.880
except the rightness of
the American Revolution

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.950
and their hatred of Hamilton.
