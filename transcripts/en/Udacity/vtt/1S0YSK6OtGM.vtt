00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.410
But let's be more general. We can do this for any 2 points in the Cornet plane.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.658
So if this point is x1 y1 and this point is x2 y2, let's see if we can create a

00:00:09.658 --> 00:00:15.525
formula for the distance between them. Before we get to write an equation, I

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:20.435
want you to write an two expressions. What's an expression for this horizontal

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:26.410
distance? Write that here. And what's an expression for the vertical distance?

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.980
Write that one here.
