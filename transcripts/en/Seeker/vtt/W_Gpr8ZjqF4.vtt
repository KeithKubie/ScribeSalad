00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.700
Your body has trillions of cells in it, including
web-like neurons in our brains that help us

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.790
think, bundles of muscle cells that power
our movements, and electricity-conducting

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.160
cells in our heart that help pump blood around.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.210
But, if we rewind far back enough, they started
out from the same thing.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.730
The point where they decide what to be is
described as NOISY -- But how do they decide?!

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.619
Just like how people experiment with different
trends, and explore different types of music

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.929
when they’re young, our cells also go through
a bit of an identity crisis…

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.700
Just like how I dabbled a bit in a suburban
punk phase when I was younger, there’s a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.500
point where our cells are deciding whether
they want to be a skin or heart cell.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.490
At one point everyone was just a tiny single
cell, called a zygote or the fertilized egg.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.750
The cell, which is about as wide as a strand
of hair , then divided into a few more identical

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.030
cells, and eventually some of these cells
began to deviate from their neighbours and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.670
take on new identities.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.060
A new study probed deeper into individual
cells in mouse embryos juuust as those first

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.480
few differences start happening.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.479
This is like when the cells have been asked
what they want to be when they grow up.

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.560
At this point the activity in the cells is
described by experts as pretty “noisy”

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.740
… like the cells are throwing one last molecular
party before they commit to the . high-minded

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.150
life of a brain cell or submit to their future
in the colon.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.920
This decision point is not super clean, and
even though it’s deemed “noisy,” it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.000
isn’t actual sound…

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.619
It comes in the form of excess and seemingly
random transcription of DNA.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.729
If you think of DNA as the set of instructions
- like a lesson plan your teacher writes on

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.149
the board - each cell only copies out the
instructions that are specifically relevant

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:37.460
to its functions.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.020
For example, a light sensing cell in the eye
would copy parts of DNA that instructs it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.789
how to make proteins that can sense light,
whereas a blood cell wouldn’t need those

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:47.789
genes.

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.079
Normally, each cell type has a characteristic
pattern of gene expression, but during the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.619
noisy time all the cells are filled with random
bits of RNA, like a big mixer.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.040
Then, they settle down and pick just the genes
they’ll end up needing.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.570
Understanding this process has been a long
time coming.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.719
Scientists have been speculating that cells
might have this noisy time for a while, but

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.550
it’s been difficult to observe experimentally
until recently.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.620
Since cells are soo small and contain millions
of bits of information, it was difficult to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.680
get enough material from one cell so we just
sampled them by the handful … but this means

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.370
we missed the subtle patterns and individual
differences between cells.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.650
Now, a new technique called ‘single cell
RNA sequencing’ let’s scientists read

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.490
out which parts of DNA are actually getting
copied to be used by INDIVIDUAL CELLS.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.970
It’s like we’re reading their little minds
and seeing what they want to be!

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.750
Based on this new information, its thought
this bursting of transcriptional noise gets

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.000
the cells ready to receive different instructive
cues from their surroundings, but there might

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.550
be other hidden signals in the noise we haven’t
quite made out yet.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.510
More research is needed, but thanks to these
more sensitive techniques, scientists are

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.340
discovering new subtypes of cells every day,
and slowly getting a better understanding

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.820
of the road from fertilized egg, to the trillion-celled
masterpieces we are today…

If you want more examples of cells partying,
check out Julian’s video here about how

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.450
blood-brain barrier is like a bouncer.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.370
One last bit: Noisy bursts were observed twice
in mouse development: once at the first cell

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.420
fate decision when 32 cells decide to be an
embryo or support structures, and again 3

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.900
days later as they specialize further.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.940
Thanks for watching!
