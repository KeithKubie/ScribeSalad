1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,410
Right, that means something. Right.
That's, that's impressive to me.

2
00:00:03,411 --> 00:00:04,550
I think that's really impressive.

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,980
There are a lot of performers
who are not good performance.

4
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:10,850
They start out not as good performance
and they need the people to believe in

5
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:14,960
them in order to get away with a
trickery. Right. And they never lose that.

6
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:17,150
They always want people to
believe it's a trigger. And when,

7
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:21,380
so when I started coming out and I started
saying, Hey, it's magic, it's verbal,

8
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:22,560
it's nonverbal communications,

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,370
all this stuff mixed together to
create a show on not a psychic.

10
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:27,650
There is absolutely nothing
psychic about what I do.

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,280
There were quite a few mentalist
in the mentalism field back then.

12
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,550
There wasn't as many as they
are now who were upset with me.

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,710
Dunkin said if you are assigned take man,

14
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:40,790
the best way to hide it is say you're
not assigned like right. Yeah. No,

15
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,450
that would be true except it's not
the case. So what's up with the nails?

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,950
I don't know cause we're
two hours in here. Maria,

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,260
tell me what's up with these nails.
Yeah, take a nail. Okay. All right.

18
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,600
All right. So this is what
I want you to do. I just,

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,290
you're going to have to
describe what's happening. Okay.

20
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,080
So this is one of the very first
things I started doing. Joe,

21
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,670
is this like the nail,

22
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:01,640
I want you to look at the nail and nail
and I want you to watch what happens.

23
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:04,760
Okay. I'm watching what happens.
Oh my God, you're bending it.

24
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:09,410
This is incredible. You're Ben. As you
can see, the nail is actually slowly,

25
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,030
slowly bending out ranges. I look
at, he's shaking your hand too.

26
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,470
Yeah. Showing your powers. And the
thing about that, take a look at it.

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,280
It's not a trick nail. It's
nothing like that. I mean,

28
00:01:19,281 --> 00:01:23,150
everything I use from silverware to forks
to anything that I do is a actual like

29
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:26,570
this and slowly do that. Nah,
that's it's uh, yeah, no,

30
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:28,040
but I'll straighten it out
again. I was at the VA,

31
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,920
I was at the very end right there like
that. Oh, I can't, I can't do that.

32
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:35,150
So here, hold on. You got
another one maybe? Yeah,

33
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,260
I'm gonna say, yeah, let's keep it got
some forks. Yeah, I got some forks. Okay.

34
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,910
So I want you, I want you to point to
a fork. Anyone? Um, how about this one?

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,430
Do you want it or you want me to have
that one? Uh, I'll take that one.

36
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,400
You'll take it. All right.
So, so you've heard of people,

37
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,390
we've talked about people actually
bending silverware, right?

38
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,500
Can I have that pen that said? Wow.
That one. You know, you can't. Yeah,

39
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,210
I don't know. That's the one I want.
I'm getting you to do something.

40
00:01:56,211 --> 00:02:00,410
I this one, just give me them fucking for
the time. This, I know what you doing.

41
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,700
Give me that fork. Yeah, you got a fork.
They'll take a whole shit for it. No,

42
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,010
you can have that fork.
Joe. Let's take your fork.

43
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,430
Joe. Trying to get this floor to
Ben. You know, watching, um, yeah,

44
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:17,800
this was year four. Incredible. Trying
to get this one. The could have burned.

45
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,643
[inaudible]

46
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,200
what kind of techniques are you
using, sir? There's a check.

47
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,470
Tell me and I'll trick forks. Well,
we're going to eat with these prompts.

48
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:31,190
Those are those actually
100% genuine forks. Um,

49
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,550
but you can't tell me how you're
doing it. It's slight of hand.

50
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,340
That's as much as I can tell you.
Okay. Let me do it. Do it again.

51
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:40,400
So I would watch some more time. You
want to watch one more time? Okay.

52
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,730
I was hoping I had like a bullshit
fake fork. No, not really. Are legit.

53
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,060
If I was sitting with you, I'll
show you it. It's actually, no,

54
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:54,230
it's easier if I'm sitting with you.
So let's do here. People can tell, huh?

55
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,080
Yup. So what's this one? Ready? Here
we go. Watch it. Right. Watch. Okay,

56
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,950
so I'm going to shake it like right.

57
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:06,040
You know what? Let's do it this way.
Can you, is it a way, can I move this?

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,260
Yeah. Yeah. So hold both hands out
like this. Okay. And I'm just going to,

59
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,991
I'm going to hold it right there.

60
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,810
I want you to hold that in and hold that
in for me. I'm gonna have to make a,

61
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,070
what do you want me to do? Hold
this end as well. Okay. With that.

62
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,220
And I'm going to hold it right
in the center. Right there. Okay.

63
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,840
You're rubbing it. Watch, Oh, you're
heating it up. Wait, wait. Don't, don't,

64
00:03:24,841 --> 00:03:28,410
don't, don't, don't force it.
Don't force it. Just hold it. Okay.

65
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,100
Can you feel that? Yeah. Because it's a
different kind of metal. No, it's not.

66
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,461
Yeah.

67
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:37,230
You're using some sort of fake
ass metal and now it's hard again.

68
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,240
Right? Because you're heating it up,
right? Is that what it is? No. What?

69
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm going to actually get this one a
break. Hmm. But I'm gonna look now chill.

70
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,240
Wow. Right? Because it's some bullshit
ass metal. I promise you it's not.

71
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,860
I have DVDs out that teach
magicians how to do this. Of course,

72
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,070
you gotta be a magician. Know where to
get it. And it uses any fork anywhere.

73
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:04,090
Anytime. Promise you.

74
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,190
But I got mine to bend now.
Yeah. Good luck bending it

75
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,540
this way. If they were
made out of special metal,

76
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,300
I would never let you keep them
because they would be too expensive.

77
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:19,840
But this one's going to twist all the
way around and that one's not made as

78
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:23,950
special metal. It's a regular metal. Hold
on. I've got to concentrate. Yo, dude,

79
00:04:23,951 --> 00:04:27,490
are you psychic for real? Yeah.
What kind of wizardry is that, sir?

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,120
He spun this around and turned into a not,

81
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,810
the thing is he's not going to tell you
how he does it. That's the real problem.

82
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,300
No, you're telling me that it's bullshit,

83
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:41,260
but you won't tell me how you're doing
this bullshit. It's very unfortunate.

84
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,170
What? There's different techniques.
That's the thing, right? I mean,

85
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,240
and I really hope you can come see a show.

86
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,330
Sometimes I do things like one
person, another person feels it.

87
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,870
I tell people to donate like name and
number, you know any number at all. Okay,

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,490
go ahead. 13. Okay.

89
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:58,090
And that would be a common number for a
lot of people to choose. Sure. You know,

90
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,380
there were specific words, if I said
to you, think of a number of name,

91
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,530
any word with seven letters or
less. Go ahead. Okay, go ahead. Cut.

92
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,050
Of course. Most people wouldn't.

93
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,510
Most people were not a common
word. No, that's not a common word.

94
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,310
I'd know most people are choosing
love or how something like that.

95
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,630
And kinda along those lines, uh, you
know, a dog or cat, a really common ones.

96
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,400
Um, but, but here's, here's the
interesting thing. Okay. Okay.

97
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,520
So inside this wallet, did you give up
on the word? Because I'd chosen her.

98
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,640
There was no, no. Yeah, inside
this wallet. I put it in, see,

99
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:37,210
I was driving while I was driving
all around it. Right, right.

100
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,370
And someone cut you off and
you know what doodling is?

101
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,980
Doodling is when you kind of
scribble without even looking.

102
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,670
And as you notice inside the hair, you
open it up. Tell me what's on there.

103
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,410
So you know, I didn't want to
touch it. What does it say?

104
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,950
It's hard to read. Yeah, it's
my handwriting and doodling.

105
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,860
Does it say 13 and can't?
Yeah, it does. Let me see.

106
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,270
Oh shit. Hmm. Well,

107
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,900
it's such bad handwriting that I got to
think that you wrote that underneath the

108
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,380
table. It is definitely a 13 right?
[inaudible] yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,180
I wrote it under the table
while we're doing this.

110
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:17,450
How would it end up inside the wallet?
Cause you just shoved it in there. Oh,

111
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:22,370
this is, try this. What's that
one? All right, we'll try this.

112
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,710
I can't promise I'm going to be
able to do okay. You know what?

113
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:28,510
I got both of you in here. Let's
do this. What am we do? All right.

114
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,660
I just got a bunch of cards on
second deck of cards. All right.

115
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,880
That is crazy though, to have 13 and
cunt written on the piece of paper.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,420
I'm gonna wash your hands closer. I'm
going to fan of cards out, Joe. Okay.

117
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,380
I'm not going to actually have
you pick one up. I am in sort of,

118
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,810
I'm going to find it. I'm not good at
fanning cause I'm not a magician. Right.

119
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,910
I'm gonna show you the cards. You're not
a magician. I'm a mentalist. Oh, watch.

120
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,980
I'm going to found the cards out.

121
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:55,160
I want you to think of any card you
see any card. I say you get one. Okay.

122
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,110
You see it? Yes. Did you get a red card?
Excuse me? Did you get a red card? Yes.

123
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,660
Good. Did she got a red card? And we
do. Same with you across the table.

124
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,630
I want you to think of any card to get a
black card. Okay. Do you get one? Yeah.

125
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,351
All right.

126
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:11,470
I'm gonna ask one question cause I have
to ask questions sometimes to try to

127
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:13,720
figure out exactly what it
is you're thinking. Okay.

128
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,280
Did either one of you
choose a high card? Yes. No.

129
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,600
Okay. High cards are hard for me to get,
but I will try. All right. Look at me.

130
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,510
Don't dump down so you got a red card.

131
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,760
I'm going to say your
card is probably hearts.

132
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,570
Your card over there. Jamie is black. Yes.

133
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,940
Probably spades.

134
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,703
Nailed it.

135
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,110
The two, two of spades.

136
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:43,763
Yes.

137
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,820
Hearts, King hearts. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, let me see that deck of cards.

138
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,890
We only had three choices. Yeah.

139
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,640
I had a queen of spades and eight of
spades and a two of spades and I switched

140
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,160
from the queen of sprays. Before you
asked that question, high or low?

141
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,670
I went low. You went low. You went
low. Yeah. Why did you do that?

142
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,900
Because I thought it was [inaudible]
mind. Fuck he mind fucked.

143
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:08,540
You thought I was going to go high.
There's a lot of these kinds of things.

144
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,200
It's verbal, nonverbal. It's magical.

145
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,160
Psychology is a mixture of all kinds of
different things. Twisted up a spoon.

146
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,100
It son that shouldn't, yeah.
I don't know how you did that.

147
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,920
I definitely want you to come. We go to
the magic castle tonight, by the way,

148
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,220
are you? Yeah. You're welcome to call
me if I can go to the comedy store.

149
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,380
Oh yeah, you're working.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm working.

150
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,230
What time you work in there rather
come and see you so I'm not working.

151
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,900
You're not? Nah. Going to go
ahead and see some friends.

152
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,990
Like my friend of my scrubs is actually
a good friend of mine, Steve Valentine.

153
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,210
I don't know if you know
Steve as an actor. No,

154
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,790
I don't really graves' and
crossing Jordan, stuff like that.

155
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:41,090
And he's got an interesting story about
his life and it's not the psychological

156
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:41,661
thing as well,

157
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:45,680
which I'm always fascinated with of
where he was performing magic for years,

158
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,450
constantly performing magic and um,

159
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,690
he wanted to be an actor and the magic
was kind of a side thing for him,

160
00:08:50,691 --> 00:08:53,990
but it started getting away. He'd go
on interviews and stuff and they say,

161
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,150
you know, I want you, that
guy that does kit shows,

162
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,330
I want you to do a party for me and so
forth. And he could never get the part.

163
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,870
So he started denying
that he was a magician.

164
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
I just totally left magic
completely. And people say, yeah,

165
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:09,660
I got your business card. No, that's
not me. That wasn't me. Oh wow.

166
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,240
That's when he started to be on how to
act and he started getting the acting

167
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,021
jobs and everything.

168
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:17,670
It wasn't until years later that he
could go back and be a performer. Wow.

169
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,170
And it's a really interesting story,

170
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:21,990
but he does it with magic and
teaching and things and yeah.

171
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,310
Do you ever work on comedy and magic
in her Masa? Nah. No. I never have. No.

172
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:29,610
Yeah, it's interesting cause he
mixes comedy and magic together.

173
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,410
Like you'll have like a magician
on the show with comedians.

174
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,010
There was a few of those back in the
days that I worked where it was comedy

175
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:38,670
magic club type thing. So
yeah, it's a good nights.

176
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,440
Do you ever teach this stuff? I
teach to other magicians. I have,

177
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:46,530
so have to be like, I have videos
and stuff. I have books. Uh,

178
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,870
so I definitely do teach, but I don't
teach one on one. I never teach.

179
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:51,270
I just don't have time
to teach you one on one.

180
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:54,360
I'm always so busy working and
trying to teach like this stuff.

181
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:58,020
Like how do you do these things? The
metal bending, I have DVDs out on that.

182
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,780
The teach magicians how to do
that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:03,950
And I promise you they are not trick
forks. Those, they're not trick nails,

184
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,460
not trick forks. They are. Yeah.

185
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,560
Well just the fact that you could spin
a regular fork, right? This, Oh fuck.

186
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:11,370
Are you doing that man?

187
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,050
There was a way it sorta became
the Holy grail for me when a,

188
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,620
I can tell you how that came about for me.

189
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,740
There was muscle walkie I told you that
he could actually put it under a chair

190
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:21,330
and he would put it in
something and twist it.

191
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,570
I was doing an article
for the national Inquirer.

192
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,730
I don't even think I could
do that with just my hands.

193
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,670
And that's what's confused. And the guy
shows up. You? Yeah, there is a way.

194
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,490
And the guy shows up, a photographer
shows up from me and he says,

195
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:36,840
I want you to bend some silverware. So
you know, I go, Oh, you know, and I,

196
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,990
you know, I go to him, you
know, and I go, okay, all right,

197
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,980
I'm going to bend something.

198
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:45,090
So I take one and I go like this and
next thing you know it's bending up like

199
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:47,700
that. And then I do another
bend for him. He says,

200
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:50,910
this is going to take a while, isn't
it? I go, well, yeah, you know, he says,

201
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,860
just bend them up with your
hands. I go, well that's cheating,

202
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,740
which exactly what I was doing, you
know? So I say these, that's cheating.

203
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,620
So he says, no, go ahead. So just start
bending them up like crazy, crazy.

204
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,311
And next thing you know,

205
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:02,850
I had a twist and I remembered
exactly how I got that twist.

206
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,080
So I called Randy up on the phone because
it was sort of the Holy grail thing,

207
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:08,550
looking for a way to actually do it.

208
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:11,880
And I went in there and I had one of
those telephones that had the long cord,

209
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,110
you know, all the way into the bathroom.

210
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:15,060
And I called Randy up and I'm
whispering now and say, Hey,

211
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:17,480
I just bet a four with them, you
know, with my hands, you know,

212
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,490
just put a twist in it. And he goes,
yeah, so what? I go, no, no, no.

213
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,800
And I explained exactly how to do it.

214
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:26,250
And now all the mentalists
use that technique. Yeah.

215
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,200
So this was a regular fork. Yes.

216
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,760
And you twisted that right in front
of my face with one. Yes. Yup. Hmm.

217
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,420
Oh, how the fuck you did it.
You're not supposed to know.

218
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,200
He's supposed to enjoy the
mystery, Joe. All right,

219
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,730
well I'm trying know that you can
be fulled. It's very confusing.

220
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,250
I can be fooled so easily
because this is a real fork.

221
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,570
I know that there's a certain forks
that they make out of shitty metal.

222
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,380
It's like a knee, heat it up and
it becomes like super bendy. Yeah.

223
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:57,010
That's something that's, I don't want to
get too much into methods and so forth,

224
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:59,770
but that's definitely not something
I use or would use and yeah,

225
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,470
and that looks just a little
weird. Yeah. But yeah,

226
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,530
it looks like jerking off before,

227
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,300
but I'm trying to get a dyno monic
ejaculation that may or may not do it.

228
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,560
The thing about was weird is that how
easy that fork bent when I bend it,

229
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,090
when you had it, it was very strange.
The one that bent really easy.

230
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,190
When I bend it and you said,
are you doing it on your own?

231
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,070
It was so easy to bend, right? Like why
would it, why was it so easy to bend?

232
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:27,070
And I'm can't tell you why at
that moment, but if you look now,

233
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,420
that's that fork right there.

234
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,250
And take a look at it and
see if it's easy to bend.

235
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,770
Now you'll see that it's not
going to heat in as fuck her up.

236
00:12:32,771 --> 00:12:34,840
I'm going to make it easy, but
it's because at that moment,

237
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:37,360
that's the one that I was going to
break. I wanted to break that one.

238
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,280
It's very confusing. Yeah, it's
a job. Well, it's amazing really,

239
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,860
because you'll let people
actually touch the things.

240
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,920
And someone like me who knows
that you're doing a trick,

241
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,800
cause you just told me that you're doing
a trick and yet I still can't figure

242
00:12:50,801 --> 00:12:52,480
out how to fucking do it. You see me work,

243
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,570
you'll see I throw everything across the
stage and a lot of stuff I just leave

244
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:58,510
for people afterwards because I want
them to interact with those things I want

245
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,090
them to take them home with.
Yeah, yeah. No, I can imagine.

246
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,130
Especially the forks. Yeah. After
awhile, you know, that's just,

247
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,000
he just sat. I mean you just sit
and look at this fork afterwards.

248
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:12,850
You look okay. I don't
think I could do that. Yeah.

249
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,360
I mean if I just gave you a regular
fork, Jamie, do you think you'd do that?

250
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,780
Spin that? No, I don't think I
could twist that thing like that.

251
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,330
We remember when we're
talking about the TV show,

252
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,050
we're talking about the TV
show earlier, the areas.

253
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,070
I have a pitch that's out
right now for a series,

254
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,960
which it looks like you
may be going somewhere.

255
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,250
So I don't want to say too much about it,

256
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,390
but it's bringing back the million dollar
challenge and it's going out to James,

257
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,800
Randy, James,

258
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,320
Randy million-dollar challenge and
used to go out looking for psychics,

259
00:13:38,321 --> 00:13:41,500
testing them on a proper controls.
If they're trying to trick us,

260
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:42,970
maybe I'll expose it in methods.

261
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,270
I will demonstrate my abilities supposedly
to do the exact same thing under

262
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:53,260
certain conditions as well and it's sort
of what makes me the expert to go out

263
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:56,050
and try to find these things and see
what's really going on and it's sort of

264
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,800
brain games Meech meets the
bunking meets psychic phenomena,

265
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,900
but not every single one is
going to be debunking either.

266
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,440
It's only going to be really debunking
when somebody is purposefully going out

267
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,150
and trying to bullshit
somebody and trying to fall.

268
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:11,650
People will take advantage of
people. It's very baffling stuff.

269
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:12,940
The the, I mean the, the,

270
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,060
the stuff about talking to people and ask
them questions and reading their cues.

271
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,250
That kind of makes sense. But
this doesn't make sense at all.

272
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,910
The fork stuff just does not make sense.

273
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,680
It's really weird because the PK
stuff is something as a mentalist,

274
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:29,440
as a performer, you tend to pick
your powers, right? You tend to,

275
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,770
well you wouldn't because you don't,
you know, but as performance ourselves,

276
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,990
when we perform this type
of stuff, we go, okay,

277
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:38,890
does that fit sort of in the repertoire
of my abilities? Do I have x-ray vision?

278
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:41,920
You know, I drive cars blindfolded,
you know, it put DOE in there,

279
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:42,820
they put tape over,

280
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:45,190
they at least see me do something
along those times on your show.

281
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,230
And it says thing of like,

282
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,890
you pick your abilities and this doesn't
seem to fit with anything except that

283
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,240
your Yella did do this.

284
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:56,900
And also said that it could duplicate
pictures and read minds once in a while as

285
00:14:56,901 --> 00:14:59,600
well. I didn't do too much of the minor
eating, but did a little bit of it.

286
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,800
Somebody would draw a picture,

287
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,410
then he would draw a picture
and they would match. So,

288
00:15:03,411 --> 00:15:05,990
which is a standard
mentalism magic trick anyway,

289
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,230
but his methods were a little bit
more bold, a little bit more direct.

290
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:14,510
[inaudible] yeah. I'm still
baffled, stopped being baffled.

291
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,480
How can I not be bent
some forks, man. Maybe.

292
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,480
Maybe someday I'll teach you how to do
all this and I'll tell everybody no,

293
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,970
they did not want that. I won't tell
you. Don't tell them. I can't tell you.

294
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:26,940
You can't tell me cause I'll
fucking tell everybody. Yeah.

295
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,160
But then nobody's going to be impressed
when you do it. Well, I don't care.

296
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,760
Yeah. I just want everybody to know.

297
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,840
Is there anything else that you
can do that's fucked up? Ah,

298
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:38,420
I didn't really bring a whole lot cause
I've kind of just wanted to talk more

299
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:42,860
than anything else. Um, I mean we've
done enough. It's very, very impressive.

300
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,820
Maybe I can do one thing for
you. Okay. I don't know. Um,

301
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,700
all right. So see these, you
know what they are, right? No,

302
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,160
they're the Zener cards. Basically.

303
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:59,600
The [inaudible] shapes basically
five shapes that were, um,

304
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,320
they were used at Stanford research
Institute. Uh, I took university,

305
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:07,050
actually not Stanford, Duke university.
They accredited by [inaudible]. Uh,

306
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,810
simple shapes. Uh, there's a
square, there's a star wavy lines,

307
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:12,860
a plus in a circle. All right. These
are the standard shapes right there.

308
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,600
I'm going to try to get you to choose
a specific one. Now, psychologically,

309
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,360
if I asked you to choose one,
which, which would you say like,

310
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,900
I mean we shouldn't even say
psychological [inaudible] that would be

311
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:26,400
psychological because it's right in
the middle and that would be the one.

312
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,220
All right, so I'm going to go with,
um, yeah, I'm going to go with a star.

313
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:35,840
I think star, there's a circle. There's
a square, a the plus in the wavy lines,

314
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:38,300
right? I'm going to mix them up so you
don't know which is which. Alrighty.

315
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,940
I'm going to have to look at them in
just a second myself to make sure I know

316
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:43,700
exactly where that is. All right.

317
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,720
We can do this as the gambling thing
or not, but I don't like to do that.

318
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,610
I should probably rip people off strong.
Right? Put that in the right place.

319
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,680
Okay, good. So this is
what we're going to do.

320
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,210
I'm going to take cars
and I'm going to ask you,

321
00:16:56,211 --> 00:17:00,800
do you think the star is that card you,
all you have to do is not choose a star.

322
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,830
You're going to choose a star. You
won't know why you choose a star,

323
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,320
but you will choose the
star. All right? Okay.

324
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,010
You won't have Aegis will and
it's going to be something I do.

325
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:12,650
Something I say or something that it's
going to be something that I'm going to

326
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:15,860
try it. I just made this make me pick
the star. This may or may not work.

327
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,520
All right, but we're going to try. I
see sneaky pastor, do you think this is,

328
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,660
do you think I'm going to say yes? That's
the star. You say yes, that's a star.

329
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:26,720
You'll see. Okay, so
you're supposed to say no,

330
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:28,590
that's not the star at
some point because you,

331
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,180
your idea is not to pick the star. I
want you to not pick the store to anyone,

332
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,380
so if you think that's the
star. All right, I will. Okay,

333
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:40,050
so you're just going to say, do you
understand? Yes. All right, so here we go.

334
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,870
I know you're watching me close. All
right, so let's do it again. Hold on.

335
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,020
We already flipped them around.
It makes them up. One more time.

336
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,770
There's this sneaky hand movements
are still confusing. Watch. Okay.

337
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:50,500
No take time. Moments to makes me sad.

338
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,890
He spent so much time learning
how to move your hands like that.

339
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,330
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep it
simple. Really simple for you. Okay.

340
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,750
By my opinion. Yeah.

341
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,360
Well I've cut it already so cause I
want to do it again because I'm going to

342
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:03,680
make, make it very vague. Right.

343
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:08,610
Your job is to not choose the star
K not choose the star. Okay. Ready?

344
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,380
All right. So, um, um, I guess I'll
just ask you, do you want this card? No.

345
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,290
All right. So you don't want
that one. Don't want that one.

346
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,770
Do you want that card right?
Like don't choose a star.

347
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,750
Yes, I want that one. You sure
that's the one you want? Yeah,

348
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,830
that's the one I want. Don't look
okay. I won't look that. Look.

349
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:32,570
I don't trust you. Watch my hand.
Don't look, don't look okay.

350
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,110
I see what you didn't choose.
You didn't choose a circle,

351
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,580
right as she was a plus that didn't,

352
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:40,600
she was [inaudible] the wavy lines or
the square. He chose a star. They look

353
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,470
sound of a bitch. Yeah. Yeah, but
that's like slight of hand, right?

354
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,490
Huh? Huh? Well, what the hell is that?
Watch. What are you talking about?

355
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,560
Slight of hand. I can try. I can
try it one more time. Hold on. Okay.

356
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,910
To put it there. All right.

357
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,990
I hate doing this stuff like this because
especially with the amount of people

358
00:19:04,991 --> 00:19:07,270
that are listening to this
podcast, right? What happens?

359
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,360
[inaudible] I'll manage if I'm
wrong. I looked like an idiot.

360
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,900
If you're wrong as a performer.
Yeah. Somehow or another.

361
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:16,450
I think you're not going to be
wrong. I could be. So once again,

362
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,150
I'm going to try and make you
choose a star, okay? Okay.

363
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,940
Your job is to not use it. Okay. I'm
not going to do it again after this.

364
00:19:21,941 --> 00:19:25,990
This is the last time we doing this.
All right. Do you want that card? Yes.

365
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,750
That's the one you want. That's
the one I want. I keep in mind.

366
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:34,920
You did that the first time.
Yeah, right. Don't look,

367
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,860
I don't want look square.
Circle plus wavy lines.

368
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,480
Take look. Dammit.

369
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,670
The story now, do you, um,

370
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,760
realize that I'm impulsive
and that I have no patience?

371
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,420
I did all that for the star
immediately did it the first time. See,

372
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,760
you thought that by doing it again,

373
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,670
that I would not think that
you would do it a second time.

374
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,910
Is that what you did is that's how
you sort of kind of, not what I did.

375
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,190
I was not going to tell him. So now he's
getting frustrated, right? No, no, no.

376
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:10,650
I'm very impressed. I'm very
impressed. Well, listen, man,

377
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,200
this was a lot of fun. It was.
