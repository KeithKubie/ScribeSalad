00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, now we know that 3 colorability is NP hard.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If I give you a general graph and say--can you assign colors to these nodes, at most three colors

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to these nodes so that no two nodes that are connected have the same color.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Answering that yes or no for all possible graphs is probably computationally intractable.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's as hard as any problem in NP. What is that tell us about 4 colorability.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So I want you to check all the things that are true because we know that 3 colorability is an NP,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
then 4 colorability is an NP because we can quickly verify a certificate that list the color assignments.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So is it true that 4 colorability is an NP for this reason.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's not necessarily an NP because the number of colors is bigger than in the 3 colorability case.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Is is the case that it is not necessarily NP hard

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
because having four colors to work with makes things easier.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So just because something is hard to color with three colors,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it could be quite easy to color with four colors.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Next, no, no--it is NP hard because the solution to 4 colorability also solves 3 colorability

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and the reason for that is we can just add another node to the graph,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
connect it to all the other ones and then try to color that graph, and then finally, since any graph

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that is 3 colorable is 4 colorable, the problems are basically equivalent, so it's the same.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So check all that apply. There are two of them that apply.
