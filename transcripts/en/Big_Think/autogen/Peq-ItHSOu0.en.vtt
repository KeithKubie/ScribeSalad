00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.440
 
I was mentioning this one possibility

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450
I was mentioning this one possibility
 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.460
I was mentioning this one possibility
that we are living on a

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470
that we are living on a
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.940
that we are living on a
three-dimensional surface but that there

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950
three-dimensional surface but that there
 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.400
three-dimensional surface but that there
are other dimensions out there and in

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
are other dimensions out there and in
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.509
are other dimensions out there and in
string theory you would need ten

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519
string theory you would need ten
 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.170
string theory you would need ten
dimensions and it's possible there's a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
dimensions and it's possible there's a
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.460
dimensions and it's possible there's a
number different possibilities one is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
number different possibilities one is
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.620
number different possibilities one is
that and at every point in this room

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
that and at every point in this room
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.890
that and at every point in this room
there's a tiny curled up dimension that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900
there's a tiny curled up dimension that
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.990
there's a tiny curled up dimension that
we don't know about because nothing that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
we don't know about because nothing that
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.210
we don't know about because nothing that
we that we can't go in there it's too

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220
we that we can't go in there it's too
 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.669
we that we can't go in there it's too
tiny and nothing we know about can fit

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
tiny and nothing we know about can fit
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.470
tiny and nothing we know about can fit
in there either maybe gravity can

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
in there either maybe gravity can
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.960
in there either maybe gravity can
communicate through these additional

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970
communicate through these additional
 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.910
communicate through these additional
curled-up dimensions that's one

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920
curled-up dimensions that's one
 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.400
curled-up dimensions that's one
possibility the other possibility is

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
possibility the other possibility is
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.590
possibility the other possibility is
that the other one of the other

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
that the other one of the other
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.850
that the other one of the other
dimensions or more of them could be

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
dimensions or more of them could be
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.730
dimensions or more of them could be
large and cut off at the other end by

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:46.740
large and cut off at the other end by
 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.040
large and cut off at the other end by
another kind of another brain similar to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
another kind of another brain similar to
 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.620
another kind of another brain similar to
ours so people wonder well what is the

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630
ours so people wonder well what is the
 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.750
ours so people wonder well what is the
effect of the of the matter is there

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760
effect of the of the matter is there
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.640
effect of the of the matter is there
some kind of dark matter on that other

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650
some kind of dark matter on that other
 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.680
some kind of dark matter on that other
brain and that's actually what we're

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
brain and that's actually what we're
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.770
brain and that's actually what we're
seeing when we look at galaxies or is

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
seeing when we look at galaxies or is
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.650
seeing when we look at galaxies or is
there when when the accelerator at CERN

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660
there when when the accelerator at CERN
 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.730
there when when the accelerator at CERN
the LHC when they're taking data are

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740
the LHC when they're taking data are
 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469
the LHC when they're taking data are
they going to see missing energy that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479
they going to see missing energy that
 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.980
they going to see missing energy that
leaks out into the extra dimensions this

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
leaks out into the extra dimensions this
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.020
leaks out into the extra dimensions this
again would require saw the exact extra

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030
again would require saw the exact extra
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.459
again would require saw the exact extra
dimensions to be somewhat larger in

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469
dimensions to be somewhat larger in
 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:17.959
dimensions to be somewhat larger in
order for that to happen but it is

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969
order for that to happen but it is
 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.789
order for that to happen but it is
certainly possible oh another project

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
certainly possible oh another project
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.529
certainly possible oh another project
that I worked on this one was a lot of

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539
that I worked on this one was a lot of
 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.319
that I worked on this one was a lot of
fun if we're living on this on a

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329
fun if we're living on this on a
 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.440
fun if we're living on this on a
three-dimensional surface like that and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450
three-dimensional surface like that and
 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.590
three-dimensional surface like that and
it's possible for some gravitational

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600
it's possible for some gravitational
 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.539
it's possible for some gravitational
signal or I don't know what kind of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549
signal or I don't know what kind of
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.630
signal or I don't know what kind of
signals something to leave our brain go

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
signals something to leave our brain go
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.130
signals something to leave our brain go
into the extra dimensions and then come

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
into the extra dimensions and then come
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.620
into the extra dimensions and then come
back in the in the distant future and if

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
back in the in the distant future and if
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.569
back in the in the distant future and if
the shapes are right so imagine imagine

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
the shapes are right so imagine imagine
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.840
the shapes are right so imagine imagine
our brain is curved and the extra

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
our brain is curved and the extra
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.719
our brain is curved and the extra
dimension so I guess I'll try to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
dimension so I guess I'll try to
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.700
dimension so I guess I'll try to
illustrate this so our brain is like

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
illustrate this so our brain is like
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.969
illustrate this so our brain is like
this and in the extra dimensions you can

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979
this and in the extra dimensions you can
 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.309
this and in the extra dimensions you can
cut it off bye-bye you can do a shortcut

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319
cut it off bye-bye you can do a shortcut
 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.940
cut it off bye-bye you can do a shortcut
path by cutting across then you could

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
path by cutting across then you could
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.440
path by cutting across then you could
communicate information in a way that

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
communicate information in a way that
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.940
communicate information in a way that
looks like it's faster than the speed of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
looks like it's faster than the speed of
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.300
looks like it's faster than the speed of
light so that would be fun

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310
 
 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.880
 
it is a spatial I am thinking in terms

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890
it is a spatial I am thinking in terms
 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.760
it is a spatial I am thinking in terms
of spatial extra dimensions so not time

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770
of spatial extra dimensions so not time
 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.680
of spatial extra dimensions so not time
there are some models where you have

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690
there are some models where you have
 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.180
there are some models where you have
additional time dimensions but what I'm

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190
additional time dimensions but what I'm
 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.949
additional time dimensions but what I'm
talking about now you still have the

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959
talking about now you still have the
 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.410
talking about now you still have the
single time dimension but the so and we

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420
single time dimension but the so and we
 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.720
single time dimension but the so and we
have here you know the you move to the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730
have here you know the you move to the
 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.000
have here you know the you move to the
right you move up you move the three

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
right you move up you move the three
 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.460
right you move up you move the three
dimensions that we're used to and

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470
dimensions that we're used to and
 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.750
dimensions that we're used to and
probably you could just keep going on

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760
probably you could just keep going on
 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.229
probably you could just keep going on
infinitely in any of those directions

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239
infinitely in any of those directions
 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.210
infinitely in any of those directions
whereas the other dimensions I'm talking

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
whereas the other dimensions I'm talking
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.490
whereas the other dimensions I'm talking
about like I said they're if they're

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500
about like I said they're if they're
 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.479
about like I said they're if they're
small then so where I'm sitting right

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489
small then so where I'm sitting right
 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.940
small then so where I'm sitting right
now I could move in the X direction I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950
now I could move in the X direction I
 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.380
now I could move in the X direction I
could move forward I could move in the Y

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390
could move forward I could move in the Y
 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.880
could move forward I could move in the Y
direction I could move to the right I

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890
direction I could move to the right I
 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.259
direction I could move to the right I
could move in the Z direction I could

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269
could move in the Z direction I could
 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.570
could move in the Z direction I could
move up but I cannot move in this other

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580
move up but I cannot move in this other
 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.670
move up but I cannot move in this other
direction because I'm too big so these

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680
direction because I'm too big so these
 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920
direction because I'm too big so these
other directions are there like curled

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930
other directions are there like curled
 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.890
other directions are there like curled
up little circles and they're just

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900
up little circles and they're just
 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.650
up little circles and they're just
really tiny that's that's one in one

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660
really tiny that's that's one in one
 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.110
really tiny that's that's one in one
possibility
