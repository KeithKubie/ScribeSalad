00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here is the answer. The structure is exactly the same.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's the union of these two sets.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The difference is that with a compiler the calling convention

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is pattern gets called with the text as argument.

00:00:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
In the interpreter the calling convention is matchset calls with the pattern and the text.
