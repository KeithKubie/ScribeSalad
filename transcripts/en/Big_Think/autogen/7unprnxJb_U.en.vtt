and and I don't know if that really

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670
and and I don't know if that really
 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.310
and and I don't know if that really
means being a visionary but it certainly

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320
means being a visionary but it certainly
 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.290

right what we have found and leadership
 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.030
right what we have found and leadership
is kind of edgy and the reason I say

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040
is kind of edgy and the reason I say
 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.620
is kind of edgy and the reason I say
that is because there's some people that

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630
that is because there's some people that
 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.420
that is because there's some people that
have been very effective leaders over

if i look at at least for what i try to
emulate those would be the three and

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510
emulate those would be the three and
 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.090
emulate those would be the three and
then and then of course then you need

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100
then and then of course then you need
 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.590

whole series of operational issues that
are required if you want to actually

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500
are required if you want to actually
 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.250
are required if you want to actually
make it successful but i think when the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260
make it successful but i think when the
 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.320
make it successful but i think when the
leadership aspect it would be

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330
 
 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.640
 
hi I think we should go blank and you

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650
hi I think we should go blank and you
 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.260
hi I think we should go blank and you
you think about that for a while and you

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270
you think about that for a while and you
 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.540
you think about that for a while and you
play with it with your mind and maybe

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550
play with it with your mind and maybe
 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.010
play with it with your mind and maybe
you talk to one or two people about it

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020
you talk to one or two people about it
 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.540
you talk to one or two people about it
and they certainly assure you that

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550
and they certainly assure you that
 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.820
and they certainly assure you that
you're wrong and then you then go okay

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830
you're wrong and then you then go okay
 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.770
you're wrong and then you then go okay
well then I'm going to modify a little

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780
well then I'm going to modify a little
 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.570
well then I'm going to modify a little
bit you come back to them and when they

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580
bit you come back to them and when they
 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.850
bit you come back to them and when they
stop saying vehemently know then you

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860
stop saying vehemently know then you
 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.320
stop saying vehemently know then you
figure that you must be pretty close and

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330
figure that you must be pretty close and
 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.420
figure that you must be pretty close and
then you try to go write a group of

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430
then you try to go write a group of
 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.160
then you try to go write a group of
people to say hi I want us to consider

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170
people to say hi I want us to consider
 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.810
people to say hi I want us to consider
this and then you start doing that

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820
this and then you start doing that
 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.210
this and then you start doing that
process I face that every day I'm trying

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220
process I face that every day I'm trying
 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.380
process I face that every day I'm trying
to move the status quo and sometimes of

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390
to move the status quo and sometimes of
 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.390
to move the status quo and sometimes of
course they realize there are other

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400
course they realize there are other
 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.980
course they realize there are other
people at Intel who would tell you every

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990
people at Intel who would tell you every
 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.800
people at Intel who would tell you every
day they try to move me so it's not a

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810
day they try to move me so it's not a
 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.200

to move the corporation and others or

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830
to move the corporation and others or
 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.100
to move the corporation and others or
not I think of mr. Otellini very clear

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110
not I think of mr. Otellini very clear
 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.690
not I think of mr. Otellini very clear
on the fact that he's the CEO and I'm

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700
on the fact that he's the CEO and I'm
 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.080
on the fact that he's the CEO and I'm
not and he is and I'm not so at

not and he is and I'm not so at
different levels we're all working the

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740
different levels we're all working the
 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.280
different levels we're all working the
same issue but but each time you're

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290
same issue but but each time you're
 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.740
same issue but but each time you're
trying to form a consensus you're trying

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750
trying to form a consensus you're trying
 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:52.150
trying to form a consensus you're trying
to get people to see the world

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160
to get people to see the world
 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
to get people to see the world
differently than they see it today and

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170
differently than they see it today and
 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.900
differently than they see it today and
you're trying to paint that that new

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910
you're trying to paint that that new
 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.150
you're trying to paint that that new
vision is better than where we are today

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160
vision is better than where we are today
 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.040
vision is better than where we are today
and then and then you proceed with your

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050
and then and then you proceed with your
 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.260
and then and then you proceed with your
data
