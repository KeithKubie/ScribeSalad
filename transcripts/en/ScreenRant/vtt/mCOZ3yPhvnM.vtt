00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.990
Ever walked away from a film feeling confused?
A little brain food once in a while is a good

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.750
thing - cerebral movies films challenge our
intellect. They�re a necessary component

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.990
of a balanced cinematic diet.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.770
But some movies are so opaque they need several
viewings to be understood, like the entries

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.810
on our list of 10 movies that you need to
see twice to understand. Spoiler warning!

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.810
Memento

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.560
If you wouldn�t listen to Pink Floyd backwards,
then watching a two-hour movie that begins

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.279
at the end and ends at the beginning probably
sounds unappealing. That�s the sum total

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.750
of Memento, a story told in reverse by an
unreliable narrator. �

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.690
It�s a mind-bender like most of his movies,
but the clues to unraveling Memento are woven

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.360
throughout its structure. Since Memento�s
release, Christopher Nolan has become Hollywood�s

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.250
go-to guy for brainy blockbusting.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.250
The Fountain

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.960
The story of Darren Aronofsky�s The Fountain
is easy to comprehend: a neuroscientist named

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.579
Tom is bent on curing cancer to save his dying
wife, Izzi. But his story plays out alongside

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.700
the tales of conquistador Tomas and space
traveler Tommy.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.610
That�s much less straightforward than a
medical drama. Aronofsky ties these disparate

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.430
threads together with the repeated casting
of Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. He also

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.999
uses a common motif: The tree of life, which
symbolizes the interconnection of life and

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:16.289
immortality. It�s the key to solving Aronofsky�s
puzzling genre-blending movie.

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.909
12 Monkeys

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.850
Time travel is always a tricky concept. Even
very good time travel stories stumble over

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.020
their own continuity. Terry Gilliam�s 12
Monkeys avoids the worst pitfalls of the genre

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.439
by keeping it simple, relatively speaking.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.799
Plagued by cryptic dreams, prisoner James
Cole is sent back in time to prevent a viral

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.349
outbreak that wipes out most of humanity.
The movie comes full circle, and we learn

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:40.270
that as a boy Cole saw his older, time-traveling
self gunned down in the airport where the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.290
climax occurs. By trying to save the world,
James walks into his inevitable doom.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.979
2001: A Space Odyssey

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.709
Stanley Kubrick is a legend in the movie world,
and his most widely recognized film, 2001:

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:56.409
A Space Odyssey, is every bit as iconic as
he is. It�s an homage to mankind�s evolution

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.570
throughout the eons and arguably the best
movie about space exploration ever filmed.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.630
It�s also long and complicated. 2001: A
Space Odyssey clocks in just shy of three

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.259
hours and packs so much detail that you can�t
watch it once and grasp everything. You�ll

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.790
understand the film (apart from its divisive
ending), but you won�t totally �get�

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.930
it, either.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.000
Inherent Vice

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.180
Paul Thomas Anderson�s adaptation of Thomas
Pynchon�s 2009 detective yarn plays like

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.650
a glib, stoner-influenced riff on a Carl Hiaasen
novel. That�s pretty much the life of hippie

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.319
private eye Doc Sportello in a nutshell.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.069
Doc leads a hazy life, he takes on three separate
cases that end up intertwining. What do a

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.069
missing real estate mogul, a member of the
Aryan Brotherhood, and a supposedly dead musician

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.970
have in common? Nothing, but also everything.
Make sure to block off time for multiple consecutive

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.250
views on Blu-ray.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.000
Fight Club

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.879
If you�re a Fight Club devotee, beware;
we�re about to break its first two rules.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.049
When the time comes for the big reveal in
David Fincher�s adaptation of the Chuck

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.640
Palahniuk book, everything theoretically makes
�sense.� The unnamed narrator and Tyler

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.030
Durden are two sides of the same disassociated
coin.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.349
The moment we learn the truth of Tyler�s
true existence, Fight Club unhinges. What,

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.749
exactly, is going on in Norton�s scenes
with Brad Pitt throughout the whole movie?

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:14.189
Flashbacks hint at the narrator�s lunacy,
but try watching the film with the truth in

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:20.390
mind; every moment Norton and Pitt share on
screen becomes even more interesting.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.540
The Tree of Life

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.200
There aren�t many directors in the world
who make movies like Terrance Malick. The

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.430
director�s flicks are enigmatic. Even his
most straightforward movies, Badlands and

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.920
Days of Heaven, require extra viewings.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.849
In The Tree of Life, Malick tells the story
of Jack (played by Sean Penn), a middle-aged

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.920
man reconciling his childhood memories. The
plot takes viewers all the way back to the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.659
Big Bang, tours through the Cretaceous period
and eventually arrives at the present in Waco,

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.780
Texas. How does the birth of the universe
and the extinction of dinosaurs shape the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.120
meaning of Jack�s existence today? The moments
show the dueling paths of grace and nature

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.379
but the connection isn�t apparent in a single
viewing.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.569
Eight and a half

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.810
Federico Fellini began his filmmaking career
shooting movies that captured authentic life

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.950
experiences. So his 1963 masterpiece, the
dreamlike 8 &amp; ?, represented a surreal change

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:06.989
of pace for the director.

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.879
But truth is stranger than fiction. Fellini
takes flights of fancy in 8 &amp; ?, but he includes

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.170
autobiographical notes, too. The story of
Guido Anselmi is similar to the story of Federico

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.829
Fellini. Guido�s struggles in his latest
project, a science fiction picture, as well

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.310
as his marital woes and mental strife, often
reflect Fellini�s own personal troubles.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.310
Mulholland Drive

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.090
David Lynch originally envisioned Mulholland
Drive as a TV pilot, and repurposed it for

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.889
the big screen after television executives
rejected the show. The story feels episodic

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.400
but that, along with its weirder elements,
make the film difficult to understand at first

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.400
glance.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.139
The world of Mulholland Drive is littered
with amnesiacs, assassination attempts, romantic

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.850
interludes, and waking nightmares that lurk
around the corners of our worst fears. What

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:58.259
all of these things add up to in the end is
all in the eye of the beholder. Good luck

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.160
figuring it out in a single sitting.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.160
Primer

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.630
Unpacking Primer requires a handful of viewings
plus several hours consulting the Internet.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.900
Even if you put in that footwork, you still
might only achieve a sliver of comprehension,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.639
because this is one of the most complex time
travel films ever made.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.940
But the lessons taught in Primer are clear,
even when its approach to time travel is confusing

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:23.290
- traveling through time is a bad idea. Protagonists
Abe and Aaron start out as pals but slowly

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.080
work to out-scheme and outmaneuver each other
when Abe comes to realize that time travel

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.650
is dangerous. Bad way to end a friendship.
