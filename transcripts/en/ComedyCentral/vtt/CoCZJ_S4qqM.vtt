00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:05.272
This seems bad.

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.974
It's not amazing.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:08.542
Why would PETA use this shot?

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.477
This wasn't even during
the photo shoot.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.246
This was taken during
my peanut butter break.

00:00:12.346 --> 00:00:13.914
You're the one who wanted
to pose naked

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.449
and pretend it was
for a good cause

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:16.984
so you wouldn't look
like a whore even though

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.886
that's secretly why
everybody does it.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.787
Can you fix it?
Of course.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:21.822
It's my job.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.624
What about doing some
appearances

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.925
for Operation Smile?

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.126
What is that?

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.995
The organization that fixes
cleft palates.

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.664
No, I really don't want
to deal with paint.

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.266
Ugh.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.004
What about pity (bleep)
a prom loser?

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:39.173
Yes, that's it, right?

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.308
All the hot celebrities
are doing that now.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.110
Yeah, I don't think
any of them are actually

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.745
having sex with the teenagers,

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.414
but I don't think that going
to prom is a terrible idea.

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:48.682
Did a student ask you?

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.285
No.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.653
Not yet.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.454
But I bet if I just Google it,
he's out there somewhere.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:55.522
Yeah.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.357
You just make sure
the press is there.

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:59.293
Oh, I will.
Okay.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.727
Will you bring this with you?

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.396
Sure.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:03.463
Unless you think it's okay.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:04.531
I--I don't.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:06.600
Okay.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.169
Prom.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.141
God.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.175
Ugh.

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:17.377
Who do we have here?

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:18.846
<i>That's why if you're
watching this,</i>

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.647
<i>I really hope you agree
to come to prom with me.</i>

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:23.350
<i>I promise we'll have
a really great time.</i>

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:24.885
<i>Please say yes.</i>

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.087
<i>Love, Lucas.</i>

00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:29.690

a prom date, buddy.

Well, I hope this kid's ready

No, you silly hooker,
I'm here for the prom!

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.453
L-L-L-L-Lucas!

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:34.454
Hi.

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:36.256
Hi, do I know you?

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.926
I'm your celebrity prom date.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.961
I'm Amy Schumer.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:42.095
Surprised?

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.097
Uh, I've never heard of you.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.966
You know, "When's lunch?"

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.468
Uh, this is my girlfriend
Madison.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:50.637
Girlfriend?

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:52.406
What about your YouTube video?

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.275
Oh, you mean the one where
I asked Madison to prom?

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.277
Did you even watch
the whole thing?

00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:59.613
Is anybody (bleep)
talking to you, Madison?

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.415
This is none of your business.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.050
You seriously need
to back off right now.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:05.152
Excuse me,
this is my business.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.453
Oh, really?
You know what?

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:10.357
You're ruining the best night
of Lucas' short life, okay?

00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:11.959
Whatever, Joy Behar.

00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:13.060
What?

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:15.128
Get off of--

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.196
You get off!

00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:17.931
This is-- Ow!

00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.200
Oh, my God,
you killed him!

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.602
Let go!

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:22.769
My God!

00:03:22.903 --> 00:03:23.804
I'm a cripple!

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:26.173
You give it back,
I brought that!

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:31.078
Out of my way!

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.913
These are the best years
of your lives

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.948
because you're (bleep) losers!

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:37.084
You think you could
follow Tosh?

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:41.388
You can't, I was Variety's
top ten comics to watch 2009!

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:46.560
Montgomery,
I'm riding up front!

00:03:46.627 --> 00:03:48.929
Whatever you say,
Mrs. S!

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:58.105
Oh, my God.

00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:00.374
My arms look so skinny.

00:04:00.474 --> 00:04:02.643
They do.

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:05.045
They really do.
