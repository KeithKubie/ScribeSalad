00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.710
As we've seen in this session,
enums are especially powerful in Swift.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.530
They give us the ability, not only to
represent values from a related group,

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.860
but we can also add things
like associated values and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.800
build complex case statements.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.910
You'll definitely want to add
enums into your Swift toolbox.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.750
See you in the next session.
