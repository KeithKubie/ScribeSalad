00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.380
Some people need a little noise in the background
when they’re trying to get to sleep.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.860
If you’re me, that means putting on Futurama
in an endless loop until you know every episode

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.460
word for word... in your sleep.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.260
But if you’re a normal, healthy, functioning
person, you might turn on some white noise.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.000
It turns out, though, there are more “colors”
of noise, like pink, blue, and brown.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.220
How are these colors different, and what do
they do to your brain while you sleep?

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.180
Obviously sound has no color, unless you have
synesthesia... in which case, awesome.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.280
But in this case it’s helpful to use colors
as an analogy

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.740
for the spectrum of frequencies in noise.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.560
White light has all the colors of the rainbow
equally represented, which is why

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.940
it doesn’t look like any one particular color.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.500
Likewise, the frequencies in white noise are
all equally represented, with the lowest audible

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.580
frequency at 20 Hz having the same
power as all the frequencies above it,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.080
up to the highest frequency humans can hear,
at 20,000 Hz.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.800
White noise sounds like this:

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.680
[KSSSCK]

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.580
There are natural sources of white noise,
like steam hissing from a radiator

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.300
or static from a TV.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.320
But if you’re all modern with your gas furnace
and digital TV and still can’t sleep,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.880
then you can buy a white noise machine.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.580
Because white noise is all frequencies, it
can help mask other noises,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.860
like the ringing of tinnitus or the sound
of your girlfriend snoring... Katie.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.820
But humans don’t hear all frequencies equally.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.480
The distance between 30 Hz and 60 Hz
sounds the same as the distance

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.480
between 10,000 Hz and 20,000 Hz;  to
us, both notes are one octave apart.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.320
And we’re more sensitive to high-pitched
noises, like babies crying.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.700
Enter pink noise.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.600
Unlike white noise, the energy in pink noise
is highest for the low frequencies,

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.320
and is halved every time the frequency doubles, meaning every octave has equal power

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.320
and the net effect sounds less bright, 
and more balanced, than white noise.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.420
Here’s white noise again:

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.580
[KSSSCK]

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.800
And here’s pink noise:

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.060
[WHOOOSH]

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.600
While white noise is by far the most researched
noise color, pink noise studies

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.320
are on the rise recently.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.380
One from 2012 found that participants
who listened to pink noise while they slept

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.030
showed an improvement in deep sleep, and reported
sleeping better.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.000
During deep sleep, the neurons
in your brain are firing slowly,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.100
what’s known as the delta brain wave pattern.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.540
As we age, we don’t get as much deep sleep,
which is associated with memory problems.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.120
So, a 2017 study played bursts
of pink noise in sync with the delta brainwave

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.200
to older adults, and found 
the waves increased in amplitude,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.080
and participants performed up to 
30% better on memory tests.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.260
Why?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.220
Well, scientists are just beginning to explore
the connection between sound and neural activity,

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.360
but one thing’s for sure -- the key to the
results is timing,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.280
so if you’re Philip J. Fry and don’t have a delta brainwave, you’re out of luck.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.080
That was a Futurama deep cut – y'gotta get on my level.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.140
The only other color noise that has an official
Federal Communications standard definition

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.000
is blue noise, which is like 
the opposite of pink noise,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.920
where higher frequencies are amped up.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.900
Wanna hear the most annoying sound 
in the world?

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.600
[HISSS]

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.280
Unofficially, there’s also grey noise, where
the high AND low ends are emphasized:

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.320
[THURSSS]

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.840
and Brown noise, where the frequencies mimic
the randomness of Brownian motion:

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.000
[WISSSH]

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.580
Now, if you said that means the Brown noise is
named after a person, not a color, you are

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.980
you are technically correct... 
which is the best kind of correct.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.480
(Disappointingly, it has nothing to do with the mythical pitch that will make someone poop their pants.)

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.323
There are even more sounds I don’t have
time to touch on,

00:03:16.323 --> 00:03:18.720
but it turns out there are a lot of colors of sound,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.560
and they have some
surprising applications and effects

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.720
that research is just starting to explore.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.560
So if you love science, make some noise!
