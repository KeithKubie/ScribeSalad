This is actually a little bit tricky. Even
though we've talked a lot about what

00:00:05.027 --> 00:00:10.218
vocabulary is, sometimes it's hard to
apply it to actual situations. Let's start

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.999
from the bottom and work up. -100000 is
part of a term, but the term that it's

00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:20.293
part of is actually -100,000x. Remember
that the term is the whole thing that's

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:25.980
going to be added to other things or
subtracted from other things. So -100000

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:31.850
on its own is not a term, so let's cross
that out. We said earlier that -100,000x

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:37.255
is a variable term as a whole, but it's
not the -100000 that makes the term a

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:43.121
variable term. It's the x that does that,
so, -100,000 itself is not a variable.

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:47.675
Constant was the word that we used for
numbers that were terms on their own,

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:52.656
things like 3 million right here. This is
something that is a term by itself that

00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:57.595
has no variables as part of it. -100,000
is not standing on its own, it's

00:00:57.607 --> 00:01:02.945
multiplied by x, so this is not a constant
either. That leaves us with coefficient.

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:07.460
Remember that coefficients are the number
parts of variable terms. So they are

00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:12.035
numbers that are multiplied by variables
to create variable terms. I know there are

00:01:12.047 --> 00:01:16.275
a lot of subtle differences involved in
this, but over time this will become a

00:01:16.287 --> 00:01:19.695
much more natural feeling. Great job
working on all this vocab.
