another I think our responsibility was
 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.969
another I think our responsibility was
to educate students make them be

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979
to educate students make them be
 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.890
to educate students make them be
thoughtful about their career choice and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900
thoughtful about their career choice and
 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.890
thoughtful about their career choice and
then while some schools would look at

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900
then while some schools would look at
 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.510
then while some schools would look at
their fifty percent of students going

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520
their fifty percent of students going
 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.580
their fifty percent of students going
into finance and be horrified at that

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590
into finance and be horrified at that
 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.430

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.040
number of so many going into industries
in which you don't quote make things I

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050
in which you don't quote make things I
 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.260
in which you don't quote make things I
always felt our job was to really

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270
always felt our job was to really
 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.150
always felt our job was to really
provide a great general management

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160
provide a great general management
 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.250
provide a great general management
experience for our students and then if

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260
experience for our students and then if
 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.110
experience for our students and then if
they chose to go into one industry

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120
they chose to go into one industry
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.760
they chose to go into one industry
another that that was really their

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770
another that that was really their
 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.770
another that that was really their
choice so so I don't think it's so much

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780
choice so so I don't think it's so much
 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.100
choice so so I don't think it's so much
that the company that the schools have

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
that the company that the schools have
 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.990
that the company that the schools have
to now in sent their students to go

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000
to now in sent their students to go
 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.540
to now in sent their students to go
elsewhere it's just that there's always

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550
elsewhere it's just that there's always
 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.330
elsewhere it's just that there's always
going to be financial activity but just

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
going to be financial activity but just
 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.460
going to be financial activity but just
not at the scale that we've seen and so

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470
not at the scale that we've seen and so
 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.400
not at the scale that we've seen and so
as the salaries maybe come down a little

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410
as the salaries maybe come down a little
 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.340
as the salaries maybe come down a little
bit in finance there won't be the strong

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350
bit in finance there won't be the strong
 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.500
bit in finance there won't be the strong
economic incentive to go and obviously

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510
economic incentive to go and obviously
 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.020
economic incentive to go and obviously
just if the jobs aren't there in finance

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030
just if the jobs aren't there in finance
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.820
just if the jobs aren't there in finance
the students are going to be preparing

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830
the students are going to be preparing
 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.890
the students are going to be preparing
themselves I think to to have a little

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900
themselves I think to to have a little
 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.470
themselves I think to to have a little
broader set of of options when they

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
broader set of of options when they
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.990
broader set of of options when they
graduate

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000
 
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.990
 
not in my judgment I think I think

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000
not in my judgment I think I think
 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.240
not in my judgment I think I think
business schools have really taken to

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250
business schools have really taken to
 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.240
business schools have really taken to
take taken the responsibility of

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250
take taken the responsibility of
 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.640
take taken the responsibility of
developing some ethical education into

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650
developing some ethical education into
 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.110
developing some ethical education into
into the curriculum in a really

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120
into the curriculum in a really
 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.150
into the curriculum in a really
substantive way schools have taken that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160
substantive way schools have taken that
 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.160
substantive way schools have taken that
extremely seriously and if you look at

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170
extremely seriously and if you look at
 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.740
extremely seriously and if you look at
what's been done over the last 20 years

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750
what's been done over the last 20 years
 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.720
what's been done over the last 20 years
or so I think the schools have done a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
or so I think the schools have done a
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.320
or so I think the schools have done a
great job you know the the problem to me

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330
great job you know the the problem to me
 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.530
great job you know the the problem to me
with the certification it's almost like

well if we can check off the box then we
 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.449
well if we can check off the box then we
can forget about it it was almost like

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459
can forget about it it was almost like
 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.960
can forget about it it was almost like
in the old days when everybody had to

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970
in the old days when everybody had to
 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.650
in the old days when everybody had to
have a special little set of ethics and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660
have a special little set of ethics and
 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.160
have a special little set of ethics and
law courses that typically were required

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170
law courses that typically were required
 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.199
law courses that typically were required
and as long as the students took one or

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209
and as long as the students took one or
 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.229
and as long as the students took one or
two they were fine and the ethical

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239
two they were fine and the ethical
 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.290
two they were fine and the ethical
dimensions were not as then as present

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300
dimensions were not as then as present
 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.090

in the everyday conversation of the
 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.040
in the everyday conversation of the
school and I think what we've tried to

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050
school and I think what we've tried to
 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.050

special topics which you cover in
 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.630
special topics which you cover in

orientation and then say oh okay that's
 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.729
orientation and then say oh okay that's
covered now we can get on to the real

covered now we can get on to the real
stuff of marketing but you have to embed

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170
stuff of marketing but you have to embed
 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.810
stuff of marketing but you have to embed
the ethical discussions into the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820
the ethical discussions into the
 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.000
the ethical discussions into the
everyday life for the school and I think

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010
everyday life for the school and I think
 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.509
everyday life for the school and I think
you have to create a responsibility for

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519
you have to create a responsibility for
 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.819
you have to create a responsibility for
doing that as well so so i weary a

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829
doing that as well so so i weary a
 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.950
doing that as well so so i weary a
little bit about whether some kind of

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960
little bit about whether some kind of
 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.980
little bit about whether some kind of
certification program or passing a test

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990
certification program or passing a test
 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.710
certification program or passing a test
would lead us more back to the old days

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720
would lead us more back to the old days
 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.409
would lead us more back to the old days
of saying everybody saying okay we have

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419
of saying everybody saying okay we have
 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.960
of saying everybody saying okay we have
these few courses and and we can check

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970
these few courses and and we can check
 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.420
these few courses and and we can check
them off and it really got to get the

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430
them off and it really got to get the
 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.219
them off and it really got to get the
substantive focus distracted from

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229
substantive focus distracted from
 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.170
substantive focus distracted from
because everybody's wearing about

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180
because everybody's wearing about
 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.180
because everybody's wearing about
showing that ninety-nine point nine

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190
showing that ninety-nine point nine
 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.219
showing that ninety-nine point nine
percent of their students passed some

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229
percent of their students passed some
 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.740
percent of their students passed some
certification test so so I think this is

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750
certification test so so I think this is
 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.360
certification test so so I think this is
a dimension on which I know business

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370
a dimension on which I know business
 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.700
a dimension on which I know business
schools are frequently criticized at the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710
schools are frequently criticized at the
 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.030
schools are frequently criticized at the
moment but if people really understood

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040
moment but if people really understood
 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.190
moment but if people really understood
what is happening in the curriculum at

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200
what is happening in the curriculum at
 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.529
what is happening in the curriculum at
school and also I think in the wonderful

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:01.539
school and also I think in the wonderful
 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.810
school and also I think in the wonderful
you know the wonderful students that we

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820
you know the wonderful students that we
 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.110
you know the wonderful students that we
and a number of the other

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120
and a number of the other
 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.510
and a number of the other
rules enjoy these days these students

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520
rules enjoy these days these students
 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.820
rules enjoy these days these students
really going to insist that ethics and

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830
really going to insist that ethics and
 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.680
really going to insist that ethics and
sustainability be part of the everyday

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690
sustainability be part of the everyday
 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.350
sustainability be part of the everyday
discussion of the school so so I really

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360
discussion of the school so so I really
 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.300
discussion of the school so so I really
feel pretty good about where we are on

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310
feel pretty good about where we are on
 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.150
feel pretty good about where we are on
that

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160
 
 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.320
 
there's probably three different three

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330
there's probably three different three
 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.990
there's probably three different three
different ways that that we would be

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000
different ways that that we would be
 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.880
different ways that that we would be
doing it what one would be we have

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890
doing it what one would be we have
 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.010
doing it what one would be we have
established a few years ago the Ross

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020
established a few years ago the Ross
 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.640
established a few years ago the Ross
Leadership Initiative which which one of

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650
Leadership Initiative which which one of
 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.130
Leadership Initiative which which one of
the sochi of Dean's run runs for us and

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140
the sochi of Dean's run runs for us and
 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.960
the sochi of Dean's run runs for us and
so that is an integrated package of

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970
so that is an integrated package of
 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.500
so that is an integrated package of
material that that we use to bring up

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510
material that that we use to bring up
 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.170
material that that we use to bring up
issues of social responsibility and

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180
issues of social responsibility and
 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.530
issues of social responsibility and
business ethics so so I think one of the

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540
business ethics so so I think one of the
 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.930
business ethics so so I think one of the
important elements of our training is

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940
important elements of our training is
 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.530
important elements of our training is
during your first week at school during

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540
during your first week at school during
 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.960
during your first week at school during
the orientation program we spend one day

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970
the orientation program we spend one day
 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.940
the orientation program we spend one day
on community service and so we all go

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950
on community service and so we all go
 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.410
on community service and so we all go
out and do a community service project

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420
out and do a community service project
 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.920
out and do a community service project
that we all come back together all 450

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930
that we all come back together all 450
 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.470
that we all come back together all 450
of us or so and discuss about well what

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480
of us or so and discuss about well what
 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.150
of us or so and discuss about well what
did we learn that day and what's the

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160
did we learn that day and what's the
 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.730
did we learn that day and what's the
meaning of this kind of activity so I

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740
meaning of this kind of activity so I
 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.770
meaning of this kind of activity so I
think from very early on what we're

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780
think from very early on what we're
 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.840
think from very early on what we're
trying to do is get these issues of

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850
trying to do is get these issues of
 

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.430
trying to do is get these issues of
corporate social responsibility into the

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440
corporate social responsibility into the
 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.770
corporate social responsibility into the
into the minds of students and then our

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780
into the minds of students and then our
 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.470
into the minds of students and then our
net impact Club which is I think the

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:20.480
net impact Club which is I think the
 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.540
net impact Club which is I think the
largest chapter in the United States you

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550
largest chapter in the United States you
 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.400
largest chapter in the United States you
know which Foster's the triple bottom

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.410
know which Foster's the triple bottom
 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:26.890
know which Foster's the triple bottom
line kind of philosophy of social

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900
line kind of philosophy of social
 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.500
line kind of philosophy of social
responsibility ethical responsibility

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510
responsibility ethical responsibility
 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.659
responsibility ethical responsibility
and and profitability as three different

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669
and and profitability as three different
 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.670
and and profitability as three different
important measures to be bringing into

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680
important measures to be bringing into
 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.190
important measures to be bringing into
discussion that kind of thinking is

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200
discussion that kind of thinking is
 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.830
discussion that kind of thinking is
embodied in our in our everyday in our

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840
embodied in our in our everyday in our
 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.700
embodied in our in our everyday in our
everyday classes and so so I think those

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710
everyday classes and so so I think those
 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.950
everyday classes and so so I think those
are two important ways then the third

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960
are two important ways then the third
 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.860
are two important ways then the third
one would just be what we do in terms of

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870
one would just be what we do in terms of
 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.180
one would just be what we do in terms of
bringing in outside speakers and through

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190
bringing in outside speakers and through
 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.800
bringing in outside speakers and through
our club activities like we have the

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810
our club activities like we have the
 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.320
our club activities like we have the
global corporate responsibility group so

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330
global corporate responsibility group so
 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.600
global corporate responsibility group so
i think it's the way that we try to as i

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610
i think it's the way that we try to as i
 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.460
i think it's the way that we try to as i
was saying a moment ago really have it

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470
was saying a moment ago really have it
 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.650
was saying a moment ago really have it
be part of the everyday everyday life of

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:05.660
be part of the everyday everyday life of
 

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.070
be part of the everyday everyday life of
the school

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080
 
 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.350
 
well I think the you know I think the it

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360
well I think the you know I think the it
 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.790
well I think the you know I think the it
would be a good idea to to tie bonuses

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800
would be a good idea to to tie bonuses
 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.510
would be a good idea to to tie bonuses
to to specific performance goals I think

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520
to to specific performance goals I think
 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.820
to to specific performance goals I think
and that's something which seemingly has

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830
and that's something which seemingly has
 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.390
and that's something which seemingly has
gotten lost that that the bonuses while

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400
gotten lost that that the bonuses while
 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.189
gotten lost that that the bonuses while
people always call them bonuses they

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199
people always call them bonuses they
 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:31.619
people always call them bonuses they
really in fact in many industries had

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:31.629
really in fact in many industries had
 

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:33.779
really in fact in many industries had
become more or less an entitlement where

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:33.789
become more or less an entitlement where
 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:35.939
become more or less an entitlement where
there wasn't a tie of well we'll get

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949
there wasn't a tie of well we'll get
 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:37.529
there wasn't a tie of well we'll get
this kind of bonus assuming assuming

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:37.539
this kind of bonus assuming assuming
 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:40.409
this kind of bonus assuming assuming
these kind of performance metrics so I

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:40.419
these kind of performance metrics so I
 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.589
these kind of performance metrics so I
think incentive pay in general is not a

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:43.599
think incentive pay in general is not a
 

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:47.369
think incentive pay in general is not a
bad idea and certainly they've been lots

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:47.379
bad idea and certainly they've been lots
 

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:49.890
bad idea and certainly they've been lots
of industries which have done much

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:49.900
of industries which have done much
 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.439
of industries which have done much
better because they tied the they

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:52.449
better because they tied the they
 

00:07:52.449 --> 00:07:56.010
better because they tied the they
aligned the financial performance of the

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.020
aligned the financial performance of the
 

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.950
aligned the financial performance of the
firm with the with the financial rewards

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960
firm with the with the financial rewards
 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.170

to the employee so the idea of incentive

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180
to the employee so the idea of incentive
 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.140
to the employee so the idea of incentive
pay I think I think it's terrific but

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.150
pay I think I think it's terrific but
 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.820
pay I think I think it's terrific but
you just have to make sure that there

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:05.830
you just have to make sure that there
 

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.749
you just have to make sure that there
are metrics that drive the profitability

00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759
are metrics that drive the profitability
 

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.089
are metrics that drive the profitability
of the firm that those metrics are the

00:08:12.089 --> 00:08:12.099
of the firm that those metrics are the
 

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:14.129
