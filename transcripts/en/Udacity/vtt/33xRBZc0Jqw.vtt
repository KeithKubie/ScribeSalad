We know that we want to find the inverse of B of t equals 1,000 e to the -.5t.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.037
Which we know is going to be the reflection of that graph line y equals x. So,

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:16.280
that means we're looking for the equation this graph right here. This is B of t

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.851
and this is B inverse of t. Well let's think about how we might want to do

00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.294
this. While we could divide both sides by 1000, and then maybe we could take

00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:29.877
the t root, of both sides. That will get rid of the t on the right hand side,

00:00:29.877 --> 00:00:34.726
in the exponent. But we would still have an exponent of t over here. since we

00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:38.984
know that the t root is the same as taking this to the one over the t power. So

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:42.985
that's not going to help without that at all. We actually need a totally new

00:00:42.985 --> 00:00:48.031
idea to solve this problem. And that ideas named by a Scottish mathematician

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:53.691
named John Napier discovered in 1614. His discovery was something called a

00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:58.405
logarithm or just a log. We'll look at some simpler examples first log and then

00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:01.744
come back to this example about bacteria once we have all the tools we need to

00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:03.989
deal with it.
