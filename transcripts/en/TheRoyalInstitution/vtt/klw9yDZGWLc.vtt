00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.040
Ready? 3, 2, 1...

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.160
Perfect! You did it! You remembered all 10!
Well done!

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.280
That was brilliant, Sam.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.230
Kids play loads of different kinds of memory
games,

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.830
but may not think about how they store

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.200
different types of ideas in different ways.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.160
In this activity you and your kids can investigate

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.190
the different ways we store memories.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.460
OK, Sam, we are going to play a memory game.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.210
I have got 10 objects, and I'm going to give
you 30 seconds,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.100
just looking, to try and remember them.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.640
Anemone, globe, shell...

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.480
When we need to remember something quickly,
we use our short term memory.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.530
This struggles to hold more than about nine
pieces of information at a time,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.629
so these ten objects should be quite a challenge
for Sam.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.229
So, shall I count? OK you try and tell me
what was under it?

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.790
umm... an anemone, a globe.. what's next?

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.630
You have to tell me!

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.560
A batman... a camera!

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.750
There's no camera!

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:35.119
Do you think you've got 6? OK, I think we
got 6.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.969
What do you think we can do that will help
you remember them better?

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.179
Write them!

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:48.069
You think writing them down would help? That's
a really good idea.

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.100
I'll do it!

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.280
Ask if they can think of any ways to help
remember more.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.020
That might be writing a list, or picking up
the objects before they�re hidden,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.390
but let them try whatever they think would
work.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.869
What shall we try this time?

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:02.899
Pick them up!

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.210
OK, let's try that.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.570
Yeah let's pick them up and say them, that's
a great idea.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.250
Watch, batman, doll, globe...

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.000
And they're gone!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.350
Batman, doll, watch... I can't remember any
more!

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.220
OK that's fine, we remembered 7 when you got
to touch them, that's really good.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.890
Write down the results as you go.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.830
This is a great way to get used to observing
the results of an experiment

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.830
and thinking like a scientist.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.230
We are gonna try a new thing to help you remember
all ten.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.520
So far the most you've remembered is seven.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.920
We're going to try to make a story.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.330
I need you to pick two objects to start out.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.870
OK, what can an octopus do with a watch?

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.770
He can wear it!

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:13.200
He can wear a watch? But that would be really
silly, he's got one watch on three of his

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200
legs!

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.200
But that's octopuses wear watches!

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.790
OK, do you think we can remember that then,
that can be our first pair?

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.880
An octopus is wearing a really brightly coloured
superman watch and it's on three of his legs!

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.230
By connecting the ideas of the objects in
pairs,

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.590
Sam will push them into his long term memory.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.580
It�s important to make the pairs overlap,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.230
so the second object of one pair becomes

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.861
the first object in the next part of the story.

00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:40.240
If the octopus goes into the water, who might
he meet there?

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.780
An anemone!

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.820
So that's our next pair.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:51.900
We had an octopus wearing a watch, the octopus
jumped into the sea and he's met an anemone.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.260
The stranger the connections, and the sillier
the kids make them,

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.670
the more unique those connections will be,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.970
helping lead their memories from one object
to the next.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.280
This chain of ideas should help the kids remember
all ten items.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.360
Your story started with a watch. Can you tell
me what happened next?

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.680
An octopus weared a watch.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.659
There's your octopus. What happened next?

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:24.439
He went into the water and he met an anemone.

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:29.629
And he squirted ink all over him...

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:36.710
And then the anemone went for a shower...

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.840
And he played with his rubber duck...

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.539
...and the doll read a book!

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:56.629
Amazing! That was such good telling your story,
I love it!

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:03.620
The very first one we did was when you jsut
looked, wasn't it?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.090
How many did you get then?

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.090
Six.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.740
So you got six when we looked, you got seven
when you wrote them...

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.230
In the end, how well the kids recall the objects
isn't really the important thing.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.199
It's about them thinking about how they
remember things, and coming up with their

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.199
own ideas.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.779
At the end of the activity keep asking lots
of questions about what helped,

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:26.650
why they think that might be,

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.289
and maybe even what that tells them about
how their brain works.

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.120

science behind it,
