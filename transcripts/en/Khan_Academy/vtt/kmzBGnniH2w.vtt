00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:02.600
- [Voiceover] A barista
poured a cup of coffee.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.319
The initial temperature of the coffee

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.341
was 90 degrees Celsius.

00:00:06.341 --> 00:00:08.872
At time t increased (laughs).

00:00:08.872 --> 00:00:12.889
As time t increased, the
temperature C of the coffee

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.489
began to decrease exponentially

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:19.042
and approach room temperature
of 20 degrees Celsius.

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:23.384
Which of the following graphs
could model this relationship?

00:00:23.384 --> 00:00:25.241
So we're starting at 90 degrees Celsius.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.167
It looks like all of the graphs
start at 90 degrees Celsius

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:30.930
at t equals zero.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.506
And we're going to approach
the room temperature

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:36.154
of 20 degrees Celsius.

00:00:36.154 --> 00:00:38.731
So this first one does
approach the room temperature

00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.849
of 20 degrees Celsius as t increases.

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:45.761
Now this one, when t is 70,

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:48.199
when t is 70.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.312
I'm assuming this is in minutes.

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:53.725
When t is 70 it looks like
it has the temperature

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:56.209
going to zero degrees Celsius

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:58.708
so that cup of coffee is
going to start freezing.

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:00.450
So I think I can rule out B.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.909
Also this looks like a linear
model not an exponential one.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.657
C, it does get us to this end state

00:01:05.657 --> 00:01:07.677
that stays at 20 degrees,

00:01:07.677 --> 00:01:09.674
but it doesn't look like
an exponential model.

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:11.787
It looks like it's linearly decreasing

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:14.620
and then it stops linearly
decreasing after 50 minutes

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.492
and then it just stays
constant at that temperature

00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:17.792
of 20 degrees.

00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:18.999
So even though it gets
us to the right place,

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:21.507
it does not look like
an exponential decay.

00:01:21.507 --> 00:01:23.574
So I would rule choice C out as well.

00:01:23.574 --> 00:01:25.106
So A is looking good.

00:01:25.106 --> 00:01:26.964
D, we are starting at 90,

00:01:26.964 --> 00:01:30.005
it does look like an exponential function.

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.926
We have exponential decay right over here

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.516
and we are approaching something

00:01:34.516 --> 00:01:35.700
but it's not the room temperature

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.814
of 20 degrees Celsius.

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:39.183
We're approaching 30 degrees Celsius here.

00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:40.715
So I'd also rule out D.

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:42.364
So A is looking good.

00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:44.035
It's an exponential.

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:46.195
It's decreasing exponentially.

00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:47.843
Starting at 90 degrees Celsius

00:01:47.843 --> 00:01:49.979
and it's approaching the room temperature

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.533
of 20 degrees Celsius.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.609
Let's do another one of these.

00:01:56.193 --> 00:01:57.633
So it says.

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:00.535
Let me scroll up a little bit.

00:02:00.535 --> 00:02:03.368
So it says, after the
closing of the mills,

00:02:03.368 --> 00:02:07.013
the population of the town
starts decreasing exponentially.

00:02:07.013 --> 00:02:10.032
The graph below represents
the population, P,

00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:13.143
in thousands, of the town t years

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:15.558
after the closing of the mill.

00:02:15.558 --> 00:02:16.324
Alright.

00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:19.691
So it looks like the
population starts at 40,000.

00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:21.130
It's decreasing exponentially.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.547
It looks like, over time, the population

00:02:22.547 --> 00:02:25.542
is approaching 20,000 people.

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:27.391
So, what are the question here?

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:29.573
Based on the graph, with the mill closed,

00:02:29.573 --> 00:02:31.260
what does the population
of the town approach

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.722
as time increases?

00:02:32.722 --> 00:02:33.541
We just said it.

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:36.466
As time increases, it looks
like it's coming close to,

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.904
it's approaching, 20,000.

00:02:38.904 --> 00:02:41.366
It's approaching 20,000.

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:45.313
It's already gotten
below 22,000 as far as,

00:02:45.313 --> 00:02:47.719
you know, it looks like
after 20 or 22 years.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.321
We've already gotten below 22,000,

00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:51.202
so we're definitely below 30 or 40,000.

00:02:51.202 --> 00:02:53.593
But we haven't gotten below 20,000

00:02:53.593 --> 00:02:55.613
but we are approaching it.

00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:57.680
We can even check our answer if we like.
