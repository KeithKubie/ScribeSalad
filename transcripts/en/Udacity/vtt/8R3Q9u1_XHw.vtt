00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.070
Okay, this is getting to be a lot
of stuff about IP addresses,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.370
why do we care so
much about them anyway?

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.640
So, all traffic on the Internet is
split up into messages called packets.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.990
And each packet has the addresses of its
source or sender and it's destination or

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.460
intended recipient on it.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.420
When you use Ping, you're sending a
steady stream of packets to a particular

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.490
destination and hopefully,
you're getting a steady stream back.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.480
So each server or

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.240
other host that you want to talk to,
it needs to have a distinct IP address.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.370
Now, that would be fine, but
there aren't enough IP addresses for

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.140
all the computers today.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.890
Remember, there's about 4 billion IPv4
addresses available for hosts, and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.420
there's 7 billion people on the planet.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.310
To make it worse, big institutions that
have been on the internet since forever

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.150
are using way more than their
fair share of addresses.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.221
And the addresses to people ratio in
the US is actually a lot higher than

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:59.368
the rest of the world, especially
Latin America, Asia, and Africa.

00:00:59.368 --> 00:01:02.090
At the end of this lesson I'll tell
you more about how we're fixing

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.260
this problem.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.610
But before we get there I have to
confess that I've been lying to you

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.210
about something.
