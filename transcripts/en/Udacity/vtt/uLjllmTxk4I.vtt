00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.700
So we're here with Paul.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.600
Paul, why is it important
to be able to throw away

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.420
your prototypes once you've made them?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.080
&gt;&gt; I would say that it's important to
throw away your prototypes because it

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.000
makes sure that you're not
invested in your prototypes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.770
One of the goals of prototyping is that
all of your prototypes are cheap and

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.740
super fast.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.940
And so, thinking about your
prototypes is throwing them away.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.930
Make sure that you're going to think
about them as these cheap, fast,

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.660
little things that you spit out quickly,
get rid of, recycle, move on.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.400
Prototypes shouldn't be thought of
as just an end into themselves.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.200
That's one of the things
engineers kind of think about,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.530
not necessarily prototypers.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.940
For prototypers, prototypes are a means
to the end of making good product.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.973
Being able to use your test, being able
to demo, putting together a video for

00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:47.410
VCs, for example, that kind of thing.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.390
&gt;&gt; So the end goal is
this prototyping process,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.910
rather than any individual
step along the way.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.
