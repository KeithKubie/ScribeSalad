00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:02.120
We blame meteorologists for a lot.

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.190
They ruin camping trips, golf trips, days
at the beach.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.360
Why are they always wrong?!

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.840
I’m going to say something controversial
here.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.389
Weather forecasting isn’t bad.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.570
It’s actually really accurate.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.570
Bare with me.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.910
To get a prediction on the weather, someone
has to measure humidity, wind speed, rain,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.600
sun, clouds, dew point, and a hundred other
things all over the world.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.560
It’s crazy to think about the amount of
data we need just to say if it’s going to

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.680
rain on Thursday.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.100
To paraphrase a famous astrophysicist -- “the
weather is under no obligation to make sense

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.370
to you.”

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.710
And yet, we keep trying.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.300
For most of the 20th century, weather forecasting
was mediocre because we didn’t have two

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.200
things, satellites and supercomputers.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.620
Once we got those, we really knocked it out
of the sunny ballpark.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.079
In 1972, we could predict temperatures in
a range of plus or minus 6 degrees (~3C).

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.680
Like it’s going to be “in the 60s (15-20C)”
Now it’s 2 to 3 degrees (~1C).

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.590
There’s a big difference between the high
60s and low 60s.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.410
And, we get rain right about 82-percent of
the time.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.330
That’s fantastic, considering we didn’t
even know what a cold or warm front was 100

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.330
years ago.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.510
Like I said though, satellites and supercomputers.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.260
Satellites made weather forecasting amazing.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.690
The first sat to take pictures of clouds over
the US was TIROS-1 in April of 1960.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.860
In the first week it spotted a typhoon.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.729
That was huge.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.830
Tropical storms, hurricanes, typhoons -- they
were difficult to detect before satellites.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.909
We’ve launched dozens of weather sats in
the last 57 years, with the newest making

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.310
the originals look like the Stone Age.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.981
Now we can see cloud patterns, spot tropical
storms as they form, see heat maps, and even

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:44.330
see differences between “clouds, water vapor,
smoke, ice and volcanic ash.”

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.330
It’s insane.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.119
But as we got more data, it started to just…
be too much for our puny human brains to fathom.

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.460
Around the turn of the last century numerical
weather monitoring was first attempted.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.830
It applied physics of the atmosphere to weather.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.680
Meteorologists divided the world into a grid
of small imaginary boxes, and calculated the

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.700
weather in each box and how it would affect
the boxes around it.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.649
. And it turns out, this is kinda impossible
without a computer!

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.290
It took a 1920s mathematician three months
to predict 24 hours of weather.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.560
Supercomputers can run many millions of these
grid calculations per second.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.640
Each time they use real weather data and create
a simulation of what could happen.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.140
Humans could not do this… not even close.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.940
Daily, NOAA’s supercomputer pumps through
data equal to more than twice the entire printed

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.810
collection of the Library of Congress.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.790
Even still, weather models (or simulations)
aren’t perfect.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.950
There are lots of them used by different organizations
all over the world, and they’re always tweaking

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.010
‘em based on new research…And yet, the
supercomputer can only get so far.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.280
Humans have to be part of the equation.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.160
The National Weather Service says humans improve
rain forecasting by 25-percent, because let’s

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.140
be clear, computers only know what we tell
them.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.019
They can’t infer or guess; they just calculate.

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.290
And it’s not like before sats and supercomputers
we knew nothing like Jon Snow.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.030
Before space travel, we used (and still use)
radar, balloons, and weather stations spread

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.720
across the country and the ocean.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.090
And before electronics, people could look
at the sky or read almanacs!

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.090
Seriously!

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.599
Red sky in the morning sailors warning, has
to do with atmospheric thickness, red light

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.159
scatters the least -- so it can make it through
the thicker air of a possible stormfront.

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.920
Stars below a 40 degree angle twinkle normally,
but stars overhead don’t.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.270
When the higher-up stars start to twinkle…
rains a-comin’!

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.660
Not to mention people kept records of weather
on days of the year -- knowing the history

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.430
helps us predict the future, but it’s not
very precise.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.610
Almanacs are bad weather predictors.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.099
And snow in April doesn’t mean global warming
is a hoax.

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.110
Weather is big and complicated and global.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.080
We’re still figuring it out.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.659
In the end, stop raining on your local meteorologists
parade.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.830
Climate and weather are different things,
btw.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.090
I’m not even going to touch that today,
But if global warming is real, then is NASA

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.090
lying?

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.489
Because Antarctic ice is growing!

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.480
Find out more about it in this video.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.940
Do you love your local meteorologist?
