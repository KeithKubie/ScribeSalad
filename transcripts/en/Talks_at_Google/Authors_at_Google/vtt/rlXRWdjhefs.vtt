[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:07.550
ERIC SCHMIDT: Welcome
to Google.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.800
STEPHEN COLBERT: A pleasure
to be here in the flesh.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.800
I watch you guys online all the
time, really great show.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.260
It's slow, but you just never
know where the plot's going.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.650
ERIC SCHMIDT: Jim DeMint
has just announced--

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.770
STEPHEN COLBERT: Jim
DeMint, yes, yeah.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.290
Jim's a friend, but go ahead.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: He's just
announced that he's retiring.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.860
And it occurs to me that you
might want to-- you're from

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.310
South Carolina originally,
I think?

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.340
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yes, I am.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.500
I'm from South Carolina,
the palmetto state.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.330
ERIC SCHMIDT: You might want
to run for Senate.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.200
STEPHEN COLBERT: No, I do not
want to run for Senate.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.930
I want Nikki Haley to just
appoint me to senate.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.530
That's the great thing, people
are asking me, are you going

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.250
to run for Senate?

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.770
And like, no, why
would you run?

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.080
She just gets to
say, it's you.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.020
So, yeah, while I'm honored by
what you're implying and by

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.530
the groundswell that
I've felt.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.400
But obviously, that's something
I have to take up

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.320
with my family and my pastor
before I decide whether to

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.470
take that position.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.720
Is there another question,
Senator?

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.220
ERIC SCHMIDT: Do you think
Bill O'Reilly would be a

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.370
better choice?

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.740
STEPHEN COLBERT: He's not
in South Carolina.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.110
But he's a very talented man.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.940
And I sincerely admire his
broadcasting abilities.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.520
ERIC SCHMIDT: But, you
know, you're locked

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.450
in a deathly battle.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.310
STEPHEN COLBERT: With
Bill right now?

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.050
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.100
STEPHEN COLBERT: Oh,
you mean over the--

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.430
ERIC SCHMIDT: The book.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.760
STEPHEN COLBERT: Over
the book, exactly.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.140
Bill's got a book called
"Killing Kennedy." And I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.750
admire his obsession with
terrible things happening to

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.440
presidents.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.550
He's got "Killing Lincoln,"
"Killing Kennedy," "Sodomizing

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.930
Coolidge"--

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.180
that's a kids' book.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.320
He was on John Stewart's show.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.090
And he said his next book is
going to be called "Killing

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.500
Colbert." And it broke my
character's heart so much to

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.550
hear Papa Bear say that.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.050
So we launched operation Killing
"Killing Kennedy."

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.650
Where I'm just telling my
audience out there--

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.870
I'm not telling you
to buy my book.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.190
I don't want to abuse
the relationship.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.470
But I'm just reminding them,
if you're going to buy my

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.440
book-- and you are--

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.980
if you're going to buy
my book, just do

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.640
it all in one week.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.120
So we can leapfrog at least
one of his killing books.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.650
ERIC SCHMIDT: Which week do you
want us to all your book?

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.500
STEPHEN COLBERT: Right
now, as we speak.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.150
ERIC SCHMIDT: Right now.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.640
This week.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.260
STEPHEN COLBERT: Right now.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.640
Go right now.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.360
Go to a local bookstore, a
small bookstore, a big

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.320
bookstore, online,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.970
ERIC SCHMIDT: Your book
is on Google Play.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.220
STEPHEN COLBERT: What
does that mean?

00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:41.790
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
our online store.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.400
You're going to end up
being your best--

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.990
STEPHEN COLBERT: I know
all about Google Play.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.480
Really?

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.810
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.830
STEPHEN COLBERT: So
go to Google Play.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.145
ERIC SCHMIDT: Absolutely.

00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:48.740
STEPHEN COLBERT: And
what happens there?

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.490
ERIC SCHMIDT: People are going
to pay you lots of money to

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:51.190
buy your book.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.430
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well, then
it's a wonderful service.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: Excellent.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.220
STEPHEN COLBERT: So you
go there, and you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.720
can click on it?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.930
It's like going to, it's like
that one that's named after a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.380
rainforest.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.360
You go to that one.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.630
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.940
ERIC SCHMIDT: You click
on it and you get it?

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.310
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.450
It's the competitor
to the rainforest.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.165
STEPHEN COLBERT: I don't

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:05.070
ERIC SCHMIDT: And
further more--

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.050
STEPHEN COLBERT: Because
we got to preserve that

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.610
rainforest.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.975
We got to stop making books
out of that rainforest.

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:10.840
Do you get a physical
book from you guys?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.880
Or is it all the ebook thing?

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.800
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
an ebook thing.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.230
STEPHEN COLBERT: It's
only ebook?

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.350
ERIC SCHMIDT: You can
get a physical, too.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:16.430
We'll sell you one of those.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.950
STEPHEN COLBERT: You will?

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.140
ERIC SCHMIDT: We'll get it
through your publisher.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.420
STEPHEN COLBERT: Good.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.870
ERIC SCHMIDT: At list
price, no less.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.130
STEPHEN COLBERT: What?

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.070
At less price?

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.800
ERIC SCHMIDT: At list price.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.570
STEPHEN COLBERT:
At list price?

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.590
At list price.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.100
So go to Google + for no deal.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.470
If you're willing to pay list--
which you should.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.450
Because if you pay list price
they include more book.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.755
ERIC SCHMIDT: Understood.

00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:37.390
STEPHEN COLBERT: I'm not
going to give this

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.080
stuff away for free.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.890
"America Again, Re-Becoming
the Greatness We Never

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.270
Weren't." Has to be written this
way, because clearly our

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.793
country's in trouble, yes?

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:51.600
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.430
STEPHEN COLBERT: OK, you can
tell because I am the country.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.850
And I'm all beaten up
on the cover here.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.545
We want to re-become the
greatness, right?

00:04:01.545 --> 00:04:02.970
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.040
STEPHEN COLBERT: All right.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.040
But if I said we never were,
then that would mean America

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.520
was never great, right?

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.800
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.850
STEPHEN COLBERT: But if I said
that we presently aren't, that

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.390
would mean I'm criticizing
America, which you

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.700
mustn't ever do.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.800
Therefore, it's America again,
re-becoming the greatness we

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.620
never weren't.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.220
Unless you've got something
bad to say about

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.870
America, Eric Schmidt.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.520
Do you have something bad
to say about America?

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.280
Because let me know.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.440
Because I'm sure all these
people and YouTube would love

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.250
to know what problem you've got
with the US of A, mister.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.930
Because I don't.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.780
And I've proven it with a title
that makes no sense.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.380
ERIC SCHMIDT: In this doctrine
of American exceptionalism,

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.590
right, which is I think what
the book is actually about.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.960
STEPHEN COLBERT: It is about and
that's the first chapter.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.160
It is the thesis statement,
American exceptionalism.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.597
Rules don't apply to us.

00:04:58.597 --> 00:05:03.440
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK, so if that's
true, how does America become

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.590
great if the rules don't
apply to us?

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.630
STEPHEN COLBERT: Buy the book.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.280
Every chapter tells us how to
return to what we already know

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.190
is the right thing, is to
reject socialism, reject

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.280
collectivism, and
go with the gut.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.380
We even have a chapter
just on food.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.090
Why America is the crispest,
crunchiest, most corn-fed

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.190
nation on earth.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.520
And if you are what you eat,
then just put a stick up our

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.770
butt, and we're all corn
dogs walking around.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.470
ERIC SCHMIDT: In preparing for
this book did you study the

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.050
amendments to the
Constitution?

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.215
And did you have any opinions
about the amendments?

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.775
STEPHEN COLBERT: I always have
opinions about the amendments

00:05:52.775 --> 00:05:53.720
of the Constitution.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.260
I mean everybody's got their
top, like what their top 10

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.300
amendments are.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.210
ERIC SCHMIDT: Do you have
a top you like?

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.996
STEPHEN COLBERT: My number
one would probably

00:05:59.996 --> 00:06:01.970
be the Second Amendment.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.273
And my number two
would probably

00:06:04.273 --> 00:06:06.100
be the First Amendment.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.730
And then probably my third
would be the Seventh.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.180
My fourth would be the 10th.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.996
Fifth would be the Ninth.

00:06:11.996 --> 00:06:13.270
Sixth would be the Eighth.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: Is everybody
writing this down?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.200
STEPHEN COLBERT: Yeah, get this
down, because I don't

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.720
have a rationale behind it.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.640
No, but there's nothing about
the Constitution in the book.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.800
ERIC SCHMIDT: But the
Constitution allows

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.230
this book to be.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.500
It's free speech.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.310
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well,
sure, no, no, no--

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.560
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.670
STEPHEN COLBERT: The Second
Amendment allows

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.300
this book to exist.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.510
ERIC SCHMIDT: The First
Amentment--

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.100
STEPHEN COLBERT: Because if
anybody stopped-- no, no, the

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.760
Second Amendment.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.130
Because if anybody stopped me
from publishing this book, I

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.380
would shoot them in the face.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.510
Do you understand me?

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.290
Do you understand me?

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.620
Are we clear?

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.670
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's
very, very clear.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.000
STEPHEN COLBERT: It does, the
Second Amendment guarantees

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.922
all other liberties.

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:53.260
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING]

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.710
AUDIENCE: Why did comedy,
kind of, become your

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:55.810
thing, do you think?

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.760
Or did comedy kind
of pick you?

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.380
STEPHEN COLBERT: Well, that's
a nice way of putting it.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.550
That's a nice way
of putting it.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:10.695
I would say, I can't under
emphasize how important comedy

00:07:10.695 --> 00:07:12.740
has been to my life.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.685
And how important certain
opportunities that came along

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.520
to my life, and many of them
seem sort of accidental.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.040
I went to college
to be an actor.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.980
But an actor, actor.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:23.830
I wore black and
I had a beard.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.310
I was like, let me share my
misery with you, you know.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.150
And then I accidentally met some
people from Second City

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.540
and took some classes there and
got invited to audition.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.110
And accidentally, just sort of a
happy accident, fell in with

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.460
some great people.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.730
And I quit Second
City four times.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.440
I kept on returning
to doing comedy.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.090
And I was backstage one night.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.170
And this is really the thing
that made the decision for me.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.550
Somebody was on stage, and they
were supposed to do a

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.790
very simple blackout.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.830
A blackout is a very short--
it's got one joke, and then

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:53.610
the lights go out.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.740
This is Second City.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.350
It's a pace keeper
for the show.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.370
She goes out there and the
blackout is this, she goes--

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.750
you're supposed to say, I'd like
to do a song for you now.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.240
Welcome to the No Exit Cafe.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.870
I'd like to do a song
for you right now.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.850
A song for the whales.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.600
And then you tune up your
guitar for a long time.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.440
This is a song for the whales.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.958
And then you go--

00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.874
[IMITATING WHALES]

00:08:16.874 --> 00:08:18.790
[CLICKING]

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:19.690
STEPHEN COLBERT: It's
very simple.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.610
You do whistle and clicks
and everything.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.140
It's fine.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:23.880
Not a great laugh.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.800
But it works every time.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.680
She goes out there to do it.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.610
I'd like to do a song
for you right now.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.540
I'd like to do a song
for you right now.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.280
She just goes into her whistling
and her clicking.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.480
And we're backstage waiting
to go on for the next

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.830
scene, me and Dave.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.130
And we said, it's not
getting any laughs.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.820
This is fool proof.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.720
No laughs at all.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.320
What's going on?

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.540
Something's wrong.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.815
And then she goes, oh, I forgot
it's song for whales.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.530
And we burst into laughter
backstage.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.780
And we threw our arms around
each other in the

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.930
agony of her failure.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:10.880
And just laughing, we fell
like a collapsing teepee.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.830
We just fell to the ground.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:16.460
And Dave's feet went out
onto stage, like this.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.000
As we held each other
like lovers.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.560
The most intimate, joyful
experience at her pain, that

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.520
we all knew.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.850
And she could hear it happen,
and the audience

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:27.600
could see our feet.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.020
And she started laughing
at how wonderfully

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.300
she had just failed.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.590
And I thought at that moment,
this is what I want.

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:42.930
If failure of this scale can
cause this much joy for any

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.730
one, then this is the healthiest
thing that I could

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.950
do with the rest of my life.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.060
And I will do nothing else.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.160
And I've never looked back
from that moment.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: Stephen Colbert,
thank you very much.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.710
STEPHEN COLBERT: Thank you.
