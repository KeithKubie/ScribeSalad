00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:08.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.520
Thanks, and thanks everybody.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.880
Welcome.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.740
Here we are post-coffee
break, so hopefully you're

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.520
all caffeinated
and full of energy.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.480
I know I'm a bit nervous
myself despite this being,

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.830
I think, I counted it's
the 27th GDC I've been to,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.540
and I think I've
spoken at the last 20.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.860
So I'm curious how many--
it's going to crush my ego--

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.490
but how many people
here have heard

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.880
me speak at a
conference somewhere?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.390
OK.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.170
Well, enough not
to crush my ego.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.630
But those of you
who don't know me,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.210
we've got this wonderful
service that Google runs.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.710
It's not a game,
but I think it's

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.120
like a search engine or
something, so go right ahead

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.010
and look me up there.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.250
I'm the Chief Game
Designer at Google,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.090
which is a wonderful title
my boss bestowed on me.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.850
Let's not make too much of that.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.629
I'm going to talk about
looking to the future,

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.390
and I'm going to do that
by looking to the past.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.010
I have the advantage
of, as I've said,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.490
being around for a very long
time in the games industry.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.790
I started making games
in 1980 professionally,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.350
and it really is
not so bad being

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.500
a dinosaur in the
games industry.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.380
We have a lot
going for us there.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.480
For one thing, if
you look back, there

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.720
was extinction 65 million
years ago, but some of us

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.590
are still around.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.506
I'm going to look even
farther back than that.

00:01:34.506 --> 00:01:37.750
540 million years ago, there was
something called the Cambrian

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.940
explosion.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.000
And it was shortly, in
geological terms, just

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.350
a very short time after
multicellular life started out.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.470
And within this
tiny amount of time,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.520
it just spread out into all
the different weird forms

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520
that you're seeing out there.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.040
Pretty amazing
variety of, kind of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.440
monstrous and pretty cool
science-fictional-looking

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.870
creatures and everything.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.300
And then there was some sort
of event, maybe an asteroid,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.190
nobody really knows for sure,
and many of them died out.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.449
In fact, only one of
those many creatures

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.380
you see there may have been
the ancestor of all of us here,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.600
and I won't even
go into which one.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.510
It's kind of humiliating
when you see which one it is.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.190
But the fact is that
eras rise and fall,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.700
and evolution, we've had many
things go up and then go down.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.160
And over time, it's actually not
that different than the cycles

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.170
that we've seen in
the games industry.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.440
So what can we learn from that?

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.890
Well, you look,
first of all, at how

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.450
there were these
games that came out,

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.320
and they were very
popular for a while,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.990
and then nobody heard of them.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.720
I was involved in the arcade
industry in the early '80s,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.800
and within a course
of just one year,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.530
we had 90% of our
audience just go away.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.600
It was really shocking.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.760
And realize that this was
early enough that there

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.330
was this sense of-- I had
people say, see, this profession

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.890
you think you've taken,
it's a little hobby that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.260
was hot for a while, and
now nobody cares about it.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.360
And luckily, computer
games started taking off,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.952
and the first Nintendo
came out right

00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:12.160
in the middle of that hole
when everybody was saying,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.310
oh, it can't possibly work.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.420
And of course, things
took off again.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.380
But, you know, consoles
have come and gone.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:18.629
There have been waves of them.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.260
Sega was big for a while and
got out of the console business.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.150
More recently, it seems that
this is going even faster.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.640
We had a huge wave
of social games

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.770
with 100 million people playing
on the same day for some

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.920
of these games,
numbers that were

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.580
mind-boggling to those
of us 20, 30 years ago.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.660
The indie movement, that
is going strong now.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.910
How many of you consider
yourself an indie developer?

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.410
OK.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.980
So it's almost
half the audience.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.130
And 5, 10 years ago, that would
have been a tiny fraction.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.635
It's become a really big thing.

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:54.593
Same thing with mobile.

00:03:54.593 --> 00:03:57.360
Mobile was a niche
for many years.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.640
I had friends who were
struggling with it around 2000.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.990
Smartphones came out, and
it just started to shoot up.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.520
And it's still increasing.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.840
If you look at the numbers,
I have to say particularly

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.450
for Android sales, it's
just amazing to see

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.860
what's going on out there.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.330
And, of course, tablets are
almost a brand new thing

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.320
by game industry terms and just
still going up in a great way.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.560
But that brings us
to the core of this,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.790
which is that-- it is
a bit of a cliche--

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.150
but the Chinese language
character for Crisis

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.890
is made up of the symbols
for danger and opportunity

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:32.850
together.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.760
And, of course,
it's pretty logical

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760
when you think about it.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.134
But let me break
it down in terms

00:04:37.134 --> 00:04:39.490
of what's going on in
our world right now.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.180
So a lot of dangers.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.160
Being a dinosaur
is pretty exciting,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.560
but you can end
up like our friend

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.170
here who's outside of
the Google offices.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.990
And I have to be careful
about what I say here,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.280
but I had a friend who just
told me about 10 minutes ago

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.940
that there's a cartoon
that explains it.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.870
The reason that
the T. Rex ended up

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.950
having those really
tiny arms is that it

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:02.512
was an early version
of Google Glass,

00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:03.970
and with all the
voice commands, he

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.630
didn't need to use those
arms anymore, and that's what

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.040
happened to him.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.190
Hopefully, that's not true.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.580
For one thing, I think--
well, we'll get into that.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.010
But having big teeth is
kind of a good thing, too.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.680
All right, anyway.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.930
A lot of people are wondering,
is this the last big console

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.440
cycle?

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.900
Are consoles having
their last heyday?

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.060
And it's been interesting,
because the sales

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.010
for the big AAA console
games, the top one

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.670
keeps going up and
up, particularly,

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.860
when you look at the sales in
just the first 24-hour period.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.860
It's amazing.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.580
But lots of things get really
big before they go away.

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.770
A lot of people are
very nervous about that.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:47.090
The social game boom, as I
said, we had 50, 100 million

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.180
monthly, even
daily, active users,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.610
and that's been-- it's certainly
not dead by any account,

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.090
but it's a very mature market,
and it's a dangerous one

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.130
to try and get into right now.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.230
Another dangerous
area is mobile,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.080
which was really wonderful.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.270
So many people-- even now,
you can make a Flappy Bird

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.750
and do incredibly well, but
usually it's the big companies.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.010
The production costs
and values have gone up.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.480
I just saw an
amazing presentation

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.740
from some of the Glu people
and boy, high production values

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.930
are going to be the norm
for a lot of mobile games.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.810
It's pretty scary
for that as well.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.750
And business models
are causing disruption.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.540
Free-to-play really took
a lot of us by surprise.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.140
Some people rode that wave up.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.970
Others have been slow to follow.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.070
Digital distribution,
same kind of thing.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.720
Great for a lot of people.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.960
Terrible for a lot of
brick-and-mortar companies

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.760
out there.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.210
Rentals are causing problems.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.300
And boy, imagine renting a
digitally free-to-play game.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.130
It's the apocalypse
coming together.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.240
So you never know what's
going to happen next.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.420
There's also, of course,
this amazing increasing

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.700
range of hardware out there.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.870
In my 35 years or so
in the games industry,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.880
I've never seen so many
different types of platforms.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.680
Everything-- well, I won't
even get into the range there,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.360
but even as that's
a scary thing,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.330
there's an opportunity
there at the same time.

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.720
We've never been
making more money.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.610
As an industry,
it's pretty amazing.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.400
And maybe even more
importantly than that,

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.830
it's never been more
popular and more widespread,

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.740
and I mean that both
in the global sense.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.590
We're all over the world now.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.130
There are tiny countries one
or two million population

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.660
that have three or
four game development

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.590
companies in them at this point.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.700
Very common all over.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.810
I just got an
invitation two days ago

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.820
to an African game developer
conference in Nigeria

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.520
this fall.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.930
Just stuff I never
would have expected.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.660
At least I think it's
a real conference.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:53.440
Now that I say that, I
have to check that out.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.620
We've also never been
so consequential.

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.130
A lot of the work that I
did before coming to Google

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.500
has been in the serious
game space, which is just

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.190
at the very beginning of the
tip of the iceberg of being

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.740
able to save lives, change
people's training, and the way

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:11.270
that they learn and just make
them happier and healthier

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.820
in many ways.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:16.550
We've never been so
connected in so many ways.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.570
Even sometimes almost
a neuromancer kind

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.710
of jacked-in thing.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:25.600
This is actually from a serious
game project here in UCSF

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.140
that Dr. Adam Gazzaley got on
the cover of "Nature" with.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.360
First time a video
game has ever been

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.950
on the cover of the
journal "Nature."

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.434
Really exciting stuff going
on all over the place.

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.809
We've never been on so many
different devices and screens

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:40.820
at once.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:47.970
And that's really just an
amazing thing for those of us

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:49.620
who have been
around a long time.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.240
And one of the
consequences of this

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.964
is that there is serious
analysis going on.

00:08:54.964 --> 00:08:57.130
Analytics are something
that's really big at Google.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.620
You've heard something
about that today

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.661
if you were here earlier.

00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:02.300
There are some more
going on later.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.450
And, of course, universities
are studying games and giving us

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.980
more information than
we've ever had before.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.910
So really exciting time.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.500
You have the danger, you
have the opportunity,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.210
but this causes
a lot of anxiety.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:15.900
Where do I go?

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.270
Where do I get this opportunity?

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.020
What's the right decision?

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.690
OK.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.860
I'm not going to give you
that answer, not exactly.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.110
But I'm going to talk
to you about, perhaps,

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.700
algorithms that
can help you there.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.650
To survive and thrive in
times of great change often

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:35.030
has been the case of the
cliche with the dinosaurs.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.600
The little mammals
came out there,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.830
and we and so many
other ecological niches

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.600
were colonized by that result.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.400
That's kind of a truism of
the way evolution works.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.980
Being flexible and
embracing change,

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.290
moving into these
new areas is often

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.525
a powerful winning strategy.

00:09:54.525 --> 00:09:56.650
Certainly, there are a lot
of the biggest companies

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.140
out there today that have
done that either a long time

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.730
ago or even quite recently.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.870
You think of
companies like King,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.830
for example, that seemingly
came out of nowhere

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.690
and now are incredibly
popular just because they

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.470
got into the right niche in the
right way at the right time.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.075
And something that's perhaps
the most important takeaway

00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:17.700
that you can have
from this whole talk,

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.160
I'm talking about evolution.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.850
And that's just an analogy.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.480
The reality is
with evolution, DNA

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.240
mutates over millions of years.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.080
Changes are slow.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.845
You can't choose
which DNA-- well,

00:10:27.845 --> 00:10:28.970
except maybe some bacteria.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.810
There's some
interesting ideas there.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.450
But better than bacteria, we can
actually make conscious choices

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.350
about what game ideas to take.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.220
What new areas to move in to.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.440
Where to explore.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.420
And I think that is probably the
single most important thing I

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.400
can tell you, is that you can
pick those ecosystems that you

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.840
wish to compete in.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.130
And Google is here to
help you with that.

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.740
If any of you've been to
some of the presentations

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.460
earlier today, and I
see some familiar faces,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.660
we've got some more
coming up that are

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:59.380
just great through
the end of the day.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:02.057
You can see that Google has
an amazing breadth of this.

00:11:02.057 --> 00:11:03.640
But that's something
you would expect.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.560
I mean, think about
what Google's into.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.240
We're known as a search
company, but we also

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.270
are doing all these
Cloud services that

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.740
have direct connection to games.

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.790
Fiber is spreading out and
getting higher bandwidth

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.160
into more and more households.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.350
Ads are a wonderful way
to monetize and fuel

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.699
the development of your games.

00:11:22.699 --> 00:11:24.490
And we're looking at
better and better ways

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.110
to make the ads more
effective for you.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.920
And as a game
developer, I always

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.210
look to make it non-invasive,
so that it can actually

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.610
help the player, and
they can welcome it.

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.040
Mobile, of course, with Android,
we've been doing quite a bit,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.860
but we're moving Android
into other areas.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.910
We've got Chrome on the desktop.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.410
There are TV initiatives.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.870
You've seen Android
micro-consoles out there.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.580
We've announced an
automotive initiative.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:58.230
Just today, our wearable
API was discussed online.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.610
Lots of new things.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.160
Can't talk about
the next ones just

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.330
yet, but you can count
on Google for releasing

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.920
all sorts of really wonderful
stuff as it goes on.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.650
So what's going to
go on in the future?

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.810
I can't tell you
about any one thing,

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.360
but I can tell you that there
are some solid suggestions

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.260
that I think will help you.

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:19.070
Being open-minded, because
it's hard to say where

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.220
the next hit will come
from, the strategy

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.520
that you need to pursue is
think globally, and not just

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.090
literally globally, but in
terms of the whole breadth

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:33.500
and depth of this sort of game
ecosystem continuum out there.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.670
Look for blue oceans.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.530
Look for areas that
are fertile, that

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.710
are opening up that
seem promising.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.580
And also that seem
promising for you.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.840
That each of you,
as an individual,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.160
for yourself, for
a company you may

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.570
work for, for a mega
corporation perhaps,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.460
there are all different
ranges of that,

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.220
but what works for
you in that sense

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:57.550
is where you are going
to compete effectively.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.432
So I can't answer this
because the answer's

00:12:59.432 --> 00:13:01.890
different for each one of you,
but as somebody who survived

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:04.310
in this industry since it
was radically different,

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.130
you move from one
thing to another.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.690
And if you're open to learn
and change and thrive,

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.970
then you're going to do well
with that sort of thing.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.150
Being agile and
iterative is also

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.670
a strategy that always works.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.480
If you stick with something--
I have an artist friend

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.390
who had one way of art
rendering in the 8-bit days,

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.800
and he was the best
in the world at it.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.034
Probably still is, because
nobody does that anymore.

00:13:26.034 --> 00:13:27.700
And he moved out of
art because of that.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.540
So if you want to
stay relevant, you

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.950
have to keep iterating and
move around as you need to.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.480
So you diversify as much as
practical even if it's just

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.250
a little bit, but
not too much for you.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.440
You don't want to become
a total generalist,

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.110
and yet, it's amazing over
time how many different things

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.210
you can learn.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.700
So those are some
of the basic tips.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.270
The last one I want
to leave you with

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.780
is don't bet against
the internet.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.238
This is something that's been
driven home to me quite a bit

00:13:52.238 --> 00:13:56.314
recently, is that it's
not quite pervasive yet.

00:13:56.314 --> 00:13:58.480
There are places you can
go where you're not online,

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.370
or you're not online reliably,
like maybe at a crowded Moscone

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.740
Center with a bunch of
techno nerds next to you.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:06.530
But it's getting
better and better.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.136
And the very fact that you're
able to get online at all,

00:14:09.136 --> 00:14:10.760
and that it's getting
better each year,

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.910
is something that is going
to continue as we go.

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.080
And finally, let
Google help you.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.680
We've really been doing
a lot in this area.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.730
I am a long-time game developer.

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.850
I can say from now,
an inside view,

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.410
it's amazing how much
Google is doing with games

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.870
and how involved and
committed the company

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.380
is to helping game developers,
and I'm looking forward

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.440
to seeing that continue.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.104
So that's my extent
of my inspiration.

00:14:37.104 --> 00:14:38.895
I hope you'll stick
around for an afternoon

00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:40.020
of some great talks.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.770
And we're rounding up with my
friend and boss R.J. Michael

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.330
at the end of the day.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:46.945
Stick around.

00:14:46.945 --> 00:14:47.570
Don't miss him.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.710
He's always a great show.

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.480
Thanks very much.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.060
This is how you can
contact me if you

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.410
want to get in touch
with me later on,

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.290
and have a good day and a great
GDC for the next few days.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.410
Thank you everybody.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:04.694
[APPLAUSE]
