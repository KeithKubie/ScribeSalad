00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:07.800
It's always very illuminating to go back in time and look at the thought pieces

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.350
from computer visionaries, and particular I want to draw your attention to this

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.360
memorandum that was done back in 1963 that talks about intergalactic computer

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.290
networks. I encourage you to do a web search and get this document and read it.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.600
Here is another one this document talks about the first time

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.390
computers talk to one another. The first computer to computer communication back

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.990
in October 29th, 1969. Now this is considered the

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.020
first ever email that was written by Ray Tomlinson

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.450
from BBN Technologies back in 1971, and with all the junk mail that

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.290
is floating around, you might be wondering why

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.800
email was invented in the first place, but

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.320
it is a useful tool when it is not junk. This is a log book that was

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.240
maintained by professor Leonard Kleinrock of UCLA who is considered

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.590
one of the networking pioneers. And, this log book records

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.580
the first time there was a computer to computer communication. A call was made

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.330
from UCLA to Stanford Research Institute. Host to host communication recorded

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.420
on October 29th, 1969. And this is the first ever computer to computer

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.910
communication. Here is another interesting chart. This chart shows all the

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.760
computers in the world in one chart. March of 1977. This is your

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.160
entire internet on one chart back in 1977. And

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:54.070
the model of a computer system back in 1975 was, you had a mainframe

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.940
computer, which consisted of a CPU, memory, and I/O devices like a disk, and

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.810
you have cathode ray terminals through which users can connect to the CPU

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.840
and use the CPU in a time-shared manner. So this was the model of the computer.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.730
Back in 1975. Note that I'm not showing any connection to any network here. The

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.970
reason I'm giving you this buildup with all the first in computer technology and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.850
the model of the computer system, is because the seminal paper by Jerome Swalser

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.840
identifies terminologies, you and I know, as

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.400
current day issues. Examples include denial of service,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.760
firewalls, sandboxing, objects, and so on.
