00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.516
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You had so much
to offer yesterday. You okay?

00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:05.596
&gt;&gt;Aiden: I'm tired.

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:06.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So what's going on?

00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:08.500
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: Strong 
relationships are

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:10.466
central to the learning process.

00:00:16.506 --> 00:00:18.436
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: What the science of
learning and development tells us is

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:23.046
that we need to create learning
environments, which allow for strong,

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:28.086
long-term relationships for
children to become attached to school

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.586
and to the adults and
other children in it.

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:42.336
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: When children have
experiences of closeness and consistency

00:00:42.336 --> 00:00:45.116
and trust, oxytocin is released.

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:51.336
And oxytocin has many, many positive
effects on the development of the brain.

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:54.926
So when we think about a
relationship, we're not just talking

00:00:55.236 --> 00:00:57.236
about being nice to a child.

00:00:57.706 --> 00:01:01.916
We're talking about a child
having an experience of attunement

00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:07.566
and trust strong enough to
release the hormone oxytocin.

00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:10.596
&gt;&gt;Falon: Good morning, Ariella!
How are you doing today?

00:01:10.776 --> 00:01:13.456
&gt;&gt;Falon: The purpose of the morning
greeting is to connect with them

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:17.546
and to just make sure that
I'm seeing them as humans.

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:21.066
Like I'm making that relationship
with them, making that bond.

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:25.616
&gt;&gt;Catherine: I prioritize
relationship building, because getting

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:27.206
to know them is the best
part of the job.

00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:30.696
&gt;&gt;Salma: When I come in in the
morning, we usually talk about things

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:32.226
that are happening in our community.

00:01:32.596 --> 00:01:34.956
&gt;&gt;Catherine: We're trying
to build caring and respect.

00:01:35.036 --> 00:01:40.136
&gt;&gt;Salma: Teacher is trying to understand
who I am, and my values as a person.

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:41.926
&gt;&gt;Kirsten: When I have a
free 45 minutes or an hour,

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:45.706
I think to myself I could sit down
and catch up on grading, or I could go

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:50.666
and make connections, whether it's
a smile, or a joke, or a reminder,

00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:53.016
it validates their presence
in the building.

00:01:53.176 --> 00:01:54.800
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Rock it out in the art room.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.586
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: It starts from so much
honest and transparency with kids.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:03.406
It's really easy to strive
to be this like idealized,

00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:05.986
always ready to go, elementary
school teacher.

00:02:05.986 --> 00:02:09.156
And that's not real,
and that's not human.

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:10.436
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: When people start talking

00:02:10.436 --> 00:02:14.256
about other things while I'm still 
giving direction, it feels frustrating

00:02:14.256 --> 00:02:16.266
for me, and I have to take a breath.
[deep breath]

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:21.566
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: My students connect most with
me when they see that I also struggle,

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:22.996
and I also have challenges.

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:26.426
It takes a lot of vulnerability
on my part.

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:30.866
&gt;&gt;Bobby: When that student
knows that you care about them,

00:02:31.476 --> 00:02:35.226
when they know that you're a
human, their academic performance

00:02:35.226 --> 00:02:36.396
in your class is going to be better.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:40.536
&gt;&gt;Cassidy: If I'm comfortable
around them then I'm more confident

00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:44.876
around them, and it's easier to
ask questions and things like that.

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:47.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So when you're
looking at this graph,

00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:48.856
what is it that you think happened?

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:51.056
&gt;&gt;Aiden: Some teachers I don't
always get along with the best.

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:54.636
So at times, I'm like, "I can't do
it!" So I'm just not going to do it.

00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:58.216
But when I like the teacher,
I want to do their work.

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:00.596
And I'll be like, "I can learn this."

00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:03.276
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You all have
done outstanding work.

00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:07.476
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Emotion and learning
are completely connected.

00:03:07.476 --> 00:03:08.336
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Very good!

00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:11.606
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: If you're in a positive
emotional space, if you feel good

00:03:11.606 --> 00:03:13.166
about yourself, your teacher.

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:17.966
That actually opens up the
opportunity for more learning.

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:19.426
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good to see you.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.500
&gt;&gt;Girl: Today, uhm.
