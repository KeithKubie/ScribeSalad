00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.530
At this point you need to
finish installing Xcode.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.740
So if you haven't yet,
pause this video and

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.450
take a moment to finish
the installation.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.440
Since I already have Xcode installed,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.850
I'm ready to launch
the Maze application.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.120
To launch the app we need to first
launch Xcode, and you can do this by

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.980
clicking on the spotlight icon, in
the top righthand corner of the screen.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.560
Or optionally you can hit Cmd+Space, and

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.362
that'll bring up the same
spotlight search.

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:30.007
And then type xcode.

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.305
This will bring up
the Xcode launch screen.

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:35.513
&gt;From the launch screen you can
create new Xcode projects,

00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:39.110
open existing projects,
or create a playground.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.500
We won't quite be using playgrounds yet,
but they're a great tool for

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.410
experimenting and writing swift code.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.300
For now you want to open
an existing Xcode project,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.800
the Maze project to be precise.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.790
We've created the Maze project
ahead of time for you.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.366
So if you haven't downloaded it already,
go ahead and

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.501
download it first before
continuing ahead.

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.695
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:04.794
Once you've downloaded the project and
saved it somewhere on your computer,

00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:08.970
select Open another project, and then
you'll want to navigate to the project.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.508
So I've saved it on my desktop.

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:13.810
And you want to open up
the Xcode project file.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.310
And we'll give it a second to load and
here we go.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.370
This is Xcode.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.950
It's a huge application, so we'll
start taking it one piece at a time.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.970
To run the Maze application
click on the play button

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.180
in the upper lefthand corner
of the Xcode interface.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.160
You may also hear this button
referred to as the Run button.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.240
This will launch the iOS
simulator with the Maze app.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.300
And there we go.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.710
Congratulations, you've
launched your first app.
