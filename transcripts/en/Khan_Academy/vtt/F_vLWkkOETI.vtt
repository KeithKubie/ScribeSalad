00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Instructor] What we
will introduce ourselves to

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.840
in this video is the
notion of electric circuits

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.550
and Ohm's law, which you can view

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.430
as the most fundamental law

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.449
or the most basic law or simplest law

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.580
when we are dealing with circuits.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.521
And it connects the ideas of voltage,

00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:20.960
which we will get more
of a intuitive idea for

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.500
in a second, and current,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.560
which is denoted by capital letter I,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.380
I guess to avoid confusion
if they used a capital C

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.010
with the coulomb.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.213
And what connects these two
is the notion of resistance.

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:37.130
Resistance,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.280
that is denoted with the capital letter R.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.240
And just to cut to the chase,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.920
the relationship between these

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.630
is a pretty simple mathematical one.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.797
It is that voltage is equal to current

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.510
times resistance or
another way to view it,

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.120
if you divide both sides by resistance,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.910
you get that current is equal to voltage

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.730
divided by resistance.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.740
Voltage divided by resistance.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.270
But intuitively, what is voltage?

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.630
What is current?

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.590
And what is resistance?

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.140
And what are the units for them

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.071
so that we can make sense of this?

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:22.100
So to get an intuition
for what these things are

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.330
and how they relate, let's
build a metaphor using

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.588
the flow of water, which
isn't a perfect metaphor,

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:32.930
but it helps me at least
understand the relationship

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.460
between voltage, current, and resistance.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.680
So let's say I have this
vertical pipe of water,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.400
it's closed at the bottom right now,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.750
and it's all full of water.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.510
There's water above here as well.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.379
So the water in the pipe,

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:49.800
so let's say the water right over here,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.980
it's gonna have some potential energy.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.730
And this potential energy, as we will see,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.270
it is analogous to voltage.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.437
Voltage is electric
potential, electric potential.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.020
Now it isn't straight up potential energy,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.230
it's actually potential
energy per unit charge.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.100
So let me write that.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.270
Potential energy per unit,

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.010
unit charge.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.180
You could think of it as joules,
which is potential energy,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.660
or units of energy per coulomb.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.530
That is our unit charge.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.697
And the units for voltage
in general is volts.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.160
Now, let's think about what would happen

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.070
if we now open the bottom of this pipe.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.730
So we open this up.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.563
What's gonna happen?

00:02:38.563 --> 00:02:42.220
Well, the water's immediately
gonna drop straight down.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.300
That potential energy
is gonna be converted

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.850
to kinetic energy.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.410
And you could look at a
certain part of the pipe

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.910
right over here, right over here.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.743
And you could say, well,

00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:54.867
how much water is flowing per unit time?

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.480
And that amount of water that is flowing

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.150
through the pipe at that point

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.950
in a specific amount of time,

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.280
that is analogous to current.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.330
Current is the amount of charge,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.060
so we could say charge per unit time.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.800
Q for charge,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.900
and t for time.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.320
And intuitively you could say,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.487
how much, how much charge

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.780
flowing,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.420
flowing past

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.290
a point in a circuit, a point in

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.123
circuit

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.780
in a, let's say, unit of time,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.460
we could think of it as a second.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.670
And so you could also think
about it as coulombs per second,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.990
charge per unit time.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.870
And the idea of resistance
is something could just keep

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.440
that charge from flowing at
an arbitrarily high rate.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.070
And if we want to go back
to our water metaphor,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.080
what we could do is, we
could introduce something

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.180
that would impede the water,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.320
and that could be a narrowing of the pipe.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.850
And that narrowing of the pipe

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.490
would be analogous to resistance.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.230
So in this situation, once again,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.690
I have my vertical water pipe,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:15.880
I have opened it up,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.040
and you still would have
that potential energy,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.690
which is analogous to voltage,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.380
and it would be converted
to kinetic energy,

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.250
and you would have a flow
of water through that pipe,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.040
but now at every point in this pipe,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.400
the amount of water that's flowing past

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.890
at a given moment of
time is gonna be lower,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.840
because you have literally this
bottleneck right over here.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.840
So this narrowing is
analogous to resistance.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.280
How

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.840
much

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840
charge

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.810
flow

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.850
impeded,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.170
impeded.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.520
And the unit here is the ohm,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.000
is the ohm,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.560
which is denoted with
the Greek letter omega.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.450
So now that we've defined these things

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.710
and we have our metaphor,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.290
let's actually look at
an electric circuit.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.620
So first, let me construct a battery.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.800
So this is my battery.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.380
And the convention is my negative terminal

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.700
is the shorter line here.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.220
So I could say that's
the negative terminal,

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.390
that is the positive terminal.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.280
Associated with that battery,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.020
I could have some voltage.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.910
And just to make this tangible,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.470
let's say the voltage

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.720
is equal to 16 volts across this battery.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.650
And so one way to think about it is

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.300
the potential energy per unit charge,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.760
let's say we have electrons here

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.620
at the negative terminal,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.900
the potential energy per
coulomb here is 16 volts.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.400
These electrons, if they have a path,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.120
would go to the positive terminal.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.992
And so we can provide a path.

00:05:54.992 --> 00:05:56.920
Let me draw it like this.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.470
At first, I'm gonna not
make the path available

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.630
to the electrons, I'm gonna
have an open circuit here.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.380
I'm gonna make this path

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.380
for the electrons.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.370
And so as long as our
circuit is open like this,

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.150
this is actually analogous
to the closed pipe.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.440
The electrons, there is
no way for them to get

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.300
to the positive terminal.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.142
But if we were to close the
circuit right over here,

00:06:21.142 --> 00:06:23.940
if we were to close it,
then all of a sudden,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.660
the electrons could begin
to flow through this circuit

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.510
in an analogous way to the way

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.237
that the water would flow down this pipe.

00:06:33.237 --> 00:06:35.900
Now when you see a
schematic diagram like this,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.400
when you just see these lines,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.325
those usually denote something
that has no resistance.

00:06:40.325 --> 00:06:42.090
But that's very theoretical.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.670
In practice, even a very simple
wire that's a good conductor

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.640
would have some resistance.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.545
And the way that we denote
resistance is with a jagged line.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:55.990
And so let me draw resistance here.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.910
So that is how we denote
it in a circuit diagram.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.210
Now let's say the resistance
here is eight ohms.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.320
So my question to you is,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.860
given the voltage and
given the resistance,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.230
what will be the current
through this circuit?

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.170
What is the rate at which
charge will flow past

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.540
a point in this circuit?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.892
Pause this video and try to figure it out.

00:07:18.892 --> 00:07:21.160
Well, to answer that question,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.400
you just have to go to Ohm's law.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.990
We wanna solve for current,
we know the voltage,

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.570
we know the resistance.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:31.770
So the current in this example
is going to be our voltage

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.230
which is 16 volts,
divided by our resistance

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.850
which is eight ohms.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.510
And so this is going to be 16 divided

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.470
by eight is equal to two

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.600
and the units for our current,

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.080
which is charge per unit
time, coulombs per second,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.140
you could say two coulombs per second,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.660
or you could say amperes.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.000
And we can denote
amperes with a capital A.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.260
We talked about these electrons flowing,

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.710
and you're gonna have two coulombs worth

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.650
of electrons flowing per second

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.440
past any point on this circuit.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.900
And it's true at any point,

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.270
same reason that we saw over here.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.985
Even though it's wider up
here and it's narrower here,

00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:18.010
because of this bottleneck,
the same amount of water

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.590
that flows through this
part of the pipe in a second

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.650
would have to be the same
amount that flows through

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.620
that part of the pipe in a second.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.760
And that's why for this circuit,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.540
for this very simple circuit,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.600
the current that you would
measure at that point,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.853
this point, and this point,
would all be the same.

00:08:32.853 --> 00:08:34.582
But there is a quirk.

00:08:34.582 --> 00:08:36.830
Pause this video and think
about what do you think

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:38.780
would be the direction for the current?

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.410
Well, if you knew about electrons

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.340
and what was going on,

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.250
you would say, well, the
electrons are flowing

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.580
in this direction.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.490
And so for this electric current,

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.372
I would say that it was flowing in,

00:08:49.372 --> 00:08:52.970
I would denote the
current going like that.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.340
Well, it turns out that
the convention we use

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.930
is the opposite of that.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.580
And that's really a historical quirk.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.756
When Benjamin Franklin was
first studying circuits,

00:09:02.756 --> 00:09:05.540
he did not know about electrons.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.940
They would be discovered
roughly 150 years later.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.390
He just knew that what he
was labeling as charge,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.710
and he arbitrarily labeled
positive and negative,

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.020
he just knew they were opposites,

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.800
he knew something like charge was flowing.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.660
And so, in his studies of electricity,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.220
he denoted current as going

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.770
from the positive to
the negative terminal.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.460
And so we still use that convention today,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.420
even though that is the
opposite of the direction

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.750
of the flow of electrons.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.520
And as we will see later on,

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.511
current doesn't always involve electrons.

00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:42.130
And so this current here is going to be

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.220
a two ampere current.
