00:00:06.972 --> 00:00:10.458
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:14.111
 

00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:15.860
JACQUELINE FULLER:
Well, welcome everyone.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.900
So great to see
everybody here to welcome

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.120
a very special guest,
Mr. Dikembe Mutombo.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.782
Let's have another
round of applause.

00:00:25.782 --> 00:00:32.049
 

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.400
Dikembe's taking
the time to be here.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.920
And before we get started--
I'll introduce him--

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.000
but before that,
let me just say,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.560
there's going to be another
opportunity for those of you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.850
think you got a little game.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.366
We're going to be over at--

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:53.712
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:55.049
 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.340
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: There will be.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740
I'm going to be there too.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.620
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.930
Justin's been trash talking.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750
And so that guy
right there, that's

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.319
the one you need to stuff.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:10.170
So Sasha, what time is
that over at Garfield?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.045
FEMALE SPEAKER: 2:30.

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:11.840
JACQUELINE FULLER: 2:30, OK.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.423
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Can
you let them know

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:14.930
that I brought my shoes too?

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.096
JACQUELINE FULLER: Oh, yeah.

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.756
He brought his game, and
he brought his shoes.

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:20.130
So we hope to see
everyone there.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.920
And we have Badge
to donate stations

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.374
to help support the work that
Dikembe is doing in Congo.

00:01:26.374 --> 00:01:28.540
We'll talk a little bit
more about that in a minute.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.270
But make sure that you do
that at the tables here,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.880
and we'll have them
at Garfield, as well.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.380
Well, let me start by just doing
an introduction of the man who

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.640
needs no introduction.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.610
So I am Jacqueline Fuller,
and I run google.org,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.590
which is Google's philanthropy.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.550
And this is Dikembe Mutombo,
and he was born in--

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.133
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Dikembe Mutombo
Mpolondo Mukamba Jean-Jacques

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.840
Wamutombo.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.660
I thought you were going to
introduce me with my man names.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.200
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.470
Wait, Nick, that
wasn't in the briefing.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.680
That was not in the briefing.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.270
Can you say that one more time?

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.480
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Dikembe Mutombo
Mplondo Mukamba Jean-Jacques

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.459
Wamutombo.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.500
JACQUELINE FULLER: Right?

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.650
Welcome Dikembe.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.270
 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.700
So a little bit of background.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.300
He was born in Kinshasa
and arrived in the US

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.860
from the Democratic Republic
of Congo, which I'll just

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.640
refer to as Congo, in 1987,
on an academic scholarship

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.680
to Georgetown University.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.944
So I can't believe
this is a true story,

00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:37.110
but tell me if this is true.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.780
So when he was in his
second year at Georgetown,

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.390
the famous coach,
John Thompson, saw you

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.540
and invited you to try out for
the university's basketball

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.040
team.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.520
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.811
JACQUELINE FULLER: That's true?

00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:49.980
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.910
JACQUELINE FULLER: So
he played a little ball

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.110
while he was at
Georgetown, and also found

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.440
the time to graduate with
dual degrees in linguistics

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.610
and diplomacy.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.315
And as a linguist, he's
fluent in nine languages.

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:07.190
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.148
JACQUELINE FULLER: Wow.

00:03:08.148 --> 00:03:09.420
So what are those languages?

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.660
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: I speak
English, French, Portuguese,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.250
a little bit of Spanish, and
all the African dialects.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.420
JACQUELINE FULLER: Wow.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.900
Not too bad.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.032
I have a little bit of
high school French myself.

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:22.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.580
So looking at his basketball
resume, let's start there.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.830
So he was drafted fourth
overall by the Denver Nuggets.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.430
He was an eight
time NBA all-star.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.600
He was a four time defensive
player of the year.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.700
He had the second most
blocked shots in NBA history.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.654
AUDIENCE: Woo, woo.

00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:49.820
JACQUELINE FULLER: Including,
as he told me outside,

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.444
when I let him know
I was from Seattle--

00:03:52.444 --> 00:03:53.866
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
Oh, there we go.

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:54.630
I apologize.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.130
JACQUELINE FULLER: 35
blocked shots against Seattle

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.270
in like five games, huh Justin?

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.310
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: I apologize
again if you're from Seattle.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.635
I really didn't mean it.

00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:07.500
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.260
I think he meant it.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.400
And then you retired from
the Houston Rockets in 2009,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.050
and just a few months
ago, was elected

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.600
to the NBA Hall of Fame.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:25.150
So we have an NBA Hall
of Famer with us today.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.400
And in fact, I think
we have a quick clip

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.070
to show of some of those
blocked shots, perhaps.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.320
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Let's see.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.990
I love to watch myself.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.615
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:43.870
 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.474
Is all of them against me?

00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:46.140
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.708
-Number 55!

00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:48.124
JACQUELINE FULLER:
Let's hope not.

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:49.612
-Dikembe Mutombo!

00:04:49.612 --> 00:04:50.604
-Get out of the way!

00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:53.580
Here comes Dikembe!

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.068
Deke!

00:04:55.068 --> 00:04:57.548
Mutombo's in.

00:04:57.548 --> 00:05:01.016
-Tumbo rolls in,
count it, and a foul.

00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:01.516
-Oh!

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:03.004
 

00:05:03.004 --> 00:05:04.988
-This could be his first shot.

00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:05.980
It is!

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.948
-Dikembe said, no,
not in my house.

00:05:09.948 --> 00:05:12.924
-Tumbo goes baseline
and throws it down.

00:05:12.924 --> 00:05:14.412
--[INAUDIBLE] tried
to do a 1-on-1.

00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:16.892
Watch as Dikembe reloads it.

00:05:16.892 --> 00:05:18.876
He knew Dikembe was there.

00:05:18.876 --> 00:05:20.860
-And Mutombo, with a foul.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.852
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:24.981
And Dikembe erases it!

00:05:24.981 --> 00:05:27.230
-It's an inside to bank it,
[INAUDIBLE] comes to help.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.446
Dikembe rejects it!

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:33.937
-Second all time shot
blocker in NBA history.

00:05:33.937 --> 00:05:35.434
-Nice play, Dikembe.

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:36.432
Hello!

00:05:36.432 --> 00:05:38.427
-To Rogers again,
great position.

00:05:38.427 --> 00:05:38.927
Oh!

00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:42.420
Dikembe flies in
and puts it down.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.913
-One of the great upsets
in NBA playoff history.

00:05:45.913 --> 00:05:48.780
-Dikembe Mutombo, one of
the great human beings

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.404
of the National
Basketball Association.

00:05:50.404 --> 00:05:52.400
A guy you got to love.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.620
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.292
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:58.292 --> 00:05:59.210
 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.040
JACQUELINE FULLER: So
Dikembe and I met recently.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.520
We were on a panel
together, but I was just

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.310
reminding him outside that
actually, funny story.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.420
When I first met Dikembe,
it was several years ago,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.545
and I was at a Clinton
Global Initiative gathering.

00:06:13.545 --> 00:06:15.253
And there is a special
meaning for people

00:06:15.253 --> 00:06:17.500
who cared about the Congo
and were doing work there.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.156
And we were in this really
small, hot, stuffed hotel room.

00:06:22.156 --> 00:06:24.530
We were all crammed in there
and talking about the Congo.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.000
And he spoke so
eloquently about the work

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.310
that he was doing there.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.610
I was so impressed,
and I'm on the board

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.385
of a group that works in Congo.

00:06:34.385 --> 00:06:37.771
And then about a year later,
I mentioned him to somebody,

00:06:37.771 --> 00:06:39.270
or someone mentioned
his name to me.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.080
And I said, right.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.704
I know Dikembe.

00:06:40.704 --> 00:06:43.354
I've actually spoken with
him, the philanthropist?

00:06:43.354 --> 00:06:45.895
And they looked at me like, and
he plays a little basketball.

00:06:45.895 --> 00:06:48.620
 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.030
So I think from that
highlight reel, many of you

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.480
are aware of what he's done
in the world of basketball.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.940
But you may not be as aware
that he is one of the leading

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.250
global philanthropists,
and really, someone who has

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.330
set the bar for elite
athletes, in terms

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.850
of what it means to give back.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.830
So let me just share a little
bit about what he's done there.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:14.990
So he has visited, for example,
Somali refugee camps with CARE,

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.700
an NGO run by Dr. Helene Gayle,
a mutual friend actually,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.830
of both of ours.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.210
He's worked with the
UN, including the UNDP.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.070
He's on the advisory
board of the National

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.540
Institutes of Health.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.380
He's been a tireless champion
for a range of organizations,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.890
including Opportunity
International,

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.310
Special Olympics, UNICEF.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:39.010
And in fact, a few years
back, the NBA commissioner,

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:45.180
David Stern, actually created
a new position for Dikembe

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.132
as the NBA global ambassador.

00:07:48.132 --> 00:07:50.340
And so in this role, he
travels throughout the world,

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.150
and helping to
grow, and celebrate

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.020
the game of basketball
through several events,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.710
including Basketball
Without Borders.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.400
But he has not only
been a champion

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.390
of other organizations, and is
not only the global ambassador

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.890
for the NBA, but he also
established his own foundation,

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.630
which he has given
very generously

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.420
from his own resources.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.660
And his foundation,
for more than 20 years,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.770
has improved health,
education, and quality of life

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.700
for the people in the Congo.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.070
And in particular,
there's a hospital there

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.550
that you established.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.010
And its named for
your mother-- Biamba?

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.300
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Biamba Marie.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.890
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah,
Biambo Marie Mutombo Hospital

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.880
in the Congo.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.690
So it's a 170 bed facility.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.450
It cost about $29
million to build.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.169
And when it was built, it
was the first new hospital

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.660
built there in 40 years.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.602
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:08:45.602 --> 00:08:47.060
JACQUELINE FULLER:
And his hospital

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.390
was treated more
than 100,000 people

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.480
since it was established.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.050
So why don't we roll
our second video

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.368
and get a little
more background.

00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:58.813
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:58.813 --> 00:09:02.236
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:02.236 --> 00:09:47.400
 

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:50.990
-Join us and help us
realize our dream,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.914
improving health, education,
and quality of life.

00:09:54.914 --> 00:09:55.935
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:55.935 --> 00:09:57.560
JACQUELINE FULLER:
So we've established

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.410
that Dikembe is a world class
athlete, NBA Hall of Famer.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.940
He is a world class
philanthropist.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.400
But there's also one
other role potentially

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.794
that you might play that
people may not be aware of.

00:10:10.794 --> 00:10:11.718
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:11.718 --> 00:10:15.170
-If anything ever
happens to the guy that

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.863
does the voice of
Cookie Monster,

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:21.380
I can sleep at night,
knowing we have

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.058
Dikembe Mutombo as a back up.

00:10:24.058 --> 00:10:25.986
[END PLAYBACK]

00:10:25.986 --> 00:10:26.950
 

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.324
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:30.324 --> 00:10:32.252
 

00:10:32.252 --> 00:10:35.940
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: I
didn't know that.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.590
That was funny.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.950
JACQUELINE FULLER: I
sleep better at night

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.050
knowing that now as well, too.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.110
So let's jump in
Dikembe, and just talk

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.720
a little bit about the
work that you're doing.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.950
So giving back is clearly a very
important part of your life.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.470
I heard in an interview
recently that you've

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.580
brought your kids to the
hospital and worked there.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.500
So what first inspired
you to do this?

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.300
Because not all professional
athletes use their resources

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.082
and use their spotlight
to do this kind of thing.

00:11:02.082 --> 00:11:06.210
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: To
me, it was something

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.900
I've seen from childhood.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.480
I think I just got sick
and tired to see people

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.550
dying at a young age in Africa.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:19.100
So growing up in that
type of environment,

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.830
where you see people
dying all the time,

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:24.429
so definitely becoming
a natural thing,

00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:25.720
that it just happened everyday.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.320
 

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.365
So when I got a chance to be
in the shoes that I have on,

00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:36.100
I saw that I can go
and make a difference.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.100
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:41.840
And you brought your kids there,
and made a family endeavor?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.530
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.960
I am trying to pass the torch
to my beautiful three children.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.130
I have my daughter
and my two boys.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.290
My wife and I, we are
making sure that one day,

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:57.810
when we are not here, that
our children can keep on

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.700
with this great legacy
that we have set on

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.670
and that was passed
on to our parents.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:03.040
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.202
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: So I
think we're setting up

00:12:04.202 --> 00:12:05.530
a good example for them.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.530
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.580
So as a philanthropist,
and there's so many

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:11.990
causes out there calling
for your attention.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.316
How do you choose which
ones you're going to do?

00:12:15.316 --> 00:12:16.690
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
I think you have

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.190
to look at a course
that touches your heart.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.880
You cannot just wake up in
the morning and say, OK.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.750
I'm going to get my
money here, there.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.510
But it's always good to
give the money on something

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.022
you believe in, on something
that you're making sure

00:12:33.022 --> 00:12:34.730
that it is making a
difference, is having

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.504
an impact on our
society, and that

00:12:37.504 --> 00:12:38.670
are becoming very important.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.460
I always tell all of my friends,
don't just give the money

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.860
and run away.

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.470
Give the money, but also want
to know where's your money's

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.270
going.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.530
That's very important.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:53.080
I think for me, I knew where
I was giving my $25 million,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.740
where it was going, and what
was going to happen to it,

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.847
how much difference my money
was going to make in society.

00:13:00.847 --> 00:13:02.680
JACQUELINE FULLER: When
we were on the panel

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.010
together in Florida,
someone asked a question

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.730
about how can I know an
effective organization

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.700
to give to?

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.120
And you said, give to mine.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.660
You essentially said,
make sure when you give,

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.370
that you're supporting
something where

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.020
people are visiting regularly.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.460
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.501
JACQUELINE FULLER: They're
following the metrics,

00:13:21.501 --> 00:13:23.590
and that you have
evidence and proof

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:25.690
of changed lives for money.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:28.145
And you get that
through your work?

00:13:28.145 --> 00:13:29.020
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.150
And I've been challenging
more so my donors, especially

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.140
those who believe in my vision.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.390
It's good for you to give
me money all the time.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.890
I say, thank you so much.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.740
But if there's a
possibility in your life

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.970
to spend that you can take
even one day of your life

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.720
and take a trip with me
where I'm doing my work,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.920
that would be so meaningful
to me and to our organization

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.420
than anything else, that you
believe in what you're doing

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.380
than instead of just
giving us the money.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.646
And that's good.

00:14:00.646 --> 00:14:01.770
JACQUELINE FULLER: Perfect.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:03.144
Well, maybe we
have some Googlers

00:14:03.144 --> 00:14:06.270
who are interested in learning
more about your hospital

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.902
and eventually, going to visit.

00:14:08.902 --> 00:14:11.360
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Maybe put the
drone on top of my hospital,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.480
so I can see everyday
what's going on.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.700
JACQUELINE FULLER:
Oh, we don't-- Justin,

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.170
we're not doing that, right?

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.350
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Justin
says we can do it.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.227
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:25.560
So one of the causes that I
know is really near and dear

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.315
to you also is the
Special Olympics.

00:14:27.315 --> 00:14:28.190
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.650
JACQUELINE FULLER: And Google
is working with Dikembe on this,

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:35.330
because he's going to
bring Congolese athletes,

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.680
Special Olympians over to
the World Games this summer.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.640
And we're going to have more
than 300 Googlers volunteering.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.690
Disability is a big focus
for google.org this year.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:48.090
So what would you let people
know about Special Olympics,

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:50.950
and why it's something
you've chosen to invest in.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:55.250
Do you have any favorite
stories from your interactions?

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.526
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: First,
I'm glad you brought it up.

00:14:57.526 --> 00:14:59.310
I think the Special
Olympics is one

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.020
of the great and
wonderful organizations

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.506
for any one of you that
can take part of it.

00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:09.570
I just love the organization.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:14.060
I love those wonderful athletes.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.150
I don't call them just children,
because we do have some of them

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.860
are a little bit older.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.740
I love their courage.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.906
I love their spirit.

00:15:24.906 --> 00:15:27.500
I love their parents
and people who

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.645
are very supportive for those
accolades from the day they

00:15:31.645 --> 00:15:33.270
were born, from childbirth.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.720
And to be there, I
think that will bring me

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.850
more joy, to just
go there interact

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.260
with those young athletes.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:43.910
It's great.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:46.160
And for some of you
guys who will take time

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.830
to join us in Los Angeles
in July, you will feel it.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:57.010
Myself, I'm traveling to more
than seven countries in July.

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.430
And wherever I'm
going to be, I'm

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.750
going to have to
come back in the US

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.700
to take part in the
Special Olympics.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:08.140
And I'm glad to hear that the
Googlers are going to be there,

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:11.970
and going to take place into
this wonderful game that

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:16.840
will bring more of 12,000
athletes from around the world.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.320
And you will have so much fun.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.530
You will appreciate
your time you took out

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.790
of your busy schedule to
volunteer to the game.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.820
And you'll see.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.997
Just come see.

00:16:28.997 --> 00:16:31.080
JACQUELINE FULLER: So let's
talk a little bit more

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.980
about your hospital
and the work there.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.980
So was there a moment as you
were even thinking about,

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.990
even to get more specific,
in my home country,

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.090
I'm going to do work
here-- where you were like,

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:43.298
it's going to be health care.

00:16:43.298 --> 00:16:45.490
It's going to be this hospital.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.800
And the way that you've
set it up is also unique.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.410
You and I were talking
about that in Florida

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.670
that you've figured
out that there

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.800
are ways to get some revenue
streams, because you can get

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.350
people who need the care to
stop flying out of the country

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.680
to do so?

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.520
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.050
The whole idea was just
getting the hospital created.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.839
The thing that hit me the
most was my mother's death,

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.470
when my mother
passed away, which

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:17.450
was a sudden death at her home.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:21.810
And I realized that there
was something very important

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:25.619
that I could do in this
country and make a difference

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.880
for generations to come.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.566
And I went and established
this wonderful organization,

00:17:31.566 --> 00:17:34.720
and we went and
built a hospital,

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.870
which did cost a lot of money.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:41.695
But as the hospital opened in
2007, we all did celebrate.

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:42.990
We were full of joy.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.990
We were very happy.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.842
But we were losing
money at the beginning.

00:17:47.842 --> 00:17:48.800
JACQUELINE FULLER: Mhm.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.610
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: We were
losing a lot of money.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:57.570
We were losing close
to $3.5 million a year.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:04.350
And it was very difficult for me
to play basketball in the NBA,

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:09.890
and every day, I would force--
nobody didn't force me.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.930
But spiritually, I was forced
to raise money every day

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.660
in every city that I went
to, either before the game

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.160
or after the game, I have to
come out with at least $350,000

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.725
every year, every month, so
I can send to [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:25.725 --> 00:18:28.060
make sure the hospital
would stay open.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.790
And I did very well
with the generosity,

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:37.120
with the support of so
many people in America.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.071
And I woke up one day.

00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:41.570
I said, no.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.090
It has to stop.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.540
We have to stop
bleeding like this.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.800
We have to change the metrics.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.290
So I talked to few people,
a few of my advisors,

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.460
including Dr. [INAUDIBLE],
and Dr. [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.620
and some of those people
who advise me every day.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:01.760
They say, Dikembe, you're
going to burn yourself up.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.140
You cannot go like this.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.310
We have to figure out how
the hospital can make money.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:12.200
Then we realized
that in the Congo,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.080
most of the corporations,
telecom industry,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.970
and the mining industry, was
losing close to $49 million

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:25.210
a year by shipping all the
executive and the top employees

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:29.010
to South Africa for treatment,
and getting a private plane

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:32.730
to take somebody who's having
a headache or a stomach pain.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:37.700
And I said, but if I can
invest more than $18 million

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.780
in high tech equipment
in the Congo,

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.170
we can stop losing all
this money every year,

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.670
and all those people can come.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.070
So we went, and we talked
to a couple mining companies

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:51.600
like Freeport in
Phoenix, Arizona,

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.500
that invests more than
$6 billion in the Congo.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:58.970
And they went and helped us
get more high tech equipment.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.230
And today, all of
those companies

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.060
are not shipping all their
employees to South Africa

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:04.840
anymore.

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.440
And they come to us,
and they pay $20 a month

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.341
for each one of the employees.

00:20:10.341 --> 00:20:12.590
Whenever they get sick, or
whenever they need surgery,

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.760
they just get money
from the pool.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.785
And now, we have enough
money to run the hospital,

00:20:20.785 --> 00:20:26.360
to buy the medicine to
keep the hospital running.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.820
It's been a dream come true.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.090
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.680
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
I can smile today.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.240
I'll tell you guys, I was not
smiling the first three years.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.060
It was tough.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:44.760
But now, I can laugh, and
enjoy myself, and travel a lot.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.190
JACQUELINE FULLER: And in terms
of the challenges that you've

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.810
seen, you've talked
about how you came up

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.270
with a business solution.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.850
And as someone who's in the
giving business at google.org,

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.960
I can say, we love when
non-profits come up

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.170
with ways that they can cross
subsidize or have revenue

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.400
streams, because it makes
the operation so much more

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.370
sustainable.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:10.490
But would you say that there's
other, key lessons that you've

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.870
learned as a philanthropist
that maybe the Google employees

00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.210
in this room might want
to keep in mind as they're

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.640
doing their giving?

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.284
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:21:22.284 --> 00:21:27.814
I think the great lesson that I
learned, I wish as I get older,

00:21:27.814 --> 00:21:30.170
maybe I can continue
to teach unto

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:35.240
those who want to get themselves
in the philanthropic world.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:39.025
That's do not go and
start an organization

00:21:39.025 --> 00:21:41.830
that you don't know how long
you're going to keep it going.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.530
 

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.840
First, it's not just your money.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.940
It's the time.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.530
Make sure the
responsibility that you

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.450
have in your life,
wife, or your husband,

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:57.900
and your children have
been taken care of,

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.790
and make sure that are
you in your workplace.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:02.760
Because you got to
keep working in life.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.030
You can't just stop
working and then

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.125
devote yourself for the rest
of your life to philanthropy.

00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:12.220
 

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.740
You will do it, but you have
to have revenue that will

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:20.220
keep the organization going.

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.070
I sit on so many boards.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.570
We raise money on a daily basis.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.330
Even the Special Olympics, we
have to keep the event going,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.570
or we have to take care
of those young people.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.210
So you have to find a way how
the money will keep going.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.760
And our hospital
is surviving today,

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.067
because of all the
metrics, and all the things

00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:43.910
that we observe to learn
and mistakes that we made.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.620
We made a lot of mistakes.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.190
Today, we are happy
that we are partners

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:54.020
with so many organizations,
including Google,

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.890
that [INAUDIBLE] to support us
in all the social innovation

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.290
we're doing, not
just by bringing

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:06.600
all the Special Olympic kids
from the Congo to Los Angeles.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.980
So Google, the company
you work for, they're

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.520
supporting all of those doctors
from SEE international who

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:19.190
are coming to operate to
more than 250-some people who

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.820
are losing their sight in the
Congo, that maybe tomorrow,

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.620
they're not going
to be able to see.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.410
So there's a lot of
great organizations

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:29.520
in Los Angeles who are
playing with their team,

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:34.625
with the equipment, everything,
Google.org is supporting

00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:37.480
the organization so they
can come and operate

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.320
in the hospital for two weeks.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:42.230
So we're happy with
this, all those marriages

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.020
that we are having
with all those

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.405
good people who
believe in our vision,

00:23:46.405 --> 00:23:48.590
because you will not
do it by yourself.

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.939
That was my mistake.

00:23:49.939 --> 00:23:52.230
At the beginning, when I
started building the hospital.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:55.190
I was like, my name
is Dikembe Mutombo.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.220
I'm a millionaire, so I'm
just going to cut a check

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:00.320
and build a hospital.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.850
That's it.

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:05.020
And the reason I
got to that point,

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:09.930
because I got sick and tired
asking ball players for money.

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:13.080
And I went to so
many of my friends.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.380
As I will trying to approach
them to give me money,

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.195
everybody was like--

00:24:17.195 --> 00:24:19.320
JACQUELINE FULLER: They
started to see you coming--

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.861
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: And as soon as
they see me, as tall as I am,

00:24:21.861 --> 00:24:24.080
they just go to a
different direction.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.620
Deke, I'm not giving
him any money.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.930
So it took them almost about
20 years before some of them

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.570
decided even to give me $5,000.

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.497
But that's a different story,
another day, we can talk about.

00:24:36.497 --> 00:24:39.080
JACQUELINE FULLER: We're going
to tell that story [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.230
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
But I'm very happy.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.660
For me, any one of
you, anything you

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.300
want to do, even
in your community,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:52.410
make sure that you put a great
team, that whatever you create,

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.570
that you will work
with other partners.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:57.640
Don't try to do nothing
that you believe you're

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.624
going to do it by yourself.

00:24:59.624 --> 00:25:03.060
I have so many
organizations supporting me,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.550
and that's the reason why the
hospital is running the way.

00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:11.860
It's tough to run the hospital
with 420 doctors and nurses,

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.320
and living in America,
not being there,

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.000
hoping that one day
when you come back,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.210
all of the equipment's
going to be there.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.557
It's very tough.

00:25:19.557 --> 00:25:20.890
JACQUELINE FULLER: Good lessons.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.950
So let's shift gears a little
bit and talk about your role

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.490
with sports diplomacy.

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.280
So you've just gotten
back from a visit to Cuba

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.430
in your role as the
NBA's global ambassador.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:31.680
So tell us about that.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.750
What was Cuba like?

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.491
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: It's beautiful.

00:25:35.491 --> 00:25:37.280
I'll tell you what.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.242
I think it's maybe one of my
most beautiful experiences

00:25:41.242 --> 00:25:43.360
in the last decade.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.140
I've had so many
great experiences

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.626
before meeting Nelson
Mandela and all of that,

00:25:48.626 --> 00:25:50.000
when he came out
from the prison.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.510
But going to Cuba, who would
have ever thought that NBA,

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.540
and we, as a basketball
player, we could go to Cuba

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:04.600
and host a basketball
clinic, and help

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.972
those future generations
of young Cubans

00:26:07.972 --> 00:26:09.720
to have a bright future?

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.460
JACQUELINE FULLER: Right.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.876
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
This is a country

00:26:12.876 --> 00:26:15.700
that is located almost 27
minutes away from the United

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.580
States of America's shore.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.200
And it's just hopeful.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.920
For us, we, as
Americans, to just

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.260
let other human beings
dye and suffer because

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.050
of our political beliefs.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:33.735
And I'm glad that our
commissioner and our owners

00:26:33.735 --> 00:26:36.000
made that particular
decision that

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.190
said that we are going to Cuba
as part of the cultural change

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:47.060
and building a bridge between
the Cubans and the Americans.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.380
And it was nothing to
do with the government.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:54.110
It was all about human beings,
how can we, as humans, connect

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.590
to each other with that.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.160
And we had a great time.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.400
We went there for seven days.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.920
We did a lot of clinic.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:06.150
We refurbished more than
six basketball courts.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.210
We saw so many kids.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.440
To see kids in a
national team who

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.860
come to practice every day
with no basketball shoes

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.162
that costs only $20--

00:27:15.162 --> 00:27:16.120
JACQUELINE FULLER: Wow.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.710
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
It was very sad.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.020
We brought two
containers of shoes,

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.420
and we gave it to every kid.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:27.130
You can see the
smiles on their face.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.190
You see kids dribbling the ball.

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:32.790
Instead of looking at the ball,
he's just looking at his feet.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.870
Oh my god, I've got
basketball shoes on.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.130
And that's what you want to see.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:42.040
You want to see that
joy, and that happiness.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.280
We didn't meet with the
government officials.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.220
They kind of left us alone.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:51.550
But it's something
that anyone of you

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.550
should go and take
that experience.

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.780
Cuba is not far.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.840
It's about six flights.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.360
They went out from
the US to Cuba.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.840
So feel free, whenever
you have time, maybe

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.142
a weekend, just go to Cuba.

00:28:04.142 --> 00:28:06.350
JACQUELINE FULLER: Maybe
bring some basketball shoes.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.380
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
No, I'm serious.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.740
You can travel to Cuba
now with no restrictions,

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.880
for some of you that don't know.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.770
Our embassy's opening.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.650
Maybe eight weeks
from now, we're

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.280
going to have the embassy open.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.930
I believe John Kerry, if
he didn't break his legs,

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.914
he was going to go
there very soon.

00:28:26.914 --> 00:28:29.330
JACQUELINE FULLER: That was
biking, not basketball though,

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:29.710
right?

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:30.445
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: That
was not basketball.

00:28:30.445 --> 00:28:32.950
JACQUELINE FULLER:
No, that was biking.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.510
So let me go back to something
you said a little bit earlier,

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.110
which is that it took a
while for you to even talk

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.110
to some of your friends
in the NBA about giving.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.920
And there's this debate
about whether athletes

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.930
are role models or
should be role models.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:50.595
I think you probably have
a perspective on that.

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:51.470
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:55.820
I believe that we,
as athletes, should

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.950
be a role model in society.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:01.400
There's a lot of things
that we are responsible for.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.380
We are the icon for the
next generation to come,

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.800
and that we have maybe
a billion people who

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.380
follow us on a weekly basis.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:11.380
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.630
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Especially
we, as basketball players.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.730
I think for the fact
that we wear a uniform.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:20.990
We don't wear
anything in our hair

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:22.800
to cover us like
football players.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.160
But people know us by our faces.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.085
I think we should
be a role model.

00:29:29.085 --> 00:29:30.960
There's a lot of things
that we can stand on,

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.151
that we can do and make a
difference in our society.

00:29:35.151 --> 00:29:40.090
And I reject those
who come out publicly.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:42.980
I'm not against Charles
Barkley, and I love him so much.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:44.770
He's a great guy.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.590
But I reject the idea that the
people who come publicly on TV

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:51.220
say that I cannot
be a role model,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:56.330
or nobody is more about me,
because if it's all about you,

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.259
how did you get there?

00:29:58.259 --> 00:29:59.300
JACQUELINE FULLER: Right.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.430
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: How did you get
to be a great NBA player if you

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:06.220
didn't get support from
your coaches, your teammate,

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.790
your friends, and your high
school teacher, your principle,

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.340
or your mom and dad.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.445
You did have so many
people who did believe

00:30:13.445 --> 00:30:17.195
in you, who did believe
in your vision, who said,

00:30:17.195 --> 00:30:19.480
I will put my trust in this kid.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.630
I'm going to put my
effort in this child,

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:25.280
and I'm going to try to help
him to get to the [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:28.180
to go, because they want
to make you an example.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:33.230
So there's a responsibility
in each one of us to do.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:38.860
As one of the professors put
it in a summit in an AIDS

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.880
conference in South Africa.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.520
He said that when there's
a problem affecting

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.850
one part of the society.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.010
It should be a responsibility
of a human being living

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.020
on this planet.

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.800
Somehow, every human being
living on this planet,

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.270
somehow, we have a role to do.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:57.350
We have a duty to fulfill
for other human beings.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.290
It doesn't matter which
part of the world,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.510
which part of society that
you live in or you work in.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:08.230
There's always a place for you
to contribute to be an example.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.380
So these are the great
examples that I'm

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.870
giving to each one of you.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:14.560
Don't say that
because I work here

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.940
in this beautiful,
magnificent campus,

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.990
I don't have any role
outside of this campus.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.610
You do.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:25.170
You're a role model too,
not just Dikembe Mutombo.

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.030
JACQUELINE FULLER: Uh-huh.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:31.390
So are there any
players or people

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.490
that you would call out as
people who are doing it well?

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:35.365
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:31:35.365 --> 00:31:38.300
 

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:43.330
The best of them,
I will say today,

00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:48.480
who's really following
almost 99.9% in my footsteps,

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.030
I would say, Yao Ming.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.040
JACQUELINE FULLER: Oh.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.170
Yeah, from China.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.410
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: To see
how much in resources

00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:00.870
that the young man has devoted
himself to more than 1.2

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:02.690
billion people in China.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.410
He's building schools.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:10.070
He's building a bunch
of sports academies.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:14.370
He's building recreation centers
for after school programs.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.117
I thought I was doing enough.

00:32:17.117 --> 00:32:18.950
JACQUELINE FULLER: Is
he raising the stakes?

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:20.610
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: As
being tall as I am.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:25.630
But seeing other guys
who's taller than me,

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:29.207
almost at 7'7",
that I can look up.

00:32:29.207 --> 00:32:30.165
JACQUELINE FULLER: Wow.

00:32:30.165 --> 00:32:31.800
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: And I say, no.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.080
That's my role model.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.290
JACQUELINE FULLER: Wow.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.895
Another man that Dikembe
actually has to look up to.

00:32:36.895 --> 00:32:37.770
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:38.920
Oh, there's a few of them.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:39.920
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.770
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: I'm
not the tallest guy.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:46.480
I'm a little bit tall, but
I see tall people every day.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.160
But I'm very glad
that [INAUDIBLE] you

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.040
have Luol Deng, who's
playing for the Miami Heat.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.400
He's doing so much
in Southern Sudan.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.960
You have Alonzo Mourning.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.595
He's done so much in Miami.

00:32:59.595 --> 00:33:01.180
You have LeBron James.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:06.319
He's becoming very devoted
for the city of Akron,

00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:07.485
also, the city of Cleveland.

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:10.000
 

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.540
We have so many, old and young.

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.950
You have all the kids
who are coming out.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:21.410
You have Kevin Garnett,
and Serge Ibaka,

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:25.020
and all those young kids who are
coming for the new generation

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.900
are trying to keep
up with my footsteps.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.210
And we're so happy that
so many of our players

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.580
today are stepping up.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.480
They came to understand
that this game is good.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.160
We make money.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:42.140
But we have to make a difference
in our society, because I would

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.900
not be sitting in this
chair that you put me in,

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.450
not just because of
the game of basketball.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.630
There's other things
that you appreciate

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.610
about me and my
personality, and that's

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:56.690
the reason why you guys brought
me in this beautiful campus.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:02.305
And I think we want our
place to be that model.

00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:05.090
 

00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:10.560
Just do what you can do, because
you cannot be here forever.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:14.856
JACQUELINE FULLER: So NBA
finals start tomorrow night.

00:34:14.856 --> 00:34:15.980
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: I'm going.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.394
 

00:34:20.394 --> 00:34:22.810
JACQUELINE FULLER: So I was
going to ask, who's your pick?

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.159
And you have to be gentle.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:26.270
And remember, we've got
a lot of Warriors fans

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:27.940
perhaps in this room.

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.449
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: You know what?

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:37.370
I apologize that I cannot
predict who's going to win Not

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:39.190
just because I'm a
basketball player,

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.140
but I work for the
commissioner office.

00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:43.829
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:45.370
JACQUELINE FULLER:
As ambassador, one

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:46.376
does not pick teams.

00:34:46.376 --> 00:34:48.209
We're going to go with
the Warriors on that.

00:34:48.209 --> 00:34:52.699
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: So I have
a right to remain silent.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.467
And I'm going to take my fifth.

00:34:55.467 --> 00:34:58.640
But I wish you guys good luck.

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.700
It's the best for my job.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.320
It makes me look good, and
it'll be good if your city wins,

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.120
your team wins.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.540
We're all going to be here to
celebrate, but I'm just happy.

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.970
It's the best for the game.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:14.340
All these ideas are
good for the game.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.520
JACQUELINE FULLER: All right.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.680
So what does it feel like
to block Michael Jordan?

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:24.730
 

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.480
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: I've
have a great respect

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.440
in the game of Michael Jordan.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.020
And I have a great respect for
Michael, himself, as a player,

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.540
as a person.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:40.990
But he was one of those
guys that I always said,

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:42.684
this guy's not going to get me.

00:35:42.684 --> 00:35:43.600
JACQUELINE FULLER: Ah.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:44.480
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
As Dikembe Mutombo.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:45.790
JACQUELINE FULLER: A
little bit competitive?

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:46.665
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:35:46.665 --> 00:35:48.980
 

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.520
I think Michael's one
of those guys that

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:54.350
made me to be Dikembe Mutombo.

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.400
I just challenged him every day.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.360
And it took him about
7.5 years to get one.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:01.634
JACQUELINE FULLER: Wow.

00:36:01.634 --> 00:36:04.050
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: As many years
as he played in the league,

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:04.822
he only got one.

00:36:04.822 --> 00:36:05.780
JACQUELINE FULLER: Wow.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.363
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: And
I always told him

00:36:07.363 --> 00:36:10.940
that he got me
because I was late.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.710
He really didn't get me.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.988
He really didn't
climb over my Mutombo.

00:36:15.988 --> 00:36:16.936
JACQUELINE FULLER: OK.

00:36:16.936 --> 00:36:19.306
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:19.306 --> 00:36:21.804
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:21.804 --> 00:36:23.220
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
You can ask him--

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.320
JACQUELINE FULLER: I'll ask him.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.065
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: --friend.

00:36:25.065 --> 00:36:26.790
But see, I'm a
super Sonic friend,

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:28.910
they know how they try
to climb over Mutombo.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:31.410
JACQUELINE FULLER: So we're not
going to the Sonics, are we?

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:33.370
We are just not going
to go the Sonics.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.080
I think we have a live question.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.385
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
your vision for the Congo.

00:36:37.385 --> 00:36:39.510
And obviously, the hospital
is a huge part of that.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.230
But I'd love to hear
just more of what

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.530
is your vision for the Congo.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:49.770
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: My vision is
I hope that Congo will become

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:58.740
a country where people are
free to elect their leader,

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:02.410
where everything
can be transparent,

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:07.552
and where health care
and the mortality rate

00:37:07.552 --> 00:37:09.830
can go a little bit up.

00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:14.720
Right now, I still have my
brothers and sisters, uncles,

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.020
cousins still living there.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.150
My mother-in-law's
still living there.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:26.190
So the mortality rate's still
42 for men and 43 for women.

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.057
JACQUELINE FULLER: I'd be gone.

00:37:28.057 --> 00:37:29.640
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: I'm
working very hard

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:33.570
to see that mortality
rate maybe go to 50, 55.

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:36.290
And I'm just putting
myself as an example.

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:38.490
I'm not going to be just
the only one doing it.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.860
There's a lot of organizations
working in the Congo.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:44.280
We need to help
from the outside,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.340
not just for the
Congolese themselves.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:51.670
I think it will take the world
community to come together

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:56.400
to figure out where's the best
way for Congo to move forward,

00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:03.050
because Congo's just a country
so rich with natural resources.

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:07.585
And everyone is digging in.

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:10.820
It's not just the
Chinese who are there,

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.870
but you also have the
Canadians, the Americans.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:18.700
So hopefully, all those
countries who feel like they

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:22.720
can benefit from the
Congolese natural resources.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.990
They can also invest
in the way human beings

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.750
for Congolese people that
something is missing.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.950
The Canadian company,
the American company,

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:37.840
the Chinese company, and
few European companies,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.110
I think they benefit
for themselves.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.520
They're not putting
anything back

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.945
so Congo can be a better
society and a better country.

00:38:45.945 --> 00:38:49.594
We will see how it goes
in the next five years.

00:38:49.594 --> 00:38:51.010
FEMALE SPEAKER:
This is a question

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.960
from a Googler named Javier.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:56.870
And Javier says, in ESPN's
documentary, Son of the Congo,

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:58.860
we see how difficult
it is for Serge Ibaka

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:00.869
to give back to
everyone in need.

00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:02.160
There's only so much he can do.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.480
How do you manage to be fair and
generous with as many of your

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.712
as possible?

00:39:06.712 --> 00:39:08.420
JACQUELINE FULLER:
And this is Javier who

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.240
asked the question, right here.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.536
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
Sorry for your Knicks.

00:39:12.536 --> 00:39:15.347
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.347 --> 00:39:15.847
 

00:39:15.847 --> 00:39:17.686
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:17.686 --> 00:39:19.560
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: They
say when you're Knicks,

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:20.518
you're Knicks for life.

00:39:20.518 --> 00:39:28.660
But I still love my Knicks.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.120
 

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.900
Serge is a wonderful person.

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.100
And he's a young brother to me.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.030
I spend a lot of time with him.

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.860
My father, his dad, got a
chance to play basketball

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.220
with my brother, oldest brother.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.760
So we know the family so well.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.870
He's trying to do
something in the Congo.

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:58.780
But the challenge for
Serge Ibaka, if from both

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:03.090
Congos, if from the big Congo,
where his mother's from, where

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.740
he has all of his mom's family.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:08.720
Then from the Congo [INAUDIBLE],
where his dad's from,

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.500
where he's got all of
the family, as well.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.600
So as being the son of
Congo, he's trying to say,

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.710
where am I going to start?

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:17.800
On my dad's side, or mom's side?

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.560
Where am I going to
make a difference?

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.870
So when the two Congo's
are claiming him.

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.040
So he's trying to do his best.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.570
And the thing is I'm trying
to advise him that he just

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:33.210
has to be much smarter
and pick the good cause,

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.775
where he can invest
and see a good result.

00:40:36.775 --> 00:40:39.890
But if you can just go ahead
and start giving out money here,

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:43.710
there, you're not going
to see a good result.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.880
I'm working very
closely with him.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:48.560
Hopefully, we're going to
see some success very soon.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.970
 

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.220
AUDIENCE: With Mobutu
Sese Seko gone, and I

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.514
assume corruption's improving.

00:40:56.514 --> 00:40:57.930
But could you talk
about if you've

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:59.346
had to navigate
through corruption

00:40:59.346 --> 00:41:02.360
through your
philanthropic efforts?

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.320
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
That's a good question.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.230
I think corruption in
the African continent

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:11.730
is never going to
erased, period.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:16.110
Those are the things that all
the international communities

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:19.340
need to know about.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:24.710
The reason I say that even
[INAUDIBLE] very good on that.

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.800
I learn the corruption
from you guys,

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.200
from the international
community.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:34.250
He said, you guys cannot come
and tell me that I'm corrupt,

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.150
when it was you guys, one,
who came in my country,

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.530
trying to get whatever we
have, and trying to pull him

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:42.050
on the side, at the same time.

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.500
And I think we see
corruption almost

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:52.510
in every part of society,
including here, in America.

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:55.050
But the thing is when
the corruption reaches

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:57.560
a different level,
and then that's

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.060
when things doesn't look good.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:08.720
But the government
needs to work very hard.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.470
The country can be corrupt,
but at the same time,

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:16.490
there can be other areas
where there's an advancement.

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:20.240
And when we were
building our hospital,

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.040
I did face a lot of challenge.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:27.405
We had ministers, and
people in the government,

00:42:27.405 --> 00:42:30.412
in the lower level who
was coming and saying,

00:42:30.412 --> 00:42:31.870
you're not getting
these documents,

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.790
or you're not getting
the permit for land

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:39.240
or for the construction if
we don't see something back,

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.910
like a kick back.

00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:43.800
I'll give you an example.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:55.740
We had the groundbreaking of the
hospital on September 11, 2001.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.780
That was the day that the two
planes went through the World

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.190
Trade Center in New York.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:06.820
So the reason I always
say that my idea survived,

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.170
comes from a very
difficult time,

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.450
because it was in the
middle of the ceremony

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:16.740
where the US ambassador,
with all of the diplomats

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:19.810
who came with me on the
groundbreaking of the hospital,

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:21.690
before the construction start.

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:25.380
We have to stop the ceremony,
in the middle of the ceremony,

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.180
because all of the US diplomats
and everybody from the US

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.920
government that was with me,
you have to leave the site,

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.540
because there was
a terrorist attack.

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:40.630
So then I have to stop even my
construction for four years.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:45.170
And I stopped the fundraising,
and the hospital was not

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:47.635
going to get built. And we
didn't start the construction

00:43:47.635 --> 00:43:49.960
back until 2004.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.070
And then the hospital was
opened three years later.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:54.330
But it's a struggle.

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:57.422
It's a struggle that
we went through.

00:43:57.422 --> 00:44:01.975
In 2004, I want to
see President Kabila.

00:44:01.975 --> 00:44:06.230
And I asked, Mr.
President, I said,

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:08.660
I'm not starting
construction to the hospital

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:11.450
until I get all the
documents that I want.

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.005
He said, but Dikembe,
you made a promise

00:44:14.005 --> 00:44:16.675
to the Congolese people you
were going to build a hospital.

00:44:16.675 --> 00:44:19.400
It has been four
years that's went by.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.590
There's no break.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.000
Nothing's happening on the site.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.470
What happened?

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.290
You have all of us
on the side there.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.495
You make us look bad.

00:44:26.495 --> 00:44:29.180
I said, yeah, but
there's a couple people

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:32.420
here in the lower level, who's
beating me up, or punching me

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:33.045
every day.

00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:35.620
I need all the papers I can.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.995
So one, we were
making sure that if we

00:44:37.995 --> 00:44:40.540
were going to bring
more than $18 million

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:44.460
of medical equipment
from Germany, and the US,

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.660
and other parts of the
world, we were making sure

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:53.290
that those equipments, it was
in the Congo with no taxes,

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:56.400
because I was investing millions
of dollars to the people

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.810
and the future of the society,
why the same society would

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:03.213
trying to tax me for
another $10 million?

00:45:03.213 --> 00:45:07.520
I said, I'm about to give
you guys a $20 million

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.580
medical facility, and
you guys are trying

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.030
to tax me $10 million more.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.305
I said, let's do this.

00:45:12.305 --> 00:45:15.050
How about me just staying in
America, enjoying my money,

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:17.920
and you guys stay over there,
while people are dying?

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.697
So the government
ended up deciding, no.

00:45:20.697 --> 00:45:22.280
You're going to get
whatever you want,

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.370
and I got everything I wanted.

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:27.340
And I'll go to
the Congo everyday

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.895
with nobody bothering me.

00:45:29.895 --> 00:45:31.270
JACQUELINE FULLER:
Well, I'm glad

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:32.790
that you're sharing
the struggle,

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:36.020
because I think sometimes,
we feel like when I give,

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.980
and when I want to
establish this nonprofit,

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.320
and when I want to take on
affordable housing in the Bay

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:41.695
Area, that should
be easy, right?

00:45:41.695 --> 00:45:43.850
You just mean well, and
you put in your resources,

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:44.850
and things work out.

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:49.237
So I think this tenacity
that you're talking about,

00:45:49.237 --> 00:45:51.820
and the fact that struggles are
going to come, and opposition,

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.910
and then you have to
be creative, creative

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.640
as a businessman,
creative as an operator

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.760
to overcome that, I think that
that makes the story actually

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.010
even more inspiring, to hear--

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:02.610
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
Sometimes, you've

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:04.480
got to be a little bit mean.

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.910
JACQUELINE FULLER: And
sometimes, a little bit mean.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:06.785
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:46:06.785 --> 00:46:10.800
When you're trying to
work, you will get people,

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.980
even from the city council,
from the government, who

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.770
will try to come push
it, because you're

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:20.090
making higher people who came
to me, even in Africa, who said,

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:21.450
you know what?

00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.190
Thank you for
everything you're doing,

00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:25.845
but you do make us
embarrassed a little bit.

00:46:25.845 --> 00:46:28.230
You do embarrass
us, because you make

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:32.780
us look bad, because we feel
like we're not doing anything.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.450
Every year, you always
bring all those people here,

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:37.080
doing all those surgeries.

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.490
And then after you leave,
we don't do anything.

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:40.821
People say, how about you?

00:46:40.821 --> 00:46:42.320
Why are you guys
not doing anything?

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.910
So those are the challenges
you have to accept,

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:47.430
and you have to
try to live with.

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:51.690
Do not try to have somebody
push you off the cliff,

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:52.730
and you fall?

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.271
JACQUELINE FULLER:
How would you like

00:46:54.271 --> 00:46:56.080
to be the person
trying to push him off?

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:56.789
This is the man--

00:46:56.789 --> 00:46:59.246
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: I've got a
lot of people trying to push me

00:46:59.246 --> 00:47:01.970
for the rebound, and I tried--
they got a lot of broken noses.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:02.597
JACQUELINE FULLER: Yeah.

00:47:02.597 --> 00:47:03.846
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Look at that.

00:47:03.846 --> 00:47:07.270
JACQUELINE FULLER: Apparently,
somebody-- it wasn't me--

00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:11.180
but somebody said maybe 22
broken noses on the other side

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.040
of that elbow?

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:12.873
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: No.

00:47:12.873 --> 00:47:14.360
You know what?

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:19.630
I always get accused for
being too aggressive.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.590
And I think I really didn't
break anybody's nose.

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:24.116
They ran up to my elbow.

00:47:24.116 --> 00:47:25.940
JACQUELINE FULLER: They ran.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.600
Some faces running into elbows.

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.310
But what you're
saying is sometimes,

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.850
even in the charitable
world, you've

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:32.380
got to be a little aggressive.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.255
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Yes.

00:47:33.255 --> 00:47:34.600
You have to.

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.450
Otherwise, they're going to beat
you up, and take your money,

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:39.019
and run away.

00:47:39.019 --> 00:47:41.435
JACQUELINE FULLER: So you have
to practice Dikembe's style

00:47:41.435 --> 00:47:42.630
of philanthropy.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:43.130
I love that.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:44.296
Do we have another question?

00:47:44.296 --> 00:47:46.630
 

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.670
AUDIENCE: Hi Dikembe,
how's it going?

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:50.430
My name is Mattie.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:51.760
I'm from Finland.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.305
And I just wanted to
ask you a question,

00:47:54.305 --> 00:47:55.930
because something
that we see in Europe

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:58.940
is that with the country's
not doing so well,

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:01.290
there's a big rise
in countries--

00:48:01.290 --> 00:48:03.240
there's political
pressures of countries

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.190
not to do as much foreign
aid or take in refugees.

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:10.320
And I wanted to see what
your opinion on something

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.440
that you're doing as a
non-government organization

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:15.420
versus governmental foreign
aid, and how you see,

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:19.310
for example, what's happening
in Europe, at the moment.

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:24.110
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: I've been a
big advocate about the issue

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:27.805
that we are dealing with
today about foreign aid.

00:48:27.805 --> 00:48:32.730
I think it should not be just
the European country, something

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:36.680
[INAUDIBLE], has been
a student of diplomacy.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.450
I think they have given so
much aid in the [INAUDIBLE],

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.760
they will go and get it back.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.720
It was like a death.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.790
They're letting an African
country borrow money.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:49.250
And I think when they
were borrowing money,

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:52.490
that money never reached
the African people.

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:54.720
It was staying just
in all those leaders

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.610
who went to Europe to
negotiate from a Paris club,

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:00.510
European club, and all of that.

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:03.890
That money was staying just in
Europe in the bank accounts.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:06.390
And I didn't think
we're in the right place

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:10.814
really to name all those leaders
who took billions of dollars

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:11.480
from the people.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.740
But if any countries
around the world

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.810
can go to the continent of
Africa or South America,

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:23.200
and invest in a society
and make a difference

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:27.250
in those communities,
and leave few people

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.310
from the organizations there to
just watch what they're doing,

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:35.110
and they hire the community to
be responsible, or work there,

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:40.990
that's what we did, even though
I do run the Biamba Marie

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:42.570
Mutombo Hospital from the US.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:47.830
But we have more than 12 people
on the ground, Congolese,

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.400
that we hire, we train.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:55.980
We made them be responsible
for this $40 million facility,

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:58.130
and to make sure to
keep an eye on it.

00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.590
They watch each other.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:01.900
That's what you have to do.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:06.020
And you have to make sure that
the society's responsible.

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:10.215
Do not just come and then open
the library, build the library,

00:50:10.215 --> 00:50:12.350
and enable [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:12.880
Say, OK.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:14.330
I already gave you a gift.

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:17.610
I'm not responsible if the
library closes down, or what.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.900
That's the big failure
that we have seen.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.040
And that's why people
are tired in Europe

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.860
right now when it comes to,
oh, we need to help Africa.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.540
And everybody was like, oh.

00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.470
It's been almost 100, 200 years.

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:32.390
All we've been giving, giving.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.710
But you've been giving.

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:36.440
Who's been following up on that?

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:40.600
It's always good to make
people responsible for whatever

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.610
they get.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.350
What they're doing with
the money you give to them,

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:47.040
they give you reports,
and then they show you

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.780
where the money's been spent.

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:52.230
And that's what I
always want in people.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:55.490
I'll give you an example of my
foundation, and then Jacqueline

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:57.130
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:01.450
There's only three
people who work for me.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:05.620
I want a $40 million
facility in the Congo,

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:06.980
with only three people.

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:10.345
And I built the hospital
with three people-- no,

00:51:10.345 --> 00:51:11.050
with two people.

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:14.150
We just hired another
person two years ago.

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:17.140
So for the past 20 years, I've
been running my office only

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:19.310
with two staff.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:23.710
And we've been able
to get a good result.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:26.290
And we wanted people to know
where the money's going.

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:29.256
So when you give
me your $10,000,

00:51:29.256 --> 00:51:32.340
I know where your $10,000 is.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.476
So I will show you
where your $10,000 is.

00:51:34.476 --> 00:51:37.510
And you're going to
[INAUDIBLE] too close

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.080
in Africa, so it's easy too
for the African people to say,

00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.001
I'm going there.

00:51:41.001 --> 00:51:43.600
 

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.120
JACQUELINE FULLER: I think
just our last question?

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.290
One more.

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:48.420
AUDIENCE: Hi Dikembe.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:49.940
Thanks for coming today.

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:53.390
Congrats on the basketball
hall of fame, first of all.

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:55.780
My question is I'm curious.

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:58.400
Who is the most
inspirational person

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.490
you've ever got a chance
to meet in your life,

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:03.470
and what was the best piece of
advice that they gave to you?

00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:04.800
JACQUELINE FULLER: That's the
perfect question to end on.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:06.466
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO:
That's a good question.

00:52:06.466 --> 00:52:10.785
I always say that [INAUDIBLE]
there's people I've met.

00:52:10.785 --> 00:52:12.200
And I think there's
nobody that's

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.110
ever come close than Madiba.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:16.345
 

00:52:16.345 --> 00:52:17.470
JACQUELINE FULLER: Mandela.

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:20.780
DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: Nelson
Mandela was a great leader,

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:27.550
a great father, and a great
motivator, a great president.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:30.880
 

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:33.770
He set so many
examples for all of us.

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:37.750
And meeting with him for the
first time in '92, after he

00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:41.080
came out from prison,
in the middle the night,

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:46.110
where they have to shut down
the entire street lights,

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:48.192
and turn the lights
off at the hotel,

00:52:48.192 --> 00:52:50.150
because he was coming
in, because there were so

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:53.200
many people who were trying
to kill him back then.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.180
It was just tough to
know, to understand

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.030
that you walk in the room.

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:03.540
He said, Dikembe, thank you for
bringing your delegation here

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:08.860
to South Africa for the
future of South Africa.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:14.120
He didn't say, thank you for
coming for this nation for now.

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:18.190
But he said, for the
future of South Africa.

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:22.550
And he told us, please, keep
doing what you're doing.

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:27.800
Do not stop, and do not
forget South Africa.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.050
And we made a promise
to him that we're never

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:32.830
going to forget South Africa.

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:35.620
We're going to continue
to devote our resources,

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:40.110
and our energy, our
money to improve

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:42.370
the future of the
game and the sport

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:44.850
in South Africa for
the young people.

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.380
And we've been doing
that for 20 years.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:50.880
We've built more than
200 basketball courts.

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.700
We invest I think more than
$20-something-million dollars

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.458
now.

00:53:57.458 --> 00:54:03.060
But his advice,
please help my people.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:07.200
Do not forget,
because you are part

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.255
of the future of
this generation, part

00:54:09.255 --> 00:54:10.300
of the future leaders.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:15.620
And I think it encouraged
me that I'm the leader

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.490
today in a continent.

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:21.210
And I continue to set an example
for so many people to follow.

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:26.830
And I thank you guys and
google.org for inviting me

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:30.390
to this campus for me
to share my vision,

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:34.381
to share my work, my experience.

00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:39.250
And maybe what I was able
to translate to you today

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:42.660
can be replicated as an
example for each one of you

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:46.610
to go out to do, also
set an example in a world

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.100
that we are living in.

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:51.480
And it has been my challenge
for each one of you in the room,

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:56.490
everywhere I go to speak,
don't leave this earth

00:54:56.490 --> 00:55:00.060
without touching
somebody else's life.

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:03.395
Go out as you leave
this room today,

00:55:03.395 --> 00:55:08.712
go and touch somebody, and be
an example for somebody else.

00:55:08.712 --> 00:55:09.960
Thank you so much.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:11.168
JACQUELINE FULLER: Thank you.

00:55:11.168 --> 00:55:11.870
Dikembe Mutombo.

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:13.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:16.670
That was amazing.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:20.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:55.980
