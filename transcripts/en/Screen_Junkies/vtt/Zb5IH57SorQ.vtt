00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.310
From the studio that finally learned how to
make Pixar movies

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.510
and the songwriting duo behind “Hasa Diga
Eebowai”

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.540
Comes the feature-length music video for “Let
it Go”--

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.540
FROZEN

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.730
It’s been three years since the last Disney
musical,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.369
and 18 years since the last good Disney musical.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.300
Now, the big D is back and adjusted for inflation,
with

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.550
Two princesses

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.239
two goofy sidekicks

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.960
and three different orphans.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.489
Welcome to Arendelle, a magical-ish Scandanavian-ish
country that’s

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.730
been cursed with eternal winter
... even though their main export is ice.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.620
Meet Elsa, a manic-depressive princess with
a confusing set of powers, like

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.239
Snow-blasting

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.719
Dress-making

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.039
Castle-building

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.410
And creating life?

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.600
"You're alive?!"

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.399
"I think so."

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.760
They kinda gloss over that one.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.470
Fall in love with her adorkable sister Anna
Who spends 3 years of her adult life shut

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.230
inside a castle...
even though she could leave at any time.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.500
"I can't live like this anymore!"

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.840
"Then leave"

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.390
And who could forget the completely unnecessary,
unexplained, magical

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.390
troll rocks?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.960
When disaster strikes, watch Anna save the
day by teaming up with

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.050
Her sister

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.220
A merchant

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.470
A hot guy

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.940
And a snowman

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.860
To defeat...

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.860
Her sister

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.030
A merchant

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.280
A hot guy

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.220
And a snowman.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.060
Experience a clever twist on past Disney films
that teaches girls they don’t need a prince

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.460
to rescue them, because all men are disgusting
loners

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.060
Greedy murderers

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.670
Or lying manipulative power hungry sociopaths.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.800
"You won't get away with this."

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.520
"I already have."

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.680
Happy now, Jezebel?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.121
So gather the family and sing along on a musical
journey that’s all

00:01:58.121 --> 00:01:59.810
about the soundtrack.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.960
Featuring unforgettable songs like

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.410
The exposition song!

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:29.940
The 
song that sounds like it’s from Wicked

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:41.530
The romantic duet

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.450
The other romantic duet

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:56.069
The anthropomorphic sidekick’s comic relief
song

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:05.069
The one you skip

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:15.819
The one you don’t know the words to

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:32.950
And the YOLO song.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.950
Starring...

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.020
Frozen.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.250
You don't need true love to thaw a frozen
heart:

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.390
Just soak it in water for a few hours.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.800
Works on turkeys.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.470
