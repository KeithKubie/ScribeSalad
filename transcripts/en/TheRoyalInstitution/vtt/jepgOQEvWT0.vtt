00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.245
I'm standing here on the roof
of the Royal Institution.

00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:17.040
And I'm using something that
we take for granted in the

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.200
modern technological world, a
compass, using GPS built into

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.330
my smartphone.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.420
And I can use it to find the
direction to magnetic north,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.960
which is that way, which means
that south is that way.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.440
Which means Spain is over 1,000

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.190
kilometres in that direction.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.450
I'm interested because what we
think we're very clever at

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.270
doing, nature has figured
out before us.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.540
Lots of migrating birds and
marine animals have built-in

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.670
compasses in their brains, in
their eyes, at the ends of the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.360
beaks, so they can detect the
direction they should travel.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.760
One bird in particular, however,
does something much

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.800
more clever.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.740
The European Robin uses quantum
mechanics to find its

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.330
way to Spain.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.580
That's why I'm so interested.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.110
What's becoming increasingly
clear is that the humble

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.520
European Robin finds its way
south from Scandinavia to the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.600
Mediterranean every winter by
following and seeing Earth's

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.110
magnetic field.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.680
And it does this with special
molecules, proteins inside its

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.580
retina called cryptochrome.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.600
Essentially, these are
light-activated, and they

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.360
produce something called
quantum entanglement.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.100
Light enters the bird's retina
and knocks one of a pair of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.720
electrons off an atom and
onto a neighbouring one.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.740
These two electrons, though,
remain somehow coordinated in

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.380
their actions.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.500
We say they're quantum
entangled.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.860
And because they're far apart,
their actions are sensitive to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.900
the direction of the Earth's
magnetic field.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.970
What happens next is that the
direction of the field affects

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.260
the way they cause chemical
reactions to take place,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.080
sending signals to the bird's
brain, telling it which

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.970
direction to go.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.660
Now, this is not only
surprising but very

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.200
fascinating for physicists,
because we're used to trying

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.240
to control the delicate quantum
world inside our

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.840
sterile controlled laboratory
experiments.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.180
So the notion that nature has
got there first, that somehow

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.070
these delicate quantum phenomena
can be maintained

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.490
inside the warm, messy, complex
environment of a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.220
living cell, is nothing short
of miraculous, and until

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.980
recently has been very
controversial.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.160
But it's the reason why so many
biologists and quantum

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.320
physicists are becoming very,
very excited, because it may

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.220
be that the weird world of
quantum mechanics plays a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.555
vital role in biology.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.370
Quantum entanglement is the idea
that particles, however

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.910
far apart they are, still
somehow, their fates remain

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.680
intertwined.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.070
They are still aware of each
other's existence.
