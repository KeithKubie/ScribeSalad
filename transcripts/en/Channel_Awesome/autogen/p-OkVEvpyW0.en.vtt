say it doesn't feel very natural very
flowing<00:15:30.440><c> so</c><00:15:31.040><c> I</c><00:15:31.070><c> think</c><00:15:31.220><c> there</c><00:15:31.550><c> is</c><00:15:31.580><c> a</c><00:15:31.730><c> way</c><00:15:32.030><c> to</c>

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:32.090 align:start position:0%
flowing so I think there is a way to
 

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.870 align:start position:0%
flowing so I think there is a way to
show<00:15:32.450><c> thin</c><00:15:32.990><c> becoming</c><00:15:33.380><c> a</c><00:15:33.530><c> teenager</c><00:15:33.950><c> at</c><00:15:34.550><c> least</c>

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
show thin becoming a teenager at least
 

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.190 align:start position:0%
show thin becoming a teenager at least
with<00:15:35.060><c> our</c><00:15:35.180><c> relationships</c><00:15:35.750><c> and</c><00:15:35.900><c> it</c><00:15:35.990><c> only</c><00:15:36.080><c> seems</c>

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:36.200 align:start position:0%
with our relationships and it only seems
 

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.930 align:start position:0%
with our relationships and it only seems
to<00:15:36.410><c> be</c><00:15:36.500><c> with</c><00:15:36.650><c> the</c><00:15:36.680><c> relationship</c><00:15:37.250><c> stuff</c><00:15:37.580><c> yeah</c><00:15:37.910><c> I</c>

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:37.940 align:start position:0%
to be with the relationship stuff yeah I
 

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.220 align:start position:0%
to be with the relationship stuff yeah I
get<00:15:38.180><c> when</c><00:15:38.270><c> your</c><00:15:38.450><c> team</c><00:15:38.630><c> is</c><00:15:38.780><c> mostly</c><00:15:39.020><c> what</c><00:15:39.170><c> you</c>

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.230 align:start position:0%
get when your team is mostly what you
 

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.770 align:start position:0%
get when your team is mostly what you
think<00:15:39.380><c> of</c><00:15:39.440><c> anyway</c><00:15:39.710><c> um</c><00:15:40.060><c> but</c><00:15:41.060><c> I</c><00:15:41.270><c> think</c><00:15:41.600><c> there</c><00:15:41.750><c> is</c>

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:41.780 align:start position:0%

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:43.550 align:start position:0%
a way to show it where it is sort of
 

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:46.180 align:start position:0%
a way to show it where it is sort of
more<00:15:43.930><c> balanced</c><00:15:44.930><c> out</c><00:15:45.050><c> and</c><00:15:45.320><c> not</c><00:15:45.440><c> just</c><00:15:45.740><c> I'm</c><00:15:46.040><c> a</c>
