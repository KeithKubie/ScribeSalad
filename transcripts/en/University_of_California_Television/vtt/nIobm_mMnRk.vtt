00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.433
(mid-tempo riveting music)

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.580
- Welcome to a Conversation With History.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.630
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.880
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.240
Our guest today is Bart Ehrman who is

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.440
the Gray Distinguished
Professor of Theological Studies

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.560
at the University of North
Carolina in Chapel Hill.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.890
His new book is God's Problem:

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.220
How the Bible Fails to Answer
Our Most Important Question--

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.620
Why We Suffer.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.620
He is on the Berkeley campus
as the 2008 Foerster Lecturer.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.710
Bart, welcome to Berkeley.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.380
- Well, thanks for having me, Harry, yes.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.420
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.530
- Lawrence, Kansas.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.190
- Aha, the Midwest.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.023
- [Bart] Yes.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.330
- And looking back, how do
you think your parents shaped

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.170
your thinking about the world?

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.960
- Well, it was a fairly
conservative time and place.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.850
So I was born in the mid-50s

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.610
and Lawrence is a university town,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.520
so I think it is a little more progressive

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.363
than a lot of the rest of Kansas.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.720
But basically it was a pretty
conservative upbringing.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.900
- And what sort of
conversations did you have

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.170
around the dinner table?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.300
Politics or religion, the Bible?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.438
- Yes, yes, and yes.

00:01:34.438 --> 00:01:36.090
(Harry laughs)

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.630
And so, yeah, my parents
were quite interested

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.320
in all of the above.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.320
- Aha, and when did you
come to the conclusion

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.919
that you might be interested in religion?

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:53.350
I guess you became born again,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.950
as you describe in your
book, in high school.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.087
- Yeah, I had a religious upbringing.

00:01:58.087 --> 00:02:00.790
We attended an Episcopal
church when I was a child

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.510
and we were active in the church.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.310
But then when I was in high school

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.520
I started attending a
Youth for Christ club

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.865
which was in the high school.

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:13.540
And looking back it seems
a little strange to me

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.080
that I needed to be born again.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.388
I'm not sure what I'd been born from,

00:02:17.388 --> 00:02:21.000
since I already was a
religious Episcopalian,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.700
but I think the idea was
that I needed to have

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.760
a personal relationship
with God through Christ,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.520
and so that's what happened.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.030
Then when I was maybe 16 years old,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.550
and I became a very committed

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.119
and hard-hitting Evangelical Christian.

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:42.119
- And I gather that you see
the origins of your commitment

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.530
to scholarship during the same period.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.530
I believe you say you
became ill in high school,

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.800
and tell us what happened as a result.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.020
- Well, yeah, I wasn't a
brilliant scholar in high school,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.750
I was fine, I did well, but I actually,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.320
between my junior and
senior years in high school,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.810
I was playing baseball
actually and I got sick.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.322
I got hepatitis and it kept
me from playing baseball,

00:03:07.322 --> 00:03:09.160
and it kept me homebound,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.110
and I decided to start working

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.190
on the debate topic for that year.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.530
I was on the debate team,

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.880
and I threw myself into it

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.300
the way I had thrown myself
into athletics before this.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.290
And after a while, I was
just completely absorbed

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.290
by the idea of books, and reading,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.220
and knowledge, and research.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.220
And so, I trace my becoming
a scholar to that moment

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.280
in my life when I really
became intensely involved

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.190
with a high school debate topic.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.480
- And then where did you
do your undergraduate work?

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.210
- So then, since I had had
this born again experience,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.210
I thought that to be a
really committed Christian.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.400
I needed to have Christian training,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.880
and so my options were to be

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.200
on the debate team at Kansas University

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.610
or to go off to a Christian school.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.530
I decided that I really
wanted to be committed,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.610
and so I went to Moody
Bible Institute in Chicago,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.840
which was a three-year degree program

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.630
where I studied Bible and theology.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.630
Graduated from there,

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.060
and then I went to Wheaton
College in Illinois,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.060
which is Billy Graham's alma
mater to finish out my degree.

00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:20.980
- And then from there it
was on to graduate school

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.060
at Princeton, at the theological
studies program there.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.893
- Yeah, that's right.

00:04:25.893 --> 00:04:27.380
So, when I was at Wheaton,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.550
I took as my foreign language Greek.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.550
I wanted to do that because
the Bible is written in Greek,

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.900
the New Testament is written in Greek.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.193
And to understand it fully, of course,

00:04:39.193 --> 00:04:41.720
you need to be able to read
it in the original language.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.770
And so, I took Greek at Wheaton,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.360
and it turned out I was pretty good at it.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.510
And I decided I wanted
to do my graduate work

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.380
on the Greek manuscripts
of the New Testament.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.650
And as it turns out, the leading
expert of that in America

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.760
taught at Princeton Theological Seminary,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.310
a man named Bruce Metzger,

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.160
and he was at the end of his career

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.950
and I wanted to study with him.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.680
And so, I went to Princeton
Theological Seminary

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.590
and the only degree option

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.620
for me there was a divinity degree,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.230
so I was actually
trained to be a minister.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.420
But I was really more interested

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.490
in the academic side of
things and continued on then

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.362
and did a Ph.D. there in
the Greek New Testament.

00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:25.520
- And along the route of your
education in religious studies

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.220
did you have any mentors
other than Metzger

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.350
that really influenced you,

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.680
that kind of narrowed the focus

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.170
of where you wanted to
go in your research?

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.750
- I had a number of people,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.190
my Greek teacher in college,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.310
a fellow named Gerry Hawthorne,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.750
who was very influential on me.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.660
And I had several other
professors at Princeton Seminary.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.860
Most of them were New Testament scholars

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.860
and they were of varying degrees
of theological persuasion.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.700
Some of them were rather
conservative, as Bruce Metzger was.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.130
Others were on the other side
of the theological spectrum.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.930
And so, I think I was exposed

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.430
to a wide range of things
there that otherwise,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.913
prior to that, I hadn't been exposed to.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.370
- And after you getting your degree,

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.560
you were actually a minister

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.890
to a congregation in
Princeton, New Jersey?

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.240
- That's right, I was the pastor

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.940
of the Princeton Baptist
Church for a year.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.790
It was when I had actually
started my teaching.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.000
I graduated from Princeton
Seminary with my Ph.D.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.500
and I started teaching
at Rutgers University.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.500
And while I was doing my teaching,
I was also, for one year,

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.160
the pastor of this
American Baptist church.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.570
It wasn't a conservative
southern Baptist church,

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.110
it was fairly liberal.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.050
By this time, I had become fairly liberal

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.890
in my views of things,

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.345
and so I pastored this
church for a year, yeah.

00:06:53.345 --> 00:06:55.850
- So, help us understand

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.850
what an academic committed
to theological studies,

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.860
or a scholar of the
literature of the Bible,

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.035
what is it exactly that you do?

00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:07.868
(both laugh)

00:07:07.868 --> 00:07:09.770
- Yes, right, good question.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.260
So, I think roughly speaking,
very roughly speaking,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.520
there are two kinds of people

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.200
who do the sorts of things I do.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.670
There are some people who
are theologically oriented,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.110
who teach in divinities and seminaries,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.900
who are in the business of
training people to be ministers.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.530
And so, those are the kinds of professors

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.400
that I studied with,
people training ministers.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.830
But also, there's another type of scholar

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.290
who works outside of a divinity context,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.610
and that's where I started
working at Rutgers University,

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.430
which is the state
university of New Jersey.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:42.290
It's a secular university,

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:43.410
And after teaching there,

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.506
I've been teaching since 1988

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:48.993
at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.980
In this context, religion
professors are teaching

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.080
about religion rather than
trying to affirm religion,

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.350
or trying to convey religion.

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.540
They're teaching about religion the way

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.223
political scientists teach
about political science.

00:08:03.223 --> 00:08:05.633
They're not necessarily committed

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.960
to a particular point of view,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.120
and they're not trying to espouse

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.180
a particular point of view,

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.060
or trying to evangelize anybody.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.420
They're simply teaching about religion,

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.980
in my case teaching about
ancient Christianity

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:21.880
and the New Testament as
part of ancient Christianity.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.220
- So, if students were
interested in going this route,

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:29.260
what can you tell 'em about the skills

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.230
that are required to do this work?

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.670
Obviously languages.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.580
- Yeah, languages, but the
religious studies department

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:37.860
at Chapel Hill, or anywhere else

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.310
where there're religious
studies departments,

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:40.930
are usually parts of the humanities.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.010
And so, the kinds of
skills are the same skills

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:44.580
that students would have
if they were studying

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.980
classics, or philosophy, or history,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.370
or actually any of the
humanities or social sciences.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.860
Religion is understood as

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.290
an important historical
and cultural phenomenon,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:58.100
and it needs to be studied

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.600
as other historical and
cultural phenomena are studied.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.330
And so, that involves looking

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.010
at the literatures of religions,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.410
looking at practices of religions,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.600
looking at philosophical
undergirdings of religions,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.220
and so forth.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.690
During this time, when I was teaching,

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.313
I mean, the part we've left out so far is

00:09:15.313 --> 00:09:18.830
that I moved away from my
conservative religious beliefs.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.360
And I was teaching not as
somebody who was intent

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.740
on converting people to
some kind of religion,

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.027
I was actually just a
historian of ancient religion.

00:09:27.027 --> 00:09:31.860
- And this is a point I wanted
to go to next, which is,

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.050
as one looks at your story as recounted

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.830
as kind of a sidebar in your book,

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.360
God's Problem, you're on
two trajectories, basically.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.843
That is, very early you
become a person of faith,

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:53.230
drawing on your youthful
enthusiasm and strong beliefs,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.370
and on that trajectory, and
then another trajectory,

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.630
which you've just described,
is that of you know evidence,

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.240
historical analysis, a search for truth

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:12.230
in the secular way of doing
these things at the university.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.360
And I get the sense
that at a certain point

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.480
these two trajectories weren't
going on a parallel course,

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.950
that they crossed in one
way and you chose the other.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.320
Talk a little about that.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.830
- Well, no, that's exactly right.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.830
I think I got interested in
pursuing the study of religion

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.159
when I was a born again Christian

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:41.270
and was interested in knowing
more about this faith,

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.740
and that drove me into scholarship

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.740
because I wanted to learn more and more.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.370
But the more I pursued scholarship,

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.290
the more I saw that
scholarship at many points was

00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:52.780
at odds with my religious convictions.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.040
And so, over time I had to deal with this

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.450
on the personal level, which is,

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.920
it's quite unlike most academics.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.500
My wife is an expert in
medieval English drama

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.720
and this does not cut up

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.650
against her personal beliefs in any way,

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.880
and so it's how she's chosen
to pursue her academic life.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.440
But in my case, my academic
life was originally driven

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.940
by personal religious convictions

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.610
and then came to create tension

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.110
with my personal religious convictions,

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.770
and something had to give,

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.360
and what gave were my convictions.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.130
- And it struck me as
I was reading your book

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.640
that there's an element
of courage involved

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.380
in the path that you took.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.830
And by that, I mean
you must have believed,

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.370
and you must have believed strongly,

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.740
and then these two
worlds clashed in a way.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.020
And at a certain point you
have to confront yourself

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.600
in the mirror and say, well, you know,

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.630
I have to wonder about this.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.530
- Yes, well, as it turns out,

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.350
it's very difficult emotionally

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:02.350
to move away from a perspective,
religious perspective,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.850
religious world view
that you've held deeply.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.000
I see this with my own
students at Chapel Hill

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.820
where my students, many of them,

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.150
come from conservative Baptist backgrounds

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.870
and they're very committed to
the Bible and their beliefs.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.400
And when I teach the New Testament

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.500
from a historical perspective,

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.010
bracketing the question of belief,

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.520
and they learn historical information

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.660
about the New Testament,

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.360
it actually confronts them with things

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.810
that they're not comfortable with.

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.580
And it does create a good
deal of emotional turmoil

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:36.333
that is fairly unusual in the
world of academics, I think.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.070
But if one is gonna be a serious academic,

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.290
one needs to, of course,

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:46.140
engage in the study and things
fall out as they do, yeah.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.510
- In looking at your work

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:52.750
and the textual analysis you
do in the course of this book,

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.990
and some of your other
books which I looked at,

00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.990
it's very clear that comparative
historical studies are

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.310
very important as you look at these texts.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.220
And I wanna talk a little about that

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.580
'cause it seems to be very important.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.400
So, you're looking at a work
that we know as the Bible,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.010
or some piece of it,

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:21.010
and what are the questions
one has to ask about that work

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.720
when you're trying to understand
its multiple meanings?

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.930
- Yeah, the study of the Bible,

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:29.930
especially the New Testament,

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:33.700
which is what I'm particularly expert in,

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.190
is a complicated affair

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.430
because a lot of people
read the New Testament

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.940
and a lot of people have
opinions about the New Testament,

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.350
but scholarship on the New
Testament tends to be different

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:44.550
from the popular reading
of the New Testament.

00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.270
In part, just for the
reason that you mentioned,

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.320
that to understand the New Testament,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.900
one really has to situate it
in its own historical context.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.850
When people read the New Testament today,

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.170
mainly the people who
read it are believers

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.550
who simply assume that this is
speaking to them in some way.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.120
But the historians want to know

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.280
what these books are as
first century documents.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.770
These are written by Christians

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.160
in the first century who were living

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.350
in a particular time and particular place

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.417
with a particular set of
assumptions about the world,

00:14:13.417 --> 00:14:15.100
with a particular set of assumptions

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.360
about how religion works,

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.910
and one needs to understand these writings

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.320
within their own historical context.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.150
And once one does that,

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.100
once one engages with these books

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.520
from the point of view of history,

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.190
they start looking very different

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.460
from the way that they look
to just simple believers

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:37.200
who are reading the text
for personal reasons.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:42.200
- Is there a moment early in
these two phases of your life

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.620
where, you know, a light bulb went off,

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.620
or was this transition
to full-time scholar

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.843
from part-time evangelical,

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.540
was this the culmination of years,

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.670
or was there some moment that came?

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.590
And here I'm not as much interested,

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.470
we'll talk a minute about
how you watched suffering

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.390
and how that was a key part, but really,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.900
I'm interested in the contrast
between these two worlds.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.780
- Yeah, well, there were a
number of aha moments for me

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.460
when I realized that
there's a tension here,

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.110
and one of the early ones, I mean,

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:27.560
it sounds a little bit silly
now, looking back on it,

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:32.530
but I had done a term paper
for a class I was taking.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.720
In seminary, one takes courses

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.620
on a book of the New Testament
will be the entire course.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.260
And so I was taking a book on the exegesis

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.830
or the interpretation
of the Gospel of Mark.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.840
And one of the problems with the Gospels

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.730
that historians have long noted is

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.990
that there are a number of
discrepancies among them,

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.658
and contradictions, and they
have different perspectives,

00:15:52.658 --> 00:15:54.810
and how does one grapple with this.

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.190
And I was dealing, I wrote a term paper

00:15:57.190 --> 00:16:00.003
on a specific passage
in the Gospel of Mark.

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.780
It's a tiny little detail

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.430
but there's this passage in Mark

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.200
where Jesus' disciples are
accused by the Pharisees

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.710
of eating grain on the Sabbath.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.215
And Jesus tries to defend them by saying

00:16:13.215 --> 00:16:15.830
that these Pharisees should
remember what happened

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.780
when King David went into the temple

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.960
and ate the shewbread

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.280
which is only supposed to
be eaten by the priests.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.430
And they did this when
Abiathar was the high priest.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.930
And so, Jesus backs them down

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.390
with this reference to the Hebrew Bible.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.840
The problem is that when you actually read

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.940
the Hebrew Bible passage about
this in the Book of Samuel,

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:34.810
it's not Abiathar, the high priest,

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.230
who is reigning at the time,
it's his father, Ahimelech.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.980
And so, I wrote this 35-page
paper trying to explain

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.681
how it was that even though
Mark said it was Abiathar

00:16:45.681 --> 00:16:47.040
that was the high priest, in fact,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.270
what he meant was that it
was Ahimelech (laughs).

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.770
In other words, I was trying
to reconcile a contradiction,

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:56.520
and I spent 35 pages of
detailed interpretation,

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.320
dealing with the Greek text
and the grammatical problems

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.750
of the Greek text in
order to argue this point.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.810
And at the end of this paper,

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.230
my professor who was a
very pious Christian man

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.890
simply wrote a comment where he said

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.183
maybe Mark made a mistake.

00:17:11.183 --> 00:17:13.810
(both laugh)

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:14.660
- [Harry] I see.

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.760
- And it just blew open
the whole thing for me.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.500
I realized I had gone to all this effort

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.333
to try and show that, in fact,

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:20.960
there's not a contradiction here

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.190
but it's just much simpler
to say it's a mistake.

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:27.610
And once that happened I
started realizing that, in fact,

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.240
there are a lot of mistakes
in the Bible, contradictions,

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.530
discrepancies, different points of view,

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.160
different authors have different things

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.000
that they have to say
about fundamental issues

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.910
about who Jesus is, who
God is, what salvation is.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:43.580
And so that the Bible is
not a unified monolith.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.600
In fact, it's a book that has lots

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.690
of different points of
view represented in it.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:50.530
- And this is an important point

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:55.243
because you're dealing with the
problem of the human author.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.070
I'm not talking about Jesus now,

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.130
but obviously, you
know, the disciples who,

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.630
as you just said, make mistakes.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:07.630
But it's also these works
come to us after translations,

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:13.790
and so on, that add another
layer of mixed meanings.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.913
- Yes, absolutely, it's very,

00:18:19.718 --> 00:18:23.860
my older view that the Bible
is the inspired word of God

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:28.680
with no errors in it, came
under fire for just this reason.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.830
We don't have the originals

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.590
of any of the copies of the New Testament,

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.910
or of the Hebrew Bible either.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.020
What we have are copies that
were made centuries later,

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:41.670
in most cases, by scribes,
some of whom weren't very good,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.910
and these copies that we have
all have changes in them.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.330
This is what my earlier book
on misquoting Jesus was about,

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.030
is that we have thousands of copies

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.570
and these thousands of copies have

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.610
hundreds of thousands
of differences in them.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.940
And I got to a point where it
no longer made sense for me

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.050
to say that God had inspired
the words of this text

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.990
because we don't have
the words of this text.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.480
And so, what would be the point

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.930
of even saying God had inspired them?

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:07.830
We don't have them.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.700
And so, this was another
sort of moment for me

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.070
when I realized that, in fact,

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.250
this older belief of mine
simply wasn't credible.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:20.250
- Now an important theme in
your book is your own experience

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:28.430
in addressing the question
of human suffering,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:33.540
was also a catalyst for this transition

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:38.870
to, you know, just being
a scholar, in essence.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:42.470
But at the same time, you continued to be,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.220
I guess, a humanitarian,

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.120
or somebody focused on, you
know, the problems of the world

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.120
and finding your commitment
to faith as not giving

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:00.840
you the answers as you
worked through the text.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.773
Talk a little about that

00:20:01.773 --> 00:20:06.773
because it's a very human sense
of not just your suffering

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.670
but the problem of suffering,

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.350
which leads to changes in your thinking.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.470
- That's right, when I
was pastoring this church

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.910
in New Jersey was when I was moving away,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:21.150
in many ways, from my Christian faith.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:24.680
And one of the things that
happened in those years was

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.860
that I was teaching at Rutgers

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.630
and was asked to teach a
class at Rutgers called

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:33.140
the problem of suffering
in the Biblical traditions.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.500
It was a class that was on the books

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.730
and they needed somebody to teach it.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.710
They asked me to teach it.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.960
And I thought it'd be an
interesting class to teach

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.320
because I think a lot of
the authors of the Bible are

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.820
wrapped up with just this
question, why is there suffering?

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.580
And so, I taught this class at Rutgers,

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.320
and it got me thinking
deeply about the very problem

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.460
of suffering and why there's suffering.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.009
And I realized in the course
of teaching this class

00:20:58.009 --> 00:21:00.580
that different Biblical
authors have different answers

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:01.810
to why they're suffering.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.210
That a lot of these answers are not

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.950
answers people would have today,

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.200
and a lot of these answers
are at odds with one another.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.230
And this drove me deeper
into trying to understand

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.900
how we can explain this
world that we live in

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.280
with so much pain and misery in it.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.150
If there is, as the Bible says,

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:22.033
a good and all-powerful
God who's in charge of it,

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.190
if there is a God who's
in control of this world,

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.350
why is there massive starvation?

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:28.450
Why are there hurricanes?

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:29.540
Why are there tsunamis?

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:30.373
Why are there earthquakes?

00:21:30.373 --> 00:21:32.330
Why are there genocides?

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:33.630
Why is there a Holocaust?

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.660
I mean, all of these things

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.020
became very pressing issues for me,

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.670
as I started thinking more
and more about the world

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:45.670
and the relationship to some
kind of true God, ultimate God.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.480
- And when you were a minister

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.480
you mentored and nurtured
a Cambodian family,

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.510
and you talk about that in the book.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.900
Tell us a little about that

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.820
because that was kind of a
personal way that this hit you.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.580
- Yeah, it was actually
right after I stopped being

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.890
the pastor of this church in New Jersey.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.550
I decided that I wanted to be involved

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.290
in some kind of social work,

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:16.274
and I hooked up with the
Lutheran Social Services.

00:22:16.274 --> 00:22:21.274
And they had me tutor a
family, a Cambodian family,

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.830
in English as a second language.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.470
And so, every week I would go over

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:30.170
to this family's apartment
in Trenton, New Jersey.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:34.340
The fellow's name was Marcei
Noun and his wife, Sufi.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:38.300
And we would spend an hour
or two working on English.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.850
And as I worked with them
over the weeks and months,

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:43.110
it became clear they had gone

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.380
through horrible suffering themselves.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.750
They had been in Cambodia

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:49.320
during the purge of the Khmer Rouge,

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.280
and had lived in Phnom Penh.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.670
And had been driven out of
the city with everyone else

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.080
when they depopulated
the cities in Cambodia,

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.480
and had been put in slave labor camps.

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.080
And as I talked with them more,

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.020
I realized just the horrors
they had gone through,

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.633
very much like the movie,
The Killing Fields.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.403
And they had escaped finally.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.610
Marcei had tracked down
his wife and children

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.220
and they escaped under cover of night

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.670
over the mountains into Thailand,

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.700
and had been put into a refugee camp.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.030
And then had been brought
to the United States

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.313
by the Lutheran Social Services.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.210
- And you were struggling
with comprehending

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.600
how they could have gone
through this, I guess,

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.140
these experiences in Cambodia.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.130
- Well, they were horrible experiences,

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:48.040
and this is a case where a good deal

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.760
of the suffering is
simply caused by humans.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:55.760
I mean, Pol Pot's regime
was awful, and so on the--

00:23:56.307 --> 00:24:00.350
- And of course, our
bombing of Cambodia was one

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.885
of the factors that
helped create that regime.

00:24:01.885 --> 00:24:04.303
- No, it's what started the whole thing.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.020
And so, there were a number
of factors leading into it,

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.440
including American policy
in Vietnam, to begin with.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.440
But then the question was,
I mean, on a deeper level,

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.830
you can explain why on a
political level this happens.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.692
But on a deeper level,

00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:26.130
as somebody who was
still a person of faith,

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.270
I had to ask myself, why does
this sort of thing happen?

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:33.003
And how does one explain this?

00:24:33.003 --> 00:24:35.890
If one believes that there's
a God who answers prayer,

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:36.760
for example, I mean,

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.760
what is the evidence of
that, exactly, in Cambodia?

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.390
I'd say there's virtually
no evidence of it,

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:46.230
and this is what began making me challenge

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:50.140
my previous faith in a
good and all powerful God.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.100
- And this becomes the goal of your book,

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:57.826
which you conceived of
30 years, or so, back,

00:24:57.826 --> 00:25:01.420
but only now have written.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:06.420
And so, give us an
understanding of how you set out

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:14.000
with this problem in mind to
do the research that you do.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.240
- Yeah, so, well, I taught
this class at Rutgers

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.630
and I thought it was an interesting topic,

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.240
about how different Biblical
authors deal with suffering.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.090
You know, the biggest problem
I had at Rutgers, actually,

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.930
was convincing my 19- and 20-year-old,

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.540
New Jersey middle class, white students

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:30.414
that there was a problem.

00:25:30.414 --> 00:25:31.741
(both laugh)

00:25:31.741 --> 00:25:32.574
- [Harry] That there was suffering.

00:25:32.574 --> 00:25:34.690
- Yeah, that suffering existed

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:35.620
and there was a problem of it.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:37.580
And so, this was during, it was actually

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:39.420
during one of the Ethiopian famines.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.740
And I resorted to doing things
like bringing in pictures

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.610
from the newspaper of
women starving to death

00:25:45.610 --> 00:25:47.866
with children on their
breasts starving to death,

00:25:47.866 --> 00:25:50.080
and pointing to these pictures and saying

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.480
look, this is a problem.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.570
And so, I think the students got the idea

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.260
by the end of the semester.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.640
But then when the term ended I thought,

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.620
I'd really like to write about this,

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.200
about how different Biblical
authors struggle with it.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.100
But then I thought, you
know, I'm only 30 years old.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.340
I'm not really old enough
to write about suffering.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.230
I need to live a while longer.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:10.850
And so, a couple of years ago,

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.780
after I'd written a bunch of
other books on other topics,

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:14.971
I thought, you know, I'd like to go back

00:26:14.971 --> 00:26:17.100
to that question of suffering.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.557
And then I thought, no, you're
too young to write the book.

00:26:19.557 --> 00:26:21.870
But then I realized that when I'm 80,

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:23.788
I'm going to say, I'm too
young to write the book.

00:26:23.788 --> 00:26:25.420
(both laugh)

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.330
And so, I thought, well,
I'll just go ahead and do it.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.540
And so, over these intervening years

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.055
I've continued to think about
it, and to read about it,

00:26:33.055 --> 00:26:37.320
and so I decided to devote
some serious research time

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.260
into how the Bible authors
deal with this problem.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.000
And my book is the result of that.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.870
- So, let's talk about this,

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:49.870
and let's take one answer
of the Bible at a time

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.800
and see what we can draw out of you

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:58.770
about the way you study problems,

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:01.110
in addition to explicating what the,

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.330
you know, Bible has to say.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:08.330
So, the first item that
goes back in the Bible

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:11.650
to the beginning of the
Bible, the Old Testament,

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.980
what was the answer there?

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.980
What were we told in that
work about why we suffer?

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.860
- Well, one of the oldest answers
that you get in the Bible,

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.910
and an answer that pervades
much of the Hebrew Bible,

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.440
and is found in the New Testament as well,

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.593
is the answer that you find
in the early Hebrew prophets.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.030
And it doesn't really matter
which prophet you read,

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:40.540
whether it's Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Ezekiel, Hosea, Joel, Amos.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:44.137
All of these prophets
basically have the same view.

00:27:44.137 --> 00:27:48.490
The question they're dealing
with is why is it that Israel,

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.060
the people of God, suffer?

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.980
And the solution in the prophets is

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.300
that the reason the
people of God suffer is

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.210
because they have violated God's will,

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:01.060
they've broken the Torah, the law,

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.290
and God is punishing them.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.560
God is punishing them
to get them to repent

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:06.830
so they're return to him.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.370
And if they return to him
then things will be fine,

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:11.440
and the suffering will abate.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.510
And so, you find there's page after page

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.071
after page of these prophets,

00:28:15.071 --> 00:28:17.610
so that the basic answer they give is

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:20.423
that suffering comes as
a punishment for sins.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:27.350
- Give us one story that is
an example of this that really

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.750
makes the point which is
repeated again and again.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:32.930
- Well, it starts off,
it's not just the prophets,

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.170
it's the entire historical
narratives of the Hebrew Bible.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.880
I mean the Bible begins with Adam and Eve

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.300
being told not to eat
the fruit in the Garden.

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:45.520
They eat the fruit and
they're punished as a result.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.440
They're kicked out of the Garden.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.520
Adam now has to work and get his bread

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:51.990
by the sweat of his brow.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.880
Eve now, when she bears children,

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.663
will experience terrible pain.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.210
These are curses put on them
by God because they disobeyed.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.260
And as the narrative goes on,

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.200
this theme keeps getting repeated.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.590
The entire world,

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:08.260
eventually all of the
human race is wicked,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.200
and so God decides to punish
them by sending a flood.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.450
And so he kills everybody on Earth,

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.140
except for Noah and his close family.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.450
And it goes from there,

00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:18.700
you can read this narrative

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.450
throughout the entire Hebrew Bible.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.770
The sequence is that people sin,

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.790
it leads to punishment from God.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.140
If it leads to repentance, good enough,

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.363
if not, then more punishment comes.

00:29:31.864 --> 00:29:35.810
- And as we'll move to the
second solution in the Bible,

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.420
but the question arises,

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.240
as you move from solution to solution,

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.570
is it that the previous solution,

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.170
or the one that has dominated,

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:49.123
or the one that has come
first, has proven inadequate?

00:29:50.754 --> 00:29:54.370
Is that what's going on here,
in your mind as a scholar?

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:55.910
- That's part of it.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.700
Some of the subsequent
solutions come about precisely

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.000
because the earlier
solutions don't seem to work.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.650
I mean, the problem with saying

00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:07.720
that suffering comes
as a penalty for sin is

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.900
that you can't explain
why the righteous suffer.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.640
You would expect, under
the prophetic scenario,

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.840
that the people suffering all
the time would be the wicked,

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.370
and the righteous would be prosperous,

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:19.620
but it obviously doesn't work that way.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.900
And so, other solutions have to be devised

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.210
in order to explain that.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.280
There are other solutions

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.110
that are probably
independent of one another.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.190
There're a lot of smart
people in ancient Israel

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.450
and among early Christians,

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.190
and they had lots of different views,

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:34.230
and they weren't all just
reacting to one another.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.170
But this kind of progressive
idea certainly generated

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:40.147
a number of the solutions
that you get in the Bible.

00:30:40.147 --> 00:30:45.030
- And the second solution is what?

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:49.552
- Well, so it's not a sequence
of one, two, three and four.

00:30:49.552 --> 00:30:50.385
(both laugh)

00:30:50.385 --> 00:30:54.371
- Yeah, right, we're doing
the sequence of your book

00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:59.200
as opposed to, but here we have
to find another explanation,

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.020
and maybe it's what man does to man.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:06.271
- Yeah, well, the prophets
actually realized this,

00:31:06.271 --> 00:31:08.106
that not all suffering comes

00:31:08.106 --> 00:31:11.700
because of God punishing people.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.170
The reason God punishes people is

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:15.250
because people are doing
bad things to other people.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.610
And so, there's implicit
in that, of course,

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:20.370
the understanding that a
lot of evil happens simply

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:24.540
because people are wicked, or
they behave in a wicked way.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.400
This is the closest thing

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.740
that you get in the Bible to what is now,

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:33.340
among Christians anyway,
the prominent explanation.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.680
The prominent explanation
among Christians is

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.617
that the reason there's
suffering in the world is

00:31:39.617 --> 00:31:43.050
because people have free will.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:44.750
God has given people free will.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.260
If he hadn't given them free will,

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.520
they would be programmed
like robots simply to do

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.150
what God had asked them to do.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:51.510
But since they have free will,

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:54.770
they have the freedom not only
to love God but also to hate.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.610
They have the freedom not only to do good

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:58.110
but also to do evil.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:02.470
And so, necessarily there
is suffering in the world

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:05.450
because of the existence of free will.

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.040
And so, the Bible doesn't quite go at it

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.070
in those philosophical terms,
but it certainly understands

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.840
that human beings can do nasty things

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.920
to other human beings,

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.955
And that's one of the reasons
there's so much suffering.

00:32:16.955 --> 00:32:21.726
- As you're looking at these
answers, and you pointed out,

00:32:21.726 --> 00:32:26.200
that there were bright people
in these religious communities

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.150
who were thinking about these issues,

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.720
but what other things should we look at,

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.890
you as a historian, you know,

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:37.490
in terms of their social milieu,

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:38.910
the historical forces at work.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:41.890
One of the things that
comes up again and again is

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:44.144
this was all happening
in areas of the world

00:32:44.144 --> 00:32:47.560
that were being conquered
by one empire after another.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.630
- Yeah, well, it's not an accident

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.990
that the Biblical authors are
so taken up with suffering,

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.120
I mean, just precisely

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.500
because of their historical situation.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.130
Israel, of course, is located at a place

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.600
that was a very desirable
place for anybody wanting

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.430
to to have, claim to be a world empire.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:09.750
So it's situated roughly
on the fertile crescent

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.210
between Babylon and
Assyria over to the east,

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.700
and Egypt to the southwest.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.180
And anybody who wants to
control that whole area has

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.970
to control the land that Israel claimed.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.110
And so, Israel continually,

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:25.960
on top of regular natural disasters

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.880
that anybody in the ancient world had,

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.100
famine, and drought, and
pestilence, and so forth,

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:32.140
Israel had the problem

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.850
of constantly being
conquered by other countries.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.980
And so, in the 8th century BCE,

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.450
it's conquered by the Assyrians.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:40.400
In the 6th century, by the Babylonians,

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.930
later by the Persians,
later by the Romans,

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.610
and the Greeks, the
Romans, and so it goes.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.800
And these prophets, in fact,
were responding precisely

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.970
to these situations and saying,

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:53.890
the reason Assyria has overthrown you is

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.260
because you've sinned.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.970
If you hadn't sinned, it
wouldn't have happened.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.040
But then some people
looked around and noticed

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.740
that the righteous people in
Israel suffered just as much

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.190
from the Assyrians as the wicked did,

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.410
and so they have to have
some other explanation.

00:34:08.410 --> 00:34:13.410
- And the third alternative
here is suffering as redemption,

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.690
which becomes very important
in the New Testament.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:22.590
- It does, and it becomes
probably the key motif

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:26.020
in the New Testament's
understanding of suffering,

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:28.300
but it's found already in
the Hebrew Bible, as well.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.363
- In the story of Joseph,
you mentioned, yeah.

00:34:29.363 --> 00:34:32.130
- Oh, the story of Joseph
in the Book of Genesis.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:35.290
Joseph is sold by his brothers as a slave

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:38.630
and ends up in Egypt as
a slave to a household.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.050
And so this is not a great life.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:42.580
He's eventually thrown in prison

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.540
for being falsely accused of rape,

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.400
and very bad things are happening to him.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.350
But the way the story works
is that God is working

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:53.950
behind the scenes all along the way,

00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:58.950
so that at the end Joseph is
elevated to a position of power

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.060
in the government of Egypt.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.830
And he's able to bring
salvation to his family

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.950
that's starving to
death back in Palestine.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.670
And they come to Egypt

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.710
and he's able to provide
them with what they need.

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:16.560
And so, they are saved from a dire famine

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.820
because of Joseph's suffering, indirectly.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.720
And so suffering can sometimes
have a silver lining,

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.480
or sometimes suffering actually brings

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.090
salvation of some sort.

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:27.450
That's the view that gets picked up,

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.750
of course, in the New Testament

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:33.120
where Jesus himself suffers
for the sake of salvation.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.500
And so, in that view,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.493
salvation is directly
a result of suffering.

00:35:40.593 --> 00:35:45.020
- And then we move,
well, not sequentially,

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:50.020
but another alternative here
is that God is all powerful

00:35:50.682 --> 00:35:55.640
and we have to accept that,
and you find this in Job.

00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.500
- Job is a very interesting
book, and of course,

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.320
you know, any book that
talks about suffering

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.484
in the Bible has to talk about Job.

00:36:02.484 --> 00:36:06.630
What people frequently
don't understand about Job,

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.290
I'd say most readers of
Job don't understand,

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.790
is what scholars have
recognized for a very long time,

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:17.330
which is that Job actually
has two different authors

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:19.180
with two different books

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.400
that have been put together into one book.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.340
And so, the book people
are familiar with is

00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.820
the beginning and the end of the story,

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.940
where you have Job who's
a very righteous man.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.100
And because he's so righteous,

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.580
he has thousands of cattle,
and thousands of sheep,

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.840
he has a great family,
seven sons, three daughters,

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.070
and he's got a terrific life.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:42.070
And the Satan, the sort of
devil's advocate up in heaven,

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.130
tells God that the only
reason Job is righteous is

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:48.640
because he's getting everything out of it.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.120
And God and Satan, in effect, have a bet

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.533
that Satan can get Job to curse God.

00:36:56.359 --> 00:36:58.810
And Satan does his
worst, it doesn't happen.

00:36:58.810 --> 00:37:01.010
Job doesn't curse God,
he's a patient sufferer

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:02.780
even though everything
is taken away from him,

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.550
his camels, his sheep, his possessions,

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:08.670
his children are killed,
everything is taken away,

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.050
but he still doesn't curse God.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:12.250
And so, then God rewards him.

00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.810
He rewards him by giving him back

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:17.130
twice as much of everything he had before.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.860
So he got twice as many
sheep, camel, servants,

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.860
he gets 10 children back,
and dies a happy, old man.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.460
So, in this view of suffering in Job,

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.990
suffering comes as a test of faith.

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:33.090
Will you remain faithful
even if things aren't good?

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.413
And if you do, then you'll get rewarded.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.270
That's a powerful story.

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.510
I find it offensive, actually, in part.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:44.690
What I find especially
offensive is this idea

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:47.900
that Job can be given
back 10 other children

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.730
as if the murder of 10 children,

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.440
you know, that can be made all right

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.690
by the substitution of
10 additional children.

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.590
I find that completely offensive,

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.920
but that's one of the views of Job,

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.120
this narrative at the
beginning and the end.

00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.690
What people don't realize is

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.860
that the middle part of Job
is written by somebody else.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.500
It's not written as a story,

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.810
it's written as a series of poems

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:15.743
in which Job and his three
so-called friends have dialogues

00:38:15.743 --> 00:38:19.280
about why Job is suffering.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.290
And the friends take the
prophets' point of view,

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.580
that Job is suffering because
he's done things wicked,

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.530
and God's punishing him.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.330
And Job insists he's not
wicked, he's innocent.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:28.630
He hasn't done anything wrong.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.540
And after chapter after chapter

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:31.670
of them going back and forth,

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:34.280
Job finally demands that God appear to him

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.640
so that he can state his case

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.270
and show that he doesn't deserve this.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.560
And God appears out of the whirlwind,

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.480
but instead of explaining to
Job why he suffered, you know,

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:46.740
Job, well, it was actually
a bet that I had with Satan,

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.590
or it was a test to see if you'd be strong

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:51.760
but you've passed the test.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.090
Or instead of giving some explanation

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:57.760
what God does is he
overwhelms Job with his power

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.807
and begins by saying,

00:38:59.807 --> 00:39:02.750
"Where were you when I laid
the foundations of the earth?"

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:06.550
And he starts in on Job
telling him that he's almighty

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:08.000
and Job is a mere peon,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.430
and basically he squashes Job in the dust.

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:14.647
And Job ends this poetry by saying,

00:39:14.647 --> 00:39:17.300
"I repent in dust and ashes."

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.800
Well, he repents, he
didn't do anything wrong,

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.340
but since God is almighty
and Job is a mere mortal,

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.200
he has no right to question the almighty

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.530
about why he's suffering.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.650
So, that's the answer to the poetry.

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:29.483
- It's interesting here

00:39:29.483 --> 00:39:32.530
because of the textual
analysis you're doing

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:36.170
and the work of your scholarship.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:41.170
You actually unravel layers of
subtlety and complexity here,

00:39:46.567 --> 00:39:47.587
which is interesting (laughs).

00:39:47.587 --> 00:39:48.840
I'm just commenting, it's a comment.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.784
- Yeah, well, I think to understand Job

00:39:50.784 --> 00:39:55.740
without that kind of unraveling
of its different parts,

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.840
Job doesn't make any sense (laughs).

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.130
But I think when you
look at it in this way,

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.610
that you actually have
two different authors

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.370
whose books have been spliced together,

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.510
and you realize that, in fact,

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:08.130
the patient Job of the
beginning and end isn't

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:10.800
the impatient Job of the poetry.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.950
And that the view of suffering
at the beginning and end

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.810
isn't the view of the middle of the book,

00:40:14.810 --> 00:40:17.370
it actually then makes better sense.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:21.777
- Now Ecclesiastes and the
vision there is the one

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.690
that you seem most to relate to.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:26.840
- Yeah, I do,

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.620
I think the Book of
Ecclesiastes is maybe underread.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.640
It's a terrific little book.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.640
It claims to be written by Solomon,

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.520
the wisest man ever to have lived.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.080
But in fact, it was written
hundreds of years later.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.960
Scholars who are linguistic
experts in Hebrew can date books

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.640
on the basis of the style of the writing,

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.800
It's pretty clear this is a later book,

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.220
somebody claiming to
be Solomon, who wasn't.

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:52.550
The point of the book can be found

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.500
at the very beginning
where the author says,

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.770
vanity of vanities, all is vanity.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:00.560
The word vanity is a Hebrew word, hevel,

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.040
which means, it's something like

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.840
the mist that's around for a little while

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.940
and then burns off and it disappears.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.630
So, it means something that's transient,

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:12.040
temporary, impermanent, and
that's what all of life is.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.770
This world goes on and on and on,

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:14.700
nothing ever changes.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.110
There's nothing new under the sun,

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.520
but we're here just for a little while.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.850
And so, what does one do with that?

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.730
Well, the Book of
Ecclesiastes looks around

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.360
and sees there's no justice.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.620
And he looks around and sees
we're not here for long,

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.510
and his conclusion is
we should eat and drink,

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.740
and enjoy our toil, and enjoy our spouse.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.160
He believes that you should
grab the simple pleasures

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.430
in life for as long as you can

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.610
because this life is all you have.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.060
There's no afterlife,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.160
this isn't a dress rehearsal
for something else.

00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.490
It's not a dry run, this is it.

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.370
And so you should enjoy life

00:41:49.370 --> 00:41:52.960
for all it's worth while you can.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.923
- One of the solutions that
you discuss has appeared

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:04.170
to have greater relevance in our time

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:07.350
because of the way it
appears to have intruded

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:09.190
on American politics.

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:14.190
And here we're talking
about the apocalyptic vision

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.500
to solve this problem,
to explain suffering

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.080
by the notion of apocalypse.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.550
And your analysis points to the way

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:28.550
that this appears initially
in the Old Testament,

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.523
in the Book of Daniel.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.780
Talk a little about that,

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.680
and then help us understand

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:40.290
what the key components
were to this answer.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:45.270
- Yeah, this answer becomes
prominent in early Judaism,

00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:50.384
near the end of the Hebrew Bible period

00:42:50.384 --> 00:42:51.570
in the Book of Daniel,

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.630
which is the last of the
books of the Hebrew Bible--

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.620
- And that would have been
what year the hundred uh--

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.070
- About 150, 160 BCE.

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:02.660
So, but this view becomes
dominant in the New Testament

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:07.463
and becomes the explanatory
position of the New Testament.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:13.350
This view is called apocalyptic

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:16.410
because it's based on the
Greek word apokalupsis

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.540
which means revealing or an unveiling.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.900
The idea is that God has
revealed the heavenly secrets

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.090
that can make sense of earthly realities,

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:29.690
and so God explains why this
world is in the state it's in.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:31.450
The apocalypticists were reacting

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:33.860
against the prophetic point of view.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.400
The prophets thought that
God was punishing people,

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.140
that's why they were suffering.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.010
But the apocalypticists realized
that righteous people are

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.070
the ones who are suffering,

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:43.880
and so God must not be punishing them.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.230
So, why are they suffering?

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:47.400
And the apocalypticists
came up with the idea

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.690
that there are forces opposed to God

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.830
that are creating suffering in the world.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.610
This is the period in
which Jewish thinkers came

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.270
to think that God has a
personal enemy, the Devil.

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:59.500
And the Devil has demons who work

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:02.040
his nefarious ways here on earth,

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.030
and there're all these cosmic forces

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.670
that are creating havoc here on earth.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:10.630
But God is ultimately going
to establish his sovereignty

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.390
over the world by destroying
these forces of evil

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:16.070
and setting up a good kingdom on earth.

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.090
And so, the apocalypticists
believed that in the future

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:21.340
God would once again reassert himself

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.650
and good would emerge triumphant,

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.090
and God's Kingdom would come to replace

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.340
these wicked earthly kingdoms on earth.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.650
- Now when you're discussing
the prophet Daniel,

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:36.467
it becomes very interesting
that his prophecies

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:42.650
and descriptions come at a
time when the Greek influence,

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:48.750
and the efforts by the
Greek Empire at that time,

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:53.750
to Hellenize and to stop the
traditional Jewish rituals,

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.800
prayers, ways of behaving that
follow the dictates of God,

00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:08.703
that this is how we get
the Maccabean Revolt,

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.380
which is celebrated by Jews today

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.683
as the holiday of Hanukkah.

00:45:16.807 --> 00:45:20.600
So, Daniel is a man of his time

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.600
who's dealing with real historical forces,

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:31.130
the efforts to colonize this
Jewish community in Judea,

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:40.810
and his language becomes
very metaphorical, basically.

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:42.230
- Yeah, that's right.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:44.940
So, this was an awful time period

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.563
for people living in Israel.

00:45:47.487 --> 00:45:50.810
The monarch of Syria, who
was trying to Hellenize,

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:54.420
trying to make Israel Greek,

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:58.380
basically outlawed the
possibility of following Torah,

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.360
so that to the extent

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.630
that women who had their
baby boy circumcised,

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:06.150
the children would be murdered

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.030
and hanged around their mothers' necks.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.374
And we learned about this
in some of these books

00:46:10.374 --> 00:46:13.870
of First and Second
Maccabees, for example.

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.560
And Daniel is responding to this.

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.550
He sees this not just as human evil,

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:19.620
bad things that humans do,

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.100
he sees it in a bigger
cosmic context that, in fact,

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.220
there are forces that are bigger than us

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.410
that are at work in this world

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:28.690
that are creating this kind of havoc.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.420
And since these are cosmic forces,

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.700
they need to be dealt
with on the cosmic level.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.830
God himself is going to intervene

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:38.340
and destroy these forces of evil,

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.210
and get rid of the evil kingdoms

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.310
to set up his good kingdom on earth.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:45.490
- Now and you suggest that when you look

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:46.733
at what they're writing,

00:46:46.733 --> 00:46:50.990
it's on the one hand very descriptive,

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:54.910
it's like four chapters have been written

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:57.080
and these are the chapters of where we are

00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.830
and what has happened to us, and so on.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:03.830
And that what the
apocalypticists are giving

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.370
the people of the time
is the next chapter,

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.590
looking ahead to the future.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:13.210
So, in a way, they're
kind of futurologists.

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:14.400
- Yes, absolutely, in fact,

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.860
they use a very interesting ploy.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:21.514
Daniel, as we said, was probably
written maybe 150, 160 BCE,

00:47:21.514 --> 00:47:26.514
but the author claims to be
Daniel living 400 years earlier

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:28.910
under the Babylonian captivity.

00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:32.000
And so, this author pretending

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.700
to be Daniel 400 years earlier,

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.000
predicts what's going
to happen in the future.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.570
But as he's predicting what's
happening in the future,

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:38.610
the real author, of course,

00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:41.420
is recounting what's already
happened in the past.

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:43.470
So that the reader reads this

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.140
and thinks that this
ancient person was correct

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.130
about all of his predictions.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:50.110
But the author then goes on to predict

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.570
what's going to happen next,

00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.600
and the reader doesn't realize
that now he's changed gears

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.820
and is talking about what's
going to happen in the future.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.110
The reader thinks the whole
thing has been a prediction,

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:03.700
but this then provides
validation for his predictions

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.660
of this good kingdom that's going to come,

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.190
you know, in a matter of months.

00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:09.030
And so it provides hope for readers

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:10.620
that, in fact, this has all been foreseen,

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.440
it's all been according to plan,

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.070
it's all under God's sovereignty.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.870
And if we hold on for a little
while longer, it'll be okay.

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:22.870
- Why do you think that these
kinds of visions have taken

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:29.650
on a new influence, a new power,

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:34.710
and not just today but in
recent years in our culture,

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:38.023
and had such a political impact?

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.670
- Well, it's a very good question.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:45.060
You know, there continue to
be people today who think

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.210
that some kind of apocalyptic scenario

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:49.190
like this is going to be played out.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:52.493
When I was in college in the 1970s,

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:56.700
the best-selling book
in the English language,

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.430
this isn't widely known,

00:48:58.430 --> 00:49:00.060
the best-selling book
in the English language,

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.720
apart from the Bible, was a book called

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.000
The Late, Great Planet
Earth by Hal Lindsey,

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.300
which was an apocalyptic scenario

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.800
about what was going to happen

00:49:09.893 --> 00:49:12.220
when war broke out in the Middle East.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:15.690
And the Soviet Union was gonna march in,

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.940
and there was gonna be a
confederate of European nations

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.750
that came in to oppose the Soviets,

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.630
and a nuclear holocaust was gonna happen.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:26.430
And this was told as a prediction
of what really was going

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.420
to take place based on
prophecies of the Bible,

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.560
the Book of Daniel, the Book
of Revelation, and so forth.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:34.690
This was an extremely popular book,

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:36.030
millions and millions of copies

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:37.880
of this thing were read and believed.

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:42.993
And in our day the Left Behind series,

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.950
many people watching
this show may not know

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:50.200
the Left Behind series, but
it was extremely popular.

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.890
It sold more copies
than The Da Vinci Code.

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:55.060
And people believe

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:56.780
that there's gonna be this apocalyptic,

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.010
and I think it's a very
interesting question,

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:03.020
why it is, especially in
American Christianity,

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.080
that it's believed that
this apocalyptic moment

00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:07.350
is going to happen.

00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:09.430
You know, that people are so
dissatisfied with this world

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:10.600
that they think that it's controlled

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.500
by Satan and his henchmen,

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.580
and that God's going to
do something about it.

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:15.910
It's a very interesting question,

00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:18.220
what exactly the appeal is.

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:23.220
- And is it that, in some
ways, I wanna be careful here,

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.760
that the elements of this
make sense at one level,

00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.140
and that if people of faith

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:39.220
who are looking for explanations

00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:40.810
of what's going on in the world,

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:45.030
and they're not sort of
grounded in political analysis

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:47.521
or economic analysis,

00:50:47.521 --> 00:50:51.483
that one can see them making that leap.

00:50:52.323 --> 00:50:56.880
And when you get a work that purports

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.630
to put everything together--

00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:59.463
- [Bart] Yes.

00:50:59.463 --> 00:51:00.470
- Then you've got an audience?

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:04.420
- Yes, absolutely, these
apocalyptic scenarios

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.960
as painted in the Bible, in
the New Testament, for example,

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:11.210
they speak about awful natural disasters.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:12.550
There'll be earthquakes,

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:13.970
and there'll be hurricanes,

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:16.760
and there'll be, and they
lay out all these disasters,

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:18.420
there'll be wars and rumors of wars.

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:23.270
And of course, every
generation has had earthquakes,

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.910
and hurricanes, and tsunamis,
and wars, and rumors of wars.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.110
And so, people who read
the Bible literally think,

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:30.290
oh, this is talking about our day.

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.950
And so, this happens,

00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:36.380
if you go into a conservative evangelical

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.540
Christian bookstore today,

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.060
you'll find shelf after shelf

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:40.670
of prophecies coming fulfilled.

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:42.580
You know, this was going
to happen to Israel

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:43.860
and this has happened.

00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:46.790
You know, there were
supposed to be disasters

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:47.623
and look what happened,

00:51:47.623 --> 00:51:49.370
we had tsunamis, we
had Katrina, et cetera.

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:51.973
And so, things are being
fulfilled in our own day.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:55.830
- Given your background as a person

00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:00.830
who brings historical
analysis to these texts,

00:52:05.110 --> 00:52:07.700
you seem to be in a unique position

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.423
to address a very
important question, namely,

00:52:11.499 --> 00:52:16.499
how are people of faith drawn
to the present situation

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.260
in a more progressive way,

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:26.230
so that their faith leads
them to be concerned

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.723
about the environment?

00:52:28.669 --> 00:52:33.520
So that their faith leads them
to the humanitarian concerns

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.350
that, you know, are a
theme throughout your book?

00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:41.350
And I'm curious, does your
perch, your portfolio,

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:44.943
as somebody who starts
as a person of faith,

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:51.100
moves away from that but
continues to study, you know,

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:54.260
these issues as they appear back in time

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.350
and contributes to the
interpretation of text,

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:58.320
is there an answer there

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:01.453
that you can help us see a way toward?

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.660
- Yeah, you know, I think
one of the most hopeful signs

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:10.660
on the religious scene is
that a large number of people

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:14.650
on the religious right have taken up

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:16.350
important social issues.

00:53:16.350 --> 00:53:18.980
The reason this is a hopeful sign is

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.720
because the apocalyptic
scenario that I just painted out

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:24.640
has often led to social complacency.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.450
If, you know, if the end is coming

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:28.720
and God's gonna make
right all that's wrong,

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.020
and God is gonna resolve
all of our problems,

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.620
then there's no point in us really

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.000
sort of doing much about it now

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.700
because we can't do much about it.

00:53:37.019 --> 00:53:40.450
But Christians of the far right
have started realizing that,

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:44.710
in fact, if God is going
to do this in the future,

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:46.440
we ought to be doing
something about it now.

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.986
And so you find people

00:53:47.986 --> 00:53:51.343
who are typically conservative Christians,

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.170
who are now supporting things,

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:57.800
like environmental issues, global warming,

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:02.800
and concern for world
poverty, and issues like that,

00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.670
which have traditionally
been more liberal issues.

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:07.820
But they're being taken up by
these conservative Christians

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:10.530
because they realize that
their theology, in fact,

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:13.030
virtually requires them to be
concerned about these things.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:15.940
And so, I see that actually as
one of the more hopeful signs

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.900
on the political scene right now,

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.710
in terms of what's going on
with the religious right.

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:26.430
- How do you advise students
to prepare for the future?

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:30.200
Because presumably it's not just students

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:36.990
who wanna become ministers
who are in your classes

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:39.010
at the University of North Carolina,

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:40.770
but also people of faith

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:44.790
who wanna deal, you know, with
the problems of the world.

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:48.100
Is there some advice
that you would give them,

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.820
in terms of their studies,

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:53.610
in preparing to address those problems?

00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:57.820
- Yeah, you know, the strange
situation that one is in,

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:00.900
teaching religion in
a secular institution,

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:05.850
is that you're teaching a
subject about which, I mean,

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:08.390
you can't promote a particular
aspect of your subject

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:11.200
because of the separation
of church and state.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.110
So, I do get students

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:14.280
who are planning on going on to ministry,

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.745
but by far, my students are
simply people taking the class

00:55:18.745 --> 00:55:20.650
because they're interested
in taking a class

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:23.680
in the New Testament, you
know, along with their classes

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.490
in philosophy and history
and classics, or whatever.

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:31.430
But what I try to do in my
classes is actually fairly basic.

00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:34.330
I mean I do try to get
students to understand

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:36.960
that you have these different
perspectives in the Bible.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.190
Whether you're a person of faith or not,

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:41.690
the Bible contains a
lot of different answers

00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:43.060
to a lot of different issues,

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.330
so that I'm trying to get them to see

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:48.120
that you can't simply, you
know, rest on the Bible,

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:49.490
the way that many of my students

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:52.512
in North Carolina think they can do.

00:55:52.512 --> 00:55:54.900
But basically, what I'm trying to do is

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.870
to do what I think every
university professor needs to do,

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:00.063
which is to get students to think more.

00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.670
And teaching Bible in the South is

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:06.310
a perfect way to get this to happen

00:56:06.310 --> 00:56:09.210
because students come in
with a vested commitment

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.130
and interest in the subject matter,

00:56:11.130 --> 00:56:13.200
unlike almost any other
subject they're taking.

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.740
And if you disabuse them

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:17.150
of many of their perspectives
and their assumptions,

00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:19.560
it forces them to think.

00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.090
So that they have to come
up with solutions themselves

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:23.410
for things that otherwise they thought

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:26.230
were gonna be handed to
them on a silver platter.

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:27.430
This makes them, I think,

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:31.540
not only more interesting

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:34.520
and more able to deal
with religious diversity,

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.030
but also with political
diversity, for example.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:39.830
Instead of simply accepting
what their parents told them

00:56:40.928 --> 00:56:42.380
about the political situation,

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:43.610
they're forced to think about it.

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:45.950
And so, that's really kind of my strategy,

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:49.420
I think, is to get students
to reflect on big issues

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:53.060
and to realize that there are
multiple views represented.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.630
And that one has to come
to some kind of decision

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:57.461
based on rational thought

00:56:57.461 --> 00:57:01.270
about what position one wants
to take, whether religiously,

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:03.500
politically, economically,
or anything else.

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:05.210
- Well, on that note, Bart,

00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:07.010
I wanna thank you very
much for being here.

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.170
Let me show our audience your book again,

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:10.120
which has actually been

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.230
on the best seller list, God's Problem.

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:15.400
And I wanna thank you again.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.490
- Okay, well, thank you.

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:18.460
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.940
for this Conversation With History.

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.607
(mid-tempo riveting music)
