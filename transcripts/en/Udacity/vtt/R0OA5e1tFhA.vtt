00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.770
Okay Michael. So, are you ready to give me a ranking

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.780
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, I think I am.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.470
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, if you give me a ranking then.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.910
&gt;&gt; So, did you say one was the best.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.910
&gt;&gt; One is the best and three is the least best. Alright, so I

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.900
am really excited about the third cloud

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.790
structure. The third attribute to be split

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.210
on. Because, what it does. Is it takes all our x's and o's That

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.750
need to have different labels and it

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.930
puts them into two different buckets. One where

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.340
they all get to be red x's and the other where they all get to

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.360
be green o's. So I would say the far right one is ranked number one.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.930
&gt;&gt; I would agree with you and in fact I would say that infact we're done.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's perfect.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.570
&gt;&gt; It is perfect, agreed. One is perfect. Or 3

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.630
is perfect in this case, because I gave it a one.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.890
&gt;&gt; Alright, so then, I think the worst one is also

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.810
easy to pick, because if you look at the middle attribute,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.400
the attribute that's shown in the middle, we take all the data, and we put

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.890
it all on the left. So we really have just kicked the can down the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.050
road a little bit. There's nothing. That

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.020
this attribute splitting has done. So, I would

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.970
call that the worst possible thing you could

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.660
do. Which is to basically to do nothing.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.220
&gt;&gt; No, I think that's right. and, in fact, it really is doing nothing.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.730
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.640
&gt;&gt; Okay. So

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.190
what about the first attribute?

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.150
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to put that at, you know,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.130
if the first one is too hot and the middle

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.570
one is too cold, I would say this one is,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.370
wait, no, no. [LAUGH] I was going down the Goldilocks

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.320
path. So, so this one is sort of in between.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.570
In that it splits things so you have smaller sets

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.450
of data to deal with, but it hasn't really improved

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.230
our ability to tell the reds and the greens apart.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.650
So in fact, I'd almost want to put this as three also but I'll put it as two.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.360
&gt;&gt; Okay. I think an argument could be making it three. An argument could be

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.670
made for making it two. Your point is actually pretty good, right? We have eight

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.100
red things and eight green things up

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.560
here. And the kind of distribution between them,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.840
sort of half red and, half red x's,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.330
half green o's, we have the same distribution

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.500
after we go through this attribute here. So it does some

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.180
splitting, but it's still, well you still end up with half

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.120
red, half green, half x, half o. So, that's not a

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.510
lot of help, but it's certainly better than doing absolutely nothing.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.960
&gt;&gt; Well is it though? I mean, it seems

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.810
it could also be the case. That what we've done

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.400
is that we're now splitting on that has provided

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.950
no valid information, and therefore can only contribute to overfitting.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.420
&gt;&gt; That's that's a good point. That's a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.420
good point. So, do you want to change your answer

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.780
to three?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.980
&gt;&gt; I don't know, what did you want the answer to be? It seems

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.520
to me that the first one and the second one are just plain bad.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.730
&gt;&gt; They are just plain bad. The question

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.550
is whether one is, more bad than the other.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.500
&gt;&gt; I, I don't know. I don't know how to judge.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.750
&gt;&gt; Well I'll tell you, I would accept

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.860
either two or a three as an answer here.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.200
I think you can make an argument either

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.170
way. And I think you actually made both arguments.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.270
&gt;&gt; That's very nice of you.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.330
&gt;&gt; So.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.170
&gt;&gt; You're very welcome. So this is perfect. This

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.560
is the House of Representatives and this is the Senate.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.720
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What do you mean they're? Oh. So, there you go. Okay.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.220
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Not exactly sure what you mean,

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.460
but it seems somehow denigrating to our political system.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.620
&gt;&gt; It is not at all denigrating. It is,

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.570
it is, I would call it incisive political satire.
