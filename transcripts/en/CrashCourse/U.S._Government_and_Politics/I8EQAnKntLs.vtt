Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
&amp; Politics, and today, we're gonna talk about

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.260
bureaucracies, just as soon as I finish filling
out these forms. Do I really have to initial

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.220
here, here, and here on all three copies,
Stan? Regulations say so? All right. I'm just

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.300
kidding. I don't really have to fill out forms
in triplicate in order to make an episode

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.320
of Crash Course, but this kind of stuff is one of the
main reasons that people don't like bureaucracies.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.200
Americans tend to associate them with
incomprehensible rules and time-wasting

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.320
procedures and probably most annoying - actual
bureaucrats. But bureaucracies are a lot like our

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.740
extended families, in that we largely don't understand,
or at least don't appreciate, the important role that

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.100
bureaucracies play in our lives, mainly because of all
the forms, and because my cousin who always ate

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.940
all the cookies from the jar at Grandma's
house.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.860
[Theme Music]

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.740
So what exactly IS a bureaucracy? I don't
like to do this, because I'm arrogant and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.730
lazy, but sometimes it's helpful to go to
a dictionary when you need to find out what

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.579
a word means. So here's a serviceable, political
science-y definition: "A bureaucracy is a

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.790
complex structure of offices, tasks, rules,
and principles of organization that are employed

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.380
by all large scale institutions to coordinate
the work of their personnel."

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.109
Two points to emphasize here: First, bureaucracies
are made up of experts who usually know more

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:17.429
about the topic at hand than you do and who
are able to divide up complex tasks so that

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.639
they can get done. Second, all large scale
institutions use bureaucracies, so the distinction

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:25.560
between big business and big government is,
in at least this respect, bogus, or what I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.160
like to call a false dichotomy. Is that too
pretentious to say "false dichotomy," Stan?

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.180
I don't care, I'm saying it. False dichotomy!

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.440
So if people hate bureaucracies so much and
compare them unfavorably with Google and Amazon,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.670
why do we have them? Well, the main reason
is that bureaucracies are efficient. They

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.430
make it easier for governments to accomplish
tasks quickly and to basically operate at

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.330
all. In the US, federal bureaucrats fulfill
a number of specific important functions.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.330
One, bureaucrats implement the laws that Congress
writes. Have you ever read a law? They're

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.470
pretty complicated. It's a good idea to have
experts who can interpret them and put them

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.680
into action. Two, bureaucrats also make and
enforce their own rules. But this isn't as

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.829
action hero-ish as it sounds. And three, they
settle disputes through a process called administrative

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.029
adjudication, which makes them kind of like
courts.

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:10.170
Now, since I know that all of you have been
paying extremely close attention to these

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.810
episodes, you know that at least two of those
functions are problematic in ways that go

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.890
beyond making rules that seem Byzantine or
stupid or both - Byzantupid.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.380
The big concern here is the separation of
powers, which you remember is the idea that

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.330
power is divided between three branches of
government. Technically the federal bureaucracy

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.020
is part of the executive branch, but it's
so big that it dwarfs the other two branches

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.580
and can easily overpower them, much like I
overpower this eagle.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.220
"That's right eagle. I make my own rules,
like a bureaucracy."

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.440
But an even more troubling, to some people,
aspect of bureaucracies is what they actually do.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.800
So let's go to the Thought Bubble. Bureaucracies
don't just enforce the rules; they make new

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.900
ones called regulations. In doing this, they're
acting like a legislature, especially since

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.620
the rules have the force of law and people
can be punished for breaking them. For example,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.230
if you say "Sh%t Sticks" on TV, the FCC can
fine you, just like the local law enforcement

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.900
would if you broke a state law against speeding.
And don't say "Sh%t Sticks" to the cop. But

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.130
according to the Constitution, Congress is
supposed to make the laws, so if you're a

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.820
constitutional formalist, this is going to
give you fits.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.680
On the other hand, the rule making process
allows for a degree of popular participation

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.670
that goes way beyond what happens in Congress.
In 2014, Congress called for the mandatory

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.270
notice and comment period on new FCC rules
on the issue of net neutrality. Any person

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.290
can read the proposed rules which are not
easy to understand and offer a public comment,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.640
including suggestions for new rules using
the internet. The bureaucracy is required to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.980
read the comments and they could be incorporated into
 the final rules that are published in the federal register.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.840
So in a way, federal rule-making is more democratic
than congressional law-making, but it's still

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.530
not in the constitution. Administrative adjudication
raises similar separation of powers issues,

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.320
but they're less problematic because the constitution
gives congress the right to establish courts

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.310
other than the Supreme Court and it doesn't
say that these can't be administrative tribunals

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.010
that are part of bureaucratic agencies.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.500
Many low level bureaucratic positions are
filled through competitive exam-based civil

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.430
service procedures which are supposed to ensure
a level of expertise and take politics out

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.440
of the staffing process. But many upper level
bureaucratic leaders especially cabinet secretaries

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.230
and also ambassadors are very political. For
one thing, they're appointed by politicians

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.150
who may be repaying favors or trying to pack
the agencies with like-minded favorites.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.500
For another, bureaucrats engage in bargaining
and protect their own interests, the very

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.280
thing that politicians do all the time. Thanks
Thought Bubble.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.930
So the first reason we keep bureaucracies
is because bureaucracies are useful. They

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.310
do get things done even though it might not
be as quickly as we'd like. And some of these

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.420
things are things we want done, like inspecting
our meat so we don't get E. coli or Salmonella

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.080
or Mad Cow Disease. One response to this that
we'll talk about later is to get rid of public

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.270
bureaucracies and contract their tasks out
to private companies. There's something to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.850
be said to this. After all, in a lot of ways
UPS does a better job of getting packages

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.160
to us than the postal service does. And I
also have a lot more fun at the private bowling

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.780
alley than the public one. There's no
such thing as a public bowling alley.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.880
If there is, I'm going. Might be free.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.310
But the main argument for privatization seems
to be cost. And that one might not always

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.510
be true. It seems unlikely that a private
corporation would spring up to inspect meat.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.770
And although we can rely on pricing to signal
that our chicken wings are salmonella free,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.480
I don't think it's a good idea. So in addition
to being useful and filling roles that the

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.200
private sector might not fill, one of the
reasons we have so many bureaucracies is because

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.870
Congress keeps making them and delegating
power to them.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.210
If we didn't have bureaucracy, Congressmen
and their staff would be taking on all the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.960
oversight and enforcement of their own laws.
In addition to creating its own separation

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.000
of powers problem, this might be kind of chaotic,
considering that potentially the entire House

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.390
of Representatives could be replaced every
two years.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.100
One advantage of bureaucracies is a certain
amount of stability in the built-up expertise

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.540
that comes with it. Probably the main reason
why we don't change bureaucracies though is

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.320
that doing so is really difficult. Once Congress
makes a bureaucracy it's usually permanent

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.840
for a number of practical and political reasons.
We'll get into those reasons next time.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.300
So I'm going to wrap this up with a little
bit of a reminder about Federalism, based

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.150
on a largely unwarranted assertion. I bet
that if you ask most Americans to give an

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.270
example of a bureaucracy they will say the
DMV. Most people will tell you a DMV horror

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.470
story of the time they had to wait in line
for four hours just to renew their license

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.340
and when they got to the counter a clerk told
them that they didn't have the right forms

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.510
and they needed to post a money order, and
not a credit card or a check or even cash

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.060
and that anyway they had to go on break and
I had to come back in fifteen minutes and

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.000
all I wanted was my license-- AAAAAAH the
DMV!

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.940
And I sympathize with this predicament but
I feel the need to remind anyone who has had

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.840
this experience at the DMV, that it's a state
bureaucracy, not the federal bureaucracy.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.919
Most of the bureaucrats you meet in your daily
life: teachers, policeman, tax assessors are

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.840
officials of your state government, not the
federal government, like Bureaucrat Jimmy.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.510
Which is pretty much what the Framers intended.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.300
So it's a good idea to be thoughtful about
which government we're going to transfer our

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.350
anger towards and to rage against the correct
machine. That's what federalism's all about.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.050
