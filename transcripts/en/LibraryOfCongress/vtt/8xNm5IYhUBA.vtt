00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.170
&gt;&gt; It is such a great pleasure to
be sitting next to this gentleman.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.660
I've spent a fair amount
of time today going

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.380
through some treasures
in the collection.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.340
&gt;&gt; And it was fun to
see your reaction

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.090
to those including some things
you haven't seen in decades.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.210
&gt;&gt; Some not in 50 years.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:52.870
But even before we start, I'd
like to acknowledge and thank Reva

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.630
and David Logan Foundation

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.450
for underwriting this entire
residency of Abdullah Ibrahim.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.320
They also were generous

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.640
in supporting the Maria
Schneider residency.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.830
So we are grateful to
them, and we're happy

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.370
that you all came tonight.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.170
So --

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.340
[ Applause ]

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.170
And it occurs to me that there are
many different ways you can learn

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.670
about music.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.670
These days literally
you can go to school.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.370
You can go to conservatory.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.140
You can learn your instrument and
spend your entire life practicing.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.490
You can read books.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.470
You can go to live performances,
but for me one of the greatest ways

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.260
to learn about music is
to talk to the masters,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.670
and we are very fortunate
that we have one

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.500
of these masters with
us here tonight.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.510
I want you to help
me Abdullah Ibrahim.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:59.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.220
So I think I'd like to start
just by asking, you know,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.670
I alluded to the fact that that
we had a session this afternoon,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.870
and we looked at some of the
treasures, and I wondered

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.970
if there were any things in
particular that resonated with you,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.070
that really caught your attention?

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.840
&gt;&gt; Well all of them, all of them.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:32.780
There's a narrative in
the experience locked

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:42.980
into the [inaudible] and
Mingus and Eric Dolphy, Duke.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.080 position:56%
I was fortunate that could
interact with these great musicians.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.050
I haven't been in this part
of the world for some time,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.690
almost 20 years as
we did our last tour.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:08.600
The United States is gratifying and
it is quite a wonderful experience,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.670
almost a step back in
time, but that time

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.410
in fact being brought
to this present moment.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.320
And a lot of the music that I
looked at is more like the things

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.590
that we forgot to follow up.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.730
Especially as a composer you are
always left with residual stuff

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.840
that needs to be updated and
upgraded if you go back to it.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.150
Some of the things that we
[inaudible] we call it the spur

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.530
of the moment and some
years later you begin

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.000
to really understand what it means.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.940
So it's this wonderful
present that we've been given

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.690
to understand what we
experienced in the past

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.360 position:56%
in this moment, this present moment.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.730
When Jay and myself, Jay is my
colleague from Johannesburg,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:39.020
when we, after we spent
what was four hours --

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.750
&gt;&gt; We spent four hours.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.100
&gt;&gt; Yes. We went back to the
hotel and we had promised

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.790
that we would celebrate
with green tea.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.620
But the celebration
still hasn't happened.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.570 position:56%
[laughter] Just a little [inaudible]

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.230
of this wonderful experience
that [inaudible].

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.310
&gt;&gt; I should mention and share
the fact the fact that one

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.180
of the extraordinary parts
of our collection had to do

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.420
with the copyright office and the
fact that musicians and composers

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.680
who registered their work before
the 1970s would literally write

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.920
out the composition on what
is called a lead sheet.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.760
It's basically a skeleton
of the piece.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.000
And this is how you registered
your work for copyright.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.710
You would send in the lead
sheet with a little feed,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.020
and then the copyright
office stamps it,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.690
and we had literally
millions of these.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.780 position:56%
Many of them are stored in our
warehouse out in Landover, Maryland.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.510
And so because I knew Abdullah
was coming, I spent an afternoon

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.690
in the copyright office just
looking for anything either

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.950
under the name Dollar Brand,

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.880
which was his original professional
name, or Abdullah Ibrahim.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.850
The things for Abdullah Ibrahim, he
registered with sound recordings,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:13.080 position:56%
but the things under Dollar Brand's
name we have maybe 15 or 20 of them.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.620
&gt;&gt; Some of them, yeah.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.870
&gt;&gt; And they're in his hand,
which to me is always revealing,

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.720
to see somebody's handwriting.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.310
And so it was an indescribable
pleasure for me

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.610
to bring this envelop, to have him
sit down, and I said, take a look.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.480
And we pulled out these sheets
that he hasn't seen in 50 years.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.100
&gt;&gt; And those songs, some of you,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.070
some of these songs are very
well known and some not at all.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, not at all, yeah.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.280
&gt;&gt; Some things you
hadn't even recorded.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.580
&gt;&gt; No.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.300
&gt;&gt; So, can you give me a sense.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.950
I know you tend to
live in the moment.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.450
You know, we talked about that.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.720
But at the same time, what kind
of memories go through your mind

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.020
when you see a composition
you wrote 50 years ago,

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.790 position:56%
and there's a story behind each one.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:16.080
I've got to say, it's a document
that was created or initiated

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.430
at that time, and something
that we have to follow through.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:27.510
It was imbedded in there as --
it was 50 years ago, there was a,

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.890
I wrote the music either about
an event or about people,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:40.320
and there's always this expansion
of understanding what it is

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.920
that we captured at that time.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.980
So seeing the music
today, some of the,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:54.540
most of those songs I
hardly play anymore, but,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:59.170
and then when you showed me some
of the Ellington [phonetic] things

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:07.520
that we wrote, at that
time in '60 and from '59,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.020
we were already working

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:20.710
on nontraditional harmonies
and rhythms.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:25.590
And when I met Ornette
[phonetic] and of course Ellington

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.840
when I met Ornette and Don Cherry,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:34.420
they really endorsed what we
had been, or I had been writing.

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.450
It was like in the late '50s.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:46.610
So seeing the charts today says to
me that these are works that need

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:52.030 position:56%
to be revisited and maybe completed.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:56.880
Is that what the charts
were actually just like,

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.430
were lead sheets, so it
doesn't give us an idea

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:07.380
of how [inaudible] symbols.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:18.540
So I would like to take
some of the songs and just

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:26.940
of restructure them
[inaudible] also write for, to,

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:33.130
as an anchor curriculum
for younger musicians.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:39.310
And then include these
works that other composers,

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:46.220 position:56%
like Ellington's Such Sweet Thunder.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.040
There's a wealth of,
there's a wealth of,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.210
there's a wealth of material.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.930
Most of [inaudible] things that we
haven't touched, so we practice,

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.150
we used to practice 24/7, now
it's like 25/8 [laughter].

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.050
You've given me a task.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:14.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You know, one thing that occurred
to me, just gauging your reaction

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.080
to things today, these compositions

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.190
of yours are born out
of your experience.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.580
These are not abstract
feelings that are evoked.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.860
These are events that occur
in your life or people

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:33.200 position:56%
that you know, is it still that way?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:39.850
&gt;&gt; Sure. When I was in high school,
my composition teacher gave me,

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:48.820
people in your life give you
little treasures that you keep,

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:55.090
and it guides you on the path,
and my composition teacher

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:58.750
in high school told me that
when you write about something,

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.590
write about the things
that you know best.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.930
Right? And the things that
I know best is the people

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:09.880
that I interact or
events that happen.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.830
So in that sense, I think
the stories and music

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.540
and the sound then become unique.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:29.430
So I really don't have to compete
or challenge [inaudible], yeah.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:41.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I don't know how many
people here understand or know much

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.520
about Abdullah's past and the
context that he comes out of

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.670
as a creative pianist,
composer, and band leader,

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:54.490
but so let's talk just a little
bit about that if you don't mind.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.230
You were born when and where.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.690
&gt;&gt; 1954, Cape Town.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.030
&gt;&gt; And Cape Town at that time,
your mother played piano?

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.550
&gt;&gt; My mother and grandmother
were both pianists

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.040
in the church, AME Church.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.340
&gt;&gt; Okay. And so you grew up
with a piano in the house?

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:19.020 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. At that time the instrument
of choice [inaudible] was a piano.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:24.830
So many people had
pianos in their homes.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.130
Some were pianos.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.390
Some used to be pianos.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.150
But there was a piano there.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.060
&gt;&gt; Did you take to it naturally

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.800
or did your mother have
to tell you to practice?

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.700
&gt;&gt; Not really because there
was an instrument in the house,

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.910
so soon I became curious
and started,

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.860
you know, on the instrument.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.710
And my grandmother realized,
and she sent me to a,

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:50.000
to the local school teacher
to learn how to read music.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:56.830
That opened up a complete
another world for me.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:05.070
Not just musically but in
terms of experiencing global

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.280
or international dynamic.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.230
&gt;&gt; Because you were hearing
music from all over the world?

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because Cape Town
was very unique in that field

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.350
because of its geographical
position.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.650
&gt;&gt; It's a port city.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.600
&gt;&gt; It's a port city, but you know
it's the gateway between west

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.380
and east, you know,
between Europe and the east,

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.960
so a lot of shipping,
ships came through.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.360 position:56%
So it has a very, very deep history.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.230
We have perhaps people
from all over the world.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:46.860 position:56%
From Malaysia there were slaves and
political prisoners who were brought

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:53.800
to Cape Town because they fought
the invading Dutch [inaudible],

00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:03.840
and it became a battleground
before between east and west.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.590
Cape Town when the Dutch landed
there and then the British,

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.700
there was conflict with
the British and the Dutch,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.030
especially during the Crimean War

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:20.290
when Cape Town became
a very strategic point.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:27.010
The first people from our
research, the first people

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.230
who came there were
Venetians and Arabs.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:35.870
It was a very unique place.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:41.270
So, at an early age we were exposed

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.830
to this world culture
and world music.

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.680
Indian music, Chinese music.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.550
People were in the community.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:56.680
So if we look at our relationship
with the rest of the world,

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:03.750 position:56%
for example, not specifically the
west but the east, one of the things

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:11.390
that we are researching now is
the narrative Admiral Zheng He,

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:17.370
who was a 14th or 15th
century Chinese explorer.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:24.430
And from China he did
about seven expeditions.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.060
He had 300 ships.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:32.740
The mother ship was the size of
a football field and unsinkable.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:40.990 position:56%
He had doctors and scribes, and he
did to India and then back to China.

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:51.950
And then he came around to
India, to the, to Arabia and then

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.260
down the coast of East Africa.

00:15:55.260 --> 00:16:01.890
And from the upper East Africa
in Kenya, the people still

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:11.760
at this day they have memories
and recollection of this armada

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.220 position:56%
that came to, that came to the east,
I mean the east, east of Africa.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.760
So there has been a considerable
interaction, you know.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:27.350
This was 13th or 14th century.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.760
We suspect that he
rounded the [inaudible].

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:36.270
So during the years we've been
researching this connection

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:43.620
with ourselves and
internationally, one of the things

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:52.620
that we researched, researching
Venice, because Venice

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:57.330
at that point was the
center of [inaudible].

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:07.830
And there was a young
Venice, explorer from Venice

00:17:07.830 --> 00:17:14.930 position:56%
who traveled parallel with Admiral
Zheng He, and then he went to Venice

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.890
and the Pope requested a
meeting and told the Pope all

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:26.090
of his experiences, and he
drew a map of the world.

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:29.490
This was the first map
[inaudible], and this was the map

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.660
that Columbus is thought
to have used,

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:34.720
but this was from General Zheng He.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.690
So a narrative, a narrative
[inaudible] and especially

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.350
in South Africa is a very, very,

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.880
very broad in perspective
with world [inaudible].

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:49.830
So we were influenced by all
of these cultures [inaudible].

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:53.740
And so writing the music
was, some say write

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:57.620 position:56%
about the things that you know best.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:02.770
&gt;&gt; So as you're growing up, you're
hearing music on the street.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.070
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.370
&gt;&gt; You're hearing live performance.

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.670
Are you hearing radio?

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.970
Music on radio?

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:09.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We listened
to the radio programs.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.750
There was one program from
Lorenzo Marks because everything

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:16.730
for us was monitored
during the regime.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:22.150
You know, there were things that
were banned, but we had, as always,

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.420
we have young people who
are very resourceful,

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.800
so everything that was banned
we had access to it in some way.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:35.390
[laughter] So we had radio and one
of the radio programs was the Voice

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.290
of America with Willis Conover.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.140
And we corresponded to
that, corresponded with him,

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.440
and when he passed away,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:48.980
when we came to New York,
I met his [inaudible].

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.700
So it was through radio,
jazz programs but, I mean,

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.180
you know in South Africa,
if you don't understand

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.450
in South Africa we have
nine different nations

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:02.840
with different language
and different cultures.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.000
I was fortunate that I lived you
know every way in South Africa,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.920
so I was able to absorb some,
you know, some of this culture.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:21.640
Radio, one of the first things
that I heard jazz was on the radio.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.720
But also at that time we had
ice cream, ice cream vans

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.020
that would go around the town.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.320
&gt;&gt; The ice cream man, yeah.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:29.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they used to Louis Jordan
and that's why -- [laughter].

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.190
&gt;&gt; That's a pretty [inaudible].

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.490
&gt;&gt; Ice cream man.

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:34.790
&gt;&gt; I like that.

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:36.310
&gt;&gt; So that's when I
heard Louis Jordan.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:42.850
I thought, I don't know who this
person was who made that selection,

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:48.720
and that got us interested in him
especially because Louis Jordan was

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.000
like a precursor to Johnny
Hutchinson [inaudible] right?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.040
And it resonated with us
because he was also very close

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.890
to our tradition.

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.680
Piano, boogie woogie.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.980
[laughter]

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So when did you
start to attempt to play jazz?

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:17.320
&gt;&gt; It was in the early
[laughter], apparently the word got

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.280
around that there was
this young piano player,

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.090
and these limousines used
to pull up to our house.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:33.180
Again, these young resourceful
people with no means of visible,

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.640
visible means of support would
ask me if I would like to play

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.790
for their concert or
their vocal group.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:43.660
And then my grandmother said,
well, what are going, I was about,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.120
first gig was about when I
was 13 or 14 years of age.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.060 position:56%
And I used to play for vocal groups.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.700
You know, based on like the deeper
the voice, and they copied this

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.000
but it was traditional [inaudible].

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.330
&gt;&gt; These would be popular songs --

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.630
&gt;&gt; Very popular.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.140
&gt;&gt; Or religious songs or --

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.440
&gt;&gt; Well we played for
everything [inaudible] --

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.740
&gt;&gt; Band songs, yeah.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we would play in church

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.210
and then Saturday night
you do your thing,

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:13.600
Friday night, and Sunday in church.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.900
We played all the music.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.200
&gt;&gt; So you were telling us earlier
tonight about your first group,

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.250
something about tuxedo, a group?

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the first big band that I
played in when I was about 16 years

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:24.920
of age was a big band because at

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.800
that time the big bands
abounded in South Africa.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.400
&gt;&gt; And in Cape Town
there were two big bands.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.010
The one I played with was
called the Tuxedo Slickers.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.310
&gt;&gt; Tuxedo Slickers.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.330
&gt;&gt; And the theme, the theme
song was Tuxedo Junction.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.630
&gt;&gt; Erskine Hawkins.

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.210
&gt;&gt; Erskine Hawkins, yeah.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.510
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:45.010
&gt;&gt; So we had this broad
experience of all music

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.490 position:56%
from Britain, Africa, America, yeah.

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:50.910
&gt;&gt; The east?

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:57.260
&gt;&gt; So I suppose most
people's perception

00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:02.470
of South African popular culture,
I'm talking about internationally,

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.920
is all tied to this
brutal racist regime

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.500
that imposed an apartheid system.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:17.410
And I wonder how that regime dealt
with jazz, so what did it represent

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.940
to the regime and what did jazz
represent to the musicians?

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:31.310
&gt;&gt; Well we had really
unique mentors.

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:35.830
They preferred to remain
totally anonymous.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:41.060
They'd tell us we will teach you
but don't tell anybody about us.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:47.510
These are unsung mentors
in our communities.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:48.810
Incredible people.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.040
Very knowledgeable.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:58.610 position:56%
So these were our mentors, and at
an early age they made us understand

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:04.160
that this was not, whatever
the regime was trying

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.300
to tell it was, it
was not really true.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:14.560
That we were dealing
with a human condition,

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.450
which you had to transcend.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:24.940
And so at an early age
it was impressed on us

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:29.520
that it was imperative
that we should recognize

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:36.190
that they are not our teachers,
they were not our teachers.

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:41.600
My great grandmother, [inaudible]
we do not have interaction

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.030
with the bushman people,
never fought a war.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:51.130
The call themselves
the harmless people.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:55.820
Because we seem to resolve things.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.980
So whatever the regime
attempted to put into our heads

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.490
to make us believe
that this was going

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:05.630
to be nonconflict, we understood.

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.790
And our leadership also knew.

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.980
It was like Mandela, this
is what the narrative

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.440
that was happening [inaudible]

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:19.170
and not what they were telling
us we were supposed to be

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.140
and what we were supposed
to be doing.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:26.860
So we understood that
they are not our teachers

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.820
and that they cannot choose
the battlefield for us.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:36.910
&gt;&gt; But at the same time, they were
able to control your movement,

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:41.910
for example, where you
went, how you could work,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.020
what kind of music
you could perform.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.320
&gt;&gt; Oh sure.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.620
Who we should play with.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:51.100
You had to get a special
permit for musicians, you know,

00:24:51.100 --> 00:25:00.220
[inaudible] ethnic group
they are, but we understood

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:11.850
that it was totally, not
even unethical, it was,

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.990
it was not correct
because in the scheme

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.070
of things you can't throw
anything out of the universe.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.620
Where would you put it?

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.920
[laughter] So no matter where,

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.090
no matter where they tried
to move us, [inaudible].

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.020
&gt;&gt; Was it dangerous
for you to play jazz?

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.690
&gt;&gt; It was dangerous,
what they perceived

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.270
to be dangerous [laughter].

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:44.110
We would, everybody
was dangerous to them.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:50.010
Because their plan was to
take away our identity,

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:55.660
not just our ethnic identity
but our human identity, you see,

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:59.480
and make us believe that
things can be solved

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.720
through brutality, and we refused.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.480
We refused.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.940
And that was the power [inaudible].

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:12.420
&gt;&gt; Did you choose to play jazz just

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.560
because you liked the
music aesthetically,

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.970
or were you trying
to make a statement?

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.910
&gt;&gt; Never making a statement.

00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.850
What should I make
a statement about?

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:29.150
What shall I say?

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:37.860
[laughter] We understood and even
up to the day that our goal is

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:46.920
to perfect whatever it is that
we are doing and nothing more.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:54.990
One of the bushman elders
told us, I said to him,

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.970
you know, humanity we are at loss.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.640
We need water and we need wisdom.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:10.830
So he said to me, that is a very
interesting analogy that you draw,

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:17.800
and he said, in the infinite
there is always conflict

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:22.220
between the planets and the
stars, but it has to be like this

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:28.710
because this is the order,
and it takes a long time

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:31.500
to maintain this order
and there's a lot

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.030
of suffering involved
to maintain this order.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:42.120
And God put us on this earth
to maintain this order.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.320
And it takes a long
time and suffering,

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.610
but eventually humanity
will have to accept it.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:51.390
If you're like me, we were
given the task to tell people

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:57.120 position:56%
about this order, whether they laugh
at us or whether they push us aside.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.860
And wherever you are,
I'm holding your hand.

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.040
You are my brother.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.540
And this is the message
that was there

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:08.760
from our mentors and our elders.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:16.390
We are representatives here
to maintain this order.

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:21.270
And we will not follow them
because it's not correct.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:27.730
&gt;&gt; Do you believe in fate?

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:33.750
&gt;&gt; We say patience is to faith
what head is to the body.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me think about that.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:38.970
&gt;&gt; Patience --

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:40.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:41.570
&gt;&gt; -- is to faith --

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:42.870
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.170
&gt;&gt; -- what head is to the body.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.070
Faith is actually patience.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:50.500
&gt;&gt; So --

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.010
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] patience.

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:59.100
&gt;&gt; Are things in your mind, in your
belief, are things predetermined?

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:04.430
Were you fated or destined to
be a musician, to be a composer?

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.450
To live in the world?

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.910
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] banned
everything but we read everything.

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:12.290
&gt;&gt; Ah, really.

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.930
&gt;&gt; We experienced everything.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.770 position:56%
I mean in the same case, [inaudible]
we started reading everything.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:25.360
I mean everything from Shakespeare
to Marx and Hagel and [inaudible].

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.360
We went through all of them.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.510
And [inaudible] the
western philosophers,

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:37.610
the process was this idea of
predestination and free will.

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:43.670 position:56%
So how can you be predestined, be
predestined, but you have free will.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.230
How does this work?

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:52.550
Because if you are
predestined, you can choose.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:58.910
If it's predestined, what is the
conflict if you have free will.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.750
But the Lord's prayer
says thy will be done.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:07.300
So everything is predestined.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.560
Either you believe it or not.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.900
This is where the separation comes.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.050
Because if you say that
it's not predestined,

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.880
you are saying that
God does not know.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:27.850
And we were taught like from little
children to live your destiny.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.540
And when you understand
your destiny,

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.820
you understand what other
people live their destinies

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.000
so we no conflict with all this.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.500
There is no reason to fight.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.520
&gt;&gt; So if you don't mind, let
me resume the chronology.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:50.320
In early '60's, probably around
'62, things become much worse

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.310
in South Africa, and you
choose to go into exile.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.080
&gt;&gt; Was this just a gradual
decision that you came to

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:05.550
or was there an event or something
that precipitated this decision?

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:12.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for all of us there were
events, like in the late '50's

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.340
and '60's they became paranoid.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:21.890
You see, because they knew that
change was going on because,

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:25.930
and especially with the music
that we played at that time.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:32.300
Our parent, our grandparents
were a little more accommodating

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:37.800
to understand that,
but the '60's came

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:46.530 position:56%
and the collective understanding was

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.170
that we are not afraid
of you anymore.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:53.860
We have no fear of you, because
before there was the fear.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:32:01.980
And especially with the so-called
[inaudible] young people refused

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:08.460
to study in African's language,
and I took to the streets

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.800
and everything was we have
no fear for your anymore.

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.550
And that was the beginning,
the beginning of the end,

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:21.860
and then they started
reacting very violently.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:29.730 position:56%
For me personally, because everybody
understood this, there would be

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.050
that knock on your door at four
o'clock in the morning, you know,

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:36.100 position:56%
and nobody would see you after that.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:43.960
So, they came to me in the
morning [inaudible] jail,

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:49.620
and the next morning I appeared
in court and I was charged

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:55.180
with a traffic violation, and
they were going to take me

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:59.820
to some outpost there where I
was supposed to pay the fine.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:06.560
But as I walked towards the
court, the station commander,

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:12.150
who was Africana, he said to
me, are you not little Ibrahim,

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.120
the jazz pianist, he
said what are doing here.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.420
So I explained.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.940
So he pulled me out.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:18.240
&gt;&gt; He recognized you.

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he pulled me out.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:24.230
You see, then I said wait a minute,
there's something deeper than this.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:27.100
[laughter] Anyway so I explained
to him, and he said okay, we'll try

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.260
and fix it for you, all right.

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.380
Then he was, well come
into my office.

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:38.610
Then he called this other
policeman, Paul Jango [phonetic],

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.140
this was his name, Paul Jango.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:44.500
And we all feared Jango
because he was very brutal.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:49.850
So Jango came in, and then the
commanding officer said to Jango,

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.920
[inaudible] play nice music.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.960
Hey Jango, why don't you
arrange a nice party for us?

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.810
[laughter] Get some girls
[laughter], get a [inaudible]

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:10.760
because if [inaudible] this
would be the end of me.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.600
So but my people bailed me
out, and the next day I got

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.230
out of South Africa
because they were coming.

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.420
&gt;&gt; And where did you go?

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:22.140
&gt;&gt; I had a friend who invited
us over to Switzerland.

00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.380
&gt;&gt; You went to Switzerland?

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.680
&gt;&gt; Switzerland.

00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.980
&gt;&gt; And Zurich?

00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.280
&gt;&gt; Zurich, yeah.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.570
And at what point, is that
where you met Duke Ellington?

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:39.390
&gt;&gt; Talk a little bit about the
circumstances and what it led to.

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:43.630
&gt;&gt; Zurich at that time,
when we landed there,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.220
it was the coldest
winter in 60 years.

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:51.210
Whew. If we were headed right back.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:55.510
We stayed there, and some
of students, they were very,

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.340
very helpful, helped us
get and accommodation.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:04.910
And then a lot of American
musicians came through on concerts.

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:12.600
I had a lot of them there,
[inaudible], Jazz Messengers.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.900
&gt;&gt; Art Blakey.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.300
&gt;&gt; Art Blakey, yeah.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.380
[inaudible] That's where
I met Wayne Shorter.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.970
&gt;&gt; Wayne Shorter.

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:22.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.400
&gt;&gt; Freddie, Freddie Hubbard.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.790
&gt;&gt; And you start to meet more
and more American jazz musicians?

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, jazz musicians.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:38.030
We had, I had this gig at
this little club in Zurich.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:46.730
Then we had [inaudible] and so
but the club owner didn't want us

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:53.200
to have a night off to go there,
so my fiance, my wife [inaudible],

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.910
now she has passed on, Sathima,
she went to the concert,

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:06.710
and we were playing, in fact they
were busy closing up the club

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:11.410
when she walked in with Ellington
and the whole entourage just come.

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:13.180
I said, what?

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.820
[laughter] She convinced
Ellington to come and listen to us,

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:25.840
and he heard us and then two days
later he took us to Paris to record

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.160
for Reprise, Reprise Records.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:41.320
And on that session, there
was, Billy Strayhorn was there.

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:44.650
Stray sat on the recording.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:50.130 position:56%
So but before the session started,
he asked Sathima, so what do you do?

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:51.740
&gt;&gt; He didn't know she
was a vocalist.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.180
&gt;&gt; No.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.800
&gt;&gt; You know that he was married at
that time to Sathima Bea Benjamin.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.100
&gt;&gt; Benjamin.

00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:00.050
&gt;&gt; Who was a great South
African vocalist, and so --

00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:02.040
&gt;&gt; She said I sing.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.800
&gt;&gt; And he said, okay,
we'll start with you.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.100
[laughter]

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.400
&gt;&gt; In the studio?

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.000
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.770
&gt;&gt; So, I said, what
do you want to do?

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.990
&gt;&gt; And she said, I Got it Bad.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:17.540
&gt;&gt; So, he looks at
me, will do you do it?

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.610
&gt;&gt; I said no, maestro,
this is your song.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.980
So I said okay, let me do it.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.280
He said what key.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:30.480
I said B. He said, okay, you do it.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.630
[laughter] I said you
got [inaudible].

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:37.960 position:56%
So they recorded, they recorded her
and some of people, Billy Strayhorn,

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.780
what is the piece that he recorded
last time it was recorded it was

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:43.430
by Ivy Anderson.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:44.820
&gt;&gt; I Got it Bad.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.420
&gt;&gt; Bad and Good.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And Strayhorn playing song, yeah.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.810
And this was done for
Reprise Records business,

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:53.370
Frank Sinatra's label.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:57.020
&gt;&gt; So Frank Sinatra
basically hired Duke Ellington

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.300
to be a producer or
an A and R person?

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.600
&gt;&gt; A and R, yeah, for Reprise.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.900
&gt;&gt; For his label.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:03.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.500
&gt;&gt; And you were one of the
first people they signed.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the first one.

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.100
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.590
&gt;&gt; And so what is Ellington
like in the studio?

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.890
Is he relaxed?

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.400
Is he controlling?

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.860
What's his personality?

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.040
&gt;&gt; Very, very relaxed.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.400
[laughter] I learned a lot about
recording, at recording session,

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:28.890
because I mean when you look at
recording studies in South Africa,

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.980
you know, they, the process

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:38.310
of recording was [inaudible]
little thing that he said to us,

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:43.960
and this totally, totally
relaxing, relaxing man.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:50.220
I remember so one of the pieces,
my drummer like to drum sometimes

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.840
to the tempo, if the
tempo starts like this,

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.140
it would end up like this.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.440
[laughter].

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:58.740
&gt;&gt; That's typical.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.040
&gt;&gt; So, yes.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.890
So I said to do that I think
we should record it again.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:03.990
I said well why?

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.910
He was well, you know,
the drummer picked

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:07.810
up the tempo and I just leave it.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.110
That's folk.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:10.410
[laughter]

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:11.720
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.720
&gt;&gt; So, yeah.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.610
[inaudible] second take
or a third take, you know.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:20.030
What is it?

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:21.960
Unless it's a technical
mistake, you know.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.580
&gt;&gt; For that you were
working with your trio or --

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my trio.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.680
&gt;&gt; We had, and Svend Asmussen --

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.980
&gt;&gt; The violinist.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.280
&gt;&gt; The violinist, yes [inaudible].

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great player.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.660
&gt;&gt; He recorded, a lot of people
around there at that time in Paris,

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:47.600
and this was at the period when
he did the famous Paris concert.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.480
So, we were blessed.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.880
&gt;&gt; And so I assume that
when that record comes out

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.630 position:56%
and literally the title is something
like Duke Ellington presents --

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:57.930
&gt;&gt; Presents, yeah.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:03.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; -- Dollar Brand Trio, that must
have done something for your career?

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:06.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We didn't
realize until afterwards,

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:10.660
but talking to musician
especially afterwards

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:16.940
and getting the impression of
how this album really [inaudible]

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:20.520
because it was something that they,
they never heard about or thought

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:27.190 position:56%
about to go into, in terms of
composition and in terms of concept,

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:32.760
just go in another direction
and open up everything away

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.880
from a static total center.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:42.190
And Duke asked me, one of my songs
was called Sunday the Seventh,

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.010
and he liked the song,
and he said to me,

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:48.150
why don't you arrange
for a big band.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:51.260
And everytime when he
came to the [inaudible]

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:56.450
and asked me, did you finish that?

00:40:56.450 --> 00:41:00.880
And I was absolutely terrified
to write something for Duke,

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.660
and I said, I didn't write it.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:05.960
He says, why?

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.100
I said, I'm afraid
I'll make a mistake.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:14.320
Well then tear it up and
write another one he said.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.120
[laughter] Well I never
attempted it [inaudible].

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.000
&gt;&gt; But there are good
mistakes, right?

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.300
&gt;&gt; [inaudible].

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.360
In the end when I studied budo
[phonetic] and martial arts,

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.170
we realized there is no mistake.

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:27.470 position:56%
There is no such thing as a mistake.

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:30.130
A mistake is just something
that occurs that you have

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:36.070
to resolve whether it's in
music or whether in your life.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:40.540
So, my Japanese budo master
says when you make a mistake,

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:42.840
make good mistake [laughter].

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; By the way, I know you have
studied martial arts for many years.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.740
Are you studying Aikido?

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.720
What are you, what specific art.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.410
&gt;&gt; There's only, well this idea

00:41:56.410 --> 00:42:01.970
of martial arts is totally
a new concept to people.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:11.580
The term in Japan is budo, and budo
is the calligraphy, is two words,

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:18.280
so one in bu, which
means stop fighting.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.580
&gt;&gt; Stop fighting.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:24.870
&gt;&gt; Bu, do, and do is the
day, the way of not fighting.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.150
That nothing is worth fighting.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:30.740
The idea is the challenge
with the self.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.280
So the principle is
that you do not try

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.980
to overcome others,
you become unbeatable.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:47.380
And this is also the concept of
playing the music, the way that,

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:53.010
that's why you keep on
practicing and practicing, right?

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.310
In order to reach that [inaudible].

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:59.040
&gt;&gt; So if you practice enough
maybe you become unbeatable?

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:06.280
&gt;&gt; My teacher says
budo not for fighting.

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.060
If you want to fight,
use gun, quicker.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.240
[laughter]

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I see.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:12.990
Uh-huh.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:19.960
&gt;&gt; So the -- for us the
practice is 95 percent,

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.440
performance is 5 percent.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:33.860
Because the essence and
the understanding lies

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.750
in the continuous repetition
in practice.

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:43.010
This is where you begin
to understand yourself

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:47.330
because music is just
your means to an end.

00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:49.130
It's not an end.

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:51.110
&gt;&gt; Yes, you said yesterday
it's pointing.

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like language, you see,
language is a finger pointing

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:59.300
at the moon, but it's not the moon.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.620
&gt;&gt; It's an illusion.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.920
&gt;&gt; Pardon?

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.220
It's an illusion.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:12.360
So you're dealing with what
is hidden and what is obvious.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.570
So for many people in a
culture you have about people

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:21.650
of 90 percent obvious
and 10 percent hidden.

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:25.470
For us it's 10 percent
obvious and 90 percent hidden.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:33.210
And so you understand
with all the jazz masters

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:40.670
that this is the way to attainment.

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:43.220
&gt;&gt; So when you're talking
about practice,

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.010
what are you referring
to specifically?

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:51.480
Are you talking about technique,
being able to play cleanly,

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:55.040
evenly at the keyboard, or are
you talking about something else?

00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:00.380
&gt;&gt; You know, if you're a
piano player, you know finally

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.590
after all these years I
bought, I could afford

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.610
to buy a Fazioli grand piano.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:05.910
&gt;&gt; Oh, nice piano.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah because the studio,
the factory is just up the road

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.500
from where we are generally.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.140
So finally I got a Fazioli piano.

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.810
Now if you have a piano,
you need a home.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.110
[laughter]

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:18.890
&gt;&gt; It helps.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:21.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I move stuff
all around, you know.

00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.580
So finally, my fiance, she's
a medical doctor [inaudible]

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.990
so now I have a grand piano.

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:32.430
So now the problem comes with
practice with the neighbors.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.730
[laughter]

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:35.030
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:36.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was always a problem.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:37.630
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:38.980
&gt;&gt; You know, those years we
tried to sound proof the rooms

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.500
and you had one of these, something

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.060
that they put the eggs
in, you remember?

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, egg cartons.

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:45.830
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] work.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sound proofing.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.440
&gt;&gt; So, we were thinking, well
how are we going to do this,

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.740
how are going to sound
proof this room.

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:56.310
And then my fiance said, why
don't you speak to Fazioli

00:45:56.310 --> 00:46:02.290 position:56%
because they're working with Yamaha
and they've created this attachment,

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:09.100
it attaches to the piano, but you
put the ear phones on, you see,

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.820
so it's still the sound
of the piano.

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.810
It's not a Mickey Mouse
sound, you know.

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:18.580
So you [inaudible] and
you play acoustically,

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.810
or you put the ear phones on.

00:46:20.810 --> 00:46:24.450
So, the reason why I got
is because my neighbor,

00:46:24.450 --> 00:46:30.820
when I started practicing, he said
to me, oh that's wonderful playing,

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.060
but can you play a complete song?

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.640
[laughter] I said to my
fiance, get the ear phones.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:44.440
Because the practice is the
principle of repetition.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:51.960
So like with everything,
if you want to perfect it,

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.440
it comes through repetition.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.440
And sometimes it's
very, very boring,

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.630
but you begin to understand
the things that emerge

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:03.940
through this constant repetition.

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.470
Because there are no secrets.

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:08.380
There are only basics.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.520
&gt;&gt; Are you a disciplined person?

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.820
&gt;&gt; That's a big word.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.530
Yeah, yeah.

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:18.830
&gt;&gt; Organized?

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:25.270
&gt;&gt; Yes. People might not
see it like that, you know.

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:26.570
[laughter] I always
don't play anything

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:30.290
but I have these things lying
around the floor, don't move this.

00:47:30.290 --> 00:47:34.400
The hotel room, in the
hotel room when I stay more

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.190
for three days I leave the do
not disturb sign on the door.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.320
Don't come in here.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.750
You know, because the
maid wouldn't understand

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:43.050 position:56%
and move it, move it from the floor.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:44.550
So that is my, that is my order.

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:51.770
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you a little bit
about your process as a composer.

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:59.750 position:56%
Are you someone who constantly
works to create build a composition,

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:04.150
or does it ever just come
to you fully realized?

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:08.730
&gt;&gt; Sometimes it comes
fully realized [inaudible],

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:15.710
and I have no explanation
of how it comes.

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:21.770
I have a song called, a composition
called "Did You Hear that Sound."

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:30.590
And it was just before day break,
and in a dream this man comes to me

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.850
and says to me, come to the piano.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.910
So, if somebody tells you in
a dream, you better do it.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:40.510
So I go to the piano,
and he says play this.

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:47.040
[ Imitating Composing Music ]

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.890
And then it disappears, you know.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:52.350
So I went to the piano,
and there was the complete,

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:59.350
the complete changes of the song.

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:08.250
In our tradition we refer to it as
transmission, but T, R, A, N, C,

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:10.300
E. The trance, transmission.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:11.600
[laughter]

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.280
&gt;&gt; I get it.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:19.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that is how knowledge
is imparted from the elders

00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:22.240
to us also is through this process,

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.470
because it's not an intellectual
process, it's something

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:26.420 position:56%
that happens on another [inaudible].

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:30.590
&gt;&gt; You mentioned earlier that
when you are looking at some

00:49:30.590 --> 00:49:33.300
of your older works that
you hadn't seen in years

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:37.480 position:56%
and hadn't been performing in years
that you might like to revisit them,

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:42.310
and I wonder if when you do
revisit an older composition,

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:44.550
are you tempted to tinker with it?

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:49.780
Do you change it in some
ways, or is it fixed?

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:55.030
&gt;&gt; Well, this project that
I have in South Africa,

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:58.350
I call it ancient tradition
new relevance.

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:04.920
Because no matter what it is,
if you wrote it 50 years ago,

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:08.000
it's an ancient tradition but
there is new relevance to it.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.140
Everything has new relevance
because for us there's no past.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:12.440
There's no future.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.190
There's only now.

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:17.330
Right? And that's why we --

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:23.540
jazz music is [inaudible] because
you're dealing with this instant,

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:30.370
and it's also the mindset
and tradition of the ancients

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:34.440
that you're dealing with now.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.150
Art Blakey never allowed
his musicians to bring music

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.140
to the stage, written music.

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:43.640
You had to memorize everything.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.920
And so if you, for example,
you're dealing with,

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:51.810
only dealing with written music,
you are dealing with the past.

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.900
Something that has been recorded
in the past, but it's now.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:03.260
&gt;&gt; So when you write a new work for
one of your bands, let's say Ekaya,

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.360
do you actually hand out the music

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.210
or do you teach it to
them for their ear?

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:14.000
&gt;&gt; How I do it is maybe I write
something but just sketch it out.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.650
I keep it hidden.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:19.820
Then I go into the studio,
and they're busy setting up.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:22.950
Then I start playing
the new composition,

00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:26.270
and then some don't
hear what I'm playing.

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:30.230
And then the tenor player
will say, hey, what was that?

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:32.260
You know, [inaudible].

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.250
Then we expand from there.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:38.130
Something that I learned from Monk.

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:43.810
Monk was recording, and
somebody who worked in the studio

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:50.150
with Charlie Rouse, so they were
rehearsing, and so I said to Monk,

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:53.510
Monk when do you want
me to take a solo?

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:55.170
And Monk said just find a nice
place [inaudible] [laughter].

00:51:55.170 --> 00:52:01.330
And I said, wow, nothing
technical about it.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:04.060
Is this what you learn?

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:10.470
We learn from the masters how
you can convey what, you know,

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:15.200
your compositions to musicians.

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.950
So you give them the freedom
to express themselves.

00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:24.270
&gt;&gt; I know you've spoken about
the healing power of music.

00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:25.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:27.870
&gt;&gt; Do you think all
music is healing?

00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.160
&gt;&gt; Well --

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.340
-- everything is beautiful.

00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:45.190
It's only our individual
perception that says it's not.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:50.520
[inaudible] the Japanese,
Japanese tradition and culture

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:57.090
that says this concept of
finding beauty in decay.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.130
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:01.550
&gt;&gt; Finding beauty in decay,

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:05.560
as if something is old,
you have to remove it.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.760
But in our tradition, there
is no, there is no past.

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.060
There is no past.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.080
There is no for the record.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.140
It is now.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:19.450
So there's this object that you
see whether it's a human being

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:23.870
or whether it's a tree or whatever,
that point, from our perception,

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:29.460
it is old, but the perception,
excuse me, this is a, this decay,

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.290
this [inaudible] life, whatever.

00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:38.540
So to see the beauty,
see the beauty in decay.

00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:42.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because if we
are conditioned and used

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.430
to throwing things
away as they get old,

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:49.530
what do we do when
we start to decay?

00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:53.720
&gt;&gt; We don't decay,
we just get smarter.

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:55.020
[laughter]

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:56.320
&gt;&gt; Oh, you think?

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.620
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:58.920
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.220
&gt;&gt; Fully. [laughter]
That's what Bruce Lee said.

00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.520
&gt;&gt; Ah, yes.

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.640
&gt;&gt; Whatever is when you get old

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:10.300
and you can't fight
anymore and you get smarter.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:11.600
[laughter]

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.510
&gt;&gt; Does, you were talking about
practice and how beneficial

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:24.870
that can be, and I wonder
whether practice enables us

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:30.080
to meet certain unexpected
challenges

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.320
in performance or in life.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:37.720
&gt;&gt; It deals with your ego.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.610
&gt;&gt; Oh, we talked about
ego the other day.

00:54:39.610 --> 00:54:42.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it deals with your ego

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:45.900
because through practice
there's always a challenge.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.620
We he says, oh, you don't know it.

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:53.010
You know. So it challenges
the ego, constantly.

00:54:53.010 --> 00:54:56.870
&gt;&gt; And this ego, I think you
referred to as the whisper.

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:59.030
&gt;&gt; The whisper, sure.

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:02.070
The ego, the ego is always there.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.470
&gt;&gt; Always whispering.

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:06.380
&gt;&gt; That's why the stage is
the most dangerous place

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:08.630
in the world, performance based.

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:09.930
&gt;&gt; Why is that?

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:13.230
&gt;&gt; There's a whisperer.

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:22.210
When I play a concert and when
I get up and there's applause

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:25.960
from audience and I
acknowledge their applause,

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:35.700 position:56%
and the whisperer says to me, hey
that was a great concert you played.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.970
[laughter] Then I said to him,
I only do this through grace.

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:41.960
Then he says, wow,
you're really humble.

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:49.920
[laughter] So you are under attack,
you're under attack constantly.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:58.330 position:56%
So through practice you are actually
engaging and challenging with self

00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:04.570
because the gateway to
knowledge is past the whisperer.

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:07.440
Because the whisperer's job
is to keep you away from it,

00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.930
keep you away from the knowledge
of the self or whatever knowledge,

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:17.910
so if you can understand, I never
understood when I started engaging

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:20.590
with this and I did
not have any work

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:24.170
and then my teacher told me you
better your whisperer to work,

00:56:24.170 --> 00:56:26.990
otherwise you will starve.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:31.210
&gt;&gt; The whisperer is like
the lions at the gate.

00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:34.730
&gt;&gt; The meat cake.

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:36.030
[laughter]

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:40.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, sure, why not.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:45.230
I have many more questions I'm
dying to ask him, but I think some

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:48.070
of you may also have questions,

00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:52.300
and we certainly could
entertain those questions now.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.930
If anybody has anything
you'd like to ask Abdullah,

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.330
in the back of the room
there's a microphone.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:00.630
&gt;&gt; Good evening.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:05.130
I appreciate your artistry
and your humanity.

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:12.470
My question is, are you looking
to explore music scores some more?

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:15.870
I really enjoyed the Chocolat
music score that you did.

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:21.550
You are you looking to
do more music scores.

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:23.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Movie scores.

00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:28.880
Chocolat was Claire
Denis, the director.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.860
This was her first film
as an independent director

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:36.980
because she worked with some
vendors on Paris, Texas.

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:41.740
And so she asked me to do the music
for her, but she had been listening

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:47.670 position:56%
to the music after she was, when she
was filming, or getting the concept.

00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:51.120
We are working on several new ones.

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:56.190
One of the, one of the
ideas that we are working

00:57:56.190 --> 00:58:02.450
with the filmmaker now is to do
the same process that Miles did

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:06.710
with Ascension to the Gallows,
where there was no written score,

00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:10.940
but you show the movie and
you improvise and play on it.

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.400
So busy with, we were
busy with this.

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:18.370
Claire, what is [inaudible],
No Fear,

00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:28.520
No Die was another score
that we did for her.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:35.060
So films really, yeah, this
synergy that I can create

00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:41.840
between the musicians and the
film itself, so with Claire

00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:46.270
and also this new movie that
we're working on, the concept is

00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:49.070
that I suggested to her

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:55.070
that I ascribe an instrument
to a character.

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:59.590
You see, so for example, we
have Rickie Ford, you know,

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:07.690 position:56%
because he has that temperament, you
know, locking with the character.

00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:10.630
And it works.

00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:14.080
Instead of actually
writing, you know,

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.140
the film score -- are
you a filmmaker?

00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:17.440
&gt;&gt; Ah, no I'm not.

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.870
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:21.640
&gt;&gt; Who else has a question?

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.520
We have right in the center here.

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:26.160
If you want to pass
that microphone down.

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:29.490
&gt;&gt; Good evening, thank you.

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:33.300
I wanted to ask you a question
about sort of your musical

00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:38.160
and spiritual roots being in the
African Methodist Episcopal Church

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:42.620
and you've since transitioned to
Islam, and I'd like to ask you

00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:44.870
about whether or not
there's a certain time

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:49.380
in your compositional history
where that transition is reflected

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:54.690
and how it might have changed
your practice or your composing

00:59:54.690 --> 00:59:58.100
or anything you do musically.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:06.690
&gt;&gt; Oh. Some people have asked
me now to do other things,

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:12.210
to create a musical on
my life story, you know.

01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:16.940
So, we were looking at how
do we connect this narrative

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.500
chronologically [inaudible]
you do it

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:21.940
through actual time period
with dates, you know.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:28.630
I said well, this has
been done so many times.

01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:31.210
As you people suggested, okay,

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:35.150
so why don't we take the
characters, and that is the link.

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:40.590
And I said, no, I think
the link is the spirit.

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:43.050
Right? Because the
spirit is [inaudible],

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:49.170
and the spirit is universal.

01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:52.590
And again, like I said,
well what happened

01:00:52.590 --> 01:01:00.500
with the [inaudible] said it was
a collective change of the spirit.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:11.450
So even my grandmother was
one of the founding members

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:14.130
of the AME Church in Cape Town.

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:20.090
It was the African
Methodist Episcopal Church

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:27.230 position:56%
out of Philadelphia [inaudible]
founder of it, and they sent bishops

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:30.770
to Cape Town, African
American bishops,

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.070
and they intermarried there.

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:36.960
So at an early age in the AME
Church I had this Bishop Barnard,

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.830
Bishop Young, and this
experience of whether,

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:43.760 position:56%
the experience in the United States.

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:51.260
And it always has to do with not
what you think but what you feel.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:02:01.350
So for us always, always
the expression, technique,

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:10.860
technique of me to, the
technique is there really

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:15.680
so that you can better
tell your story.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.620
That's what the technique is about.

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:23.540
But the communication
is through feeling.

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:30.160
And this is at the
heart of the narrative

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.650
of all people everywhere
in the world.

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:42.660
I realized when I was a young
person that what I needed to do was

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:46.940
to find my own voice because I
knew what everything sounded like.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.600 position:56%
If I would hear a car, that's a car.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.290
If there's was sound of
a bird, that's a bird.

01:02:50.290 --> 01:02:52.590
But what was my sound?

01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:57.700
So I started researching
what is my sound.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:06.100
And then when you find this, then
you are unique because millions

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.480
and millions of people
on this earth,

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.500
and I can hear your voice
anywhere and recognize it.

01:03:13.770 --> 01:03:19.360
So the voice is our
relief on identity.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.860
&gt;&gt; Who else?

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:25.160
Yes sir, in the front?

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:31.220
&gt;&gt; Well, I actually, no,
no, he answered my question.

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:34.210
I was going to ask you a
question about your spirituality

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:38.380
because when you spoke I could
hear certain things from Islam

01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:42.070 position:56%
and certain things from Christianity
and then with you going to Japan,

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:45.570
I didn't know if some Buddhism
or Hinduism was in there,

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:48.490
but you answered the
question when you talked

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:49.900
about finding your own voice.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:52.380
&gt;&gt; I think, thank you so much.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:58.750
I think basically what
we, when we look at this,

01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:04.400
we always equate things
through religion, you see.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:09.370
We equate it through spirit,
you know, the spirituality of it

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:18.400
and not the exterior dynamics,
because they're all the same

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.600
with little differences
here and there,

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.210
the narrative has been changed,
but it's basically the same.

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:27.590
And some of those things
are imbedded,

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:31.740
for example, in the spiritual.

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:37.040 position:56%
I did some changes to the spiritual,
some people don't like it,

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.890
but one of the things is -- as you
know, we're jazz musicians, right,

01:04:41.890 --> 01:04:44.910
because you [inaudible]
play the changes.

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:47.110
You know, that's why I started
writing my own compositions

01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:50.720
because I said I am going
through my own changes [laughter],

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:57.350
why should I be worried about
playing somebody else's changes.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:01.420
Well [inaudible] you've got
a harp, I've got a harp,

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.710
all God's children got harp, when
I get to heaven I'm going to play

01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:07.510
on my harp but only with the
guys who know the changes.

01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:17.120
[ Laughter ]

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.840
That makes sense [inaudible].

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:32.170
So we don't perceive religion
or nations or tribes or colors.

01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:40.910
What we have been given, the
spirit within us, hopefully.

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:43.580
&gt;&gt; Right in front.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:47.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thank you, for me Gil Scott Heron

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:50.380
in the early '70's
was an important voice

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.750
to bring me some awareness
to South Africa.

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:55.830
Did you get a chance to ever
meet him and collaborate with him

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:57.530
since he was somewhat crossover.

01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:58.900
&gt;&gt; Who was that?

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.830
&gt;&gt; Gil Scott Heron.

01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:04.350
&gt;&gt; No, I remember when Gil Scott,
we had been planning to do,

01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:10.130 position:56%
when he was at Johannesburg, what
is it, Cape Town, what is it called?

01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:12.660
[inaudible] yeah we
had to be thought

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:15.240
about doing a collaboration
with [inaudible].

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.630
What a great musician.

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:21.910 position:56%
There were a lot of open [inaudible]
with that song, what was it called?

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:23.210
Johannesburg?

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:24.510
&gt;&gt; Johannesburg, exactly.

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:29.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So there were many
musicians around that time.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:35.210
Some of them didn't get the
exposure but were involved

01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:39.870
in supporting the struggle.

01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:44.310
Because, you know, remember
like the late 50s, you know,

01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:47.380
there was a great international.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:52.190
One was like [inaudible]
change with many, many things.

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:56.560
Globally. And we were almost
sort of like at the center,

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:59.560
the center of it, you
know, at the beginning

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:02.680
of the liberation of Africa.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:07.940
You know, many things have changed.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.480
So we as young people at that time,
as musicians, we were involved

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.920
in this change, and so when we
were living in South Africa,

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:19.930
living in the township, you
see, I mean we had everything.

01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:28.580
From Shakespeare sonnets
to Russian poets

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:31.550
to things fall apart
from [inaudible].

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:40.910 position:56%
It was an opening, I guess maybe
the more you impress people the more

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:46.000
they want to go out, so yeah.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.970
&gt;&gt; I assume you keep up with
what's happening in the world.

01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:51.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:52.570
&gt;&gt; Do you look at the news?

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:53.870
&gt;&gt; Sure.

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:55.470
&gt;&gt; Do you think things are
coming together or falling apart.

01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:56.770
&gt;&gt; It's the same.

01:07:56.770 --> 01:08:01.930
It's our only perception, you know,

01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:03.770
whether it's falling
apart or whether --

01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:06.740
&gt;&gt; But what is your perception?

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:11.630
&gt;&gt; There's no past, there's
no future, there's now.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:18.640
So most of the conflicts that
we see are things from the past.

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:23.730
I think -- and so for me this
concept of playing jazz music,

01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:28.110
okay let me put it this way.

01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:32.760
I worked with symphony orchestras
and philharmonic orchestras.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.460
There are 90 musicians.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.300
I say, anybody want to take a solo?

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:40.760
No. Why? We're afraid.

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.060
What are you afraid of?

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.360
We're afraid we'll make a mistake.

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:57.740
But jazz music is, the concept is
the concept of entrepreneurship.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:05.410
Because if you go and
look for a job,

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:08.600
you want to know how
much you get paid.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:13.090
You want to know if you
get insurance, right.

01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:17.540
You want stability, but the
person that you're going to work

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:22.820
for was somebody who took the last
hundred bucks and took a chance.

01:09:22.820 --> 01:09:29.960
So this principle of
entrepreneurship is

01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:34.630
within this concept of
the now, improvising.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:42.050
Right? So this is something that we
can create, and when you're talking

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:45.790
to people in government, they said
well how do we address this issue

01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:50.670
of young people every year being
thrown out into the job market

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:54.520
with pieces of paper and no job.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.720
[inaudible] in entrepreneurship
[inaudible]

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:04.700
and the question is
having the fear, you see,

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:10.070
because the devil threatens
us with poverty.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.000
&gt;&gt; And you always have
that whisperer.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.180
You always have your whisperer
and think you can't do it.

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:22.950
But jazz music says
to you, we feel this.

01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:28.060
&gt;&gt; Who else has a question?

01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.440
Right there.

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.710
If you want to hand
the microphone back.

01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:34.070
Okay.

01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:37.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:40.430 position:56%
A number of years ago I had an
opportunity to sit in a similar kind

01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:43.710
of situation with the
Library of Congress

01:10:43.710 --> 01:10:46.490
and there was an interview
with Dafnis Prieto.

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:47.940
&gt;&gt; I remember that.

01:10:47.940 --> 01:10:49.730
&gt;&gt; He's a Cuban drummer.

01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:52.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dafnis Prieto, the Cuban drummer.

01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:57.410
&gt;&gt; And when I was there, I
was struck by his comment

01:10:57.410 --> 01:11:03.390 position:56%
that he regretted in some way living
in New York because he was separated

01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:08.400
from the place of being
where his Cuban roots were.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.280
And I'm wondering for you
if you still have access

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:19.790
in an authentic way to reconnect
with your place where you came

01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:26.330
from originally and how
does place change what it is

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:27.630
that you're creating.

01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:30.790
&gt;&gt; You mean where I am in
South Africa for example?

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:33.870
&gt;&gt; If you have access to
go back to South Africa,

01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:35.570
if there's an evolution
that's coming,

01:11:35.570 --> 01:11:37.370
something new that's coming out.

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:41.930
Dafnis, I believe, was suggesting
that there were new ideas that were

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:46.450
in Cuba that he was not
really able to access

01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:50.220
because in New York he was
being asked to play kind

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:56.680
of traditional styles and couldn't
really be branching out too much.

01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:00.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I get the sense before

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.520
in South Africa we have
nine different nations,

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:06.750
and I am fortunate that
I lived in all of them,

01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:11.660
and we still accessed all of them.

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:16.840
[inaudible] all the languages,
but we understand that --

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:22.160
so through the, but through the
music we have created a synergy,

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.580
and this is what we are working on.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:29.190
We have a project called
ancient tradition, new relevance.

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:34.070
And we acquired a farm
in northern Cape

01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:37.170
which was called a green Kalahari.

01:12:37.170 --> 01:12:40.980
We have 800 hector,
so seven kilometers

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.810 position:56%
by seven kilometers by 5 kilometers.

01:12:45.050 --> 01:12:50.040
We have suites underground,
water system,

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.850
which comes from a very unique
underwater delta that runs

01:12:54.850 --> 01:12:56.150
under the farm [inaudible].

01:12:56.150 --> 01:12:59.780
We have about 150 spring
[inaudible].

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:04.870
We have ostriches and
everything grows there.

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:10.510
We are in the heart of solar
power that is being developed.

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:14.930
We are in the heart of wind power
that is being developed now.

01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:19.520
We have just created a relationship
with a project called SKA,

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:25.200
which is the Square Kilometer
Array, the [inaudible] telescope

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.710
that looks into the universe.

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:31.680
It's a one-hour drive from the
farm, they would set this up.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:38.860
Last year we graduated about
170 young astrophysicists.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:42.420
And about three hours
up from the farm,

01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:46.740
we are at the border of
Namibia and Botswana.

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:49.220
There's the last remaining
group of bushman people

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:51.730
who still speak the language.

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:54.770
So we have been working
with them for years

01:13:54.770 --> 01:14:00.630
because they can transmit
this information.

01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:06.340
They're helping us with plants
and understanding the animals.

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:10.580
They have something
called a hooday [phonetic],

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.980
which we know when we grew
up, you know what it is?

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:16.430
The root that you eat and it
cuts off the hunger center

01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:18.810
so you can go without
eating for days.

01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:22.790
I think about it down in
America, now they're created a,

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:27.600
what you call it, a slimming pill.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.550
So we are working with them.

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:34.840
And how we can transmit
this information

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:41.910
through the younger generation
but also make it viable for them

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:46.590
to be a reliable product,
new product.

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:51.380
So the SKA [inaudible] Square
Kilometer Array project,

01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:55.440
they know about the part that you
can actually put the telescope,

01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.920
you can look into the universe,
you can look into the creation.

01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:03.110
So in Cape Town, for example,
they have a command center.

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:06.760 position:56%
In Cape Town they have about 50
young people [inaudible] going there

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:11.980
you see that they are, the
console they are locked into,

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:17.750
to monitoring the universe,
second by second.

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:24.700 position:56%
So we have, because they have a like
one-hour drive from where we are,

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:28.960
there's a part of the project
that we brought on board.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:36.490
So when we are creating like they
have agreed for us to [inaudible]

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:42.590
on telescope, because in
the [inaudible] next to us,

01:15:42.590 --> 01:15:46.860
the biggest one, the largest,
biggest business [inaudible]

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:52.900
because there's nothing [inaudible]
there's nothing there, it's desert,

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:57.150
it's the clearest vision
into the sky.

01:15:57.150 --> 01:16:08.230 position:56%
So we are looking, we are looking
at this project, so we have, heaven,

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:16.110
earth, and we have people,
because [inaudible] young people.

01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:26.600
So what do we say to the young
people, okay, why don't you create,

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:31.070
write compositions about or
write music about these events.

01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:35.110
Or say even create
a product about it.

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:37.730
So the [inaudible] animals.

01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:50.970
At the University of Johannesburg,
there's a team of scientists

01:16:50.970 --> 01:16:53.120
who have been working
on this project,

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.070
you know, the dung beetle, right?

01:16:57.070 --> 01:17:01.070
We used to watch this dung beetle
when we were kids and played

01:17:01.070 --> 01:17:06.470
with it, but the dung beetle always
moves the ball backwards, right.

01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:10.160
[inaudible] sometimes he gets on
top of the ball and he [inaudible]

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.700
and then he goes on again.

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.910
So what they realize now
they put barriers [inaudible]

01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:19.870
because how can you find a home
with the ball going backwards.

01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:23.330
So I find that when
there's a barrier, he stops

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:24.770
and makes his dance and then goes

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.740
around the barrier
to find another way.

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:31.600 position:56%
So they understand now that during
the day, when he has to dance on top

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:34.910
of the ball, he gets orientation,
in the day gets orientation

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:39.050
from the sun and at
night from the Milky Way.

01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:42.320
This is the dung beetle.

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:46.520
So, these are things that we
knew when we were children,

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.300
but we didn't know the -- you
know, always the question, what,

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:52.560
what is this, what is thing doing.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:58.460
So now with modern technology
we're beginning to understand.

01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:02.890 position:56%
Why isn't the scope of education and
why isn't the scope of possibility

01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:05.010
for job opportunity, for work.

01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:11.640
Yeah. For one of the, one
of the ideas, and so we look

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:15.180
at all the different animals.

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:19.760 position:56%
And you see the relationship that
the bushman people had with animals,

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.660
which is like all hunter gatherers.

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:31.710
And if you see them hunting,
hunting a deer and the process

01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:38.440
of when an animal dies, you
know, speaking to the animal

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:42.040
and thanking it for
giving it's life, you know,

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:45.280
for sacrificing it's life.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:54.710
So the idea is this not
breaking the link of the cycle.

01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:01.210
If we break the link with the
cycle, then we have disaster.

01:19:01.210 --> 01:19:06.560
In Cape Town, for example, I'm
[inaudible] have problem with me

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:11.840
because the bees are gone, which we
know everywhere, the bees are gone.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.670
So, you know, if the
bees are not there,

01:19:14.670 --> 01:19:18.270
it means that there's
no food protection.

01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:23.720
So on the farm we know
that there are bees,

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.990
though we know there is honey,

01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:30.660
we haven't found the nest,
because we see the bees.

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:34.710
So one person suggested
we should do something.

01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:37.910
What do they call this
bee farming with the --

01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:42.170
so we say yeah well I know guy,
the guy can bring a queen bee.

01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:45.070 position:56%
I said, whoa, wait, wait right there

01:19:45.070 --> 01:19:49.080
because now you are
upsetting the natural rhythm.

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:55.100
So to answer your question,
we've been busy for many years,

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.720
and now some people are coming
on board, people in government,

01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.020
because they are beginning
to understand

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:04.510
that this may be a
viable, viable idea.

01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:08.780
But it's also a way that we
think and play the music.

01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:11.080
It's organic.

01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:19.020
&gt;&gt; We have time for, oh,
one last one in the back.

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.320
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:23.510
This has been a wonderful
experience.

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:28.220
I'd like to revisit a question that
Larry asked about when you went

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:32.050
into exile with kind
of a two-part question.

01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:35.410
So when you went into exile and
during that time when you were away

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:42.040
from South Africa, how did the news
of hearing about family or friends

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:45.020
or comrades you know being lost

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:50.420
to the apartheid system impact your
music and playing while you were

01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:55.430
in exile, and then when apartheid
ended, and you were finally able

01:20:55.430 --> 01:21:01.560
to come home, how did being able to
return home to a new environment,

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.980
a new South Africa,
that was different

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:08.970
from what you left
impact your playing?

01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:16.330
&gt;&gt; The experience is
through the spirit.

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:23.340
Cape Town is the place where
I grew up, you know, five,

01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:26.180 position:56%
ten kilometers outside of Cape Town,

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:29.870
called Kensington,
is where I grew up.

01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:33.980
And we used to have this what
they shabeans [phonetic] brothels

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:38.680
because we were not
allowed to drink liquor.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:43.060
So the people they elicit
what we call them shabeans,

01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:46.520
where you could buy this liquor.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.940
Then it became a communal thing,

01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:50.840
something that is still
ongoing there

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:54.360
where people collect
and meet socially.

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.350
And there was one of these
places in Kensington.

01:21:58.350 --> 01:22:05.560
It was an old little house with
corrugated iron, and I always loved

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.760
to go through the shabean to
go and drink some beer there

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.600
because I had a special
feeling about this place.

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:15.470
I didn't know what it was, but
it felt so calm and wonderful.

01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:17.980
So when we went into
exile, this was one

01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:21.090
of the recurring dreams that came.

01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:22.760
You know, this feeling
that I am back home

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:26.330
and then you wake up to reality.

01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:32.280
So when we went back I said let
me, let me go and find this place.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:35.430
The first thing that [inaudible],
let me go an find this place.

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:36.790
What is it there.

01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:40.520
So, I went, and I grew
up in the place.

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.030
I drove around for a week.

01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:43.330
I couldn't find it.

01:22:43.330 --> 01:22:45.190
Up and down, up and down.

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:48.670
So I told my teacher, and my
teacher said just try it again.

01:22:48.670 --> 01:22:50.890
So the second time I found it.

01:22:50.890 --> 01:22:53.480
And it was still an old house.

01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.780
It changed a bit.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:57.180
It was still basically
the same thing.

01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:01.500
And I said I want to make a
dealy dee [phonetic], a story,

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:04.930
get some filmmakers and
you know write some music

01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:07.460
and tell this narrative
about this house.

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:13.060
So I went to this house and I
said to the people, please I would

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:16.460
like to do a film here
with some music.

01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:20.020
And they said well you need
to ask the owner of the place,

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:24.160
and the owner of the place lived
in the street just up the way.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.930
But the grounds were massive.

01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:31.030
It was almost like to the end
of the street, the whole block,

01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:34.840
and there was this house
sitting at the back there.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:40.350
And then I remember from
childhood that those people

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:44.390
in that house we never
had contact with them.

01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:46.740
They were there, but we never
saw them and it was don't --

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.560
there was no communication
with them.

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:51.490
Anyway, so I said let
me go to this house

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:55.990
and ask the owner there
if I can film.

01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:59.460
I was standing at the
gate, and there the guy

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:02.880
from across the street comes
and says how you doing?

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.180
What are you doing?

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:08.060
And I said I want to shoot this
film, but they told me to come

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:11.170
and speak to this, to the owner.

01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:13.140
He said, well you came
at the right time

01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:17.460
because I am the only one allowed
in this area who has access

01:24:17.460 --> 01:24:22.080
to this house and the family,
so I'll take you inside.

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:26.010
So we walk into the house,
and he knocks on the door.

01:24:26.010 --> 01:24:30.020
And the door opens and
the picture that I see,

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:34.420
I'm looking into maybe
like the 16th century.

01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:46.140
The furniture, they had the, you
know those old oval picture frames

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:52.250
with sepia, and this woman comes
out, right, pitch black with dark,

01:24:52.250 --> 01:24:58.350
dark hair, and I look at what she's
dressed in, like 16th century.

01:24:58.350 --> 01:25:03.050
You know, I thought I was seeing
a ghost or something, you know.

01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:07.580
And she was very, very reserved.

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.790 position:56%
I introduced myself and said I would

01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:14.420
like to do a film [inaudible]
it's okay.

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:15.720
So I left.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:17.020
I said wait a minute now.

01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:18.320
So I drive around.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.620
This was in Seventh Street, right?

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:23.200
So I drive around in Sixth Street
because this is where we grew up.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:29.550
And this house, the people in
this house, we never saw them,

01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:34.920
but from Sixth Street, because
this place is like on a hill,

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:39.400
there used to be a tunnel that
we used to play in, you see,

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:42.270
but the tunnel at some
point was closed.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:47.990
So I said but this tunnel
leads into this house.

01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:50.860
Then we discovered
what it is, you see.

01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.660
This was a slave quarter, right.

01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:58.890
It was a slave quarter, and
that lady was a descendent

01:25:58.890 --> 01:26:00.350
from the slaves that
were taken there.

01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:01.980
So there's a slave quarter.

01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:07.110
That was what we saw when we
played as kids, this, this tunnel.

01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:17.680 position:56%
So what I felt I think at that time,
why this thing resonated with me,

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:20.240
you know, of going to this house,

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:25.510
in our terms is the
answer was speaking to us.

01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.940
So what is our task now?

01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:31.220
This happened some years ago.

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.520
I just left it at that.

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:40.590
We are going to New York on --

01:26:40.590 --> 01:26:41.890
&gt;&gt; Saturday.

01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:43.190
&gt;&gt; Saturday.

01:26:43.190 --> 01:26:46.920
We're meeting, I don't know if
you know Dr. Olastar [phonetic].

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.660 position:56%
You know, she's at Brown University.

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:53.010
She has been doing an
internship in South Africa

01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:58.890 position:56%
and in Cape Town especially, looking
at the history of slavery, right.

01:26:58.890 --> 01:27:03.930
So she's actually gone to Cape Town
to where these slave quarters were

01:27:03.930 --> 01:27:09.480
and trying to research it.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.220 position:56%
So we are working with her together.

01:27:11.220 --> 01:27:19.750 position:56%
So, to answer your question, you
see, being in exile and coming back,

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:26.250
it has in some ways
nothing to do with people.

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:32.570
You see, we are just a conduit
for something that takes us there

01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:36.230
and what we are supposed to do.

01:27:36.230 --> 01:27:40.390
Right? I think what we need to
do is just accept our destiny.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:49.770
And through the music
hopefully we can,

01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:53.480
we can this narrative of the self.

01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:56.030
Narrative of the self
and the narrative

01:27:56.030 --> 01:28:00.530
of the history of the planet.

01:28:00.530 --> 01:28:09.270
When we speak about what Admiral
Zheng He, 14th century explorer

01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:15.280
with 300 ships, and we're
talking about the bushman people,

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:22.580
and talking about my teacher in
Japan, and being here for example.

01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:29.590
Today Jay and myself spent four
hours with him just looking

01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:33.770
at these documents, you know,
the music that these people have.

01:28:33.770 --> 01:28:38.660
Now we are fortunate in that
we know some of them, Mingus,

01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:48.070
Eric Dolphy, Ornette, Ellington.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.200
I mean for us, they're
actually not musicians.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.760
Ellington for us, when we
grew up in South Africa,

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.710
Ellington was not an American.

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:06.610 position:56%
He was a wise old man in the
village that you could go to and ask

01:29:06.610 --> 01:29:11.260
for advice, and the advice
was imbedded in the music.

01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:17.000
So the idea is just
to give acknowledgment

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.910
to all these great people
who are actually mentors,

01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:27.520
and like with all mentors, they
never tell you the story straight.

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.030
[laughter] You have to
go research and find

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:31.930
out what did they actually say.

01:29:31.930 --> 01:29:36.660
&gt;&gt; And now we've come
more or less full circle.

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:37.960
&gt;&gt; Yes?

01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:39.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.560
&gt;&gt; You have one last question?

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.130
This will have to be the last one.

01:29:42.130 --> 01:29:44.660
&gt;&gt; I want to just ask one question.

01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:51.370
I grew up listening to you
in Rhodesia, right next door,

01:29:51.370 --> 01:29:55.260
and they used to play your
music, but it's kind of like,

01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:59.460
in those days it was
kind of sensitive or back

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.450
in the '70's before
our independence.

01:30:02.450 --> 01:30:07.800
I was wondering, how come
you're, you're actually singing

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:11.200
like some [inaudible] but
how are they political

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:18.760
and what are you really -- I don't
see any enthusiasm or popularity

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:25.300
with the jazz in our region in
Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Botswana,

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:29.720
[inaudible] it is something
you are doing lesser

01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:35.900
to probably cultivate
[inaudible] in southern Africa,

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:39.960
but I don't know what is
your opinion about jazz

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.950
in southern Africa, especially?

01:30:41.950 --> 01:30:44.330
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to understand
what you --

01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:52.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes, what I'm saying is what,
how do you assess the impact of jazz

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:58.310
in our area, in southern Africa,

01:30:58.310 --> 01:31:04.340
or in Africa as a whole,
including [inaudible].

01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:05.640
&gt;&gt; Jazz music?

01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:06.940
&gt;&gt; Yes, jazz music.

01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:09.870
Yeah, of course, we have a lot of
great artists from [inaudible].

01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:17.300
I don't see a lot of jazz
enthusiasm in the young generation.

01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:21.720
&gt;&gt; Let's let him answer
the question.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks.

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:25.370
&gt;&gt; You sure?

01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:26.670
Well where you from?

01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:28.010
&gt;&gt; From Zimbabwe.

01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:29.310
&gt;&gt; From?

01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:30.610
&gt;&gt; From Zimbabwe.

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:31.910
&gt;&gt; Zimbabwe.

01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:33.210
Have you been to South
Africa recently?

01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:35.740
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's been a while but --

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:40.170
&gt;&gt; It's smoking man,
there's so many musicians.

01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:41.470
[laughter]

01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:46.690
&gt;&gt; You know South Africa has the
biggest jazz audience in the world.

01:31:46.690 --> 01:31:47.990
&gt;&gt; Ah, okay.

01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:49.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah sure.

01:31:49.290 --> 01:31:59.770
South Africa, we had the only
black-owned jazz record shop

01:31:59.770 --> 01:32:01.670
in the world.

01:32:01.670 --> 01:32:05.880
South Africa in the townships
on a Sunday, they have --

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.140
it's almost like secret societies.

01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:12.470
They meet every Sunday at people's
home, and they play jazz music,

01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:13.980 position:56%
and they put them over the speakers.

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:15.660
That's where you can go.

01:32:15.660 --> 01:32:17.920
Go into the township
and you ask anybody

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.540 position:56%
about Ornette Coleman or Guy Warren.

01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:22.610
You know Guy Warren?

01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:24.810
Guy Warren is a drummer from Ghana.

01:32:24.810 --> 01:32:29.040
He came to the states
and played [inaudible].

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:39.260 position:56%
Right now, right now in South Africa
there's a wealth of young musicians

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:45.420
who are playing jazz and
also we just created a,

01:32:45.420 --> 01:32:51.990
or started creating a
jazz, a little jazz club.

01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:55.240
All over South Africa, every
weekend in the townships,

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.490 position:56%
they have what they call jazz clubs.

01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:01.000
Every township in South Africa.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:05.270
And people get together at homes,
and then they play the speakers,

01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:07.790
and they have a little taste,

01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:11.910
but that's where you
hear all the jazz music.

01:33:11.910 --> 01:33:18.840
&gt;&gt; I was also asking
about the [inaudible].

01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.140
&gt;&gt; About?

01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:26.060
&gt;&gt; I was also asking about the
other countries in the region,

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:29.850
like Mozambique [inaudible]
some of the --

01:33:29.850 --> 01:33:32.310
&gt;&gt; I wrote a song called Zimbabwe.

01:33:32.310 --> 01:33:33.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:36.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I wrote a song called Mozambique.

01:33:36.330 --> 01:33:38.190
[laughter] I wrote a
song called Namibia.

01:33:38.190 --> 01:33:39.490
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:40.970
&gt;&gt; I wrote a song called Botswana.

01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:43.740
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:45.800
&gt;&gt; So we thank you
for that question.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.100
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:48.820
&gt;&gt; We thank everyone
for coming tonight.

01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:52.670
And it occurs to me that
we've come full circle.

01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:58.360
We started out by talking about
how you can learn about music

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:03.590
from talking with the masters, and
this is a perfect example tonight.

01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:05.510
Please help me thank
Abdullah Ibrahim.

01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:12.050
[ Applause ]

01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:13.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

01:34:13.850 --> 01:34:22.210
[ Applause ]

01:34:22.210 --> 01:34:24.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.670

of the Library of Congress.
