00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:03.713
- [Instructor] Let g be a
twice differentiable function

00:00:03.713 --> 00:00:05.241
defined over the closed interval

00:00:05.241 --> 00:00:06.685
from negative seven to seven,

00:00:06.685 --> 00:00:09.704
so it includes those
endpoints of the interval.

00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:13.521
This is the graph of its second
derivative, g prime prime,

00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:14.780
so that's the graph right over there,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.540
y is equal to g prime prime of x.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.579
And they ask us how many inflection points

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.662
does the graph of g have?

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:27.430
So, let's just remind ourselves
what an inflection point is.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.638
So, that is when we go from
being concave downwards

00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:34.812
to concave upwards, so
something like this.

00:00:34.812 --> 00:00:36.241
And another way to think about it,

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:40.227
a point where our slope goes
from decreasing to increasing.

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:43.134
So, here our slope is that,
then it's a little lower,

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:45.371
then it's a little lower,
then it's a little lower,

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:46.834
but then all of a sudden
it starts increasing again.

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:49.662
It starts increasing, getting
higher, higher, and higher.

00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:51.596
So, that would be an inflection point,

00:00:51.596 --> 00:00:55.190
whatever x value where
that would actually happen.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.632
That would be the inflection point.

00:00:56.632 --> 00:00:58.229
You could go the other way around.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.856
You could have a function
that looks something like this

00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:04.115
where we have a negative slope,

00:01:04.115 --> 00:01:05.631
but then our slope is increasing,

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.342
slope is increasing, slope is increasing,

00:01:07.342 --> 00:01:09.359
but then our slope
begins decreasing again.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:12.526
This too would be an inflection point.

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:15.876
So, in other videos we go
into more of the intuition

00:01:15.876 --> 00:01:18.627
of how do you think about the
first and second derivatives

00:01:18.627 --> 00:01:21.027
of a function at an inflection point?

00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:22.057
But the big picture,

00:01:22.057 --> 00:01:24.333
at least for the purposes
of this worked example,

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.218
is to realize when you're
looking at the second derivative,

00:01:27.218 --> 00:01:28.952
you have an inflection point

00:01:28.952 --> 00:01:32.637
where the second derivative
crosses the x axis.

00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:35.908
It's not enough to just touch the x axis.

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.942
You must cross the x axis.

00:01:38.942 --> 00:01:42.865
And so right over here we
are crossing the x axis,

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:44.957
so that is an inflection point.

00:01:44.957 --> 00:01:47.315
Right over here, we are
crossing the x axis,

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:48.974
so that is an inflection point.

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:51.702
Here and here we touch the x axis.

00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:54.402
Our second derivative is equal to zero.

00:01:54.402 --> 00:01:56.342
But we don't cross.

00:01:56.342 --> 00:01:59.563
We don't cross the actual x axis.

00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:01.623
We don't go from being
positive to negative.

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:05.314
We stay non-negative this entire time.

00:02:05.314 --> 00:02:07.375
Similarly right over here,

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.896
maybe something interesting
happens past this point,

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:10.997
but they're telling us that the function

00:02:10.997 --> 00:02:12.863
is only defined over this interval,

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:15.499
so actually nothing happens
beyond getting that point,

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:18.004
so we're not going to cross the x axis.

00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:19.154
So, to answer the question,

00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:21.941
how many inflection points
does the graph g have,

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.948
well, it has two inflection points

00:02:23.948 --> 00:02:26.570
looking at the second derivative here.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.285
Now, we know the answer.

00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:29.285
Why does that make sense?

00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:32.535
Why do you have to cross the x axis?

00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:34.837
Well, let's just imagine.

00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:37.410
Let's say that this is the
graph of a second derivative.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.577
So, this is f prime prime.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.337
So, the first derivative, for
example, could look like this.

00:02:47.026 --> 00:02:50.526
The first derivative might look like this,

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:53.468
where over here we have a negative slope,

00:02:53.468 --> 00:02:56.349
negative slope, negative
slope, negative slope,

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.982
but it's getting closer and closer,

00:02:57.982 --> 00:02:59.885
and then right over here,

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:03.970
all of a sudden the slope
becomes positive and increasing.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.553
So, that would be f prime of x.

00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:10.235
And then you could think about, well,

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:13.833
if this is describing the
derivative of our function,

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.137
then what's our function
going to look like?

00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:19.256
Well, our function over here

00:03:19.256 --> 00:03:21.760
would have a very positive slope,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.558
but then the slope would keep decreasing

00:03:24.558 --> 00:03:27.438
all the way up until this point,

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:29.487
and then it increases again.

00:03:29.487 --> 00:03:32.470
So, we have a positive
slope right over here.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.242
So, for example, our function
might look like this.

00:03:34.242 --> 00:03:36.718
It might have a very positive slope,

00:03:36.718 --> 00:03:39.182
but then the slope keeps decreasing,

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:40.500
and then right over here all of a sudden,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.462
the slope begins increasing.

00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:46.108
The slope begins increasing again.

00:03:46.108 --> 00:03:50.955
And so here we were concave
downward over this first part,

00:03:50.955 --> 00:03:52.508
over this first part.

00:03:52.508 --> 00:03:54.778
We have a positive slope,
but it's decreasing.

00:03:54.778 --> 00:03:56.852
Positive slope, but it's decreasing.

00:03:56.852 --> 00:04:00.747
And then we go to having a positive slope,

00:04:00.747 --> 00:04:03.471
but now we are increasing again.

00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:05.680
And so this should give you
a good sense for why you need

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.680
to cross the x axis in
the second derivative.
