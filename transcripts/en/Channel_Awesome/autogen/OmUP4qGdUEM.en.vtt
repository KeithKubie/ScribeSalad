think<00:09:47.160><c> so</c><00:09:47.310><c> I</c><00:09:47.550><c> think</c><00:09:47.580><c> there's</c><00:09:47.970><c> gotta</c><00:09:48.150><c> be</c><00:09:48.210><c> some</c>

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:48.450 align:start position:0%
think so I think there's gotta be some
 

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:50.090 align:start position:0%
think so I think there's gotta be some
kind<00:09:48.480><c> of</c><00:09:48.660><c> backup</c><00:09:48.900><c> system</c><00:09:49.380><c> in</c><00:09:49.470><c> place</c><00:09:49.680><c> they</c>

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
kind of backup system in place they
 

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:53.090 align:start position:0%

obviously<00:09:50.339><c> know</c><00:09:51.000><c> that</c><00:09:51.560><c> this</c><00:09:52.560><c> is</c><00:09:52.770><c> gonna</c><00:09:52.860><c> be</c><00:09:53.070><c> a</c>

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
obviously know that this is gonna be a
 

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.530 align:start position:0%
obviously know that this is gonna be a
possibility<00:09:53.520><c> then</c><00:09:53.850><c> someone's</c><00:09:54.209><c> gonna</c><00:09:54.270><c> come</c>

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
