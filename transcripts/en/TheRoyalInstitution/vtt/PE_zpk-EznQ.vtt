00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.149
These three cups are in thermal equilibrium.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.699
I can measure the temperature in all three
mugs here with a thermometer and you can see

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.260
they are all come up as being the same temperature.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.039
I could also use three different thermometers
and they would still say that the temperature

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.050
is the same across all three containers.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.520
Thatï¿½s because temperature is a fundamental
and measurable property of matter.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.660
The framework that describes all of thermodynamics
can be summed up in the four laws,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.730
and these describe heat, energy, and their
interactions with matter.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.640
While the first, second and third laws of
thermodynamics are quite well known, there's

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.050
a fourth law that underpins all of the other
laws.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.800
It was devised after the three laws of thermodynamics,

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.990
but was so fundamental and provided such a
basis for the other laws,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.400
that it was termed the zeroth law of thermodynamics.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.120
The zeroth law of thermodynamics is actually
an observation

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.980
and states that if two thermodynamic systems
are in thermal equilibrium with a third system,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.180
they are also in thermal equilibrium with
each other.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:19.360
Or to put it mathematically, if A=C and B=C
then A must also = B.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.409
If all of these three glasses are at thermal
equilibrium, then we can say that they're

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.229
all at the same temperature.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.509
And this is where the significance of the
zeroth law lies.

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.490
It lets us establish temperature as a measurable
and universal property of matter.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.880
If something is measurable, then we can create
scales for it and this is exactly what happened

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.189
with temperature.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.229
The first temperature scale that, in a slightly
altered form,

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.200
is still in use today was established by Daniel
Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1724.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.899
A more common scale, named after Swedish scientist
Anders Celsius,

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.979
uses the point of water freezing as the 0
point on the scale,

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.539
and the boiling of water as the 100th degree
on the scale.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.990
Rather than using a scale where 0 is defined
arbitrarily,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.729
what we really want is to use a scale where
0 is the coldest temperature you could ever

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.660
get to.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.060
Scientists around the world use the Kelvin
scale, where 0 is defined as absolute zero.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.410
Absolute zero is something which is defined
by the third law of thermodynamics, but that's

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.190
something we'll get to in another video.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.200
It was observed that the properties of matter
could change with temperature.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.489
For example, liquids can expand or contract
when heated or cooled, and the conductivity

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.379
of wires can change as a function of temperature.

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.879
Some old fashioned thermometers like this
one use the expansion of mercury or other

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.030
liquids under heat as a measuring tool.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.629
Modern electronic thermometers commonly use
thermoresistors, where the resistance in a

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.569
material changes with changes in temperature.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.000
Yet another way of looking at temperature
is with a thermal imaging camera.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.390
All objects above absolute zero radiate some
sort of infrared frequency radiation

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.000
with hotter objects radiating higher amounts
of infrared.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.030
This allows us to us thermal imaging to see the world even without any visible light.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.890
If two objects at different temperatures are
brought into contact with each other,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.140
they will try to reach thermal equilibrium.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.560
If the two objects are of sufficiently different
temperatures, the reaction can be rather violent

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.849
due to a phenomenon called thermal shock.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.719
Because the heat gradient makes the glass
want to expand, but the other side is cold.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.650
This causes a strain that breaks the glass.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.700
The concept of the zeroth law may seem trivial,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.209
but it lets us define temperature,

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.999
and that in turn allows us to quantify the
effects of the other three laws.
