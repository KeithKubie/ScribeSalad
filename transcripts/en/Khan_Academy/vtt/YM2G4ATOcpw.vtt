00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.220
Mike built a rectangular dog
pen that is 21 feet long,

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.410
and it has a
perimeter of 78 feet.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.930
What is the width
of Mike's dog pen?

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:13.550
So let's try to
draw this dog pen.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.710
So it's going to
have some width,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.050
and I'll just label
that as the width.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.820
And it's going to have
a length of 21 feet.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.339
So this distance right over
here is going to be 21,

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:28.630
and of course, this is as well.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.140
It's a rectangle,
so this is also

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.479
going to be a distance of 21.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.470
And of course, this
distance down here

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.700
is also going to be the width.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.210
Now, how do you calculate
the perimeter of this?

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.240
They tell us that the
perimeter is 78 feet,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.550
but how do we calculate
the perimeter using

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.930
this information?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.470
Well, the perimeter
is just the sum

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.410
of these two widths
and these two lengths.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.090
So the perimeter is going to
be the width plus the width

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.430
plus the two lengths,
plus 21 plus 21.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.930
This will give us
the distance if we

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.420
go around this
rectangular dog pen.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.670
And they tell us that this thing
needs to be equal to 78 feet.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.785
Let me do the same color.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.450
Now, we could simplify
this expression

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.420
on the left hand
side a little bit.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.820
We know that the width plus the
width plus the sum of the two

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.010
lengths-- which are
both the same-- plus 42

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.990
is going to equal 78.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.390
So what must the width
plus the width be equal to?

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.640
So, I have something--
I have this thing

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.820
plus 42 is equal to 78.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.970
So if I have something
plus 42 is equal to 78,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.200
that means that this
something must be 78 minus 42.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.980
So let's write that down.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:11.540
Width plus width is going
to be equal to 78 minus 42,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.800
which is-- I'll do it in a
new color-- 78 minus 42 is 36.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.040
And you can verify this.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.170
If this thing right over
here is equal to 36,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.450
if the sum of my two
widths-- or essentially

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.190
this is 2 times the width.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.480
If 2 times the width is 36,
then width plus width is 36.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.470
Then this right over here is 36.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.970
36 plus 42 is
indeed equal to 78.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.230
So we figure out a width so that
if I add the width to itself,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.340
I get 36, because when we
add those two, you get 36,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.680
plus 21 plus 21 is equal to 78.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.200
So what number plus itself
is going to be equal to 36?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.230
Another way to rewrite this
is a number plus itself

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.810
is the same thing as
2 times that number.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.747
So 2 times the width is
going to be equal to 36.

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:06.830
And later on when we learn
algebra in a little bit

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.500
more detail, you'll see that
essentially what we're doing

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.200
is actually algebra, but it
just comes out of common sense,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.750
out of logic.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.140
So if I say 2 times some
value is equal to 36,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.490
what is that value going to be?

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:35.500
Well, 2 times 18 is 36, so
the width is equal to 18.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.400
And you might say well,
how did I figure out

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.650
that the width is equal to 18?

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.691
Well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:03:41.691 --> 00:03:44.020
If 2 times the width
is equal to 36,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.440
then the width must be
equal to 36 divided by 2,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.539
must be equal to 36 over 2,
which would also get you 18.

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:57.330
So there's a lot of
ways to think about it,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.413
and later on when we learn
algebra in a little bit

00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:02.026
more details, things like this
will seem even more obvious.

00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:04.150
But I just wanted to show
you that you can actually

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.999
reason this through just with
what we know about perimeter.
