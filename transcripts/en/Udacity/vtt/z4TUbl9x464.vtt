00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820
So let's see what happens if Alice is running her algorithm on a larger network.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.750
So, instead of 5 communication centers, she has 20 communication centers

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.100
in her network.

00:00:11.100 --> 99:59:59.000
How often are the lines 3 to 5 executed in that case?
