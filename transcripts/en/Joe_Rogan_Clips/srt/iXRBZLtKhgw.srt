1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,480
Bless that guy. So no flame to
bring it. I thought it was silly.

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:05,300
But you know these fans fans want,

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,580
cause Ben is a
representative of the trolls.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,170
Like most of the trolls look like Ben
asked her if I could give you any infant.

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,050
That's hilarious. Hilarious.
If I could give you any advice,

6
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,070
please don't pay attention.
I don't get any shit.

7
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,170
Don't pay attention to comments.
You know that glass jar? Yeah.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,020
Once you smashed that thing too. Don't
even put anything in there anymore, man.

9
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:32,400
Don't do nothing. I, and I've, I've heard
you say that so many times. Like I, um,

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,860
when I started paying
attention to the show,

11
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:38,730
I started watching the show and I watched
the one you did with Tyron when Tyler

12
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:41,310
was up here and, and
you so right. Like some,

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,480
cause that's the one thing that I always
felt like so unfair about Tyron is a

14
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,880
lot of people just gave him shit because,

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,820
and I think it started because
he didn't take that belt.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,590
They didn't dethrone George Saint Pierre.

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,030
So I think a lot of it stemmed from
that. So where do you go about that? Man,

18
00:00:57,031 --> 00:01:00,530
I know it doesn't, it stopped Robbie
Lawler if that didn't give Hendrix.

19
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,530
I understand,
but,

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,310
but George Sand pure still looping around
as the was a big champion but sort of

21
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:10,340
not because he retired. He said I'm
going to step away. Yeah, but he,

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,470
he stepped away. Yes. I
understand. For you being the,

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,040
obviously you know so much about the sport
[inaudible] being in the sport for so

24
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,890
long. Yes. But for these fickle
fans that don't know shit,

25
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:24,070
that's why he can't listen to all they
know is George Saint Pierre worship here

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,010
was a champion.
He never lost his belt.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,600
So I felt like tiring and forgot
his fair share necessarily.

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,870
I feel like the same because,
because they're like,

29
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,930
oh he never took the belt from George
and he always wanted Wonderboy fights.

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,950
I think the Wonderboy fights were so
fucking hard. Yeah. But even before that,

31
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:45,330
fight Wonderboy that way, that is
the way you fight that guy. Yes.

32
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,750
You know, unless you know someone
like me comes in and does it,

33
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,240
what would you do it? What would
you do? I don't know. I just do.

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,020
I just do me cause he's still in the
mix. How would you do me? You know,

35
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:58,560
I will eventually get ahold of him.
I will eventually break him and you know,

36
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,190
eventually make it look easy and then
people are going to just complain.

37
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:05,040
So you know it is what it
is. Yeah. The, the, the,

38
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:09,070
the problem with him is he's so
difficult to get close to. Yeah.

39
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,850
He's a different guy because
his style is so different.

40
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,410
He'll stand totally sideways on you.
His hands will be down and he can wrestle.

41
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,660
I mean in terms of takedown defense,

42
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:22,620
he's got good takedown defense and his
strikes come from fucking weird angles,

43
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:26,370
man. He moves like a snake. Like he
bends at the waist and pops forward.

44
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,880
Ever watched him kickbox and African
war. But I saw that, you know,

45
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,060
I knew it was a problem when he threw
that one kick that came over the fucking

46
00:02:33,061 --> 00:02:37,120
shoulder and smacked question
mark. Kick. Yeah. It was weird.

47
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:40,020
It's not the front leg. He's
very good with it. He just,

48
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,340
you don't even know what's going on.

49
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,880
He think maybe he's going to
kick you in the body. Yeah.

50
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:46,950
Around surround comes over. The
top x smacks you in the fet. Nah,

51
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,920
he's very talented. Like I like
wondering what lot, you know,

52
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,190
but like I just felt like when I
saw that show with tiring, I said,

53
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,770
and you said the exact same thing to them.
And that's what I said too.

54
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:56,940
And that's where I was thinking too.

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,580
But it's easier sending nut
because partially what I,

56
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,760
I got into this and why,

57
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:07,060
why I appreciate the platform that I
have right now is the fact that you can

58
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,890
affect so many people at
such a rapid amount of time.

59
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,570
Because there's been an instance to where,

60
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,880
I don't know if you ever
remember that movie,

61
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,170
what women want and Mel gifts met
Mel Gibson. I didn't watch it.

62
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,710
And basically he could hear women's
thoughts and things like that.

63
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,050
And then there was a,
there was a girl in the office,

64
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:34,051
Girl in the movie who she was planning
to kill herself because no one really

65
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:36,280
paid attention to her. She
was like, no one would care.

66
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:39,700
And she's walked around with books. I
applied for a job, everyone blew me off.

67
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:42,160
No one cares.
I'm going to kill myself this day.

68
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,750
So she was planning to kill herself and
he heard her because he could hear what

69
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:48,280
women think.
He heard a thoughts,

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,330
but initially they didn't really pay
attention to it until later on he realized

71
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,110
she was missing from the office and
then he like ran to go find her and

72
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,460
essentially saved her life.
But my thing is,

73
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,910
and that's a quote that I live by with
great power comes great responsibility.

74
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Like what if there's someone
that's dealing with something
in a certain time and

75
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,380
yes, I didn't ask to be put in
that position, but they, you know,

76
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,430
they just decided, oh, I'm
just going to reach out.

77
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:19,800
I send a message before I kill myself
this day. One was going to respond,

78
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,680
no one's going to care.

79
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,540
And I happened to read that message and
talk to that kid off the ledge and that

80
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,180
kid becomes fucking,
you know,

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,480
wins the Nobel peace prize
later on in life. Like,

82
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,290
that's a responsibility that I have that
I didn't, I didn't put that on myself,

83
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:39,550
but that I have with the gift that
I've been blessed with to touch so many

84
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,384
people.

85
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,670
And so how am I going to know that
if I never read any of my messages or

86
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:49,240
comments and things like
that? Yes, of course. I, you
know, all the negative ones.

87
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,200
Yeah.
Blow and blow it up.

88
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,830
But how do I know it's negative
if I don't read it and all,

89
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,780
so that's what I'm saying. It's easier
said than done. It's like I read this.

90
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:59,560
If now what I do is I read, if I even
feel like it's getting negative, dilly,

91
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,170
dilly, dilly, I can't read them all. Cause
after that five fucking, I got thousands,

92
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,300
I'm sure. So, you know,
I can't read them all.

93
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:10,570
But every now and again when I'm
bored enough and I have time,

94
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,540
like I'll read some of it because
sometimes it is good, good things,

95
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:18,541
but you know that [inaudible].
