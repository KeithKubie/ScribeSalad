00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
To test this hypothesis that lightning was actually electricity,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Benjamin Franklin did something--well, something incredibly stupid.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now, it's not entirely certain if Franklin actually did this experiment

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but what's believed is that he took a kite out into a windy, raging thunderstorm

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and as the kite flew and the string got wet, well he tied a key to that string.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
His thinking being that, well if this lightning is somehow electricity

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
there's got to be a ton of this electricity in the sky.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And so he probably didn't actually allow the kite to get struck by lightning

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
because that could've been fatal.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Instead, he let the kite fly close to the clouds where he hoped it would collect electricity.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That electricity he hoped will be transferred somehow along this wet kite string

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
into the key, which could then be touched to this--what's called an electrode

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of the Leyden jar, thus charging the jar.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
When he did the experiment, it worked. What he set out to do actually happened.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He showed that since lightning can be used to charge a Leyden jar,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
lightning must be electricity.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
For the rest of this unit, we're going to learn about electricity.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now I have to say this is usually a subject that's covered over an entire course.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So what we're going to do here is learn the very basics enough to protect our buildings

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
from being struck by lightning but this is really just a teaser.

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We're really just skimming the surface of what there is to learn about electricity.
