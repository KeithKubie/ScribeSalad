you know the idea that questions are

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979
you know the idea that questions are
 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.280
you know the idea that questions are
becoming more valuable than answers it

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290
becoming more valuable than answers it
 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.710
becoming more valuable than answers it
seems kind of counterintuitive but it's

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
seems kind of counterintuitive but it's
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.030
seems kind of counterintuitive but it's
actually an idea that's being really

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
actually an idea that's being really
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.530

embraced these days in Silicon Valley

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
embraced these days in Silicon Valley
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.379
embraced these days in Silicon Valley
and other areas of other centers of

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389
and other areas of other centers of
 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.199
and other areas of other centers of
innovation and the reason why is if you

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209
innovation and the reason why is if you
 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.450
innovation and the reason why is if you
look at a lot of the innovations and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460
look at a lot of the innovations and
 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.610
look at a lot of the innovations and
breakthroughs today and you trace them

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.620
breakthroughs today and you trace them
 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.430

back as I did in my research to their

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440
back as I did in my research to their
 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.920
back as I did in my research to their
origin a lot of times what you find at

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
origin a lot of times what you find at
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.590
origin a lot of times what you find at
the root of it all is a great question a

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600
the root of it all is a great question a
 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.560
the root of it all is a great question a
beautiful question if someone asking why

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
beautiful question if someone asking why
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.869
beautiful question if someone asking why
isn't someone doing this what if someone

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879
isn't someone doing this what if someone
 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.910
isn't someone doing this what if someone
tried to do that so I found that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
tried to do that so I found that
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.099
tried to do that so I found that
questions are often at the root of

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:37.109
questions are often at the root of
 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.340
questions are often at the root of
innovation and that's why you know in

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
innovation and that's why you know in
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.869
innovation and that's why you know in
Silicon Valley these days they're

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
Silicon Valley these days they're
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.430
Silicon Valley these days they're
actually saying you know questions are

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
actually saying you know questions are
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.939
actually saying you know questions are
the new answers but at the same time you

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949
the new answers but at the same time you
 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.610
the new answers but at the same time you
know it's important to note that

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620
know it's important to note that
 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.950
know it's important to note that
questions aren't just important to

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960
questions aren't just important to
 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.360
questions aren't just important to
innovators or tech people they're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
innovators or tech people they're
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.069
innovators or tech people they're
they're a survival skill for all of us

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079
they're a survival skill for all of us
 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.879
they're a survival skill for all of us
and that becomes even more true in a

00:00:58.879 --> 00:00:58.889
and that becomes even more true in a
 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:01.610
and that becomes even more true in a
time of dynamic change I mean we've got

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
time of dynamic change I mean we've got
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.910
time of dynamic change I mean we've got
so much that we have to adapt to we have

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
so much that we have to adapt to we have
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.490
so much that we have to adapt to we have
we have to solve problems we have to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
we have to solve problems we have to
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.639
we have to solve problems we have to
deal with change uncertainty and

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649
deal with change uncertainty and
 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.370
deal with change uncertainty and

questioning is that questioning enables
 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.510
questioning is that questioning enables
us to organize our thinking around what

we really need great questions in order

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
we really need great questions in order
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260
we really need great questions in order
to be able to know what to do with all

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

a four year old girl is asking like as
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.779
a four year old girl is asking like as
much as 300 questions a day and when

much as 300 questions a day and when
 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.499
much as 300 questions a day and when
when kids go into school you see this a

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509
when kids go into school you see this a
 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.300
when kids go into school you see this a
steady decline that happens as they go

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
steady decline that happens as they go
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.700

through through the grade levels to the
point where questioning in schools by

point where questioning in schools by
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.849
point where questioning in schools by
junior high school is almost at zero

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859
junior high school is almost at zero
 

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.859
junior high school is almost at zero
there are a lot of reasons why

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869
there are a lot of reasons why
 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.589
there are a lot of reasons why
questioning declines as we get older but

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
questioning declines as we get older but
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.180
questioning declines as we get older but
one of the key issues is that in

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190
one of the key issues is that in
 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.850
one of the key issues is that in
schools we really value the answers and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860
schools we really value the answers and
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.590
schools we really value the answers and
there is almost no value placed on

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600
there is almost no value placed on
 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.970
there is almost no value placed on
asking a good question
