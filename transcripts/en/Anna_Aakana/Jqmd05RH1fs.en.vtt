00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
I've failed a lot.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.100
I've done entire stand up comedy sets

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.200
where no one laughed.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.080
Uploaded videos that have huge dislike ratios

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.420
and I've bombed countless auditions, pitches and meetings.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.760
And failing in the moment is hard, right?

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.480
You feel embarrassed and ashamed

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.000
and your self esteem just like plummets to the ground.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.540
You tell yourself that you're an untalented piece of shit

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.980
who's stupid for even trying.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.440
And then to make it worse

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.300
you replay these moments over and over

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.300
in your head as though

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.640
reliving it will somehow change what happened.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.880
The number one thing that helps me deal with failure

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.800
is learning how to not take it personally.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.540
And this is hard but once you can separate your identity from failure itself

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.520
and approach it more clinically, the quicker you're able to get over it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.080
and get back to trying.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.060
I mean can you imagine how hard it would be

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.020
for scientists to make progress

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.400
if they experienced crippling shame every time an experiment failed?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.900
Oh my God! I am just like so embarrassed!

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.500
Uh, girl I totally get it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.300
but sometimes you have to break a few beakers

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.180
to get a substantially viable theory!

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.720
You know?

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.700
I know, it's just every time I test my hypothesis

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.480
and the variables don't add up to the conclusion

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.140
that I know the mathematics back

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.480
I feel like super stupid.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.700
Oh no baby it's all part of the scientific method, girl!

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620
Here! Have a shot!

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.720
Thank you

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.860
*choking sounds*

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.320
Oh oops that's not whiskey, I'm so sorry!

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.020
The sooner you realize that failure

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.960
is not a reflection of your self worth

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.700
and instead a process that everybody has to go through

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.400
to get better

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.820
the more you'll embrace it

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.580
and actually think that it's a good thing.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.220
Because every failure is one step closer to success

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.220
Now I do realize some people are stuck in the fear of failure stage.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.280
Right?  Like you're like too afraid to even try.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.420
Whenever I feel afraid and I don't wanna do something

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.560
I try to visualize all the worst possible outcomes.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.000
So, if I'm doing a show,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.100
I'll visualize that nobody laughed at a joke

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.360
or that I went blank on stage and forgot my set

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.180
or that people threw a bunch of tomatoes at me!

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.560
And after I go through every terrible outcome

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.080
I ask myself will I still be better for this experience?

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.240
And the answer is almost always yes!

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.560
Because none of these situations had me dying.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.620
And in each one I faced my fears and I experienced personal growth.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.680
Plus, to be honest, people don't care!

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.760
If anybody witnesses your failure, yeah they'll cringe

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.160
and then they'll move on with their lives

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.780
and go on to the next thing!

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.400
It was a horrifying moment in time for you,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.460
but you're still a little bit closer to your goal.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.120
Hopefully that helps! I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.300

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.120
