00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.846
In the last video on the Drake equation

00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:04.625
we tried out some numbers

00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:05.929
we just made some assumptions

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:07.785
that seemed reasonable at least to me

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:10.805
and we got that there should be 12.5

00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:14.569
detectable civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:16.098
and I've talked about a bunch of reasons

00:00:16.098 --> 00:00:18.267
about why we are not detecting them

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:20.846
but I left out one of the most obvious reasons

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:21.836
that we are not detecting them

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:24.123
and it was rightfully pointed out in the comments

00:00:24.123 --> 00:00:25.523
below that video

00:00:25.523 --> 00:00:27.790
and thats just the signal might be too weak

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.144
if theres 12.5

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:34.129
if there's on the order of 10, 11, 12 detectable

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.713
civilizations in our galaxy

00:00:35.713 --> 00:00:37.667
they could be quite far from us

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.056
this isn't the Milky Way

00:00:39.056 --> 00:00:40.964
but this is a galaxy that probably doesn't look

00:00:40.964 --> 00:00:42.379
too different from our Milky Way

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.652
we could obviously never get this vantage point

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:46.179
of our galaxy

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.764
well at least not for a while

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:50.052
not unless we can travel quite far away from it

00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:52.313
but lets say we are over here

00:00:52.313 --> 00:00:55.277
you could imagine if the ten civilizations

00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:57.333
or the twelve civilizations are

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:01.087
here, one, two, three, four

00:01:01.087 --> 00:01:02.738
there's probably a lot more at the center actually

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:04.975
because that's where our density is higher

00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:05.969
so let me put it here

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:10.585
so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:14.267
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:16.795
the closest of them might be

00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:19.877
tens of thousands of light years away from us

00:01:19.877 --> 00:01:21.779
and there might be a lot of stuff in between

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:23.559
all sorts of crazy things happening

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:25.267
stars exploding

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:27.036
all sorts of signals that we are receiving

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:27.867
and it might just be

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:29.754
that the signals from those civilizations

00:01:29.754 --> 00:01:31.775
are too weak to reach us

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:34.862
or that there is too much interference

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:36.098
from all of the other craziness

00:01:36.098 --> 00:01:37.944
that's happening around the galaxy

00:01:37.944 --> 00:01:39.118
there's also these other reasons

00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:40.585
that I've talked about in the last video

00:01:40.585 --> 00:01:42.477
maybe they've gone beyond

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:45.979
using radio as a form of communication

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.462
and thats why..

00:01:47.462 --> 00:01:49.148
or they never used it to begin with

00:01:49.148 --> 00:01:50.569
and that's why we don't even see them

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:51.579
ever using it

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.354
or they used if for a very short period

00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:54.600
a kind of transition period

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.646
and maybe in a hundred years we'll discover the next best thing

00:01:57.646 --> 00:02:02.748
the other idea behind why we're probably

00:02:02.748 --> 00:02:06.338
or maybe why we might not be able to detect civilizations

00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:07.082
is that

00:02:07.082 --> 00:02:09.436
well there might be a lot fewer than ten

00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:11.908
when I did the Drake equation right over here

00:02:11.908 --> 00:02:13.333
I just made a bunch of assumptions

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.354
none of these seemed crazy

00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:18.200
but I assumed a reality

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000
where you didn't have these kind of cataclysmic events

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.431
in the galaxy at regular intervals

00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:28.692
but we know there are cataclysmic events

00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:30.785
that happen in our galaxy

00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:32.015
in other galaxies

00:02:32.015 --> 00:02:33.979
the one we know the most about

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.867
although there are all sorts of things that we

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:36.918
don't know much about

00:02:36.918 --> 00:02:38.267
are gamma ray bursts

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:41.179
and these are still kind of trying to be understood

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:46.236
GAMMA RAY BURSTS

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:48.005
and you can watch the video on quasars

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:52.010
those are essentially of highly energetic rays

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.098
being released when all this material

00:02:54.098 --> 00:02:58.508
is being kind of absorbed into super massive black holes

00:02:58.523 --> 00:02:59.985
at the centers of galaxies

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:03.267
that tend to be very very very often

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:04.492
billions of light years away

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:07.538
and gamma rays are one of the things that get emitted from those

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.856
but you can also have gamma ray bursts within galaxies

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:14.308
we believe maybe certain types of stars when they collapse

00:03:14.308 --> 00:03:15.877
into black holes

00:03:15.877 --> 00:03:17.477
you have this burst of gamma rays

00:03:17.477 --> 00:03:20.144
there might be certain kinds of neutron stars

00:03:20.144 --> 00:03:22.596
with the right properties that might every now and then

00:03:22.596 --> 00:03:23.729
release gamma rays

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:25.267
and the view is

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:28.246
is that if there is a civilization

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:31.575
that is within a few thousand light years

00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:35.733
near one of these gamma ray bursts

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:36.713
and its in wrong place

00:03:36.713 --> 00:03:38.554
its kind of in the path of the burst

00:03:38.554 --> 00:03:42.231
then its a good chance that those civilizations will

00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:43.646
be completely wiped out

00:03:43.646 --> 00:03:45.471
that those planets will become sterilized

00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:47.692
because there is so much radiation

00:03:47.692 --> 00:03:49.487
coming out from that gamma ray

00:03:49.487 --> 00:03:51.302
there's even some theories

00:03:51.302 --> 00:03:55.005
that some of the extinction events that have happened in Earth's history

00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:56.769
we are not talking about the dinosaurs

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.415
we are talking about billions of years ago

00:03:58.415 --> 00:03:59.523
maybe a billion years ago

00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:00.662
or two billion years ago

00:04:00.662 --> 00:04:02.964
that these might have been caused by

00:04:02.964 --> 00:04:05.744
relatively local gamma ray bursts

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:08.169
the theory is that these might hit earth

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.698
on the order of once every billion years

00:04:10.698 --> 00:04:13.800
and if you think about the galaxy as a whole

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.333
we're kind of in..

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:19.077
our solar system is orbiting the galaxy

00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:21.795
its kind of a nice distance from the center of the galaxy

00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.513
the closer you get into the center

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.729
the higher densities of stars you have

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.959
so you can imagine if earth gets hit with

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.200
one of these gamma rays bursts

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.769
every couple of billion years

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:35.569
you can imagine something closer the center of the galaxy

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.329
gets hit with these gamma ray bursts

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:40.200
much much much more frequently

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.867
just because there is more activity there

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:43.621
there are more stars that are closer by

00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:44.964
more stars that are aging

00:04:44.964 --> 00:04:47.308
more stars that might be collapsing into black holes

00:04:47.308 --> 00:04:50.221
so the simple answer is we don't know

00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:53.077
there could be a thousand civilizations out there

00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:55.810
and we're not sophisticated enough to notice them just yet

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.733
or there might be very very few

00:04:57.733 --> 00:04:59.871
because all of this craziness that happens

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:01.554
in the galaxy

00:05:01.554 --> 00:05:03.359
or who knows there might be none

00:05:03.359 --> 00:05:04.795
although I find that kind of...

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:06.502
that's not too exciting

00:05:06.502 --> 99:59:59.999
so I try not to think about that one
