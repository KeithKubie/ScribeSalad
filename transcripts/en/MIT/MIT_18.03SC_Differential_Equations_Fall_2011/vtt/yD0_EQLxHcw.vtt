00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.815
I'd like to talk.
Thank you.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:28.953
One of the things I'd like to
give a little insight into today

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:38.000
is the mathematical basis for
hearing.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.893
For example,
if a musical tone,

00:00:41.893 --> 00:00:49.290
a pure musical tone would
consist of a pure oscillation in

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.572
terms of the vibration of the
air.

00:00:53.572 --> 00:00:59.152
It would be a pure oscillation.
So, [SINGS],

00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:06.679
and if you superimpose upon
that, suppose you sing a triad,

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:14.345
[SINGS], those are three tones.
Each has its own period of

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:19.308
oscillation, and then another
one, which is the top one,

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:22.736
which is even faster.
The higher it is,

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:26.616
the faster the thing.
Anyway, what you hear,

00:01:26.616 --> 00:01:29.503
then, is the sum of those
things.

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:34.105
So, C plus E plus G,
let's say, what you hear is the

00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:37.338
wave form.
It's periodics,

00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:40.550
still, but it's a mess.
I don't know,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.851
I can't draw it.
So, this is periodic,

00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:47.866
but a mess, some sort of mess.
Now, of course,

00:01:47.866 --> 00:01:52.237
if you hear the three tones
together, most people,

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:56.877
if they are not tone deaf,
anyway, can hear the three

00:01:56.877 --> 00:02:01.464
tones that make up that.
So, in other words,

00:02:01.464 --> 00:02:05.705
if this is the function which
is the sum of those three,

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:09.098
some sort of messy function,
f of t,

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:12.182
you're able to do Fourier
analysis on it,

00:02:12.182 --> 00:02:15.651
and break it up.
You're able to take that f of

00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:20.123
t, and somehow mentally express
it as the sum of three pure

00:02:20.123 --> 00:02:22.976
oscillations.
That's Fourier analysis.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.292
We've been doing it with an
infinite series,

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:29.684
but it's okay.
It's still Fourier analysis if

00:02:29.684 --> 00:02:34.693
you do it with just three.
So, in other words,

00:02:34.693 --> 00:02:38.704
the f of t is going to
be the sum of,

00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:41.289
let's say, sine,
I don't know,

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:46.459
it's going to be the sign of
one frequency plus the sine of

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.183
another frequency plus the sine
of a third, maybe with

00:02:51.183 --> 00:02:53.857
coefficients here.
So, somehow,

00:02:53.857 --> 00:02:58.314
since you were born,
you have been able to take the

00:02:58.314 --> 00:03:02.236
f of t,
and express it as the sum of

00:03:02.236 --> 00:03:07.147
the three signs.
And, here, therefore,

00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:11.034
the three tones that make up
the triad.

00:03:11.034 --> 00:03:15.943
Now, the question is,
how did you do that Fourier

00:03:15.943 --> 00:03:18.397
analysis?
In other words,

00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:23.102
does your brain have a little
integrator in it,

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:28.011
which calculates the
coefficients of that series?

00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:34.409
Of course, the answer is no.
It has to do something else.

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.399
So, one of the things I'd like
to aim at in this lecture is

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:44.561
just briefly explaining what,
in fact, actually happens to do

00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:46.368
that.
Now, to do that,

00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:50.584
we'll have to make some little
detours, as always.

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:54.542
So, first I'm going to,
throughout the lecture,

00:03:54.542 --> 00:03:59.188
in fact, I gave you last time a
couple of shortcuts for

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:04.006
calculating Fourier series based
on evenness and oddness,

00:04:04.006 --> 00:04:09.254
and also some expansion of the
idea of Fourier series where we

00:04:09.254 --> 00:04:13.212
use the different,
but things didn't have to be

00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:17.858
periodic or period two pi,
but it can have an arbitrary

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:25.000
period, 2L, and we could still
get a Fourier expansion for it.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.692
Let me, therefore,
begin just as a problem,

00:04:28.692 --> 00:04:33.000
another type of shortcut
exercise, to do a Fourier

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.186
calculation, which we are going
to be later in the period to

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:43.765
explain the music problem.
So, let's suppose we're

00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:48.936
starting with the function,
f of t,

00:04:48.936 --> 00:04:55.189
which is a real square wave,
and I'll make its period

00:04:55.189 --> 00:05:00.000
different from the one,
not two pi.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.588
So, suppose we had a function
like this.

00:05:02.588 --> 00:05:04.713
So, this is one,
and this is one.

00:05:04.713 --> 00:05:08.164
So, the height is one,
and this point is one as well.

00:05:08.164 --> 00:05:10.753
And then, it's periodic ever
after that.

00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:13.873
I'll tell you what,
let's do like the electrical

00:05:13.873 --> 00:05:17.723
engineers do and put these
vertical lines there even though

00:05:17.723 --> 00:05:20.843
they don't exist.
Okay, so the height is one and

00:05:20.843 --> 00:05:23.233
it goes over.
The half period is one.

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:27.083
This really is a square wave.
I mean, it's really a square,

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:31.000
not what they usually call a
square wave.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.506
So, my question is,
what's its Fourier series?

00:05:36.506 --> 00:05:40.299
Well, it's neither even nor
odd.

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:47.029
That's a little dismaying.
It sounds like we're going to

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:54.371
have to calculate an's and bn's.
So, the shortcuts I gave you

00:05:54.371 --> 00:06:00.000
last time don't seem to be
applicable.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.087
Now, of course,
nor is the period two pi,

00:06:03.087 --> 00:06:07.718
but that shouldn't be too bad.
In fact, you ought to look for

00:06:07.718 --> 00:06:11.963
an expansion in terms of things
that look like sine of n,

00:06:11.963 --> 00:06:14.664
well, what should it be?

00:06:14.664 --> 00:06:18.600
Since L is equal to one,
the half period is equal to

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.993
one.
Remember, the period is 2L,

00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:22.768
not L.
It's n pi over L,

00:06:22.768 --> 00:06:26.087
but if L is one,
we should be looking for an

00:06:26.087 --> 00:06:30.023
expansion in terms of functions
that look like this.

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:34.731
Now, since we've already done
the work for the official square

00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:39.516
way, which looks something like
this, what you always try to do

00:06:39.516 --> 00:06:43.607
is reduce these things to
problems that you've already

00:06:43.607 --> 00:06:48.555
solved.
This is a legitimate one,

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:52.235
since I solved it in lecture
for you.

00:06:52.235 --> 00:06:56.631
So, we can consider it as
something we know.

00:06:56.631 --> 00:07:02.866
So, I observed that since I am
very lazy, that if I lower this

00:07:02.866 --> 00:07:09.000
function by one half,
it will become an odd function.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.065
Now it's an odd function.
Okay, I just cut the work in

00:07:17.065 --> 00:07:22.239
half.
So, let's call this function,

00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:26.652
let's call this,
I don't know,

00:07:26.652 --> 00:07:32.433
S of t.
The green one is the one we

00:07:32.433 --> 00:07:37.030
wanted to start with.
So, f of t is a green

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.546
function.
But, I can improve things even

00:07:40.546 --> 00:07:46.045
more because the function that
we calculated in the lecture is

00:07:46.045 --> 00:07:51.183
a lot like this salmon function.
That's why I called it S.

00:07:51.183 --> 00:07:56.861
But, the difference is that the
function we calculated with this

00:07:56.861 --> 00:07:58.935
one.
In the first place,

00:07:58.935 --> 00:08:04.951
it went down further.
It went not to negative one

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:08.669
half, which is where that one
goes.

00:08:08.669 --> 00:08:15.010
But, it went down to negative
one, and then went up here to

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.618
plus one.
And, it went over to pi.

00:08:18.618 --> 00:08:23.976
So, it came down again,
but not, but at the point,

00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:27.474
pi.
And here, negative pi went up

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:31.192
again.
Okay, let me remind you what

00:08:31.192 --> 00:08:34.690
this one was.
Suppose we call it,

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.298
O doesn't look good,
I don't know,

00:08:38.298 --> 00:08:44.806
how about g of u?
Let's, for a secret reason,

00:08:44.806 --> 00:08:47.147
call the variable u this time,
okay?

00:08:47.147 --> 00:08:50.892
So, the previous knowledge that
I'm relying on was that I

00:08:50.892 --> 00:08:54.973
derived the Fourier series for
you by an orthodox calculation.

00:08:54.973 --> 00:08:58.986
And, it's not too hard to do
because this is an odd function.

00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:01.929
And therefore,
you only have to calculate the

00:09:01.929 --> 00:09:05.394
bn's.
And, half of them turn out to

00:09:05.394 --> 00:09:09.357
be zero, although you don't know
that in advance.

00:09:09.357 --> 00:09:14.559
But anyway, the answer was four
over pi times the sum

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:17.614
of just the odd ones,
the sine of n u,

00:09:17.614 --> 00:09:21.495
and that you had to 
divide by n.

00:09:21.495 --> 00:09:25.211
So, this is the expansion of g,
this function,

00:09:25.211 --> 00:09:30.000
g of u, the Fourier expansion
of this function.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.426
Since it's an odd function,
it only involves the signs.

00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:39.016
There's no funny stuff here
because the period is now two

00:09:39.016 --> 00:09:41.639
pi.
And, this came from the first

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:45.163
lecture on Fourier series,
or from the book,

00:09:45.163 --> 00:09:49.016
wherever you want it,
or solutions to the notes.

00:09:49.016 --> 00:09:51.803
There are lots of sources for
that.

00:09:51.803 --> 00:09:56.475
The solution's in the notes.
Okay, now, that looks so much

00:09:56.475 --> 00:10:00.000
like the salmon function,
---

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.090
-- I ought to be able to
convert one into the other.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:07.379
Now, I will do that by
shrinking the axis.

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:11.871
But, since this can get rather
confusing, what I'll do is

00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:15.320
overlay this.
What I prefer to do is I think

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.572
u, okay, I'm changing,
I'm keeping the thing the same.

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:23.502
But, I'm going to change the
name of the variable,

00:10:23.502 --> 00:10:27.994
the t, in such a way that on
the t-axis, this becomes the

00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:30.893
point, one.
If I do that,

00:10:30.893 --> 00:10:34.331
then this function will turn
exactly into that one,

00:10:34.331 --> 00:10:37.700
except it will go not from
minus a half to a half,

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.825
but it will go from negative
one to one, since I haven't done

00:10:41.825 --> 00:10:45.125
anything to the vertical axis.
So, how I do that?

00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:47.531
What's the relation between u
and t?

00:10:47.531 --> 00:10:51.312
Well, u is equal to pi times t,
or the other way around.

00:10:51.312 --> 00:10:54.681
You know that it's going to be
approximately this.

00:10:54.681 --> 00:10:57.225
Try one, and then check that it
works.

00:10:57.225 --> 00:11:00.662
When t is equal to one,
u is pi, which is what it's

00:11:00.662 --> 00:11:04.705
supposed to be.
So, this is the relation

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:06.836
between the two.
And therefore,

00:11:06.836 --> 00:11:09.323
without further ado,
I can say that,

00:11:09.323 --> 00:11:11.952
let's write the relation
between them.

00:11:11.952 --> 00:11:15.860
f of t is what I want.
Well, what's f of t if I

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.910
subtract one half of that?
So, that's going to be equal to

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.747
the salmon function plus one
half, right, or the salmon

00:11:23.747 --> 00:11:26.447
function is f of t lowered by
one half.

00:11:26.447 --> 00:11:30.000
One thing is the same as the
other.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.467
And, what's the relation
between this salmon function and

00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:40.251
the orange function?
Well, the salmon function is,

00:11:40.251 --> 00:11:45.035
so, let's convert,
so, S of t -- it's more

00:11:45.035 --> 00:11:49.917
convenient, as I wrote the
formula g of u.

00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:54.994
Let's start it from that end.
If I start from g of u,

00:11:54.994 --> 00:12:00.949
what do I have to do to convert
it into S of-- into the salmon

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:05.788
function?
Well, take one half of it.

00:12:05.788 --> 00:12:12.224
So, if I put them all together,
the conclusion is that f of t

00:12:12.224 --> 00:12:18.017
is equal to one half
plus S of t,

00:12:18.017 --> 00:12:22.307
which is one half of g of u,

00:12:22.307 --> 00:12:25.633
but u is pi t.
So, it's four pi,

00:12:25.633 --> 00:12:31.318
four over pi times the sum of
the sine of n.

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:36.259
And, for u, I will write pi t

00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:40.389
divided by n.
And, sorry, I forgot to say

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:44.987
that sum is only over the odd
values of n, not all values of

00:12:44.987 --> 00:12:47.558
n.
So, the sum over n odd of that,

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:50.675
and, of course,
the two will cancel that.

00:12:50.675 --> 00:12:53.168
So, here we have,
in other words,

00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:57.454
just by this business of
shrinking or just stretching or

00:12:57.454 --> 00:13:01.116
shrinking the axis,
lowering it and squishing it

00:13:01.116 --> 00:13:06.136
that way a little bit.
We get from this Fourier

00:13:06.136 --> 00:13:11.123
series, we get that one just by
this geometric procedure.

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:16.376
I'd like you to be able to do
that because it saves a lot of

00:13:16.376 --> 00:13:19.493
time.
Okay, so let's put this answer

00:13:19.493 --> 00:13:25.102
up in, I'm going to need it in a
minute, but I don't really want

00:13:25.102 --> 00:13:28.308
to recopy it.
So, let me handle it by

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:32.223
erasing.
So, let's call that plus two

00:13:32.223 --> 00:13:36.036
over pi,
and there is our formula for

00:13:36.036 --> 00:13:39.212
that green function that we
wrote before.

00:13:39.212 --> 00:13:43.581
So, I'll put that in green.
So, we'll have a color-coded

00:13:43.581 --> 00:13:46.837
lecture again.
Now, what we're going to be

00:13:46.837 --> 00:13:50.649
doing ultimately,
to getting at the music problem

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:55.256
that I posed at the beginning of
the lecture, is we want to

00:13:55.256 --> 00:13:59.783
solve, and this is what a study
of Fourier series has been

00:13:59.783 --> 00:14:04.707
aiming at, to solve second-order
linear equations with constant

00:14:04.707 --> 00:14:09.790
coefficients were the right-hand
side was a more general function

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:14.000
than the kind we've been
handling.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.948
So, now, in order to simplify,
and we don't have a lot of time

00:14:17.948 --> 00:14:20.860
in the course,
I'd have to take another day to

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.061
make more complicated
calculations,

00:14:23.061 --> 00:14:27.009
which I don't want to do since
you will learn a lot from them,

00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:29.275
anyway.
I think you will find you've

00:14:29.275 --> 00:14:32.770
had enough calculation by the
time Friday morning rolls

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.320
around.
So, let's look at the undamped

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.567
case, which is simpler,
or undamped spring,

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:44.207
or undamped anything because it
doesn't have that extra term,

00:14:44.207 --> 00:14:46.759
which requires extra
calculations.

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:51.168
So, I'll follow the book now
and some of the notes and the

00:14:51.168 --> 00:14:54.957
visuals, and called the
independent variable-- the

00:14:54.957 --> 00:14:58.205
dependent variable I'm going to
call x now.

00:14:58.205 --> 00:15:01.453
And, the independent variable
is, as usual,

00:15:01.453 --> 00:15:04.795
time.
So, this is going to be,

00:15:04.795 --> 00:15:08.836
in general, f of t,
and I'm going to use it by

00:15:08.836 --> 00:15:12.503
calculating example,
this is the actual f of t I'm

00:15:12.503 --> 00:15:16.095
going to be using.
But, the general problem for a

00:15:16.095 --> 00:15:20.061
general f of t is to solve this,
or at least to find a

00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:23.653
particular solution.
That's what most of the work

00:15:23.653 --> 00:15:28.068
is, because we already know how
from that to get the general

00:15:28.068 --> 00:15:32.183
solution by adding the solution
to the reduced equation,

00:15:32.183 --> 00:15:36.000
the associated homogeneous
equation.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.977
So, all our work has been,
this past couple of weeks,

00:15:40.977 --> 00:15:44.518
in how you find a particular
solution.

00:15:44.518 --> 00:15:48.730
Now, the case in which we know
what to do is,

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.367
so we can find our particular
solution.

00:15:52.367 --> 00:15:55.430
Let's call that x sub p.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:01.173
We could find x sub p if the
right hand side is cosine omega,

00:16:01.173 --> 00:16:04.236
well, in general,
an exponential,

00:16:04.236 --> 00:16:09.979
but since we are not going to
use complex exponentials today,

00:16:09.979 --> 00:16:16.032
all these things are real.
And I'd like to keep them real.

00:16:16.032 --> 00:16:20.032
If it's either cosine omega t
or sine omega t,

00:16:20.032 --> 00:16:22.918
or some multiple of that by

00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:26.852
linearity, it's just as good.
We already know how to find the

00:16:26.852 --> 00:16:30.000
thing, and to find a particular
solution.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.571
So, the procedure is use
complex exponentials,

00:16:33.571 --> 00:16:36.190
and that magic formula I gave
you.

00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:39.523
But, right now,
just to save a little time,

00:16:39.523 --> 00:16:43.650
since I already did that on the
lecture on resonance,

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:48.015
I solved it explicitly for
that, and you've had adequate

00:16:48.015 --> 00:16:50.873
practice I think in the problem
sets.

00:16:50.873 --> 00:16:55.396
Let's simply write down the
answer that comes out of that.

00:16:55.396 --> 00:16:59.761
The answer for the particular
solution is cosine omega t

00:16:59.761 --> 00:17:05.000
or sine omega t.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.752
That's the top.
And, it's over a constant.

00:17:08.752 --> 00:17:13.877
And, the constant is omega
naught squared.

00:17:13.877 --> 00:17:19.003
That's the natural frequency
which comes from the system,

00:17:19.003 --> 00:17:24.311
minus the imposed frequency,
the driving frequency that the

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:29.162
system, the spring or whatever
it is, undamped spring,

00:17:29.162 --> 00:17:34.695
is being driven with.
Okay, understand the notation.

00:17:34.695 --> 00:17:39.278
Cosine this over that,
or sine, depending on whether

00:17:39.278 --> 00:17:43.052
you started driving it with
cosine or sine.

00:17:43.052 --> 00:17:46.737
So, this is from the lecture,
if you like,

00:17:46.737 --> 00:17:50.781
from the lecture on resonance,
but again it's,

00:17:50.781 --> 00:17:53.476
I hope by now,
a familiar fact.

00:17:53.476 --> 00:17:58.149
Let me remind you what this had
to do with resonance.

00:17:58.149 --> 00:18:03.631
Then, the observation was that
if omega, the driving frequency

00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:09.023
is very close to the natural
frequency, then this is close to

00:18:09.023 --> 00:18:13.447
that.
The denominator is almost zero,

00:18:13.447 --> 00:18:17.315
and that makes the amplitude of
the response very,

00:18:17.315 --> 00:18:20.631
very large.
And, that was the phenomenon of

00:18:20.631 --> 00:18:23.710
resonance.
Okay, now what I'd like to do

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:28.131
is apply those formulas to
finding out what happens for a

00:18:28.131 --> 00:18:32.000
general f(t),
or in particular this one.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.624
So, in general,
I'll keep using the notation,

00:18:36.624 --> 00:18:41.563
f of t,
even though I've sorted used it

00:18:41.563 --> 00:18:44.085
for that.
But in general,

00:18:44.085 --> 00:18:49.130
what's the situation?
If f of t is a sine series,

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.859
cosine series,
all right, let's do everything.

00:18:53.859 --> 00:18:56.802
Suppose it's,
in other words,

00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:00.375
the procedure is,
take your f of t,

00:19:00.375 --> 00:19:07.523
expand it in a Fourier series.
Well, doesn't that assume it's

00:19:07.523 --> 00:19:09.373
periodic?
Yes, sort of.

00:19:09.373 --> 00:19:12.149
So, suppose it's a Fourier
series.

00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:15.429
I'll make a very general
Fourier series,

00:19:15.429 --> 00:19:18.962
write it this way:
cosine (omega)n t,

00:19:18.962 --> 00:19:22.158
and then the sine terms,

00:19:22.158 --> 00:19:27.373
sine (omega)n t
from one to infinity where

00:19:27.373 --> 00:19:32.000
the omegas are,
omega n is short for that.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.861
Well, it's going to have the n
in it, of course,

00:19:35.861 --> 00:19:39.558
but I want, now,
to make the general period to

00:19:39.558 --> 00:19:42.598
be 2L.
So, it would be n pi over L.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.556
Of course, if L is equal to

00:19:45.556 --> 00:19:48.760
one, then it's n pi.
Or, if L equals pi,

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.375
those are the two most popular
cases, by far.

00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:56.401
Then, it's simply n itself,
the driving frequency.

00:19:56.401 --> 00:20:01.330
But, this would be the general
case, n pi over L

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:07.000
if the period is the period of f
of t is 2L.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.763
So, that's what the Fourier
series looks like.

00:20:10.763 --> 00:20:14.694
Okay, then the particular
solution will be what?

00:20:14.694 --> 00:20:18.207
Well, I got these formulas.
In other words,

00:20:18.207 --> 00:20:21.636
what I'm using is superposition
principle.

00:20:21.636 --> 00:20:25.650
If it's just this,
then I know what the answer is

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:30.000
for the particular solution,
the response.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.522
So, if you make a sum of these
things, a sum of these inputs,

00:20:34.522 --> 00:20:39.045
you are going to get a sum of
the responses by superposition.

00:20:39.045 --> 00:20:43.341
So, let's write out the ones we
are absolutely certain of.

00:20:43.341 --> 00:20:47.713
What's the response to here?
Well, it's (a)n cosine omega n

00:20:47.713 --> 00:20:51.105
t. The only thing is,

00:20:51.105 --> 00:20:55.251
now it's divided by omega
naught squared.

00:20:55.251 --> 00:21:00.000
This constant has changed,
and the same thing here.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.248
Of course, by linearity,
if this is multiplied by a,

00:21:03.248 --> 00:21:06.624
then the answer is multiplied
by, the response is also

00:21:06.624 --> 00:21:09.299
multiplied by a.
So, the same thing happens

00:21:09.299 --> 00:21:11.210
here.
Here, it's (b)n and over,

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:14.777
again, omega naught squared
minus omega times the sine of

00:21:14.777 --> 00:21:17.515
omega t.

00:21:17.515 --> 00:21:20.700
So, in other words,
as soon as you have the Fourier

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.439
expansion, the Fourier series
for the input,

00:21:23.439 --> 00:21:27.324
you automatically get this by
just writing it down the Fourier

00:21:27.324 --> 00:21:32.412
series for the response.
That's the fundamental idea of

00:21:32.412 --> 00:21:35.549
Fourier series,
at least applied in this

00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:38.605
context.
They have many other contexts,

00:21:38.605 --> 00:21:41.340
approximations,
so on and so forth.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.522
But, that's the idea here.
All right, what about that

00:21:45.522 --> 00:21:49.061
constant term?
Well, this formula still works

00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:52.439
if omega equals zero.
If omega equals zero,

00:21:52.439 --> 00:21:54.852
then this is the constant,
one.

00:21:54.852 --> 00:22:00.000
The formula is still correct.
Omega is zero here.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.515
The only thing you have to
remember is that the original

00:22:03.515 --> 00:22:07.030
thing is written in this form.
So, the response will be,

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.035
what will it be?
Well, it's one divided by omega

00:22:10.035 --> 00:22:12.847
naught squared,
if I'm in the case omega zero

00:22:12.847 --> 00:22:16.810
is equal to zero.
So, it's a zero divided by two

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.494
omega naught squared.
And, as you will see,

00:22:19.494 --> 00:22:23.010
it looks just like the others.
You're just taking omega,

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.334
and making it equal to zero for
that particular case.

00:22:26.334 --> 00:22:31.000
Sorry, this should be omega n's
all the way through here.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.585
All right, well,
let's apply this to the green

00:22:45.585 --> 00:22:49.308
function.
So, what have we got?

00:22:49.308 --> 00:22:56.258
We have its Fourier series.
So, if the green function is,

00:22:56.258 --> 00:23:02.092
if the input in other words is
this square wave,

00:23:02.092 --> 00:23:06.932
the green square wave,
so in your notes,

00:23:06.932 --> 00:23:15.000
this guy, this particular f of
t is the input.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.114
And, the equation is x double
prime plus omega naught squared

00:23:20.114 --> 00:23:23.950
x equals f of t.

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.872
Then, the response is,
well, I can't draw you a

00:23:27.872 --> 00:23:32.986
picture of the response because
I don't know what the Fourier

00:23:32.986 --> 00:23:37.845
series actually looks like.
But, let's at least write down

00:23:37.845 --> 00:23:43.129
what the Fourier series is.
The Fourier series will be,

00:23:43.129 --> 00:23:45.573
well, what is it?
It's one half.

00:23:45.573 --> 00:23:50.225
The constant out front is one
half, except it's one over two

00:23:50.225 --> 00:23:53.458
omega naught squared.

00:23:53.458 --> 00:23:56.612
So, this is my function,
f of t.

00:23:56.612 --> 00:24:01.422
That's the general formula for
how the input is related to the

00:24:01.422 --> 00:24:06.132
response.
And, I'm applying it to this

00:24:06.132 --> 00:24:10.160
particular function,
f of t.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.419
And, the answer is plus.
Well, my Fourier series

00:24:15.419 --> 00:24:21.125
involves only odd sums,
only the summation over odd,

00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:26.832
and only of the sign.
So, it is going to be two over

00:24:26.832 --> 00:24:31.755
pi,
sorry, so it's going to be two

00:24:31.755 --> 00:24:37.020
over pi out front.
That constant will carry along

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.984
by linearity.
And, I'm going to sum over odd,

00:24:39.984 --> 00:24:43.284
n odd values only.
The basic thing in the upstairs

00:24:43.284 --> 00:24:47.124
is going to be the sine of omega
n t.

00:24:47.124 --> 00:24:50.155
But, what is (omega)n?
Well, (omega)n is n pi.

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:53.725
So, it's n pi t.
And, how about the bottom?

00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:57.699
The bottom is going to be omega
naught squared minus omega n

00:24:57.699 --> 00:25:01.000
squared.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.907
And, this is my (omega)n,
minus n pi squared.

00:25:05.907 --> 00:25:07.871
What's that?

00:25:07.871 --> 00:25:12.288
Well, I don't know.
All I could do would be to

00:25:12.288 --> 00:25:16.509
calculate it.
You could put it on MATLAB and

00:25:16.509 --> 00:25:22.398
ask MATLAB to calculate and plot
for you the first few terms,

00:25:22.398 --> 00:25:26.815
and get some vague idea of what
it looks like.

00:25:26.815 --> 00:25:31.036
That's nice,
but it's not what's interesting

00:25:31.036 --> 00:25:35.453
to do.
What's interesting to do is to

00:25:35.453 --> 00:25:38.397
look at the size of the
coefficients.

00:25:38.397 --> 00:25:42.077
And, again, rather than do it
in the abstract,

00:25:42.077 --> 00:25:46.820
let's take a specific value.
Let's suppose that the natural

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:50.009
frequency of the system,
in other words,

00:25:50.009 --> 00:25:54.261
the frequency at which that
little spring wants to go

00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:58.350
vibrate back and forth,
whatever you got vibrating.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:03.011
Let's suppose the natural
frequency that's omega naught is

00:26:03.011 --> 00:26:05.628
ten for the sake of
definiteness,

00:26:05.628 --> 00:26:09.830
as they say.
Okay, if that's ten,

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:15.415
all I want to do is calculate
in the crudest possible way what

00:26:15.415 --> 00:26:19.535
a few of these terms are.
So, the response is,

00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:23.471
so let's see,
we've got to give that a name.

00:26:23.471 --> 00:26:26.950
The response is (x)p of t.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.253
What's (x)p of t?
I'm just going to calculate it

00:26:31.253 --> 00:26:35.568
very approximately.
This means, you know,

00:26:35.568 --> 00:26:39.379
throwing caution to the winds
because I don't have a

00:26:39.379 --> 00:26:43.114
calculator with me.
And, I want you to look at this

00:26:43.114 --> 00:26:47.373
thing without a calculator.
The first term is one over 200.

00:26:47.373 --> 00:26:50.212
Okay, that's the only term I

00:26:50.212 --> 00:26:52.902
can get exactly right.
[LAUGHTER] Or,

00:26:52.902 --> 00:26:56.637
I could if I could calculate.
I suppose it's 0.005,

00:26:56.637 --> 00:27:00.000
right?
That's the constant term.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.926
Okay, so the next term,
let's see, two over pi is two

00:27:04.926 --> 00:27:07.768
thirds.
I'll keep that in mind,

00:27:07.768 --> 00:27:09.852
right?
Plus two thirds,

00:27:09.852 --> 00:27:13.831
0.6, let's say,
that's an indication of the

00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:19.326
accuracy with which these things
are going to be performed.

00:27:19.326 --> 00:27:24.821
I think in Texas for a long
while, the legislature declared

00:27:24.821 --> 00:27:27.000
pi to be three,
anyways.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.831
One of those states did it to
save calculation time.

00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:36.000
I'm not kidding,
by the way.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.995
All right, so what's the first
term?

00:27:38.995 --> 00:27:42.334
If n equals one,
I have the sine of pi t.

00:27:42.334 --> 00:27:46.014
That's the n equals one term.

00:27:46.014 --> 00:27:50.465
What's the denominator like?
That's about 100 minus 9

00:27:50.465 --> 00:27:53.889
squared. Let's say it's 91,

00:27:53.889 --> 00:27:56.970
sine t over 91.
What's the next term?

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.736
Sine of three pi t, remember,

00:28:00.736 --> 00:28:04.417
I am omitting,
I'm only using the odd values

00:28:04.417 --> 00:28:09.810
of n because those are the only
ones that enter into the Fourier

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:14.346
expansion for this function,
which is at the bottom of

00:28:14.346 --> 00:28:19.948
everything.
All right, what's the sine

00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:26.298
three pi t?
Well, now, I've got 100 minus

00:28:26.298 --> 00:28:32.752
three pi, --
-- that's 9 squared is 81.

00:28:32.752 --> 00:28:42.075
So, no, what am I doing?
So, we have 100 minus three

00:28:42.075 --> 00:28:46.096
times pi is 9,
squared.

00:28:46.096 --> 00:28:53.956
Well, let's say a little more.
Let's say 85.

00:28:53.956 --> 00:29:02.000
So, that's 15.
How bout the next one?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.025
Well, it's sine 5 pi t.

00:29:05.025 --> 00:29:09.644
I think I'll stop here as soon
as we do this one because at

00:29:09.644 --> 00:29:12.669
this point it's clear what's
happening.

00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:16.730
This is 100 squared minus,
that's 15 squared is 225,

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.915
so that's about 125 with a
negative sign.

00:29:19.915 --> 00:29:24.693
So, minus this divided by 125.
And, after this they are going

00:29:24.693 --> 00:29:28.913
to get really quite small
because the next one will be

00:29:28.913 --> 00:29:33.133
seven pi squared.
That's 400, and this is

00:29:33.133 --> 00:29:38.470
becoming negligible.
So, what's happening?

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:42.941
So, it's approximately,
in other words,

00:29:42.941 --> 00:29:48.235
0.005 plus the next coefficient
is, let's see,

00:29:48.235 --> 00:29:51.764
6/10, let's say 100,
sine pi t.

00:29:51.764 --> 00:29:56.823
And, what comes next?
Well, it's now 1/20th.

00:29:56.823 --> 00:30:03.070
It's about a 20th.
Let's call that 0.005 sine

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:08.976
three pi t,
and now so small,

00:30:08.976 --> 00:30:13.818
minus 0.01, let's say times
this last one,

00:30:13.818 --> 00:30:16.889
sine 5 pi t.
What you find,

00:30:16.889 --> 00:30:22.086
in other words,
is that the frequencies which

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:30.000
make up the response do not
occur with the same amplitude.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.266
What happens is that this
amplitude is roughly five times

00:30:35.266 --> 00:30:38.934
larger than any of the
neighboring ones.

00:30:38.934 --> 00:30:43.260
And after that,
it's a lot larger than the ones

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.175
that come later.
In other words,

00:30:46.175 --> 00:30:52.100
the main frequency which occurs
in the response is the frequency

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.733
three pi.
What's happened is,

00:30:54.733 --> 00:31:00.000
in other words,
near resonance has occurred.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.599
So, if omega is ten,
very near resonance,

00:31:04.599 --> 00:31:10.693
that is, it's not too close,
but it's not too far away

00:31:10.693 --> 00:31:16.902
either, occurs for the frequency
three pi in the input.

00:31:16.902 --> 00:31:22.421
Now, where's the frequency
three pi in the input?

00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:27.250
It isn't there.
It's just that green thing.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:33.000
Where in that is the frequency
three pi?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.688
I can't answer that for you,
but that's the function of

00:31:37.688 --> 00:31:41.508
Fourier series,
to say that you can decompose

00:31:41.508 --> 00:31:45.416
that green function into a sum
of frequencies,

00:31:45.416 --> 00:31:50.365
as it were, and the Fourier
coefficients tell you how much

00:31:50.365 --> 00:31:54.011
frequency goes into each of
those f of t's.

00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:59.134
Now, so, f of t is decomposed
into the sum of frequencies by

00:31:59.134 --> 00:32:04.450
the Fourier analysis.
But, the system isn't going to

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.717
respond equally to all those
frequencies.

00:32:07.717 --> 00:32:12.292
It's going to pick out and
favor the one which is closest

00:32:12.292 --> 00:32:15.967
to its natural frequency.
So, what's happened,

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:19.480
these frequencies,
the frequencies and their

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:23.482
relative importance in f of t
are hidden,

00:32:23.482 --> 00:32:26.913
as it were.
They're hidden because we can't

00:32:26.913 --> 00:32:30.425
see them unless you do the
Fourier analysis,

00:32:30.425 --> 00:32:35.000
and look at the size of the
coefficients.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:44.918
But, the system can pick out.
The system picks out and

00:32:44.918 --> 00:32:54.274
favors, picks out for resonance,
or resonates with,

00:32:54.274 --> 00:33:04.005
resonates with the frequencies
closest to its natural

00:33:04.005 --> 00:33:09.227
frequency.
Well, suppose the system had

00:33:09.227 --> 00:33:11.296
natural frequency,
not ten.

00:33:11.296 --> 00:33:14.718
This is a put up job.
Suppose it had natural

00:33:14.718 --> 00:33:17.423
frequency five.
Well, in that case,

00:33:17.423 --> 00:33:21.959
none of them are close to the
hidden frequencies in f of t,

00:33:21.959 --> 00:33:25.221
and there would be no
resonance.

00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:29.040
But, because of the particular
value I gave here,

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.098
I gave the value ten,
it's able to pick out n equals

00:33:33.098 --> 00:33:37.634
three as the most important,
the corresponding three pi as

00:33:37.634 --> 00:33:44.000
the most important frequency in
the input, and respond to that.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.268
Okay, so this is the way we
hear, give or take a few

00:33:48.268 --> 00:33:51.616
thousand pages.
So, what does the ear do?

00:33:51.616 --> 00:33:55.048
How does the ear,
so, it's got that thing,

00:33:55.048 --> 00:33:57.308
messy curve,
which I erased,

00:33:57.308 --> 00:34:01.158
which has a secret,
which just has three hidden

00:34:01.158 --> 00:34:05.162
frequencies.
Okay, from now on I hand wave,

00:34:05.162 --> 00:34:07.830
right, like they do in other
subjects.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.290
So, we got our frequency.
So, it's got a [SINGS].

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:13.669
That's one frequency.
[SINGS] And,

00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:16.841
what goes in there is the sum
of those three,

00:34:16.841 --> 00:34:20.590
and the ear has to do something
to say out of all the

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.411
frequencies in the world,
I'm going to respond to that

00:34:24.411 --> 00:34:26.358
one, that one,
and that one,

00:34:26.358 --> 00:34:29.746
and send a signal to the brain,
which the brain,

00:34:29.746 --> 00:34:34.000
then, will interpret as a
beautiful triad.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.549
Okay, so what happens is that
the ear, I don't talk

00:34:37.549 --> 00:34:39.963
physiology, and I never will
again.

00:34:39.963 --> 00:34:43.087
I know nothing about it,
but anyway, the ear,

00:34:43.087 --> 00:34:46.991
when you get far enough in
there, there are little three

00:34:46.991 --> 00:34:50.115
bones, bang, bang,
bang; this is the eardrum,

00:34:50.115 --> 00:34:52.884
and then there's the part which
has wax.

00:34:52.884 --> 00:34:57.215
Then, there's the eardrum which
vibrates, at least if there is

00:34:57.215 --> 00:35:01.190
not too much wax in your ear.
And then, the vibrations go

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:05.734
through three little bones which
send the vibrations to the inner

00:35:05.734 --> 00:35:10.321
ear, which nobody ever sees.
And, the inner ear,

00:35:10.321 --> 00:35:13.589
then, is filled with thick
fluid and a membrane,

00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:16.788
and the last bone hits up
against the membrane,

00:35:16.788 --> 00:35:20.334
and the membrane vibrates.
And, that makes the fluid

00:35:20.334 --> 00:35:21.655
vibrate.
Okay, good.

00:35:21.655 --> 00:35:25.827
So, it's vibrating according to
the function f of t.

00:35:25.827 --> 00:35:28.748
Well, what then?
Well, that's the marvelous

00:35:28.748 --> 00:35:31.975
part.
It's almost impossible to

00:35:31.975 --> 00:35:36.162
believe, but there is this,
sort of like a snail thing

00:35:36.162 --> 00:35:38.612
inside.
I've forgotten the name.

00:35:38.612 --> 00:35:41.535
It's cochlea.
And, it has these hairs.

00:35:41.535 --> 00:35:45.960
They are not hairs really.
I don't know what else to call

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.777
them. They're not hairs.

00:35:47.777 --> 00:35:52.044
But, there are things so long,
you know, they stick up.

00:35:52.044 --> 00:35:56.469
And, there are 20,000 of them.
And, they are of different

00:35:56.469 --> 00:35:59.234
lengths.
And, each one is tuned to a

00:35:59.234 --> 00:36:05.413
certain frequency.
Each one has a certain natural

00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:11.558
frequency, and they are all
different, and they are all

00:36:11.558 --> 00:36:16.110
graded, just like a bunch of
organ pipes.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:23.279
And, when that complicated wave
hits, the complicated wave hits,

00:36:23.279 --> 00:36:29.196
each one resonates to a hidden
frequency in the wave,

00:36:29.196 --> 00:36:35.000
which is closest to its natural
frequency.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.750
Now, most of them won't be
resonating at all.

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.500
Only the ones close to the
frequency [SINGS],

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.062
they'll resonate,
and the nearby guys will

00:36:43.062 --> 00:36:45.687
resonate, too,
because they will be nearby,

00:36:45.687 --> 00:36:48.062
almost have the same natural
frequency.

00:36:48.062 --> 00:36:50.562
And, over here,
there will be a few which

00:36:50.562 --> 00:36:53.500
resonate to [SINGS],
and finally over here a few

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.500
which go [SINGS],
and each of those little hairs,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.125
little groups of hairs will
signal, send that signal to the

00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:03.812
auditory nerve somehow or other,
which will then carry these

00:37:03.812 --> 00:37:06.312
three inputs to the brain,
and the brain,

00:37:06.312 --> 00:37:11.000
then, will interpret that as
you are hearing [SINGS].

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.407
So, the Fourier analysis is
done by resonance.

00:37:15.407 --> 00:37:21.283
You here resonance because each
of these things has a certain

00:37:21.283 --> 00:37:27.159
natural frequency which is able,
then, to pick out a resonant

00:37:27.159 --> 00:37:32.233
frequency in the input.
I'd like to finish our work on

00:37:32.233 --> 00:37:35.657
Fourier series.
So, for homework I'm asking you

00:37:35.657 --> 00:37:38.560
to do something similar.
Taken an input.

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.431
I gave you a frequency here,
a different omega naught,

00:37:42.431 --> 00:37:46.972
a different input,
as you by means of this Fourier

00:37:46.972 --> 00:37:50.173
analysis to find out which it
will resonate,

00:37:50.173 --> 00:37:54.565
which of the hidden frequencies
in the input the system will

00:37:54.565 --> 00:38:00.000
resonate to, just so you can
work it out yourself and do it.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.304
Now, I'd like to first try to
match up what I just did by this

00:38:05.304 --> 00:38:10.173
formula with what's in your
book, since your book handles

00:38:10.173 --> 00:38:14.173
the identical problem but a
little differently,

00:38:14.173 --> 00:38:19.043
and it's essentially the same.
But I think I'd better say

00:38:19.043 --> 00:38:22.608
something about it.
So, the book's method,

00:38:22.608 --> 00:38:28.000
and to the extent which any of
these problems are worked out in

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
the notes, the notes do this,
too.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.453
Use substitution.
Base uses differentiation of

00:38:36.453 --> 00:38:42.194
Fourier series term by term.
The work is almost exactly the

00:38:42.194 --> 00:38:46.549
same as here.
And, it has a slight advantage,

00:38:46.549 --> 00:38:51.399
that it allows you,
the book's method has a slight

00:38:51.399 --> 00:38:56.447
advantage that it allows you to
forget this formula.

00:38:56.447 --> 00:39:01.000
You don't have to know this
formula.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.680
It will come out in the wash.
Now, for some of you,

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.286
that may be of colossal
importance, in which case,

00:39:08.286 --> 00:39:10.862
by all means,
use the book's method,

00:39:10.862 --> 00:39:14.101
term by term.
So, it requires no knowledge of

00:39:14.101 --> 00:39:17.928
this formula because after all,
I base this solution,

00:39:17.928 --> 00:39:21.829
I simply wrote down the
solution and I based it on the

00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:26.319
fact that I was able to write
down immediately the solution to

00:39:26.319 --> 00:39:30.000
this and put as being that
response.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.577
And for that,
I had to remember it,

00:39:32.577 --> 00:39:36.975
or be willing to use complex
exponentials quickly to remind

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:38.491
myself.
There's very,

00:39:38.491 --> 00:39:41.372
very little difference between
the two.

00:39:41.372 --> 00:39:44.557
Even if you have to re-derive
that formula,

00:39:44.557 --> 00:39:48.272
the two take almost about the
same length of time.

00:39:48.272 --> 00:39:50.926
But anyway, the idea is simply
this.

00:39:50.926 --> 00:39:52.821
With the book,
you assume.

00:39:52.821 --> 00:39:55.702
In other words,
you take your function,

00:39:55.702 --> 00:39:58.887
f of t.
You expand it in a Fourier

00:39:58.887 --> 00:40:01.389
series.
Of course, which signs and

00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:07.000
cosines you use will depend upon
what the period is.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.738
So, you assume the solution of
the form-- Well,

00:40:10.738 --> 00:40:14.639
if I, for example,
carried out in this particular

00:40:14.639 --> 00:40:18.215
case, I don't know if I will do
all the work,

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:22.766
but it would be natural to
assume a solution of the form,

00:40:22.766 --> 00:40:26.017
since the input looks like the
green guy.

00:40:26.017 --> 00:40:30.000
Assume a solution which looks
the same.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.780
In other words,
it will have a constant term

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:38.351
because the input does.
But all the rest of the terms

00:40:38.351 --> 00:40:42.131
will be sines.
So, it will be something like

00:40:42.131 --> 00:40:46.527
(c)n times the sine of n pi t.

00:40:46.527 --> 00:40:50.131
The only question is,
what are the (c)n's?

00:40:50.131 --> 00:40:53.032
Well, I found one method up
there.

00:40:53.032 --> 00:40:56.461
But, the general method is just
plug-in.

00:40:56.461 --> 00:41:02.000
Substitute into the ODE.
Substitute into the ODE.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.690
You differentiate this twice to
do it.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:08.618
So, I'll do the double
differentiation and I won't stop

00:41:08.618 --> 00:41:12.181
the lecture there,
but I will stop the calculation

00:41:12.181 --> 00:41:15.163
there because it has nothing new
to offer.

00:41:15.163 --> 00:41:19.309
And, this is the way all the
calculations in the books and

00:41:19.309 --> 00:41:22.436
the solutions and the notes are
carried out.

00:41:22.436 --> 00:41:25.418
So, I don't think you'll have
any trouble.

00:41:25.418 --> 00:41:30.000
Well, this term vanishes.
This term becomes what?

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.531
If I differentiate this twice,
I get summation,

00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:37.830
so, this is one to infinity
because I don't know which of

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:40.440
these are actually going to
appear.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:43.742
Summation one to infinity,
(c)n times, well,

00:41:43.742 --> 00:41:48.194
if you differentiate the sine
twice, you get negative sine,

00:41:48.194 --> 00:41:50.728
right?
Do it once: you get cosine.

00:41:50.728 --> 00:41:53.338
Second time:
you get negative sine.

00:41:53.338 --> 00:41:57.791
But, each time you will get
this extra factor n pi from the

00:41:57.791 --> 00:42:00.631
chain rule.
And so, the answer will be

00:42:00.631 --> 00:42:05.545
negative (c)n times n pi squared
times the sine of n pi t.

00:42:05.545 --> 00:42:10.770
And so, the procedure is,

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:13.461
very simply,
you substitute (x)p double

00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:16.011
prime into the differential
equation.

00:42:16.011 --> 00:42:17.994
In other words,
if you do it,

00:42:17.994 --> 00:42:22.243
we will multiply this by omega
naught squared.

00:42:22.243 --> 00:42:25.359
And, you add them.
And then, on the left-hand

00:42:25.359 --> 00:42:29.892
side, you are going to get a sum
of terms, sine n pi t

00:42:29.892 --> 00:42:34.000
times coefficients
involving the (c)n's.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.701
And, on the right,
so, you're going to get a sum

00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:41.009
involving the (c)n's,
and the sines n pi t,

00:42:41.009 --> 00:42:44.789
and on the right,
you're going to get the Fourier

00:42:44.789 --> 00:42:49.279
series for f of t,
which is exactly the same kind

00:42:49.279 --> 00:42:52.193
of expression.
The only difference is,

00:42:52.193 --> 00:42:56.131
now the sines have come with
definite coefficients.

00:42:56.131 --> 00:43:01.014
And then, you simply click the
coefficients on the left and the

00:43:01.014 --> 00:43:05.424
coefficients on the right,
and figure out what the (c)n's

00:43:05.424 --> 00:43:10.233
are.
So, by equating coefficients,

00:43:10.233 --> 00:43:15.586
you get the (c)n's.
Would you like me to carry it

00:43:15.586 --> 00:43:19.266
out?
Yeah, okay, I was going to do

00:43:19.266 --> 00:43:24.284
something else,
but I wouldn't have time to do

00:43:24.284 --> 00:43:28.075
it anyway.
So, why don't I take two

00:43:28.075 --> 00:43:34.097
minutes to complete the
calculation just so you can see

00:43:34.097 --> 00:43:40.445
you get the same answer?
All right, what do we get?

00:43:40.445 --> 00:43:43.832
If you add them up,
you get c naught,

00:43:43.832 --> 00:43:47.783
out front, plus (c)n is
multiplied by what?

00:43:47.783 --> 00:43:52.393
Well, from the top it's
multiplied by omega naught

00:43:52.393 --> 00:43:55.874
squared.
On the bottom,

00:43:55.874 --> 00:44:00.013
it's multiplied by n 
pi squared.

00:44:00.013 --> 00:44:05.000
Ah-ha, where have I seen that
combination?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:15.378
The sum is equal to,
sorry, one half plus what is

00:44:15.378 --> 00:44:29.000
it, sum over n odd of sine n pi
t over n.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.747
So, the conclusion is that--
I'm sorry, it should be c naught

00:44:34.747 --> 00:44:38.961
times omega naught squared.

00:44:38.961 --> 00:44:44.421
So, what's the conclusion?
If c zero is one over two omega

00:44:44.421 --> 00:44:48.444
naught squared,

00:44:48.444 --> 00:44:51.222
and that (c)n,
only for n odd,

00:44:51.222 --> 00:44:55.819
the others will be even.
The others will be zero.

00:44:55.819 --> 00:45:01.662
The (c)n is going to be equal
to two over pi here.

00:45:01.662 --> 00:45:04.823
So, it's going to be two pi,

00:45:04.823 --> 00:45:10.091
two over pi times one over n
times one over omega naught

00:45:10.091 --> 00:45:15.934
squared minus n over
pi squared.

00:45:15.934 --> 00:45:20.927
This is terrible,

00:45:20.927 --> 00:45:26.144
which is the same answer we got
before, I hope.

00:45:26.144 --> 00:45:30.000
Did I cover it up?
Same answer.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.644
So, that answer at the
left-hand end of the board is

00:45:35.644 --> 00:45:38.854
the same one.
I've calculated,

00:45:38.854 --> 00:45:42.839
in other words,
what the c zeros are.

00:45:42.839 --> 00:45:45.239
And, I got the same answer as
before.
