00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For which of these problems that a numerical approach be appropriate:

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to determine the heat capacity of the oceans,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to prove that Ï€/4=1-1/3+1/5-1/7 and so on and so on up to infinity, or

00:00:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to determine whether a control system is unconditionally stable or not.
