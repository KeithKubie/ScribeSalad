problem is that even though Americans

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680
problem is that even though Americans
 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.919
problem is that even though Americans
are concerned about climate change

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929

month so while people are concerned

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839
month so while people are concerned
 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.240
month so while people are concerned
about climate change they're not

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250
about climate change they're not
 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.380
about climate change they're not
concerned enough and my personal

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390
concerned enough and my personal
 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.750
concerned enough and my personal
perspective is that the main goal for

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760
perspective is that the main goal for
 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.600
perspective is that the main goal for
climate action is to make those people

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610
climate action is to make those people
 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.210
climate action is to make those people
who are concerned but still

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220
who are concerned but still
 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.009

fundamentally complacent about the issue
to be really engaged in a way that they

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:55.479
to be really engaged in a way that they
 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.170
to be really engaged in a way that they
prioritize climate change in their

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180
prioritize climate change in their
 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.119
prioritize climate change in their
politics and their voting and make sure

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129
politics and their voting and make sure
 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.369
politics and their voting and make sure
that our leaders think of climate change

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379
that our leaders think of climate change
 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.079
that our leaders think of climate change
is a first-order political priority not

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089
is a first-order political priority not
 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:05.580
is a first-order political priority not
a third or fourth order political

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590
a third or fourth order political
 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.560
a third or fourth order political
priority and maybe even a political

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570
priority and maybe even a political
 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.630
priority and maybe even a political
imperative that governs all others

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640
imperative that governs all others
 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.910
imperative that governs all others
because that is true if you care about

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920
because that is true if you care about
 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.430
because that is true if you care about
economic inequality if you care about

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440
economic inequality if you care about
 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.580
economic inequality if you care about
violence basically every political thing

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590
violence basically every political thing
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.840
violence basically every political thing
that you could worry about in this world

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850
that you could worry about in this world
 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.730
that you could worry about in this world
bears the fingerprint of climate change

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740
bears the fingerprint of climate change
 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.620
bears the fingerprint of climate change
and will be made worse if climate change

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630
and will be made worse if climate change
 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.400
and will be made worse if climate change
continues unabated so addressing any of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410
continues unabated so addressing any of
 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.020
continues unabated so addressing any of
them on some level means addressing

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030
them on some level means addressing
 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.160
them on some level means addressing
climate change and that's the

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170
climate change and that's the
 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.480
climate change and that's the
perspective I think we really need to

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490
perspective I think we really need to
 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.420
perspective I think we really need to
have or more of us need to have there is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430
have or more of us need to have there is
 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.860
have or more of us need to have there is
a real concern about preaching to the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870
a real concern about preaching to the
 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.480
a real concern about preaching to the
choir I don't think if that is being an

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490
choir I don't think if that is being an
 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.960
choir I don't think if that is being an
issue of people like me that is people

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970
issue of people like me that is people
 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.460
issue of people like me that is people
who were up until quite recently

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
who were up until quite recently
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.410
who were up until quite recently
you know aware of climate worried about

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420
you know aware of climate worried about
 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.149
you know aware of climate worried about
it but who didn't orient their lives

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159
it but who didn't orient their lives
 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.770
it but who didn't orient their lives
around it I think that there's a bigger

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780
around it I think that there's a bigger
 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.350
around it I think that there's a bigger
risk of advocates and activists talking

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360
risk of advocates and activists talking
 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.690
risk of advocates and activists talking
to one another and not addressing the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700
to one another and not addressing the
 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.560
to one another and not addressing the
sort of median concerned liberal who is

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570
sort of median concerned liberal who is
 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.090
sort of median concerned liberal who is
worried but fundamentally complacent

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100
worried but fundamentally complacent
 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.039
worried but fundamentally complacent
that to me is the main target of

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049
that to me is the main target of
 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.200
that to me is the main target of
messaging and I when I look around the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210
messaging and I when I look around the
 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.480
messaging and I when I look around the
world I see many many more people like

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490
world I see many many more people like
 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.729
world I see many many more people like
that many more societies like that then

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739
that many more societies like that then
 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.529
that many more societies like that then
I see people who are really deeply

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539
I see people who are really deeply
 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.630
I see people who are really deeply
committed or who are really deeply in

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640
committed or who are really deeply in
 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.580
committed or who are really deeply in
denial and I say that as someone who

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590
denial and I say that as someone who
 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.040
denial and I say that as someone who
felt that way myself until quite

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050
felt that way myself until quite
 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.080
felt that way myself until quite
and who was awakened from that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090
and who was awakened from that
 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.720
and who was awakened from that
complacency by fear and alarm which is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730
complacency by fear and alarm which is
 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.490
complacency by fear and alarm which is
one reason why I think that talking

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500
one reason why I think that talking
 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.560
one reason why I think that talking
bluntly about the science and everything

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570
bluntly about the science and everything
 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.000
bluntly about the science and everything
that it projects for our near-term

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
that it projects for our near-term
 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.580
that it projects for our near-term
future is really important we shouldn't

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.140
future is really important we shouldn't
shy away from the projections that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
shy away from the projections that
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.300
shy away from the projections that
science has made for us we should look

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310
science has made for us we should look
 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.090
science has made for us we should look
as squarely at them as we can even if

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100
as squarely at them as we can even if
 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.240
as squarely at them as we can even if
they horrify us because fear can be

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250
they horrify us because fear can be
 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.760
they horrify us because fear can be
mobilizing can be motivating we know

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770
mobilizing can be motivating we know
 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.200
mobilizing can be motivating we know
that from environmental history we know

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210
that from environmental history we know

that from advocacy history in this case

that from advocacy history in this case
I don't think it needs to be the only

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080
I don't think it needs to be the only
 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.240
I don't think it needs to be the only
way that we talk about climate change

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250
way that we talk about climate change
 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.970
way that we talk about climate change
