LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Weekly for December

00:00:06.152 --> 00:00:11.554
18, 2013, our 17th and final
weekly wrap up for the year.

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:13.470
I'm Louis Gray, and this
is our highlight reel

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.200
of what's happening in the world
of Google Developers on the set

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.600
and off.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.400
Last week we hosted four
special edition segments

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.000
in celebration of Computer
Science Education Week

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.060
and the Hour Of Code campaign.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.010
Here's how it all went down.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.460
To kick things off, Van
Riper hosted three students

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.350
from GDG Fresno High, as
well as the group's sponsors,

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.310
Joshua and Courtney Woodward.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.000
Mamie Rheingold chatted
with the founder

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.410
of code.org, Hadi
Partovi, who shared

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.250
why getting 10
million kids to code

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.680
is crucial for the
success of every industry.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.110
In our third segment,
Deena Shakir and Girls

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.170
Who Code Founder Reshma
Saujani shared how developers

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.800
can make an impact in
teaching girls to code.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.020
And on Friday, Natalie
Villalobos hosted

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.800
noted entrepreneur
Limor Fried, who

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.930
explained why
engineering isn't boring,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.270
whether it's LED shoes
or DIY home automation.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.700
You can find all these
segments on our YouTube channel

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.320
and on our Google
Developers Google+ page.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.900
We then welcomed John Faig,
Darrel Sumi from Talkray,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.750
and Brad Green from
Google's Angular team

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.460
into the studio for a talk
on building Chrome packaged

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.350
apps using AngularJS.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.170
John and Darrel
discussed critical points

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.910
in transitioning
from regular web apps

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.100
to Chrome packaged apps,
as well as why AngularJS

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.010
makes for a great fit
with packaged apps.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.960
Some of the most
helpful technical tips

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.350
come from friendly people
you've never even met,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.900
like the active communities on
Stack Overflow in our YouTube

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.630
API community members.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.790
This week we invited YouTube
API Google Developer experts,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.480
who we call GDEs, Matias
Molinas, Tim Wintle and Jarom

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.690
McDonald to the studio
to learn from them

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.690
face to face and see what they
find fascinating about taking

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.960
on top code challenges.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.800
Of course, you can always learn
more about the GDE program

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.430
by visiting
developers.google.com/experts.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.550
Staying in YouTube land, Ibrahim
Ulukaya hosted split media labs

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.080
explaining how the X Split
broadcaster integrates

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.230
with the YouTube
live streaming API

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.430
to create an easy and powerful
game streaming experience.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.790
Back in my day, when I
fired up my Nintendo,

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.640
the only person who would
watch me was my brother.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.430
Now you can see all my complete
lack of skills and failure

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.620
to get to the next
level live on the web.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.660
And finally, from the lawn, in
the latest volley from the GDL

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.020
Italia series,
Michele [? Orlessi ?]

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.940
presents on how you can deploy
a PHP application on Google App

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.150
Engine.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.327
Beyond our studios, the
latest Chrome experiment

00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:33.910
takes you to Middle
Earth in the world

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.270

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.550
Check out the case
study on html5rocks.com,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.210
that's html5rocks.com, to
learn how the team accomplished

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.740
the amazing interactivity
of this experiment.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.450
But watch out for dragons.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.750
Last week [? Miley Olya
?] and the webmaster team

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.519
put together a great checklist
for improving mobile websites.

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.810

the Google Developers blog

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.930
and get handy tips for making
users happier with your sites.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.330
Also last week, Google+ Sign
In for your apps got smarter.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.000
Google+ Sign In now supports
Google Apps accounts,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.010
incremental auth, and migration
from other auth methods.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.510
Take a look at the
Google Developers

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.120
blog for all of the details.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.910
And finally, more news from the
folks working to make the web

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.630
faster.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.170
The resource timing
API is now available.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.880
This API enables you to
track timing information

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.740
about every resource
on the page,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.270
so you can measure
and then optimize.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.060
