1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,210
Last time of a about try fennel methyl.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,820
So I thought you might like to see the,
um,

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,310
see a space filling model of triathlon
on methyl and feel it how it works.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,700
Remember it was very difficult to find
a way of making Tetra fennel methane,

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,140
right?

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,580
Which means you have to take this fennel
with its little hook there and get it

7
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:27,080
into their right.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,220
So I'll pass this around and you can
try twisting it and see if you can make

9
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,050
Tetra federal methane better than
the people before Gomberg did. Okay.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:41,510
And then there's the question of whether
you can make hex of fennel ethane.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,740
So here are two triathlon on methyls.
One has the hook in it and one doesn't.

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,300
So the question is, can you put
those two together? Okay. So Debbie,

13
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,134
you're the first.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,420
So whoever gets it should bring
it up and show it to us. Okay.

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,380
The projector is warming up here.
Uh,

16
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,680
so, uh, we're speaking about
tryfan methyl and then,

17
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,840
uh,
I have a little,

18
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:16,310
a second thought about Friedel crafts
reactions that I'll give to you.

19
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,930
And then we're going to go onto the
next subject, which is carbon compounds.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,970
Once I get once the uh,

21
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,720
senator projector gets warmed up here.

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:33,613
Yeah,

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,510
I want to go. Okay, so we talked
last time about how a Steri Kendra,

24
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:44,950
how are you doing? Is Your
steric hindrance? Sarah?
Debbie. Pretty poorly. Okay.

25
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,850
It's really tough to get these things
together when you have these three

26
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:52,570
propellers that all have to twist because
of the way they run into one another.

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,350
And I still don't have my projector.
I don't know how it got turned off.

28
00:01:56,351 --> 00:02:00,850
I guess I did it somehow. So it
makes, as Debbie's finding out,

29
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,410
it makes Tetra Federal Efa. And did
you try Hex, the fennel ethane? What?

30
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:13,420
That's even worse. It's even
worse. Okay. So let us see.

31
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:15,970
I don't know how long it
looks like it's on up there.

32
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,780
How are you guys doing Helen?
Antonio, can you get them together?

33
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,800
Maybe you could get a picture of that.

34
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:36,950
I'm trying to hold it up so
that he can get a picture there.

35
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,610
Just just turn it between you
work on it as you're doing it.

36
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,743
Yeah.

37
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,960
Don't hold your hand in
the way of the camera.

38
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,073
Yes.

39
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,140
Part quiet a minute.
Yes.

40
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,790
Yeah,
it's true.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,380
It's true that the models have fixed
angles and don't distort easily these

42
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:12,700
bottles. If you made it with fishers
models, the ones that had rubber tubing,

43
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:16,450
you'd have no problem making it cause
they're not space filling either.

44
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,820
And there's the question
of how big the atoms are.

45
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,290
They're a little bit crushable,
right.

46
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,710
These models obviously are
more or less rigid. Right.

47
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:27,400
And in fact you can make
Tetra fennel methane,

48
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,300
but as we'll see shortly once we
get the projector going for us,

49
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,880
you can't make hex a fennel ethane.

50
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,973
Any luck.

51
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,010
I don't know why this is taking so long.

52
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,250
I turned off the side one and
somehow the center one went off to,

53
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:02,343
yeah,

54
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,500
I want to turn on one of the
other projectors just in case.

55
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,963
Yeah,

56
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,970
this one doesn't come on. In fact,
I'll turn them all along this.

57
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,260
See where,
where are we getting any luck?

58
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,290
Ah, there we go. Okay, so here
you'll see what we were just saying.

59
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,930
Steric hindrance and
try ethyl methyl causes,

60
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:40,931
twists that reduce overlap by 25% from
the what they would be a dye fennel

61
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:44,840
methyl and makes Tetra fennel
very difficult to prepare,

62
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,250
not to mention hexa
fennel ethane. Okay. So,

63
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,960
but Guttenberg was able to make tetra
fennel methane using this trick that he'd

64
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,710
learned in Munich of knocking nitrogen
out and having the two radicals come

65
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:59,180
together.
And He tried,

66
00:04:59,181 --> 00:05:01,970
as we've mentioned last time to
prove that that's what he had.

67
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:05,900
The analysis was correct. He
was good at analysis, remember?

68
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,150
And he got the right molecular
weight almost. So then he went back,

69
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:13,040
he spent just one year in Germany,

70
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,280
not like a free del who spent four
years first and then 17 years in Paris.

71
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,200
Okay. Uh, then he went back to
Ann Arbor and got back to work,

72
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,250
stayed there the rest of his life and he
confirmed the molecular weight by doing

73
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:32,390
an even better measurement.
He got three 18 versus three 20.

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,090
So he was really confident
he had tetra federal methane.

75
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,300
But there was one thing that was funny.
He'd nitrated it did uh,

76
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,460
uh,

77
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,190
aromatic electrophilic
aromatic substitution on the
four phenols got the Tetra

78
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:50,120
nitrile compound and he got to the
99 and a half percent yield. Okay.

79
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,920
But there was a problem he wrote,
unlike try Nitro,

80
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,160
try fennel methane,
it does dissolve

81
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,000
in sodium athelete that's f
oxide and iron strong base,

82
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,950
nor does it give any coloration.
So his tapped.

83
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,040
So these nitrile compounds with a lot
of federal seem to dissolve and strong

84
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:14,600
base and to give colors.
Right. But his compound didn't.

85
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,930
Now why does this the
dissolve in strong base?

86
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,773
Any ideas?

87
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,060
What does base do with it?
Strong base

88
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,123
tech.

89
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,680
Yeah.
It takes off h plus.

90
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,270
This is a very good and on it's
triply been Philly plus it. What?

91
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,240
Electron withdrawing nitrile group.

92
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:46,980
So it's easy to pull off the Proton and
get the an eye on which then dissolves.

93
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,270
And this colored,

94
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,900
he has an unusually high
bone and Mo Lumo nearby,

95
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:57,730
so it'll absorb like drugs, move,
absorbing light to the colored region.

96
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,300
Okay. So it was possible to get that.
Of course he didn't know this theory.

97
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,013
We know.

98
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:07,810
So for him it was just funny that it does
all been based the way others NightPro

99
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,410
phenol compounds.

100
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,720
But he wondered how about Pexa
fennel ethic. If you're nitrate,

101
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:21,030
if will it be color? Well
lit. It was all good things.

102
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,130
So he set about trying to make
mental effort. Now how did he try?

103
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:31,930
He tried using the technique but
fail to make Tetra fennel method.

104
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,070
It's very much like boards
public, right? You put a metal in,

105
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,630
pull out two chlorides.
The things come together as the idea here.

106
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,550
It's plausible because it's easy to pull
that chloride off as we'll see later.

107
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,550
Okay, so in fact he did get, he
thought perhaps a federal ethic.

108
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,260
Okay, so we did analysis, so we got this,

109
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,300
the total of carbon plus hydrogen that
is co two and water that he burned it in

110
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:06,130
got was 93.97 by one method.
This is a method,

111
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,300
not a run. He did many, many
analyses using the same method.

112
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,230
Their average was 93.97
he tried another method.

113
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:19,231
94.2 94.0 94.574 different methods,

114
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,940
a lot, maybe 20 an hour, right?

115
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,270
But he could never get it near 100%

116
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,790
and he was confident that visibility as
an analytical chemist over all that time

117
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:31,720
you spend in lab,

118
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,460
ultimately he used more than 17 different
methods to analyze it and none of them

119
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:40,690
would give 100%.

120
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:46,300
So we concluded that there's something
else there besides carbon and hydrogen

121
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,270
and that something else is oxygen.

122
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,530
Because if you have two oxygens
between the tribe dental methyl groups,

123
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,753
then the sub

124
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,250
them, the psalm of uh, Cnh is 90

125
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,600
pride will come away to give the trifocal
methyl cad I n and then o two minus,

126
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:28,150
we'll go between so you can get
the, the uh, authentic peroxide, uh,

127
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:32,850
and it was the same compound. So then
he knew how to prepare the hydrocarbon.

128
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,790
You do it by preparing it
without oxygen present.

129
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:39,720
It reacts to easily with oxygen.
So we used a special apparatus,

130
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:41,760
he said with ground glass joints.

131
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:45,030
Then they used corks and
sometimes rubber stoppers,

132
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,230
but never ground or rarely ground
glass joint. That was really high tech.

133
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:53,160
But he did it and he got the
compound that analyzed correctly.

134
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,180
But he found it was very funny because
this substance not only reacted with ode

135
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:04,680
to it reacted easily
with cl two with br too.

136
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,910
And even with I two which you
remember doesn't add to alkenes.

137
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,560
So this is us of weird
unsaturated compounds.

138
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:18,320
So one saturated react spontaneously
even with I two and certainly Hex,

139
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:20,700
a fennel ethane shouldn't do that.
Tetra fennel,

140
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:24,180
methane didn't do anything like that.
So this is the,

141
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,980
this is from his paper in 1900,
just at the turn of the century.

142
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,500
He said,
try fennel methyl.

143
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,820
The experimental evidence presented
above forces me to the conclusion that we

144
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:38,160
have to deal here with the free radical.

145
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,950
Remember where radicals came from.

146
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,880
Remember it was the nomenclature
in the 1830s and the organic, uh,

147
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,140
radical. And at first they
thought they were real things.

148
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:53,880
Colby thought he had made methyl,
but in fact he had made the dimer ethane.

149
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,570
Right. And then from then
on, radical was just a name.

150
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,040
It wasn't something that was real.
It wasn't the organic element right here.

151
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:04,770
He tried to make the
dimer hexa fennel ethane,

152
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,110
but concluded that he had the monomer
try fennel, methyl free radicals, right?

153
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,030
Not just names. Okay. On this assumption
alone to the results described above,

154
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:18,420
become intelligible and receive
an adequate explanation.

155
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,300
The action of zinc
results as it seems to me,

156
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:26,250
in the mere abstraction of the halogen
leaving the free radical, the radical,

157
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:30,780
so formed as apparently stable for it
can be kept both in solution and in the

158
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:32,850
dry crystal state for weeks.

159
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:37,320
So he had prepared a free radical.
Now of course,

160
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,870
when you do a reaction you can do,

161
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,690
you either have to go association,

162
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:46,410
dissociation or dissociation
and association.

163
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,430
And when you dissociate from carbon,
you get something that's try Vaillant.

164
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,950
And this was the first
example of, uh, of, uh,

165
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,270
authentic try Vaillant carbon compound.
So this was,

166
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,240
this is the, the, the, uh, the, uh,

167
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,310
watershed between the 19th century when
it was just making compounds and things

168
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:07,360
being mysterious.

169
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,740
And the 20th century when you can begin
to understand mechanisms in terms of

170
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:15,580
actually knowing something about
these try Vaillant carbon compounds.

171
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,730
And this was the first,
okay,

172
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:23,380
so this launched the American century
of chemistry because this experiment was

173
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:26,210
done in America, in Ann Arbor, right.

174
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,840
And here in October, 1900, he wrote
the paper and published it in America,

175
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:36,520
received October 4th and instance of
try Vaillant carbon, try fennel methyl,

176
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,640
but at the same time he
published it in Germany,

177
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,120
a preliminary paper try
federal methyl a case of uh,

178
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,080
try Vaillant carbon received
the 1st of October, 1900.

179
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:49,810
So he published at both
places to cover his bases.

180
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,650
Now you remember we talked
about the, uh, about, uh,

181
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,770
American organic chemistry and about
James Mason crafts and that essentially

182
00:12:58,781 --> 00:13:01,210
everything he did,
he did in Paris.

183
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:04,090
And people thought many people
thought he was French, right?

184
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:08,740
He did essentially nothing in
the u s and that was not, he was,

185
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:12,130
maybe there were people doing more than
that, but not a lot more than that.

186
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,870
All the center of gravity was in Europe,
especially in Germany. At the end of the,

187
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,860
of the, uh, 19th century.
But Gomberg comes along,

188
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:25,000
born 25 years later, right. And, Oh,

189
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:28,090
I should have said that there's
an exception, which is Yale,

190
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,780
because Gibbs really made it complete
international splash with his equilibrium

191
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,160
of heterogeneous substances,

192
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:40,270
which was published the same period
as the Friedel crafts reaction.

193
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,980
But that was in France and this was
in America. So in physical chemistry,

194
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,150
America had done something and it
was Gibbs, but in organic chemistry,

195
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:52,270
Gomberg was the first one to really
do something and these are gone Berg's

196
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:55,630
publications and contrast
that with the previous one.

197
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,720
So here,
uh,

198
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,000
he went for just one year
to Munich and Heidelberg,

199
00:14:01,001 --> 00:14:05,080
where he did this work and prepared
this compound, the Tetra fennel methane,

200
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,650
which was itself notable,
but much more drastic,

201
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,420
was the preparation of the radical
tryfan all methyl, which he did after.

202
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,730
He obviously,
after he got back to America,

203
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,690
so he published these things in German
because that's where the big readership

204
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,390
was.
But within 10 years or so,

205
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:26,020
he was doing all his publishing in the
United States and a lot of publishing.

206
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,550
So in that 25 year period
between Friedl on Gomberg,

207
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,280
things started really
happening in this country.

208
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,430
And then after the Second World War,

209
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:40,990
of course Europe had such difficulty that
things really took off here and it was

210
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:43,180
a long time for them to catch up again.

211
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,610
So this launched the American chemical
century and incidentally one other thing

212
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:55,201
about it is the big German journal for
organic chemistry was erected there,

213
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:59,480
Deutsche and Cayman Gazelle shop,
the reports of the, of the uh,

214
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,220
German chemical society.

215
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,640
And in 1900 there were 4,290 pages and
I leaf through them to see how many

216
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:10,640
graphs there were, how many quantitative
things were being discussed.

217
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,360
This was mainly a journal of organic
chemistry. And there were very,

218
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,200
very few graphs. In fact, in a sense,

219
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,700
two of the papers from this period here,

220
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
he gone Berg's papers had more
graphs than all those things in,

221
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,140
in all of 1900 and the
German main literature.

222
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,130
So it showed not only was thing where
things coming to America, but physical,

223
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:38,480
organic chemistry or the quantitative
approach to organic chemistry was rising

224
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:40,460
as well.
Now,

225
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,210
I said I had second thoughts
on the Friedel crafts reaction,

226
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,380
what I told you last time.

227
00:15:45,381 --> 00:15:47,690
So I'm going to take just a
minute to tell you about those.

228
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,250
So we talked about rearrangement happening
and Friedel Crafts alkylation uh,

229
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,250
and the idea that that you have, uh,
the, that the, that you can get the, uh,

230
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,340
uh, chloride being complex with
try fennel methyl chloride,

231
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:04,460
which makes it a good leaving group,
which means that you can,

232
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,730
that the fennel can come
in and displace that.

233
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,830
It's essentially an sn one reaction.

234
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:13,340
Here's the sub strait with it's good
leaving group and the high home, Oh,

235
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:14,900
here comes in and displaces,

236
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,050
and then you lose a hydrogen from
the same place and get the product.

237
00:16:18,051 --> 00:16:22,610
You get the normal appropriate
product, the first one there. Okay.

238
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,760
But if it dissociates a little bit
and rearranges with a hydride shift,

239
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,510
right, then you get the other product.
We talked, this is what we talked about.

240
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,560
Okay.

241
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,940
So we said that this is what
gives the primary product.

242
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,100
It's essentially an sn one reaction.

243
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,980
But this sn two reaction
after rearrangement,

244
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:46,310
when you get the more
stable secondary, uh, cat,

245
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,090
and then it can dissociate and
then you get the, uh, the, uh,

246
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,980
so-called Q mean I Sunpro benzene.
Now that may be true,

247
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,360
but it may be wrong too. I've
got thinking about this. Okay,

248
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,970
so suppose it rotated,
right?

249
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,740
So that methyl was on the backside.
Then what might you expect to happen?

250
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,643
Yeah,

251
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:12,540
what happened over here to
get the secondary cad iron.

252
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:17,550
It was a hydride shift,
right? What might you get now?

253
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,720
A method shift and methods and hydride
rearrange it about with about the same

254
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:28,740
rate. So why not do this?
Right? So why not do meth?

255
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:32,190
I'd shifts. So what do you get
if you do a myth? I'd shift.

256
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,170
You get that,

257
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,750
but it's the same thing you had before.
It's a degenerate rearrangement.

258
00:17:40,751 --> 00:17:43,730
It's still the primary compound.
And then you could, uh,

259
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,940
you could do the sn one
and get the product.

260
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,520
So that doesn't make any difference
that you do have math. I'd shift,

261
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,840
but suppose the Meth I'd shift
gets stuck halfway across.

262
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:56,450
Okay.

263
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,570
Suppose it stops there.
Right?

264
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:04,571
Because another way to draw that
is as protonated cyclo propane,

265
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,800
right? It's Cyclo propane that's
taken on a pro extra proton, right?

266
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,890
And that substance has been studied,
right?

267
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,900
And it's known that it's stability is
between the primary cad ion and the

268
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:22,070
secondary cad. I am. Right.
So suppose you got that,

269
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,910
what would that do? Well, uh,

270
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,740
if you could have a nucleophile
attack that, I mean,

271
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:32,450
the methyl plus is a great leaving
group, right? So you could do that.

272
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:32,931
And again,

273
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:37,910
it would still give that same product
if you had the protonated Cyclo probate

274
00:18:37,911 --> 00:18:42,860
instead of this thing doing the
alkylation. Okay. Now in fact,

275
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:48,230
Norman Dino at Penn State University
in 1968, unbeknownst to me,

276
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,720
had actually done that reaction.

277
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:56,050
He's took benzene and Cyclo propane
and reacted it with acid and got these

278
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:56,924
products

279
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,150
right.
Okay.

280
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,510
And he used deuterated deuterium here.

281
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,090
So there's deuterium in the, in
the, in this normal propyl benzene,

282
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,950
just one deuterium.

283
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,940
Now what I want you to tell me
is where you expect it to be

284
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,690
on which carbon should that do teary of B?
Which of the three carbons,

285
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,140
let's suppose that it happens by
making protonated Cyclo. Propay. Chris,

286
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:34,580
what do you say? It should be the
terminal one. Cause if you put it on here,

287
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,710
then you displaced.

288
00:19:35,711 --> 00:19:39,530
That'll be the methyl group and the
deuterium should be there. One Deuterium,

289
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,980
right? Here's what he found. Where is it?

290
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,800
Yeah.

291
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,000
Three sevenths of it is where Chris said
two sevens here and two sevens here.

292
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:53,980
It's completely scrambled, right? There
are three mouths, three hydrogens here,

293
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:56,020
two here and two here.
And that one,

294
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:59,890
deuterium is completely scrambled
among those positions, right?

295
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,150
How did it get scrambled?

296
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,770
Well this corner protonated cyclo propane,

297
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,330
very easily reorder, arranges to
edge protonated, cyclo propane,

298
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,690
and then that can become
protonated at this corner.

299
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,210
And then this edge and then this corner,
and then this edge,

300
00:20:16,211 --> 00:20:19,750
and then back to where you started.
And it does when it's that ch three,

301
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,420
it doesn't have to be the
deuterium you added that moves.

302
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:23,530
It could've been the hydrogen.

303
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,670
So everything gets scrambled very
quickly going around there. And in fact,

304
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,910
this was shown in a key experiment
by a man named Richard Baird,

305
00:20:33,401 --> 00:20:37,960
who was a assistant professor here in
this department in 1964 and that was on

306
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:42,930
the basis of that, that Dino tried
this experiment. So that explains it.

307
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,230
So it's pro, so proteinated cyclo
propane does give this compound.

308
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,060
So now we have a question.

309
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,560
Which of these is the thing that
gives the Friedel crafts product?

310
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,620
Is it an sn one sn.

311
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:01,621
Two reaction with this or
an sn one reaction that
involves the protonated cyclo

312
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:07,060
propane. And it could be either
right. And no one knows. As far as I

313
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,300
am aware,
right.

314
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:11,680
I've just been,

315
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,390
we'll do it going through the
literature in the last two days on this,

316
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:16,010
I don't think anybody knows this.

317
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,720
I tried to call professor Ola and wasn't
able to get him at the University of

318
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:24,200
southern California who got the Nobel
Prize for free to all crafts things that I

319
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:25,270
haven't been able to get him yet.

320
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:29,120
But Professor Saunders who knows a lot
about this, doesn't think he knows.

321
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,840
We'll see. Uh, but any,
I think it's not known.

322
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,030
So what I want you guys to do is
to try to think up an experiment

323
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:44,650
that can tell you whether it's the
sn two or the sn one mechanism.

324
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,103
Bye.

325
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:53,230
And I'll give you a hint. I think the
good experiments involve isotopes, right?

326
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,550
So here's a problem for you.

327
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,050
So maybe you can become famous and
know and determine the mechanism of the

328
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,610
Friedel crafts reaction after 143 years.

329
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,460
Oh, okay. Now onto the next subject,
which is carbon eel compounds.

330
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,280
Now, uh, I didn't bring the
texts, the, uh, the, uh, uh,

331
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,690
Joan's textbook along,

332
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:20,680
but the carbonyl compounds are
discussed in chapter 16 to 19,

333
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:24,370
which is 268 pages. It's about a
quarter of the textbook, I think.

334
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:27,520
And that's not a typical, you have
many other texts and you can check,

335
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:31,300
but there's a lot of stuff in there
about carbon eel compounds. Uh,

336
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,350
the good news is that almost all of it
is review because we've talked a lot

337
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:40,120
about the reactivity of carbonyl
compounds. So chapter 16,

338
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:43,690
for example, is aldehydes and ketones.
So for the rest of this lecture,

339
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:46,900
I'm just going to go over
the big view of this.

340
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,340
And then in the next lecture is we'll,

341
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,270
we'll take a more detailed
view of some of the lore. Okay.

342
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,410
So we talked about before that
the carbonyl compound is stable,

343
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:00,580
but it's reactive. Those things
we've said before seem contradictory.

344
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,900
It's that the,

345
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:05,860
you have the average bond energies we've
looked out before for the single and

346
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:09,400
double bond and for the single
and double bonds to oxygen.

347
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:14,200
And we've seen that the second bond in
carbon is very much weaker than the first

348
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:15,034
bond.

349
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,900
But the second bond for oxygen
is stronger than the first bond,

350
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,400
right? And it's not all due
to the, to the Pi bond there,

351
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:29,980
because the, it has also to do with the
change at hybridization of the carbon.

352
00:23:29,981 --> 00:23:32,380
The sigma bond changes when
you form a double bond.

353
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,840
So it's very stable compared to carbon,
carbon double bonds,

354
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:42,040
but it's also reactive
because it has a very low, uh,

355
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:47,030
Lumo the Pi Star. Okay.
Now, just a bit on the,

356
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:51,110
uh, on, uh, just to give you
something to practice with about Nmr.

357
00:23:51,111 --> 00:23:55,400
To see how people figured out chemical
shifts in an Mr. They did it by taking a

358
00:23:55,401 --> 00:24:00,290
compound, a known compound like
acid aldehyde where n is three here,

359
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,500
you'll see why I use then and
they found it had two peaks,

360
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:08,501
199.6 and 31.2 right in the CMR spectrum,

361
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,790
carbon magnetic residence.

362
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,990
And then they put another carbon on
and found peaks at those positions.

363
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,230
And then another one on and
found peaks that those positions.

364
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,630
And then they did a ketone acetone,
right. And found peaks at those positions.

365
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,540
And with one more carbon to Buton own,

366
00:24:26,541 --> 00:24:29,120
they found that and with two Penta known,

367
00:24:29,121 --> 00:24:31,940
they found that and
with three penton known,

368
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:36,941
they found that now with that
empirical evidence behind you,

369
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,940
I want you to figure out what this
is CMR spectrum is of right and,

370
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:46,520
and which peaks or which,
right.

371
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:51,140
And that's taken from that chem two 20
problems site that we've mentioned before,

372
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,430
right?
So there's a problem,

373
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:57,830
there are the values of the chemical
shifts in this proton decoupled CMR

374
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:02,360
spectrum and use the table to identify
what each of those carbons is.

375
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,020
Okay.

376
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,910
And in the process you'll figure out a
what regularities there are within this

377
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:11,540
table and how you go about
figuring out new things. Okay.

378
00:25:11,541 --> 00:25:13,520
And just to give you an extra hint,

379
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,350
here's the Proton magnetic resonance
spectrum of the same compound.

380
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,360
Notice this is 400 megahertz for protons.
It was a 100 megahertz for carbon.

381
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:28,930
That's the same magnet because the
Proton is four times as strong as carbon.

382
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,480
Okay?
And just to help you out with this,

383
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:36,890
we can blow up each of those peaks and
see what the spin spin splitting is.

384
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:39,800
And there they are with the
values of their chemical shifts.

385
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,450
And here's the scale in the for
the detail. That's 20 hertz.

386
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,600
And so this splitting here is 1.8 hertz
and the one over here is 6.8 hertz just

387
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:53,870
for reference. So there's a problem.
There are two problems for you, right?

388
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,210
Make your name by determining the Meccan
devise and experiment to prove the

389
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:04,040
mechanism of the free del crafts reaction
and figuring out what this compound is.

390
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,970
Okay. Now, so carbon eel is very stable,

391
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:11,840
but it's also paradoxically reactive.

392
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,700
And we know that's because of Pi Star
for it. We'll see other ways as well.

393
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,200
So the nucleophile comes in,

394
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:22,040
we've done this a zillion times and
we have nuclear Philly condition.

395
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:25,310
And last semester we talked about the
Borghi done its angle and all of this is

396
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:30,311
discussed in chapter 16 and you remember
this contrasts with c double bond.

397
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:33,080
See where the addition reactions are.

398
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,440
Electrophilic not nuclear filling.
Okay.

399
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,370
So then you bring a proton on
and you get an alcohol, right?

400
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,690
And especially interesting alcohols
that be discussed in chapter 16 are ones

401
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:49,140
where you form a new bond to our,

402
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,010
where the nucleophile nuclear files
an Al Kill Group, for example,

403
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,410
methyl lithium as that property.

404
00:26:55,411 --> 00:27:00,300
And we talked about that
some last semester or where
the nucleophile is h minus

405
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,530
as in lithium aluminum hydride. So here
are some sections that talk about that.

406
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,980
And again,
we'll talk more about this now,

407
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,870
a different kind of reactivity is when
one of the substituents on the carbon eel

408
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:16,830
is elite, can be a leaving
group in an sn two reaction.

409
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,090
So it's an okay an ion. Okay.
Because when you do that,

410
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:24,720
there's something else you can do at this
stage. Of course, you can reverse it.

411
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:26,670
You can bring these electrons into reform,

412
00:27:26,671 --> 00:27:29,220
the double bond and lose
the nucleophile and go back.

413
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,680
But as in sn two reactions,

414
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:36,450
you can also lose the leaving group
if it's a reasonable and ion, right?

415
00:27:36,451 --> 00:27:40,650
So you can go like this and now what
you've done is not an addition. What's,

416
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,750
what kind of reaction is this instead of

417
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,890
in addition,
what's overall Linda?

418
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,680
It's a substitution instead
of in addition, nuclear

419
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,030
Felix substitution of things
that are called acid derivatives.

420
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,640
These things,
when l is a leaving group,

421
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:01,280
when that thing is the leaving
group are called acid derivatives.

422
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,220
So it's association dissociation.

423
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:07,040
It's not like sn two where you go through,
uh,

424
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,690
pentavalent intermediate
pentavalent transition state,

425
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,830
right? This has an actual intermediate,
this has a finite lifetime,

426
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,900
so it's association and then
dissociation as an aromatic substitution.

427
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:24,320
Remember the elect electrophilic aromatic
substitution goes through a Tetra

428
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,040
Vaillant carbon.

429
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,910
Then the proton gets lost and you
have the electrified left on there.

430
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,250
And that's what's discussed in chapter 18.

431
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,870
But there are other ways to go at it too,
because the oxygen has unshared pairs,

432
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,980
so acids can attack it. So you
have an acid come in, for example,

433
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:43,250
a proton to protonate
it and get that cat ion.

434
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,650
And then you can have
electrophilic addition, right?

435
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,970
So a nucleophile then can come in in
a second step. In the previous slide,

436
00:28:52,971 --> 00:28:57,860
we had the nucleophile come in first,
right? And then brought a proton in later.

437
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,250
Now we're bringing the Proton in
first on the oxygen and bringing the

438
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:02,540
nucleophile in later.

439
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,620
So we get compounds that have
o h and a nucleophile on there.

440
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,810
Now what nuclear files can you use?

441
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:13,100
Notice that this is much easier
than for c double bond. See, uh,

442
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,840
okay. So you can have the
nuclear file can be, Ooh,

443
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,410
in which case this thing over
here is called a hydrate, right?

444
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:25,040
It's h two o added to the carbon eel.
Right?

445
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,010
And or it's sometimes called a gem dial.

446
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,430
Gem for [inaudible] for Gemini is twins,
right?

447
00:29:31,431 --> 00:29:35,570
So it's twin Oah is on there.
Okay. Or it can be oh are,

448
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:39,380
and we've already talked about that Hemi
asset towel or on the way to an asset

449
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:42,220
towel or it could be nitrogen.
And then the,

450
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,870
the equivalent of how many assets towel
for nitrogen is called a carbon ola

451
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:51,760
mean. And if you then you can unzip this
of course to go back to the carbon deal.

452
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,560
But if you have two groups on there,

453
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:57,000
you could unzip losing the other
group and keeping the nucleophile.

454
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,050
And then you have a
nucleophile double bond.

455
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:02,230
That's what the mean is a
carbon nitrogen double bond.

456
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:08,260
Or you can have a by sulfide
addition product or a CN.

457
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,430
That one's special because you
formed a new carbon carbon bond.

458
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:16,240
You're always on the lookout for things
that will form new carbon carbon bonds,

459
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:21,100
not just change the functional group.
So that's called a Cyan. Oh hydrant.

460
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,211
Hey,

461
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:27,211
so their section 16 six to 1611
or about that in the Jones book,

462
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,930
but it'll be covered in any of the,

463
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,720
all of these things will be covered
in all these textbooks. Okay. Uh,

464
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,560
now the reason, the reason this
was stable, that it was easy.

465
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:40,840
One reason it was easy to protonate that
was you have this resident structure,

466
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,070
but notice that if you have a proton
here on the carbon adjacent to the carbon

467
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:49,180
eel, that's the Alpha position.
So if you have an Alpha Proton,

468
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,590
then a nucleophile can act as a base,
right?

469
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,450
So the base can come in and take the
proton. So instead of attacking here,

470
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,770
it can attack here, right?
And generate this double bond.

471
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,970
And you remember what those
things are called? Enols. Right.

472
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,170
Okay.
So that this is an al rearrangement.

473
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:15,890
The fourth pattern of reactivity is Al
Lily Cree arrangement. Ketone to Ian.

474
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:19,270
All I, as I, as I've been going
along, I've been numbering
all the different ways.

475
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,910
Carbonells react.
Okay?

476
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,810
So now you could bring,
uh,

477
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,350
a low Lumo in here and have the
electrons and the double bond attack it.

478
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:31,240
So this is a,
this is a double bond.

479
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,110
So this is like electrophilic
addition to a double bond, right?

480
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:39,520
Except it's especially good because you
have the unshared pair on the oxygen

481
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:43,950
that can help out. And make this easy to
do that. So it's better than other, uh,

482
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,300
than other carbon carbon double bonds.

483
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,530
So the Enal is essentially
a carbon nucleophile.

484
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,220
It can attack low lumos especially easy.
Okay,

485
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:58,480
so you get something like this and
notice that after you lost the Proton,

486
00:31:58,481 --> 00:31:59,590
then what you have,

487
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,920
what you've done is to do a substitution
at the Alpha position and electrophilic

488
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:09,190
substitution at the Alpha
position of a ketone. So that's,

489
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,700
or an Aldehyde.
So that's another pattern of reactivity.

490
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:17,260
And that's chapter 19 these
reactions of enols. Okay?

491
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,510
So enols analytes and analization
a little bit from chapter 19 here.

492
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,250
Okay. So here we have this Alpha
hydrogen. We bring the base in.

493
00:32:27,251 --> 00:32:28,330
As we said last time,

494
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,930
this time we're doing it without having
first put something on the Oh right.

495
00:32:34,241 --> 00:32:36,940
And having a double. So
that, so that this is,

496
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,430
so what we've made now is an an on,

497
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:42,620
it's PKA is 19 pretty acidic.
Well,

498
00:32:42,621 --> 00:32:46,700
what's it normally for for alkanes if
you didn't have the carbon deal there?

499
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,890
Jesus, over the last
little over 50. Right?

500
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:55,880
So here we've got a 31
powers of 10 advantage.

501
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,280
So the equilibrium constant.
So that's,

502
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:03,380
that's how easy it is to make
the enal late. The an ion, right?

503
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,690
Once you have the know late with,
uh,

504
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,270
with the double bond here
and a charge on the oxygen,

505
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,200
then you can put the Proton on the
oxygen and you have an ea knoll.

506
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,580
So another number that's interesting is
the equilibrium constant between here

507
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:19,310
and here, right? So
this is for forming the,

508
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:23,930
an eye on this is for the alcoholic
rearrangement of the Proton.

509
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,310
So it's five times 10 to the minus ninth.
So it's it,

510
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,320
you're going to have very little
anal compared to the, to the, uh,

511
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:34,550
to the ketone.

512
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,240
But notice at equilibrium there'll be
in equilibrium with the same man ion,

513
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:45,840
right? Because if you lose the proton from
here, you get the same ina late and I,

514
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:48,920
and that you get from
losing the Proton here.

515
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,340
So if this is ever so much more energetic,
higher in energy than this,

516
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:59,780
then this one is going
to be unusually acidic.

517
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:03,260
It's going to be easy for
it to lose that Proton. Uh,

518
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:07,250
since the Ketone is about 11
kilocalories below the eternal,

519
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,750
the PKA of this is about 11,
right?

520
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,310
Very acidic.
Remember,

521
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,690
normal alcohols are like 16 and 17 Pka,

522
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,360
right? So this is a very, is very acidic.

523
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,040
Now let's go to if one is
good, more is better, right?

524
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,150
Put two carbon hills adjacent to
this, these, this Alpha thing.

525
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:34,151
So now both of them can stabilize it and
now the PKA is nine and the equilibrium

526
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:39,740
constant is now three. It's better
to have this than to have this,

527
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:40,491
right?

528
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:45,491
Whereas here it was a 10 to the
minus eight of this compared to this,

529
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:49,280
now it's three times as much. This
is this at equilibrium, right?

530
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,070
Notice that suddenly this
would be hydrogen bonded.

531
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:57,050
And you can imagine that the hydrogen
could shift from here to here,

532
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,240
this double bond to hear this double bond,

533
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:03,710
to hear the hydrogen could bounce back
between those two things. In fact,

534
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:06,170
it's even conceivable it
would be halfway in between.

535
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,910
And Professor Vaccaro in this lab is,

536
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,190
is doing a lot of work on that kind
of thing, compounds of that sort.

537
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:18,850
So here are the ketone is approximately
equal to the eternal because of the help

538
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:21,980
from conjugation,
right?

539
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,180
And from hydrogen bonding. Okay? Now,

540
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:29,150
if you have these double bonds in there,

541
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,990
now this compound is favored by a factor
of 10 to the 13th this Enal is 10 to

542
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:40,830
the 13th favorite at equilibrium
over this. So you got none of this.

543
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:44,370
It's all here, right?
Why? Because this one is,

544
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:46,350
so you've gained the air materiality,

545
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:51,150
that 30 kilocalories per mole that
you didn't have over here. Okay?

546
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:55,460
So the ketone is now 17
kilocalories above the enal.

547
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:59,250
Here are the ido was 11
kilocalories above the ketone.

548
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:04,320
So you have a complete range of,
of a ketone to anal.

549
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,600
The Pka of this thing here is
10 it's the same as this, right?

550
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,930
The anti and is only about 13
kilocalories per mole of a above funnel.

551
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,260
So it's very easy to lose that.
Then funnel,

552
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:22,770
if you ever get it on your skin,
Burns like fire.

553
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,770
It's just terrible because
as an organic compound,

554
00:36:25,771 --> 00:36:30,330
it dissolves in your lipids and then it's
a strong acid. So if you ever get it,

555
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:33,750
you'll know. Did you ever get
into nettles? Stinging nettles.

556
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,370
That's funnels for you. Okay. Okay.

557
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,060
And the PKA in this case is
minus three so this is very,

558
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,150
this really easily loses of Proton.

559
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,580
Okay. Now how about reactions
of carboxylic acids?

560
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,450
Okay. What patterns do we,
we we went through was that,

561
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,290
I think it was five patterns of
reactivity of carbon eel groups.

562
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,720
Now we're going to look
at the carboxylic acids,

563
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:04,860
which are in chapter 17 and see what
patterns of reactivity we're going to

564
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:08,790
expect. Well first you can get addition
just as if it were a carbonyl group.

565
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,020
So you could imagine doing that kind
of thing. And there we'll see examples,

566
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,850
right? Another possibility is
to do substitution at carbon.

567
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,380
So this is like the Oah was,
became a leaving group somehow,

568
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,640
right? And then Olr came in, so it
was like, just like the ketones.

569
00:37:26,641 --> 00:37:30,990
We said if there was a leaving group here,
here, the leaving group is o h or we,

570
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,860
or we make it into a better leaving
group somehow. Maybe by protonating it,

571
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,070
something like that.
So we can get substitution at carbon,

572
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,730
but there's another possibility
in the acid you could get,

573
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,390
you could start here and you could
do the substitution at oxygen,

574
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,610
get the same product our on our OCO,
right?

575
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:53,520
You get the same thing, but make this
bond rather than making that bond.

576
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,360
So you can have substitution at Karbon,
you can have substitution that oxygen.

577
00:37:58,470 --> 00:37:59,303
Okay.

578
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,350
And there's another possibility of course
substitution that the Alpha carbon.

579
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,830
So if you have an R,
a chair and Alpha hydrogen,

580
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:11,940
then as we saw with aldehydes and Ketones,

581
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,860
you can do a substitution there.

582
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,560
And the good news in all this is
almost all of this is review. In fact,

583
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:23,610
I should have said one thing on the
previous slide that when you have the Oah

584
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,370
and put the are odd making
the [inaudible] bond,

585
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,650
that's an Alpha substitution also,

586
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,250
it's just that it's an oxygen rather than
a carbon that has the Alpha hydrogen,

587
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,620
right?
So you can have that or on the side.

588
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,810
And the good news is very much
of this is review. For example,

589
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,320
if you look at pages seven 85 to seven 87,

590
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:47,380
section 69 to 1610,
and the Jones' book,

591
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:51,890
you'll find that it's an old favorite
of ours. So let's just conclude the, uh,

592
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,370
our here by going through that again,

593
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,770
it's the mechanism for acid
catalyzed hydrolysis of asset towel.

594
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,060
We've already done this,

595
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:06,010
but it doesn't hurt to do it again
and it's this part of the text. Okay?

596
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:09,730
So we have this asset towel and
the idea is to hydrolyze it,

597
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:14,110
to go back to an Aldehyde and how do we
do it? Do you remember acid ketalysis?

598
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:17,840
Where do we start in?
Even at home

599
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,210
was out here where it's an
acid attacks this compound,

600
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:27,770
h plus [inaudible].

601
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,210
What is it about the oxygen that
makes the h plus want to go there?

602
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:35,880
Okay,

603
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,270
so for the goal is going to be,
it's two steps.

604
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,690
First we're going to remove
orr and replace it by Oah.

605
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,920
Then we're going to remove the other
Olr and replace it by Oah. Okay?

606
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,280
So the way we do it is with h plus this
Kate tells us and we have the unshared

607
00:39:52,411 --> 00:39:56,790
pair. And we do that and we get here.
This is exactly one we went over before,

608
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:59,940
but it's the old ones are the best ones,
right?

609
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:06,300
Okay. What's going to
happen next? Uh, John,

610
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:07,134
what do you say?

611
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:12,700
[inaudible] well, the goal is

612
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,910
what are we trying to do in the first

613
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,910
sage?
John [inaudible]

614
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,590
tomorrow.
How are we going to do it?

615
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:25,670
[inaudible]

616
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,340
leave now,
right?

617
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,980
Remove Lumara wage.
What do we leave behind?

618
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,090
[inaudible] [inaudible]

619
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:48,200
where do the electrons go? It's
this bond. We're going to break.

620
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,560
Where are the electrons going to go?
Are they going to go on the Oh,

621
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,880
are they going to go on the seat?

622
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:57,160
[inaudible]

623
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,720
plus it's going to gain full,
full ownership of that pair of electron.

624
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:06,360
So it becomes r o h neutral. Right?
So what's left behind on the carbon

625
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,690
[inaudible]

626
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,050
right? The electrons went
away. So what do we draw that

627
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,590
[inaudible] och two left.
What do we draw the ch two.

628
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,280
Okay,

629
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,750
so it's going to do
that and we'll get that.

630
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:29,751
Now this if this word Aro
if it were just h say right,

631
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:34,490
that would be a crummy reaction,
right? Why does it work here?

632
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,390
What's good about that?

633
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,030
The bacon

634
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:46,040
middle is able to stabilize
those electrons. So the
thing gets unusually stable,

635
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:51,350
right? So you have that and
Bingo. Okay, so we've got,

636
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,760
we've got the first aro off.
Now we have to replace it by Oah.

637
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,670
Uh, Cassie, how are we going to do that?

638
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:04,010
How are we going to put Oh,
H on here after we took our o off

639
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,740
[inaudible] the Oh,

640
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,063
hi.
Sorry.

641
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,440
Uh, okay. So we want it, we
want to put Oah on that carbon.

642
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,813
How do we do it?

643
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,200
[inaudible]

644
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:46,970
I'm not sure what Pi's star you're
talking about. There's, there's a,

645
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,890
there's a pie here in
this resonance structure.

646
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,120
But the important thing that we have
is a vacant orbit. A lot in carbon,

647
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,500
which what?
Oxygen.

648
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:05,530
So suppose that attacks the unshared pair
on the alcohol. You form a bond here.

649
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:06,760
Now you're here,

650
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,880
right?
Let's go backwards.

651
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,270
So we're going to need something else.

652
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,460
Water each.
What would you use?

653
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,810
Water.
Water.

654
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,830
Okay.

655
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:29,390
So if you put water in that Kat Heins
unusually stable as John told us.

656
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,310
So we bring water in.

657
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,360
Now we make that bond and now we have Ooh,
there.

658
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:37,310
But we also have h is that a problem?

659
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,510
We want o h here, not h two
o no, just loose proton.

660
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:51,530
All right, so we've done
the, we've accomplished our
first step up here, right?

661
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:56,000
We have a Hemi asset towel and
we can check that one off. Okay.

662
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,370
Now we have to take the second aro
off and replace it with, with, Ooh,

663
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,420
how are we going to do that?
Nathan

664
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,980
said, tell me what do we eat? What we're
going to do? What's the first step?

665
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,730
Okay, where do we want to put the h plus
here or here? The top one. The top one.

666
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:24,710
Okay, so we removed the second one, okay.
By bringing h plus in, put it on the top.

667
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:25,663
Next

668
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:30,810
lose water

669
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,650
are, but probably lose alcohol, right? Uh,

670
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,010
to get this and now
and water.

671
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,020
No,
we don't need to add water.

672
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,940
If we wanted to put the second
one in true, I misled you, right?

673
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,380
But really where you go is here, right?
So you just lose a proton. Now you,

674
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:56,640
so you've taken the,

675
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:01,950
the key towel to a
carbonyl by way of a Hemi,

676
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,630
a towel or a Hemi Ke Tau. Uh, okay.

677
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:11,631
So the overall transformation then is
water plus asset towel acid catalyzed to

678
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:14,550
give carbon old plus two Roi ages.

679
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,940
And we wrote at different reward
at this way before. Right.

680
00:45:17,941 --> 00:45:20,130
They come together and,
and pull it apart.

681
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:25,230
And so the h two o and resolved
all three molecules. Okay.

682
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:27,270
That's how much we wanted to do today.
We made it,

683
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:32,400
we made it to the end and we're caught
up actually with where we were last year.
