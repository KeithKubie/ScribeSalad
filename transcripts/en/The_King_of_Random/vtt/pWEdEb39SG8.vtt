00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.460
It looks kind of organic doesn't it? Hey
what's up guys I hope you're feeling

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.189
hungry today because in this video we're
making pancakes

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.240
degasified pancakes. Now over the last
couple of months I've literally seen

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.870
hundreds and hundreds of requests of
people asking me to take pancake mix and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.960
put it in the vacuum chamber.
What kind of pancakes would you make if

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.930
you sucked all the air bubbles out of
them? So I randomly pulled out a comment

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.099
from Remiel Kasim who said, Grant you
have to make a pancake batter then take

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.460
out all the bubbles then cook it it
should turn out to be really [ satisfying ]

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.399
well Remiel that's what we're putting to
the test today so we can find out just

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.200
how satisfying the degasified pancake mix
really is now for this experiment today

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.020
I went down to the local grocery store
and picked up a box of this instant

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.980
pancake mix I also got a couple of eggs
some pancakes syrup as well as some milk

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.710
and some vegetable oil so to get started
I think we're just going to flip this

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.969
box over and follow the recipe on the
back to make a batch of classic pancakes

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.800
interesting side note these eggs are
from our chickens

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:10.520
♫ Instrumental Music ♫

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.259
look at those rich orange yolks

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:32.440
♫ Instrumental Music ♫

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.630
So here we are guys I just went ahead and
blended up all the ingredients as per

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.160
the instructions and this is what we've
got

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.680
a nice beautiful batch of pancake mix that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.960
should make anywhere from 10 to
14 pancakes and I even brought up the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.280
mixer just to pump a little extra air
into it as well you can see I've divided

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.890
the batter into two different batches
here one of them is going to get poured

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.829
on regularly to make a normal pancakes
the other one we're going to stick down

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.280
to the vacuum chamber and suck all the
bubbles out all right here we go vacuum

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.640
chamber versus pancake mix in 3 2 1

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:15.320
♫ Instrumental Music ♫

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.760
there are a lot of air bubbles in there.
It just keep's going

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:38.480
INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.720
now this stuff is resilient, just won't give up it just keeps
going and going

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.480
I'm on like my 30th cycle

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.030
here and I'm still going going strong
but I think we're about to defeat it

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.320
it's on its last legs here, all those air
bubbles coming up out of the bottom

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.640
sucking them out slowly cycling the
process I think we're almost at the end

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.170
maybe another 15 or 20 cycles yeah there
it is there it is

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.410
this is where we get all the air out. It
looks kind of organic doesn't, it in fact

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.790
watch this if I turn off the vacuum pump

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.120
oh that's cool yeah looks like it's
alive we're going to leave this thing

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.430
running for a few more minutes and while
we're waiting let's go ahead and make a

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:28.349
regular batch of pancake so at least we
can get those on the menu

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.490
I can hot-hot-hot whoo that is pretty
hot maybe too hot I don't know let's

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:44.890
find out
here we go pancake number one now the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.000
box says cook until the edges are dry
and then turn and cook until golden so

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.600
that's we're going to do following the
directions folks yeah I just look fairly

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.040
dry there go ahead and give it a flip

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.680
INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.990
oh I burned it! Must been too hot we'll
need to feed that to the chickens it cooked

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.840
a little bit faster than I was expecting
go with pancake number two

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.320
Okay I'm not going to burn this one

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.800
Oh bullseye!

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.810
listen to that sizzle. Oh you see all the
bubbles rising here pretty sure we're

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.940
not going to have that with the vacuum
chamber version

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.710
oh very nice getting better it's crazy
the stuff is still going it's been

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.000
running for like I don't know 6-7
minutes and it's still bubbling what the

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:11.630
heck Oh fail that was bound to happen
whoo doggie all right our first batch of

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.840
Pancakes is done. Voila! Grant the chef
in training has just made pancakes and

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.990
it's what we've got this is a regular
batch and looking at them you can see

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.520
they looks just like regular pancakes
fluffy and golden-brown let's be honest

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.280
guys I really don't know how to cook
food in the kitchen it's not what I do

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:38.840
chemicals and experiments yes food not
too much bon appetite baby all right

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.470
so they passed the test I'm not a cook but
those definitely are pancakes now let's

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.890
try the version from the vacuum chamber
we've had this thing sitting in here for

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.360
about 10 minutes let's go ahead and
release the pressure there we go

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.730
and I'm going to make this transfer
really quick here because I think

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.580
there's a reaction taking place maybe
with the baking soda and the water to

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.520
produce the bubbles itself so the faster
we can get these things in the frying

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:06.800
pan the less bubbles will appear in our
solution

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.190
one seems to be a little flatter I'm
just looking at it from the side not

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.010
making any judgments yet just looking
for observations

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.210
whoa where'd that bubble come from
there's actually bubbles coming up in

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.980
in the pancake could it be from the
water turning into steam because after

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.860
ten minutes in the vacuum chamber there
theoretically shouldn't be any bubbles

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.930
right but that right there that's quite
a few bubbles I mean that there's

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:45.940
actually a lot of bubbles it's like a
bad break out of acne and see the

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.500
comments loading up trypophobia just
going to let that cook a little bit

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.050
longer that's really interesting pattern
man that looks so crazy actually don't

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.870
want to flip it over because that's
looking really cool it's like honeycomb

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:05.280
but scary now looks like there's little
holes you get from mango worms

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.560
I have to say that right there was a very
unexpected result huh yep pretty sure I

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.560
burned the heck out of the bottom there so
look at that the whole thing turned to

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.970
bubbles. Where'd those bubbles come from
guys? They didn't come from my batter I took all

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.310
the bubbles out of the batter

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.140
yep the bubbles are coming already look
at that what the heck if I don't flip it

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:35.610
over right away it starts bubbling up
like crazy

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.280
look at those things what the heck
that's crazy they're like English

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.980
crumpets or something how's it taste?

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:56.180
it tastes very dense it's not light and
fluffy like a pancake. It tastes uhm..

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.150
almost rubbery kinda tastes like chewing
on a hardened slime if you can imagine that

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.900
appetizing right? So these results were
completely unexpected first of all these

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.750
are the pancakes that we made normally
these are normal pancakes

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.140
pancake mix from the vacuum chamber on
the other hand makes something that

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.900
looks completely different how bizarre
look at these things these are

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.480
completely different and what's really
interesting is even though we sucked out

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.380
all the air bubbles
these ones are popped with bubbles look

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:28.570
at that looks like some kind of Beehive
honeycomb

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:34.849
it's crazy look at that. Y'know whats kind of
cool about this design though all those

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:40.969
little holes will catch more syrup so
you can really load these suckers up

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:44.640
Look at the way the syrup just soaks right down into those little bubbles taste

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.560
Taste test!

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.700
Firm, a little bit crunchy lots of syrup lots of flavor definitely not bad I

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.050
mean they're not pancakes but they're
not bad vacuum chambered pancakes

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.860
they're now a thing so guys today we set
out on a mission to find out what would

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.130
happen if you tried throwing pancake mix
in a vacuum chamber and sucking out all

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.180
the bubbles would you make pancakes
without bubbles the answers that came in

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.810
response to our experiments were very
very surprising we ended up with

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.829
pancakes with more bubbles both pancakes
look relatively the same on one side but

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:29.610
you flip them over and they look
absolutely different and in a weird way

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.269
I kind of feel like we invented some new
kind of organic species I mean it's

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:37.290
delicious but it's creepy the batter
that made these pancakes sat in a vacuum

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.490
chamber for over 10 minutes extracting
all the gas so why on earth did our

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.060
pancakes come out looking like this if
you have any theories on why bubble-free

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.450
pancake mix produce pancakes with
bubbles put your thoughts in the

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.480
comments below just for fun let's go
ahead and rip one of these things in

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.610
half and take a look at the
cross-section oh wow look at that it

00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.680
almost looks like the spores of a
mushroom mushroom pancakes ha ha that's

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.959
crazy look at that it just like streaked
up it makes such an interesting looking

00:10:06.959 --> 00:10:13.680
texture let's rip the top off and Kelly
the 12 layers at the bottom definitely

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:21.260
crust here at the bottom but it's still
very firm material all the way through

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.230
so there you have it guys using a vacuum
chamber and some pancake mix from the

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.990
grocery store we've managed to make
ourselves some of the most bizarre

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.120
looking pancakes I've ever seen in my
life

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.200
I mean those really are just really
odd-looking

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.070
and a big thanks to Remiel Kasim for being one of the many people requesting this experiment

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.120
you can go ahead and check your YouTube inbox
Remiel I'm sending you 25 bucks hey thanks for

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.850
joining me for this experiment I'll be
looking for you in next one talk to you

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.040
then

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.920
I keep spilling
