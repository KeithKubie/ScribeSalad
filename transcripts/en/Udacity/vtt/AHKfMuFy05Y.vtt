00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.422
The answer is, this interval. Negative 8 to 4 with the end points included. If

00:00:06.422 --> 00:00:09.726
we look along the y axis here, we can see that any horizontal line we drew

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:13.254
going from y equals negative 8 all the way up to y equals 4, would pass through

00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:18.700
this line. In other words, all of the y values that lie between negative 8 and

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.520
4 have corresponding x values on this curve. In other words, if we get from

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.348
this value of y, 4, down to this value of y, negative 8, and of course our

00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:33.410
curve has no breaks in it. Then we must have passed through every single y

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.481
value along the way.
