00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:05.712
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: My body is so steady and
calm because your bodies are so steady.

00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:07.773
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: Being
able to teach children how

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:10.874
to manage their emotions is
actually a very important pathway

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:12.304
to intellectual learning.

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:17.045
Because if you can't manage
your feelings, it's hard to open

00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:22.437
up your brain to be able to receive the
content that you're trying to learn.

00:00:26.982 --> 00:00:30.529
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: I do a lot of
work around self-awareness,

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:40.452
being able to name emotions and
then make a choice around those.

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:43.753
You have a large range of
emotions during a school day,

00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:44.723
working with children.

00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:48.874
Some are completely joyful
and so exciting,

00:00:48.874 --> 00:00:52.015
and some are really frustrating
or incredibly disheartening.

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:53.646
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: When you talk
when I'm talking,

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.856
it feels like you're not
ready to listen to me.

00:00:56.276 --> 00:00:58.807
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: So one of the
most authentic ways for me

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:03.979
to help them expand their own vocabulary
is to use my personal experience

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:05.719
with my own emotions in the classroom.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.600
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Purpose...

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.910
&gt;&gt;Student: Purpose for writing...

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.630
&gt;&gt;Student: No. That's...

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.921
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: When people start talking

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:15.742
about other things while I'm still
giving directions, it feels frustrating

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.012
for me and I have to take a breath.

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:19.173
Catch myself and say, it's okay.

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:22.194
I'm going to try again.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:22.554
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: One

00:01:22.554 --> 00:01:27.725
of the critical features
of learning is modeling.

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:30.666
We learn by watching others.

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:37.048
In this classroom, we see the teacher
modeling her recognition of her emotions

00:01:37.648 --> 00:01:41.069
and also modeling how she deals
with them in productive ways.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.420
And that is the first step
in helping children learn

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.610
to manage their own emotions.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.970
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Big breath in.

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:50.962
Big breath out.

00:01:52.262 --> 00:01:55.543
&gt;&gt;Sydney: Like, it's
complicated, so we breathe.

00:01:55.653 --> 00:02:01.494
And that's how we-- so when we're ever
going crazy, it helps us calm down.

00:02:01.615 --> 00:02:04.185
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: It's based on
real-life information.

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:07.156
Can you make sure your body is sending
a message that you're listening to me?

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:10.257
Because it hurts my heart when you
look the other way when I'm talking.

00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:13.248
Thanks, dude. My heart 
feels much better now.

00:02:13.528 --> 00:02:16.269
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Naming my own
emotions and modeling

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.320
for the students how I can attach
a emotional vocabulary word

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.461
to how I'm feeling and then sort
of articulating how I'm processing

00:02:24.461 --> 00:02:29.352
that is a really authentic way for them
to sort of pick up that same skillset. 

00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:35.964
And for them to also see that I,
as their teacher, am a real human

00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:40.035
who is having real feelings during
the day, but I'm also doing my best

00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:43.496
to handle them in a way that is
safe and kind and productive.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:48.898
So they recognize that having big
feelings are part of being human,

00:02:48.978 --> 00:02:51.118
but being able to name
them and do something

00:02:51.118 --> 00:02:52.979
about them is really the work
we're going to do together.
