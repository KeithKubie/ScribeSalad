00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.512
Let's continue along this vein of symmetry of parabolas. Now when we were

00:00:03.512 --> 00:00:07.398
talking about linear equations, a super vital part of everything that we talked

00:00:07.398 --> 00:00:10.868
was the slope of a line. And we can find the slope of a line by taking any two

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:14.174
points along it and taking the ratio of the difference between their y

00:00:14.174 --> 00:00:18.048
coordinates to the difference between their x coordinate. We haven't however

00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:21.830
considered this slope of a curve yet of a graph of anything that isn't just a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.818
straight line. This may seem a little bit funny to think about but I think its

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:29.950
pretty important. There is a single sub that applies to every single point along

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.819
this curve. But we can talk about slope any local sense. Its pretty easy to see

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:37.663
what the slope of a single part of the curve is by picking a point on the line,

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:41.569
let's say this one and drawing a line that just touches the curve at that point

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:45.607
and has the same slope as the curve does right there. So for every point on a

00:00:45.607 --> 00:00:49.699
curve we can say that there is a line tangent to that point, that has the same

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.900
slope as the curve at that point and barely touches the curve right there. So

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.743
it's actually really hard to draw an exact tangent line, but this is a pretty

00:00:57.743 --> 00:01:01.951
good approximation. We pick two points that are infinitesimally far away from

00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:05.794
this point or in other words two points that are as close as we can possibly

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:09.948
pick, to this point that we're interested in. We can draw the line connecting

00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:14.326
those two points and then extend that line, tend up with the tangent line. Now

00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:18.814
you have to wait for calculus to get a really deep and rigorous understanding of

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:23.166
tangent lines, but they're still really useful for us for understanding the

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:27.540
shapes of parabolas and of other curves as well. So now I've drawn 3 different

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.986
lines that are tangent to 3 different points on this parabola. I've labelled

00:01:31.986 --> 00:01:36.186
them A, B and C and for each of those, I'd like you to tell me what the sign of

00:01:36.186 --> 00:01:40.577
the slope of the line is. Is it positive, negative, or 0? Check the proper box

00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:41.419
for each line.
