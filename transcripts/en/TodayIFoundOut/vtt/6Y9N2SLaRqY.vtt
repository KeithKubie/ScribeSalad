00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.630
When asked, “What do you want to be when
you grow up,” most children reply with the

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.770
standard, “firefighter, police officer,
teacher”.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:16.070
Some go less traditional with “circus performer,
singer or professional athlete”.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.150
I have yet to hear a child answer with “professional
farter”; yet believe it or not, this is

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.700
actually the way a select few in the world
have or currently do make their living.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.940
Professional farters are also referred to
as flatulists or fartists, putting the “art”

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.390
in “fart”.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.630
Paul Oldfield, better known as “Mr. Methane”,
claims to currently be the only performing

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.210
professional farter in the world.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.930
But this article isn’t about Paul, it’s
about the man who inspired him, the amazing

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.430
Joseph Pujol.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.430
Young Joseph Pujol, who went on to become
a world famous farter known as “Le Pétomane”

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.430
(his stage name comes from the French verb
“péter” combined with the suffix “mane”

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.430
meaning “maniac” which literally means
“fartomaniac”), discovered his unusual

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.430
talent quite by accident.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.270
What was supposed to be a typical swim in
the sea for the young Joseph, turned out to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.739
be a life-changing experience.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.699
While preparing to dive under the water, Joseph
drew air into his lungs by taking a deep breath

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.739
– but air wasn’t the only thing he drew
into his body.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.200
As he inhaled, he felt icy, cold sea water
flowing up his rear end.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.300
In response to this most unusual occurrence,
young Joseph walked onto shore, only to discover

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.540
large amounts of sea water exiting his behind.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.109
Knowing this was not normal, Joseph consulted
with a doctor who assured him there was nothing

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:23.460
medically wrong with him.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.609
Fascinated by an ability that no other boys
his age had, Joseph decided to explore his

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.490
unusual talent and discovered that by contracting
his abdominal muscles he could suck large

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.149
volumes of water up his rectum and expel it
with great force.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.149
No enema required!

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.979
Impressed by this humorous ability, Joseph
continued to experiment and discovered that

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.360
water wasn’t the only thing he could draw
up into his backside.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.069
Joseph discovered that he could “inhale”
and “exhale” air through his rectum as

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:48.069
well.

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:53.659
In 1892, Dr. Marcel Baudouin actually measured
how much Pujol could “inhale” anally-

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.450
as much as two quarts of air!

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.640
The best part about this discovery was the
noise he could make while expelling the air.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.259
Not only could he make a noise, he could vary
the noises by controlling the speed and force

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.520
of the expulsion of air, producing musical
notes.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.540
He taught himself musical tunes and soon mastered
them.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.540
It is a common misconception that Joseph passed
intestinal gas during his performances.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.540
His farts were merely rectal air passed in
and out in a very controlled manner.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.280
It was in the army that the already aptly
named Joseph Pujol was given his nickname

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.220
“Le Pétomane”.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.700
He entertained his fellow soldiers first with
his water trick and then with the songs he

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.790
played through his “magical flute”.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.480
Joseph had always enjoyed performing but for
now he saved his fartist act for close friends

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.480
and family.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.480
In public, he performed only on his trombone.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
After his service in the army, Joseph, an
apprenticed baker, returned to Marseilles,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.560
which is where he was born on June 1, 1857,
to attempt a living as a baker in his own

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.560
bakeshop.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.100
He was said to make the some of the finest
bran muffins in the South of France.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.730
In fact, the street on which he sold these
muffins now bears his name, “rue Pujol”.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.400
It was in his bakeshop that he began to test
the public’s reception of his other talent.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.950
He would sometimes imitate musical instruments
using his rectal air and tell customers that

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.570
he was playing them behind the counter.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.350
It was only at the encouragement of friends
that Joseph took his unusual musical act to

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.350
the stage.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.000
He first performed at the Boulevard Chavre
in 1887 at the age of 30, and continued performing

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.430
all over France with immediate success everywhere
he went.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.120
When he went to Paris in 1892, he insisted
on seeing M Vidler, the director of Moulin

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.720
Rouge and convinced him to let him perform.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.320
He was a success there from day 1.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.350
According to John Barber, who wrote a piece
for The Stage in May of 1997,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.450
He took the stage in a costume of red coat,
a red silk collar and black satin breeches.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.430
He began by explaining each impersonation
that was to follow.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.710
This is a little girl… this is a bride on
her wedding night (small noise) … the morning

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.140
after (loud rasping noise) … a dressmaker
tearing calico (ten seconds of ripping cloth)

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.620
… and this a cannon (loud thunder).

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.260
The audience were at first astounded.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.640
Then there would be an uncontrollable laugh,
followed by more until the whole audience

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.150
was wriggling in their seats, convulsed.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.690
Women, bound rigid in corsets, were escorted
from the hall by nurses, cleverly placed by

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.460
the manager so that they could he seen in
their bright white uniforms.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.890
After signing with Moulin Rouge, Joseph moved
his wife and children to Paris.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.490
Their first child was born in 1885 and then
they had a child every two years for the next

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.720
eighteen years.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.700
Riding the success and interest in his talents,
Joseph embarked on a very successful tour

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.970
throughout Europe and North Africa.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.970
In 1894, the managers of the Moulin Rouge
fined Joseph 3,000 francs for an impromptu

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:08.970
performance he gave to help a friend who was
struggling financially.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.970
This caused Joseph to part ways with the company.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.420
He opened his own company called Theatre Pompadour
which included mime, magic and other variety

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.009
acts performed by his family and performer
friends.

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.630
He continued to be the star attraction there
until World War I broke out.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.949
Four if his sons went off to fight in the
war.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.759
One was taken prisoner and two became invalids.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.620
This shattered the lovable family man so much
he had no desire to perform anymore.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.810
So he and his family moved back to Marseilles
where he and his sons and unmarried daughters

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.810
ran bakeries.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.120
In 1922, the family moved to Toulon.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.539
There, Joseph set up a biscuit factory for
his children to manage.

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.040
This is where his wife died in 1930 and he
died in 1945.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.699
After his death, a medical school offered
the family 25,000 francs to be able to study

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.710
his body, but not one of his children would
let them.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.860
His eldest son Louis is quoted as saying,
“there are some things in this life which

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.659
simply must be treated with reverence.”

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:21.029
Apparently Pujol’s sphincter is one of them.
