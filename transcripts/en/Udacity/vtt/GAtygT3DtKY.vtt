00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.510
In this lesson we discussed
the interplay between the geometry

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.410
of intersecting flat or
linear objects in space and

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.660
the algebra of solving
systems of linear equations.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.860
We then use the geometric insight
into the algebraic process to develop

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.090
an algorithm, the Gaussian elimination
algorithm, for solving systems of

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.690
an arbitrary number of linear equations
in an arbitrary number of variables.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.600
This is a valuable tool, since it let's
us solve a large class of interesting

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.800
problems that come up often
in science and engineering.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.320
In future lessons,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.660
we will develop vector algebra more
systematically looking at the problem

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.650
of solving systems of equations
in a different light.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.000
As questions about physical
transformations of space.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.050
We will then use this new insight to
develop more tools for solving problems.
