00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.000
PROFESSOR: So a couple
of announcements.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.870
Weekly quiz Tuesday.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.450
And also on Tuesday, I want to
draw your attention to the

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.050
event in the slide.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.340
We have a poster here for a
lecture that will occur right

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.470
in this room, at 4:00
on Tuesday.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.260
And it's entitled the
Wolf Lecture.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.480
The Wolf Lecture was established
here about 30

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.550
years ago in honor of
Professor John Wolf.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.370
John Wolf was an antecedent
of mine.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.760
He was the person that
invented 3091.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.550
And in 1961, he dared, as a
metallurgist, to launch a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.420
variant of freshman chemistry.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.590
And you're the beneficiaries
of John Wolf's initiative.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.370
And he also was a spectacular
teacher, quite a showman.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.255
And in his honor, they
instituted in the Department

00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:16.770
of Material Science and
Engineering, the Wolf Lecture,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.360
which, as the poster says, is
the entire community is

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.670
invited to attend, but it's
geared towards freshman.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.340
So this is a lecture
that the rules are.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.490
Talk about whatever you want in
terms of material science

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.420
and engineering, but make it
entertaining, and make it

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.650
engaging and accessible
to freshmen.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.790
You should go to lectures.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.550
If you can't go to this
one, then by all

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.820
means, go to other seminars.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.150
If all you do when you come to
MIT is go to class, you're

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.240
missing out on some of
the richness here.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.800
We have all sorts of people
coming through here every day.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.210
And you can go to these
seminars, you can learn a lot.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.600
You might say, well, I'm just
a freshman, I'm not going to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.660
understand everything.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.490
I go to these things.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.070
I don't understand everything.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.300
But I learn something, because
the first few minutes of the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.320
lecture, if the speaker is any
good, he or she is going to

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.650
set up the topic for you.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.850
If you follow the first five
minutes, you'll have something

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.630
that, you know, gets you
oriented to the topic.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.040
And then the other thing, the
other reason to go-- you see

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.380
this on the poster--

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.960
room 10-250, reception
immediately following.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.650
That means there will
be refreshments!

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.020
Food, for that, you know,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.700
pick-me-up in the late afternoon.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.330
So you go to the seminar, you
know, sometimes they have

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.810
refreshments before
the speaker.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.830
I'm not going to tell you have
to go into the seminar, having

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.870
eaten the food and partaken
of the refreshments.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.970
You didn't hear me say that.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.420
But anyways, there's always
food around here.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.440
Go to this one.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.350
I think you'll enjoy it.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.610
And the speaker is Professor
Michael Rubner.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.320
He's a faculty member
in course 3.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.350
An excellent teacher.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.190
As you see, MacVicar Faculty
Fellow, which means he's been

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.680
acknowledged as a
good teacher.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.340
I think you'll learn a lot.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.780
And he's talking about
nature-inspired, so

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.270
biomimetics, how we see things
in nature and then mimic that

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.520
design in advanced
material science.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.990
OK.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.930
Enough said.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.300
Let's get on with the lesson.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.420
Last day we started looking at
solutions, and we recognized

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.450
that bonding is the key to
understanding, and it's

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.130
encapsulated in that catch-all
phrase, like dissolves like.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.240
And towards the end, we talked
about Ksp as a metric that

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.780
helps us understand
common ion effect.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.780
Common ion effect, again, if I
tell you you have, say, 100

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.785
units of sodium chloride that
can go into solution, you

00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:36.610
would say, that's the
solubility limit.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.960
But then if I tell you, I've
got a solution that already

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.540
contains 25 units of sodium
chloride, that's a no-brainer.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.820
You've only got another
75 units to go.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.470
Now I say I've got potassium
chloride in there.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.330
So now you stop and think,
wait a minute.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.190
It's not sodium chloride,
but it is a chloride.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.760
How do I think about this?

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.660
Common ion effect through Ksp
helps you reason through it.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.440
It's when you have more than
one solute, and one of the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.550
constituents of the solute
is already present.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.450
So today I want to talk about a
subset of solutions, and in

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.410
particular, I want to talk
about acids and bases.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.230
And this is important, not only
in materials processing,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.747
but we're going to have to
understand this if we're going

00:04:13.747 --> 00:04:17.040
to go forward later and talk
about biochemistry.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.100
So, you know, they're around
us everywhere.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.060
You know, you probably got up
this morning, you washed your

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.980
hair with a pH-balanced shampoo,
maybe had orange

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.460
juice or grapefruit juice with
citric and ascorbic acid.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.600
Your radio is powered by zinc
alkaline batteries.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.400
I started my car, it's got the
lead acid battery in it, and

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.450
electricity for all my
appliances came from

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.020
coal-fired power plants,
spewing out SO2,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.590
turning out acid rain.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.580
So we're off to a good start!

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.260
It's Friday.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.000
So now we want to go
back and understand

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.230
this from the beginning.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.135
So we're going to start
with a history lesson.

00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:51.520
And the history lesson starts
in ancient times.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.350
Acids were known all the way
back in early times for

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.856
processing of food
and materials.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.530
So who among us hasn't
eaten something

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.600
that has been pickled?

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.130
Pickle means to have been
processed in acid solution.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.890
In fact, the word acid comes
from the word acidus in Latin,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.265
and acidus means either
sour or tart.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.360
But the modern chemistry of
acids and bases starts with

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.475
Lavoisier in France in 1779.

00:05:38.475 --> 00:05:42.260
And I'm going to be naming many
scientists from different

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.180
countries today, so I'm
going to use the

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.800
international symbol.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.310
You know, these ovals that you
put on the back of the car, so

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.360
now if you see a car with
this on it, you know

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.970
it's a French registry.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.140
So he's probably got a Peugeot,
and he's driving

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.500
around with his Peugeot.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.640
And what Lavoisier said, in
trying to understand acids and

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.680
bases, is--

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.290
it's a really interesting
story.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.997
He said that oxygen is
present in all acids.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.780
And why?

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.500
Because he spent most of his
career studying combustion, so

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.510
he was very concerned
about oxygen.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.240
And the interesting thing is
that oxygen, the name of the

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.920
gas, oxygen, actually comes
from the greek oxy, which

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.380
means sharp, and, you know,
the particle gen, as in to

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.290
generate or to be born.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.540
OK?

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.540
So it's interesting that this
gas is named incorrectly.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:55.110
It's named for an attribute that
is ascribed to acid, and

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.210
it's wrong.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.710
And it's in other
languages, too.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.890
The word oxygen translates
into other languages as

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.340
meaning something sharp, and it
has nothing to do with it.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.500
But while we're on the topic
of Lavoisier, Lavoisier did

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.030
study oxygen.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:15.620
And there was an intense rivalry
between Lavoisier in

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:21.950
France, Joseph Priestley
in Britain,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.000
and Scheele in Sweden.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.460
And all three of them were
working simultaneously to

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.680
study combustion and
understand oxygen.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.970
And here I've got a
very nice image.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.290
This is a portrait of Lavoisier
with his wife.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.440
And it's hard to see.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.460
If the lights were a little
bit dimmer, you'd see--

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.540
notice here, you see all of
this chemical apparatus.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:53.400
There is bell jars, and various
glass apparatus.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.270
His wife was his partner
in the laboratory.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.350
She was unique among
French women in

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.920
that she read English.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.600
And in his rivalry with
Priestley, he relied on his

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.660
wife in order to read
Priestley's writings.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.530
So they worked together.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.960
She even helped him
in the laboratory.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.020
They married at the time he
was 27 and she was 13, and

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:17.720
they were--

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.960
what are you so shocked about?

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.650
It's France, and it's 1779!

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:24.580
Get over it!

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.720
Anyways, she helped him a lot,
and we'll say a little bit

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.590
more about that later.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:32.930
OK.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.370
So now let's go on to the next
part of the history lesson.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.740
So so far, we've got one
explanation, and it's wrong.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.340
So let's go to the next one,
and we'll go to Britain.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:47.230
Sir Humphry Davy in
London in 1810.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.240
So we'll put GB here, and he's
driving around in his little

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.740
Jaguar, I suspect.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.560
And he said something
that was correct.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.000
He said that it's hydrogen
present in all acids.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.750
And that was pretty much it.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.290
He was a great scientist, did
some very good work, but

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.450
really didn't do anything
quantitative here.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.600
So for the quantitative stuff,
we have to wait for almost the

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.980
end of the century.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.240
And we go up to Sweden
again, to Arrhenius.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.590
And Arrhenius, in 1887--

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.300
so I'll give him a Volvo.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.750
And he said that the acid is a
substance that disassociates

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.740
to produce protons.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:37.940
So the acid is defined as a
solution that dissociates to

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.410
give protons.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.540
I'm going to say H plus, meaning
the hydrogen ion, or P

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:47.770
plus, and we're going to keep
using the term proton.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:50.560
I'm not going to say hydrogen
ion, I'm going to say proton.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.890
So proton in solution.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:53.370
So this is what he defines.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.270
And he further defines
the base.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.800
He defines the base as the
complement to the acid.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.420
And he says that the base is
something that dissociates to

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.360
give us hydroxyl.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:12.380
The base dissociates to give
OH minus the hydroxyl.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.220
And so now we've got this whole
concept of electrolytic

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.530
disassociation, which is what
wins him the Nobel prize in

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.690
1903 for this thing.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.800
And then we saw last day how the
addition of ions to water

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.050
gives charge carriers.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:33.350
And so the presence of protons
and hydroxyl is, in fact, the

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.350
way we have any charge carried
through water.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.450
So up until now, when I said
electrical conductivity, we

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.830
were pretty much referring to
electronic conductivity.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.740
But there's a second kind of
conductivity, and we can have

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.500
ionic conductivity.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.900
Ionic conductivity, as the
name implies, is not by

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.730
electrons, but by ions.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.915
And this is typically
ions in solution.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.820
Ionic conductivity in solution,
and a solution that

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.165
is an ionic conductor is
called an electrolyte.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.740
So we have electrolyte
in our bodies,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.290
saline, about 5% chloride.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.730
We have electrolyte in batteries
that are ionically

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.930
conductive.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:23.160
And the term simply means, we
have conduction by ions.

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:27.390
And so it was the theory of
electrolytic dissociation that

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.030
won the Nobel prize.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.260
So how does this work?

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.230
So we can start with something
like HCl gas.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.540
I'm going to dissolve it in
water, and this will give me

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.155
proton, H plus.

00:11:41.155 --> 00:11:44.940
And I'm going to write aq,
meaning that it's dissolved in

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:50.120
water, and the chloride ion,
also dissolved in water.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.920
And so this gives me an acid.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.130
This is a proton donor.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.030
And now let's look at

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:58.380
something like sodium hydroxide.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.800
Sodium hydroxide at room
temperature is an ionic

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.440
compound, so it is a solid, but
it is soluble in a polar,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:13.420
hydrogen-bonded liquid, so H20,
to give hydroxyl aqueous

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.700
plus sodium ion aqueous.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:19.270
So again, we see the
dissociation.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.800
And then we can have,
from here, a

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.240
neutralization reaction.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.740
And the neutralization
reaction is simply

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.520
reconstitution of the solvent.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.870
So neutralization, another way
to think about it, because

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.300
we're not going to be confined
to water by the end of the

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.340
lecture, neutralization is
simply a reaction that results

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:44.230
in reconstitution
of the solvents.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.330
So the solvent, in this
case, is water.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.260
So how would we reconstitute
water?

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.520
We combine proton
with hydroxyl.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.110
So let's do that and see the
result of that reaction.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:13:00.360
So if I take, and run it in the
vertical direction, proton

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.130
plus hydroxyl, we'll
give water again--

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.580
let's give H20 liquid--

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.080
and now you can see Na
plus Cl will give me

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.310
NaCl, aqueous dissolved.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.590
So this is what you probably
learned in your high school

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:21.230
chemistry, that acid plus base
ca give you salt plus water.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.910
So you see all of this resulting
from just the simple

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.640
Arrhenius definition.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.580
So this is good.

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.800
We've got off to a decent start
here with Arrhenius.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.470
But then the theory has its
limitations, as they all do.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.420
And how do we discover
the limitations?

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.860
With some new data.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:39.460
So let's look at some data.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:45.950
So it had been known for a long
time that ammonia, when

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.950
it's dissolved in water, can act
as a solution capable of

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.840
neutralizing an acid.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.780
So if ammonia dissolved in water
neutralizes an acid,

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.845
then this must be a base.

00:13:56.845 --> 00:13:59.290
But look, there's no
hydroxyl here.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.910
So the Arrhenius definition
of base is inadequate

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.630
to account for this.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.910
So let's just get that down.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.750
Ammonia, which you know is a gas
at room temperature, will

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:15.520
neutralize acids.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.020
But no hydroxyl present.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:24.980
So something's going on here
that we can't account for by

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.950
the simple Arrhenius
definition.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.020
So to get us out of this
conundrum, we had to wait

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.410
until 1923.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:34.620
And two scientists
simultaneously enunciated the

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.560
same ideas.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.640
So I'm going to put
them both down.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.680
1923.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:44.850
Bronsted, who was in Denmark,
and Lowry, who was

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.800
working in the UK.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.830
Also 1923.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.380
And I'll give him a
Jaguar as well.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.540
And so the two of them proposed
a broader definition

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.790
to account for what's
going on here.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:59.710
And what did they say?

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.640
They said that acid--

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.630
they'll keep the same definition
as Arrhenius.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.280
So an acid is going to
be a proton donor.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.300
So that's good.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:14.780
Let's even put here,
same as Arrhenius.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.830
But now here's the difference.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.500
The base is no longer confined
to hydroxyl chemistry.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.710
They call it a proton
acceptor.

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.970
And that's different.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:35.530
So hydroxyl-free.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.470
Now, let's be careful here.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.630
If I propose this new
definition, I

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.970
can't throw out hydroxyl.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.990
So you've got to watch to make
sure that by broadening the

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.030
definition, we don't
exclude hydroxyl.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.650
So the theory has to encompass
what we already know, and then

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.350
continue to encompass things
that tend to contradict what

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.060
we already know.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.540
So let's take a look at
what this gives us.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:01.750
So I'm going to write a
broader equation here.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:06.180
I'm going to write
this as the acid.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.290
So what do I have?

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:10.180
I have every acid has
to have a proton in

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.100
it, plus some residual.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.380
So I can rewrite the
acid in this form.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.990
I'm going to react
it with a base.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.300
So according to this definition,
this has to be a

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:23.170
proton donor.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.060
And this, you're going to
watch me on this one.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.390
This is going to be
a proton acceptor.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.690
And we'll put some
identities here.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.520
Eventually we're going to write
this with ammonia in it,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.850
but let's just do the
broad definition.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.200
So what happens is, if this is
a proton acceptor, on this

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.820
side of the equation, it takes
the proton from here.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.010
This is the proton donor.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:45.130
It gives it away, and we
end up with a BH plus.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.400
So this proton acceptor has
accepted the proton, leaving

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.660
behind the deprotonated
A minus.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.260
That's a nice little reaction.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.850
But now, if you'd nodded off for
the last 90 seconds, and

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.010
then opened your eyes and said,
well, he said acid is a

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.460
proton donor, this thing
can give up a proton.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.090
So OK, I'm going to call this
thing a proton donor.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.410
And this is most certainly
a proton acceptor.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.660
Look, it has accepted
the proton.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.890
So this is going to be
a proton acceptor.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.050
So now I've got in this equation
two proton donors and

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.910
two proton acceptors.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.160
And they're linked.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.660
This proton donor, BH plus,
is linked to B.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.360
So I'm going to put a little
yolk over this one.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.200
And this HA, the original
acid, is linked to

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.630
this base, A minus.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.425
So I'm going to put
a yoke over that.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:47.730
And the Latin word for yoke, to
yoke, is jugere, from which

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:50.350
we get the word conjugate.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:52.560
So I'm going to call
these things

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.665
conjugate acid-base pairs.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.770
And every equation has two.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.840
Because you've got a proton
donor proton acceptor.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.130
So now this is, follow
the bouncing ball.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.880
If you want to understand
acid-base chemistry, just

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.950
follow the proton.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.100
Here's proton here,
goes over here.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.980
Here's something deprotonated,
now it's protonated.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.130
That's the rhythm here.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:27.250
So the whole thing is, acid-base
reactions can be

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.965
defined as a proton transfer
reactions.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.590
Remember we talked about
ionicity and electron transfer

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.090
in order to achieve
octet stability?

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:42.140
So we saw the whole
life and times of

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.600
electron transfer reactions.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.470
Now life and times of proton
transfer reactions.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.840
OK.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.710
And last thing I want to do, is
to just make sure that we

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:52.360
see the definitions.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.870
You know, all queens are female,
but not all females

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:56.950
are queens.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.200
So this one here, what's this?

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.840
This is definitely, it's
a proton donor.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.990
So it's an acid.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.350
So it's definitely an Arrhenius
acid, because it's

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:11.850
got a proton, and it's also
a Bronsted-Lowry acid.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.270
Now, what about this one?

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.510
This is a base.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.690
It may not have hydroxyl
in it.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:18.670
May or may not.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.580
So this is definitely a
Bronsted-Lowry base, but I

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.730
can't say for sure that it's
an Arrhenius base, because

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:28.100
Arrhenius has to be O minus.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.460
This one here, what
about this?

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.310
Unless it's OH minus, this
one here is, what?

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:36.950
It's Bronsted-Lowry base.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:41.010
And this one here, this can be
both Bronsted-Lowry acid and

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.070
it can be an Arrhenius acid.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.940
So this is how we can
differentiate them.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.400
OK, good.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.920
Now let's go to the ammonia, see
if we've got ourselves out

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.330
of the conundrum so we
can write now NH3.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.920
And I'm going to say that
this is ammonia

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.320
that's already dissolved.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.020
So ammonia is already in aqueous
solution, and it

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:10.170
reacts with water, H20
liquid, to do what?

00:20:10.170 --> 00:20:12.250
This is supposed to be a--

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:16.390
if this is a base, remember,
this is the thing that we're

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.390
trying to demonstrate.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.180
If it's a base, according to
this, it's a proton acceptor.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.920
So I'm going to stick a proton
on this, and I'm going to get

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:26.450
NH4 plus the ammonium ion.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.940
And how did I get the
ammonium ion?

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:36.950
I took a proton from water,
leaving behind OH.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.480
So can you see that how
this thing works?

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.430
By gobbling up protons, by
becoming a proton vacuum

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:48.020
cleaner, it takes protons
out of water, leaving

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.630
an excess of hydroxyl.

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.710
And in effect, now we've got
something that's tantamount to

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.030
an Arrhenius base.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.930
But it all started
off with this.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.760
So now we can link these two.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.300
I'm going to yoke ammonium
and ammonia as conjugate

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.280
acid-base, and there is
water and hydroxyl

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.850
as acid-base pairs.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.770
So again, let's get
the colors going.

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.460
Here we've got Bronsted-Lowry--

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.380
the bases are always going
to be in blue.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.340
Blue and base both begin
with the letter B.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.950
So this is definitely
Brosted-Lowry base, but it's

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.110
not an Arrhenius base.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.100
This is a Bronsted-Lowry
base, and it's also

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:28.570
an Arrhenius base.

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:31.160
This one here, we can
call this one--

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.000
in this case, it's a proton
donor, so it's both an

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.880
Arrhenius acid and a
Bronsted-Lowry acid.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.760
But look at this.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.740
You'd say, OK, I know
what he's doing.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.760
Arrheius, Bronsted-Lowry,
Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.170
This is Bronsted-Lowry
only, this must be

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:48.420
Bronsted-Lowry only.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.070
But look!

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.540
This is a proton donor.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.100
It dissociates to
give protons.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.420
So this is both Bronsted-Lowry
and Arrhenius.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.640
Most people will miss that.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.410
We'll get to see, maybe, on a
subsequent celebration, how

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.370
many of you miss that.

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:05.680
OK.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.330
So.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.570
So now, let's go into
the chemistry here.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.730
Because I said up here at the
beginning of the lecture--

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.740
what is it-- bonding is the
key to understanding.

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.030
So what is it about bonding
here that defines the

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.310
Bronsted-Lowry base?

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:23.240
So I'm going to write this
reaction in this way, now.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.810
I'm going to put-- here's
the proton, which

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.220
is coming from water.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.290
And I'm going to write
that with NH3.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.610
I'm going to use the
Lewis structure.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.730
So, you know, Lewis structure
looks like this, Nitrate has

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:39.380
got five valence electrons,
three of them are bound, and

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.010
now I've got this long pair.

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:45.580
So what do we know about
the electronic

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.960
structure of proton?

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.770
What does it look like?

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.020
What's the Lewis structure
of proton?

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.480
How many electrons on proton?

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:54.900
None.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.680
This is nothing.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.520
This is very needy.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.910
It's like the neediest friend
you have. You know, the one

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.530
that's always taking stuff
from you, taking your

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:08.950
emotional energy, giving
back nothing?

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.180
That's proton.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.100
That's the human equivalent
of proton.

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:17.310
So if proton wants to make a
bond to form NH4, proton is

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:22.590
going to come over here and
exploit both electrons.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:26.700
So if this is going to be a
proton acceptor, the only way

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.000
it can be a proton acceptor
is to have two

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.130
unused electrons available.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.520
This is going to be a
dative bond, agreed?

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.450
Dative, because both electrons
from the bond

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:38.780
come from the nitrogen.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.510
The proton doesn't contribute
anything.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:43.060
So that's the hallmark.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:49.900
The proton acceptor
axiomatically must have an

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:53.480
available non-bonding pair.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:59.660
So wherever you see non-bonding
pairs, wherever

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:03.010
you see a compound that has
this capability, it could

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:07.870
serve as a Bronsted-Lowry
base.

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:12.140
We know that water, because it
has hydroxyl in it, has to

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:12.910
satisfy this.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:13.970
So let's take a look.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.940
H20 we can do similarly.

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.190
Oxygen.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.050
It's got 6 electrons, 2 are in
the, bonds and we have 2

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:22.520
non-bonding pairs.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.380
So then when we attach
proton here, we make

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.050
something called hydronium.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.390
We make hydronium ion.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.750
So it's a little fancier than
just saying, I've got this

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.960
naked proton with no electrons
swimming around in water.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.340
In fact, it's more coordinated
like this.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.180
H30 plus, and while we're
in the neighborhood, we

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:44.870
might as well show.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:46.930
This is sp3 hybridized.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:51.190
We've got one, two, three,
four orbitals.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.560
Hydrogen's on three.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.180
It's got a net charge of
plus 1, and lone pair

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.620
on the fourth side.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.680
So there's the structure
of hydronium.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.310
And we can now write
the equation.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:14.050
We can say H20 liquid plus
H20 liquid gives me H3O

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:18.520
plus, plus OH minus.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.520
So this is now the
self-ionization or

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.720
self-dissociation reaction.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.520
So now I can pair
these as well.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.540
I can yoke these.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.890
I have acid-base pair.

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:36.100
So this is acid here, and the
conjugate base is water, H20.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.180
Hydroxyl, we know, has
to be a base, and its

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.720
conjugate acid is water.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.100
So you see, in the same
equation, same place, same

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.340
time, water is acting as both
acid and base relative to

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.440
these two species.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:55.080
And so we call such a such a
compound that acts as both

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.360
acid and base, we call
it amphipathic.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:04.310
Has two moods.

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:06.082
You know, amphi, like
in amphitheater.

00:26:06.082 --> 00:26:07.870
Have you ever seen
a Roman theater?

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:09.575
It looks like this from
the top down.

00:26:09.575 --> 00:26:12.410
It's got all this, you know,
like this, and all the people

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.690
are here, and there's
the stage up here.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:22.440
But if I make a theater in the
round, that is amphitheater.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.120
Or as it's commonly
mispronounced, ampitheater.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.750
3091ers do not say ampitheater,
they say

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:29.810
amphitheater.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.130
So this reaction here is
self-dissociation.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:33.400
Right?

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:38.300
This reaction is
self-dissociation of water.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.980
Or because we're forming
ions, it's also called

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.230
self-ionization.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.110
Self-dissociation or
self-ionization of water.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:55.710
Now, turns out that the
chemical's power of H3O plus

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:57.620
and OH minus is very high.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.350
So this reaction doesn't go
very far to the right.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.690
The amount of the dissociation
is tiny, and to be specific,

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:09.790
at 25 degrees C, the amount
of, if you take deionized,

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:13.530
deaerated water, absolutely
pure and pristine.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:18.120
The amount of native H30 plus
and OH minus is on the order

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.020
of one part in 10 million.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.520
So H3O plus concentration
would be 10

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.910
to the minus 7 molar.

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.810
And obviously, from the
stoichiometry of the equation,

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:34.910
you get the identical
amount of OH minus.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.740
Well, that's in the
self-dissociation.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.490
And so you have very, very few
charge carriers, which is why

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:46.090
high-purity water is a very poor
conductor of electricity,

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.140
even as an electrolyte.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.550
And that's, I've told you in
the past, that could be one

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.390
indicator of certain toxins.

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.550
If you measure the conductivity
of water and you

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:57.390
discover it's abnormally high,
and it's putatively supposed

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.460
to be pure water, that's
an indication that

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:01.320
it's not pure water.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.380
There's some other charge
carriers present.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.880
So we can write a
Ksp we analogy.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.200
And it's called the water
ionization constant, which is

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.700
the product H3O plus
and OH minus.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.680
And you can do the math.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.480
That's 10 to the minus
14 is the product.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:27.310
And you can use the common
ion effect here.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.960
If I introduce some other
acid, look at how this

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.670
equation helps you the same
way that Ksp did.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:36.460
If I have acid, in other words,
protons donated from

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.180
some other source, that means
this number is going to be

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.000
higher than 10 to the minus 7.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.470
If this number is higher than
10 to the minus 7, and the

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:47.200
product must be 10 to the minus
14, this must be lower.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.950
So when I have, H3O plus goes
up, then OH minus must go

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.650
down, and under these
circumstances, we have

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:58.960
something that is called
proton-rich.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.240
And we call this acid, simply
because the proton

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.370
concentration exceeds
the hydroxyl.

00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.630
And likewise for the other.

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:15.480
And so we can make a plot of
this, and that's shown here.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.440
And all we've got is
OH versus H3O plus.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.540
And you can see that it's
a right hyperbola.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:27.610
But it goes back to that comment
that I made in the

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:29.900
past about how you graph data.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.030
I don't know what to do with
that, because it's curved.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.330
I can't tell whether the
data are good or bad.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.330
So instead of looking at
something like this, y versus

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:43.890
x, I want to transform so that
can get a straight line.

00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:46.720
Because then I can make a
judgment about goodness

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.780
of fit and so on.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:52.870
So I need some f of x versus
g of y to, quote unquote,

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:53.930
straighten this out.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:59.540
And we have that, thanks
to another Dane,

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.930
by the name of Sorensen.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:05.050
Sorensen was the one that
gave us another way

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.810
to think about it.

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:13.590
Sorensen, who in 1901, and
he's got the DK on his--

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.830
he's probably got
a Volvo, too.

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:16.520
Or maybe he's driving a Saab.

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.620
So he was a biochemist at
the Carlsberg brewery.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.930
Yes, they had biochemists,
because they wanted understand

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.670
the chemistry of beer
production.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:26.570
What a concept.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.850
Having people that
understand the

00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.960
technology of the business.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.580
So he was working at the
Carlsberg brewery, and he

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:37.390
decided to take this acid-base
business and turn it into

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.810
something that's much more
readily recognizable.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:49.030
And so he defined a concept
called the chemical potential,

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:53.850
which, if you like, is the
reactivity, the chemical

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:55.250
potential of hydronium.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.980
And he gave it the symbol.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.950
Lowercase p for potential, and
uppercase H as, obviously, for

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.790
the hydrogen ion.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.970
And he said, I'm going to
make this a logarithm.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.820
So it's logarithm, and in those
days, everybody was

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.780
using slide rules, so it's log
base 10 of the concentration

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.010
of hydronium.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.650
And being a good engineer, he
recognized since this starts

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:26.050
off at 10 to the minus 7, the
log of a number less than one

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:27.930
is going to be negative.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.700
And who wants to deal with
negative numbers?

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.260
So you put a minus sign here.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:34.610
That way, pH normally is
a positive number.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:39.020
And now you can see the
results of Sorensen's

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.585
straightening things
out for us.

00:31:40.585 --> 00:31:43.220
So now you go over a wider
range, and you can see, you

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.220
have nice straight line
relationship, and then you can

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.040
get data on there, and so on.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.990
And this is taken from your
book, and it shows the pH

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.830
values of some common
substances.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.690
If you start here at neutral pH
7, you have milk, you have

00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:00.650
human blood, normal things that
you would expect, fluids

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.950
and so on, are hovering
around 7.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.690
If you take some coffee, you're
going to go into the

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:05.370
acidic region.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.780
You see tomatoes down
here at about 4.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.705
Wine, you'll see in the reviews
of wines, they'll say

00:32:12.705 --> 00:32:14.770
it has balanced acidity
and so on.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.830
Yeah, it's down around pH 3.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:21.040
And carbonated soft drinks, some
of them get down to 2.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.020
Vinegar is wine that
has spoiled.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.630
Vin aigre, which means eager.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:27.140
The Middle French eager meant

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.660
impetuous, or tart, or something.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.070
So this is spoiled wine.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:32.310
And the pH changes.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:35.720
So by measuring the pH of wine,
you can tell if it's

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.580
changing or not.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:37.400
There's lemon juice.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.840
Gastric juices in the stomach
can get down to 1, pH of 1.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:43.950
But you want that happening
only at one point in the

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.300
digestive cycle.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.930
If you run around for long
periods of time at pH 1, you

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.700
will ulcerate, in other words,
you'll puncture the walls.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.740
And if that's about to happen,
you need to neutralize.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:56.790
So how do you neutralize?

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.750
You go up with something
that has a high pH.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.200
So you can start with something
like Alka-Seltzer,

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.130
sodium bicarbonate at
about 8.4, or milk

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.950
of magnesia, 10.5.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.820
Why is it milk of magnesia?

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.830
From last day, because it's
not a solution, it is a

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:11.700
suspension.

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.320
The magnesia is in suspension.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.710
The magnesium hydroxide.

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:18.860
And that's one of those
mandatory shake well before

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.330
using, because all the magnesia
is on the bottom, and

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:25.910
you've got this almost clear,
colorless liquid on the top.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.390
So you're just drinking water.

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:29.960
Not going to help you if you've
got stomach pain, but

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.620
gastric juice is down here.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.180
If you're really desperate,
don't reach for ammonia.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.140
You have to be patient.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.320
They have to work with
milk of magnesia.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:39.660
OK.

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.910
So that's the range.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:47.520
So what else do we have here?

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.850
Let's take a look.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:56.570
So far we've been assuming that
when we add acid to the

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.680
system, we get 1 to
1 dissociation.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.730
So the next message that I want
to give you here, is that

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.983
not all acids are of
equal strength.

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:18.890
See, I could look up here and
say, well, maybe the reason

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:22.970
that the lemon juice is down it
at 2 and the gastric juices

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:26.170
are at 1 is simply a
concentration effect.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.790
How much acid was introduced.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:31.240
No, there's another explanation
for it.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.670
And that is that certain acids
don't fully disassociate.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:40.220
So for example, if we look at
1 molar HCl, hydrochloric

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:44.480
acid, you look at 1 molar
hydrochloric acid, that goes

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.880
100% into solution and gives
us 1 molar H30 plus.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.450
So 1 to 1 correspondence between
how much hydrochloric

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:57.760
acid we introduce, and how much

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.760
hydroxyl that we generate.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:07.160
So this is total dissociation
of the HCl.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.105
And as a result, we call
this a strong acid.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.890
In contrast, let me show
you a weak acid.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:18.210
So a weak acid is going to
dissolve, but it doesn't

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:18.880
dissociate.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.530
So there's really
two steps here.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:23.160
First you've got to get the
stuff in solution, and then

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.330
once you get it in solution,
it has to break apart.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:29.165
It's possible to go into
solution and not break apart.

00:35:29.165 --> 00:35:32.140
In which case, you don't have
the protons, but you've got

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.520
the solution.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.470
That's not an acid.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:37.700
So a weak acid would be,
let's, in contrast,

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.070
look at a weak acid.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.930
A weak acid would be something
like acetic

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:44.210
acid, which is CH3COOH.

00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:45.760
And this is for historical
reasons.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.580
Normally, the proton that's
going to dissociate is at the

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.890
front of the formula, but this
was written long ago, before

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.170
people understood this theory.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.990
And that's the way you'll
see acetic acid written.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:02.280
So really, this is the proton,
and the CH3COO is really the

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.310
acetate anion, Ac,
acetate anion.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:10.230
So we're going to put that
into solution, like this.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.140
I'm going to put it into
water, H20 liquid.

00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:18.005
So this is the salt out of
solution, and all we're going

00:36:18.005 --> 00:36:23.210
to do is make it into the
aqueous solution of same COOH,

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.060
and I'm just going
to write aq.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:28.880
Now, if this were strong acid
with impunity, I would write

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:33.030
whatever the concentration of
acetic acid is, I break it

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.400
apart, and I get the full
amount of the proton.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:44.340
What happens is that this, now
plus H20, gives me H3O plus

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:49.480
plus the remaining acetate,
which is CH3COO minus.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.410
And now, here's where the
weakness is manifested.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:59.850
The degree to which the acetic
acid grabs protons from here,

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.910
and then ends up being
protonated,

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.440
is very, very small.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:06.310
It turns out that in the
case of 1 molar--

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.360
I'm going to write acetic
acid this way, now.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.100
HAc.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:19.880
So this thing here is the
CH3COO minus, all right?

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:25.240
It turns out that in 1
molar acetic acid, we

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:29.400
get only 0.4% reaction.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.915
0.4% reacts and dissociates.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:44.060
So to give protons, it hangs
onto most of its protons.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.690
So we can then represent this
in the form of an acid

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.045
dissociation constant.

00:37:57.850 --> 00:37:58.970
And that it looks like this.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.730
K sub a for acid.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:05.100
So on the right side, what we're
going to do is make a

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.460
mass balance here.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.930
We're going to take the product
of the proton, the

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:14.010
acetate divided by the
undisassociated acetic acid.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:18.210
So we'll put H3O plus
concentration times the

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.690
acetate concentration
divided by the

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:26.350
undissociated HAc aqueous.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:31.290
So I'm trying to represent
what the ratio is here.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:35.890
And instead of being one to one,
it's 10 to the minus 5.

00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:37.290
Very, very weak.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.080
You get a little bit,
but not much.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.260
Now, you could say, well, 10 to
the minus 5, this is, just

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:46.050
for reference, it's 100 times
10 to the minus 7,

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.190
which is the Kw.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:50.750
So the point here is, if you put
in acetic acid, you'll end

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.590
up with 100 times the proton
population that you would have

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.090
had by just self-dissociation.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:57.100
So it isn't acid.

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.410
It is donating protons.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:01.230
But it's not doing it a lot.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.610
So this is called a weak
acid, because it's

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.635
a poor proton donor.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:14.620
And so we can then look
at a comparison to,

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:16.580
say, over here, HCl.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.370
Let's go back here, and we can
write the acid dissociation

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:23.830
constant for HCl, for
the strong acid.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:27.280
And in that case, Ka over here,
which is going to be the

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.610
H3O plus Cl minus, H3O plus.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:35.310
In the case of HCl, we're
going to get proton and

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:44.910
chloride over undissociated
HCl dissolved in water.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:48.820
And that's 10 to the plus 6,
which for all intents and

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.680
purposes is infinity.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.300
You put in 1 molar HCl, you
get 1 molar H plus.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.210
And look at the ratio.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.810
10 to the sixth, 10
to the minus 5.

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:03.770
There's a 10 to the eleventh
relationship between the weak

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:05.890
acid and the strong acid.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:09.420
And here's the cartoon that
shows this strong acid, put in

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.240
this amount, 100% dissociation,
weak acid gives

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:16.680
you small amounts of proton,
and a very weak acid is

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.370
imperceptible amount
of disassociation.

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.170
And here's a table that
quantifies it.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.760
So the strong acids up
here with the Ka.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.600
This value of Ka has to be
greater than 1, because it's

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.540
saying that we're getting a
lot of dissociation, the

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:32.870
reactions moving to the right.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:33.860
And you have these
numbers here.

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.360
10 to the ninth, 10 to the
eighth, 10 to the sixth.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.060
Those are differences
without distinction.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.650
if I say the ratio is a million
to one, or a billion

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:43.500
to one, for all intents
and purposes, you have

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.610
dissociation.

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:45.840
And then here are
the week acids.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.070
Look.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.420
10 to the minus 3.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:50.820
There's phosphoric,
hydrofluoric, and so on, all

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:51.400
the way down.

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.140
There's carbonic acid,
10 to the minus 7.

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:56.890
So there's the list.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.330
And just another cute
demonstration of the

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:07.330
relationship between bonding and
acidity, the acid strength

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:11.130
increases from left to right,
and the bond strength

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.180
increases from right to left.

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.940
You know, HF is very strong.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:16.090
It's a hydrogen-bonded.

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:18.390
Very tight HF bond.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.620
But what determines if
it's going to be a

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:22.260
strong acid or not?

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.590
It's how willing HF is
to give up its H.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:28.710
But its H is tightly bound.

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:32.440
So oddly enough, in HF, you
don't give up much of the H.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.880
HF is over here.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.170
It's less than one.

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:36.500
It's a weak acid.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.310
HCl is a pretty strong acid.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:43.020
If you want to go heavy-duty,
HBr and HI are even stronger

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:46.630
acids, because they have a
weaker hold on the hydrogen

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.600
within them, so they
are much, much more

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.760
generous proton donors.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.490
So you can see that from there.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:54.990
OK.

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:58.110
So what's the takeaway
message here?

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:07.010
The takeaway message is that
equal acid concentration does

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.760
not mean equal acid strength.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.210
You have to be mediated
by the Ka.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.420
Equal acid concentration,
which means, how

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.010
much did you dissolve?

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:22.510
Does not equal acid strength.

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:23.510
And what's the reason?

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:26.140
Because equal acid
concentration, this is a

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:30.090
function of solubility, whereas
this is a function of

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.090
dissociation.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.160
So many dissolve,
few dissociate.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:34.830
How about that?

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:37.600
There's a nice tagline
you can use.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.180
Use that at a party
this weekend.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.130
Many dissolve, but
few dissociate.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:41.450
All right.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.120
Now I want to go very,
very high.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.590
Big concept, all right?

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:48.330
Last definition of acid-base
comes from the United States.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:48.450
G.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:48.740
N.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.820
Lewis.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.150
Same G.

00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.370
N.

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:55.310
Lewis who gave us the Lewis
cross and dot structures,

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.080
covalent bonding, didn't
stop inventing.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.280
So we're going to put U.S.A.,
with a Chevrolet out in

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.470
California.

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:03.190
And what did G.

00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.430
N.

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:04.550
Lewis tell us?

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:08.950
He said, I want to extend the
Bronsted-Lowry concept.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:10.485
But you know, let me give
you an analogy.

00:43:10.485 --> 00:43:12.140
Have you ever stood
on a bridge and

00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.150
watched the traffic go?

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:16.750
You see it starts from a stop
sign or a traffic light.

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:20.140
Light turns green, the first car
pulls away, the second car

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:23.020
pulls away, the third
car pulls away.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.370
The other way you can look at
it is, when the first car

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.600
pulls away, there's
a car vacancy.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.150
And instead of watching the cars
go from right to left,

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:34.440
watch the car vacancy move
from left to right.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.980
And the two are linked.

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.030
And point of fact, if you're
the fourth car from the

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.630
traffic light, light
turns green and you

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:42.350
hit the horn, why?

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.350
You can't drive.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:46.020
You have to drive only into a
car vacancy, and it takes time

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.130
for the car vacancy
to get to you.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:52.340
When the rate of vacancy flux is
not matched by the rate of

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.340
car flux, then we have a
collision, and then we

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.220
exchange papers.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.570
So it's a mass transport
problem.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:43:59.315
So now what G.

00:43:59.315 --> 00:43:59.500
N.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:05.620
Lewis said was, instead of
looking at this reaction as a

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:10.470
proton transfer reaction, and
looking at proton attachment,

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:13.680
or proton acquisition, he said,
why don't we look at

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.390
this from the other side
of the relationship?

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:20.860
And so he said, let's look at
something like, for example,

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:22.640
we've got NH3 here.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.910
So let's put the N with
the 2 electrons.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:31.300
And we've been talking about
this from the perspective of

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:34.980
the bond being formed
here through the

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.360
acquisition of the proton.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.790
Lewis said, I can view this from
the other perspective,

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.490
and say, I'm going to
view it from the

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:43.850
perspective of the nitrogen.

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:46.620
From the perspective of the
nitrogen, this reaction

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:51.690
represents the donation
of the electron pair.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.440
A very high concept.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:57.890
So this base is not about
proton attachment.

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:01.390
It's about donating an
electronic pair.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.270
So let's get that down, because
that's really good.

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:08.400
So I'm going to say something
that's a base looks like this.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.840
This is what a base is.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.920
It's a lone pair.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:15.355
This is electron pair,
very high level base.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.900
And what's the proton give us?

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.520
What we're doing, is
we're talking about

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:24.430
electrons and donation.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:27.990
So what's this other thing
in that same category?

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:33.740
An electron pair can match
up with an empty orbital.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.110
That's the only place electron
pairs can go.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:37.840
They go to the empty orbitals.

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:41.060
So electron pair is a base,
and this is just a circle

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.410
around nothing.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.910
OK?

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.170
This is nothing.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.050
But it's a special
kind of nothing.

00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:47.510
This is called a
vacant orbital.

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:56.150
And I'm going to call a vacant
orbital an acid, in the most

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:57.840
general sense.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.220
So now I'm going to take an
electron pair plus vacant

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:03.700
orbital, and what did they
react to give me?

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:06.990
Covalent bond.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:08.035
You'd expect that from G.

00:46:08.035 --> 00:46:08.240
N.

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.600
Lewis, because G.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:12.960
N.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.570
Lewis enunciated covalency.

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:15.873
That's why you'd expect
it from G.

00:46:15.873 --> 00:46:15.976
N.

00:46:15.976 --> 00:46:16.340
Lewis.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.750
So this is, vacant orbital
plus electron pair gives

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:20.820
covalent bond.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.430
Very high level.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:23.450
Very high level.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.190
So what is a base?

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:31.080
A base is now not just
a proton acceptor.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:38.040
It's an electron pair donor,
and the acid is an electron

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.290
pair acceptor.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:44.130
So now there's no
chemistry here.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.280
No chemical identities.

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.190
Which means, I can
even go from--

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:50.620
I don't even have to
be in solution.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.240
I don't have to be
in a liquid.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.670
This could be a gas
and a solid.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:56.080
Could be a gas plus a gas.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.790
So this is, like, Darwinian.

00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:59.940
You know, we've come out of the
primordial ooze, and now

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:03.310
we can fly, because we can
talk about any chemical

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:04.480
reaction we want.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.820
Any state of matter.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.590
It's fantastic.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:09.680
Absolutely fantastic.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.210
So here, let me do one
last color drawing.

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:14.990
We want to do this one here.

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:18.030
This is Lewis and the
biggest concept.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:19.570
So we're going to
go like this.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:23.120
Base like this.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:26.620
Base with its lone
pair hanging out

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:31.110
plus acid gives us--

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:31.760
three colors.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:32.370
This is great.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.100
We've got all this colored
chalk, it's Friday,

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.070
what could be better.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:37.680
All right.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:44.470
So now we're going to end up
with A, B, there it is.

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:46.340
This is the Lewis concept.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:53.400
Lewis acid-base concept.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:54.310
In the broadest thing.

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.460
Now I'm going to show
you an example of

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.090
how you can use this.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:58.000
I'm not going to stop here.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.410
OK, let's go.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:47:59.720
All right.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.240
So we're going to talk
about acid rain

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.870
from burning of coal.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:05.210
You know, about half of the
electric power in this country

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:09.930
comes from burning coal, and
coal contains about 1% sulfur.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:14.290
You can purify it of sulfur, but
it takes money to do so.

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:16.640
A ton of coal will give you
about 25 million British

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:20.130
thermal units, and that's the
number in SI units and joules.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.890
So 3 tons of coal will give
you 1 megawatt per day.

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:26.070
By the way, it takes about
one gram of uranium

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:26.880
to do the same thing.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.170
So someday, when you're
sitting there as a

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:31.450
policymaker, you've got a choice
of 3 tons of coal or

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.290
one gram of uranium, keep
this fact in mind.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:37.690
A 10 megawatt plant burns
30 tons of coal per day,

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:41.160
containing a third of a ton of
sulphur, which makes 2/3 of a

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.230
ton of SO2.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:46.600
And SO2 is a precursor
to acid rain.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.520
Now we can reduce that SO2
emissions by reacting SO2 with

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:53.140
a lime, CaO, according
to this reaction, to

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:55.610
make calcium sulfite.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:58.170
And now I'm going to
bring in this.

00:48:58.170 --> 00:48:59.430
Lewis.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:02.390
Oh, here's from your textbook,
there's the scrubbers with the

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:05.010
calcium oxide, and water
missed, and so on, and

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:08.810
eventually they trap the SO2.

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:10.210
They do nothing to the CO2.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.510
So all the CO2 is going up.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:16.060
So here's calcium oxide,
which is a solid.

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.100
It's lime.

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.990
You know, stuff you sprinkle
on football fields.

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:22.460
And this is SO2, and it's got
this structure with the

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.750
resident bond double single.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:27.940
The oxygen here acts the
way it did in the

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.490
glasses, as a modifier.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.580
It goes in and breaks this
double bond, and now we have

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.900
three single bonds.

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:37.090
So we can look at this
from Lewis acid-base.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.960
You know, calcium oxides,
electron pair donor.

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.880
If it's an electron pair
donor, it's a base.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.720
So it's a base.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.250
And you know SO2 better be an
acid, or your theory is nuts,

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.340
because SO2 is a precursor
to acid rain.

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.670
So it has to be an acid.

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:52.450
It's an electronic
pair acceptor,

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:53.390
which is what we said.

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:54.660
It's an electron
pair acceptor.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.020
So this is a Lewis acid-base
reaction that

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.770
is a gas-solid reaction.

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:03.050
So we started with aqueous
solutions, and we end up

00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:05.790
generalizing all of these
types of reactions.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:07.360
So that's pretty good.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:12.270
Here's a plot of acid
concentration

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.280
up in the sky, here.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.140
You're Here.

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.410
Yeah.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:22.790
Last thing I'll do, I talked
a lot about Lavoisier and

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.250
Scheele and Priestley.

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:26.310
This is a play, if you've
got the little bit

00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:27.220
of time this weekend.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:28.130
You might try reading it.

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:30.760
This is Carl Djerassi and Roald
Hoffman, both Nobel

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.440
Prize winners in Chemistry.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.260
Not the same year.

00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:36.340
They won independent Nobel
Prizes, and actually speak to

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:39.010
each other, and they
collaborated on this play.

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:41.000
Here's the setup, the premise.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.150
The premise of the play is
that the Nobel committee

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:47.380
decides to give Nobel
Prizes retrograde.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:48.600
Before 1901.

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.740
You see, you can't get a Nobel
Prize posthumously.

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.070
You've got to do something
great, and you've got to keep

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:56.670
on living until you
get the prize.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.590
So they decided they're going
to go backwards, you know,

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:01.250
maybe give prizes to people
like, I don't know, Maxwell or

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:02.800
Faraday or whatever.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.370
And they decide, it should be
simple in the old days.

00:51:05.370 --> 00:51:07.790
Because we didn't have all this
dog-eat-dog competition

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.530
in science, and big grants,
and corporate interests.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:11.790
Should be simple.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:17.670
Until they hit the Nobel Prize
for the discovery of oxygen.

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:20.000
And then they hit the wall with
these three different

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.080
competitors.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.120
And so the story goes that the
three competitors and their

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:26.440
wives end up in Stockholm,
and the

00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:28.100
interactions the take place.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:31.350
And it's really fascinating,
because you have Lavoisier,

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:34.260
who was the political
conservative but the chemical

00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:39.320
radical, Priestley, who was the
chemical radical but the

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.650
political conservative--

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:41.710
by the way, Lavoisier.

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:43.190
You know how he died?

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:45.800
He was guillotined during
the French revolution.

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.630
And people think it's because
he was a tax collector.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:49.450
Not true.

00:51:49.450 --> 00:51:51.210
He was a tax collector.

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:55.070
The real reason is Marat, who
was one of the chief justices

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:59.220
of the Jacobin terror, was also
a scientist. And around

00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:03.380
1740, Marat had submitted an
article for publication, and

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:04.430
it was rejected.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:08.710
And Lavoisier was on the
editorial board.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:11.910
And so sometimes when I get an
article to review, and I have

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:15.680
to give it a negative review,
I think about this story.

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:19.490
And sometimes, I will just say,
you know, I'm really busy

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:24.060
teaching 3091 and I won't get
to this on a timely basis.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:24.730
OK, people.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:25.980
Have a nice weekend.
