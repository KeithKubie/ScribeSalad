&gt;&gt; ANDRES: Hello. I'm Andres from Illusion
Labs in Sweden. And we are creating games

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.349
and the fun applications for mobile devices,
for mainly devices. We have created a game

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:24.210
called Labyrinth. It's actually a digital
copy of the classic wooden game that we used

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.950
to play when we were kids where you tilt a
plate to guide a steel bowl through a wooden

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.230
maze. And we made a digital version of that.
We put a lot of effort into making the physics

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.180
feel rights. And, yeah, it has become quite
popular. There's a free version on that on

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.630
the market today. And we found the game to
be suitable for the Android G1 and G2 devices

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.310
because it has the accelerometer feature.
It has a nice big display where you can display

00:00:52.310 --> 00:01:00.910
the entire level at once. And we also think
that the distribution channel is a great way

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.049
to distribute the application. It's easy to
reach a lot of people through the markets.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.240
And we believe that the volumes will be quite
big, so we're looking into developing more

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.270
games and applications for the Android devices
at this time. Okay. So, the company, we started

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.729
the company about two years ago. And the Labyrinth
game was actually the first game we created

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.560
in the company. From the beginning, it was
for the iPhone, and we started selling it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.130
on the app store. It went very well. And after--and
when we saw the Android phones coming out

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:44.209
on the market, we actually ported the application
from the iPhone application. There was a few

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:51.160
differences there because the iPhone, we wrote
most of the parts in C++, and for Android,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.560
it's Java, of course. A lot of things, we
could just copy and paste a lot of physics

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.240
calculation because the syntax is quite similar.
So, the porting work wasn’t that hard actually.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:16.600
We found it to be quite okay. And then, yeah,
we have only the free version today on the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.430
markets, but we will release a full version.
And the full version, it contains about 1000

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.910
levels, all created by the community because
we have also an online level editor that anyone

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.180
can access and create, very, very simply,
create their own levels. It's actually built

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:42.470
on the App Engine using HTML 5 and the Canvas
Tape. So, it's working very well. So we had

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.300
a couple of issues with accelerometer values
at first because as we think they were filtered

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.900
before we could access the values. So, we
actually had--have a good contact with some

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.720
of the Google guys and they helped us to get
raw stream instead which it could use and

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.480
we could perform the filtering in our device
instead of in the system. So, after a little

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.671
chat with some Google guys, we actually managed
to get the feeling just right and that was

00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:20.840
great. Another hard thing that we found was
that since we are a Swedish-based company,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.540
the G1 wasn’t sold in Sweden, so it was
quite hard actually to get hold of a phone,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.730
but we both went there on eBay from the U.S.
So, yeah, so we got hold of them finally.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.680
But still the simulator is quite good. But,
of course, you cannot release something just

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.762
tested on the simulator, so we had to get
a real phone. So when we created the application,

00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:53.430
we had to get the feeling just right. We wanted
to run the application in maximum frames per

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.790
second. That is 60 frames per second. So we
had to do a lot of tweaks to get this going.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.960
For example, we used OpenGL for rendering.
And one thing that we did was to use Dirty

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.290
Rectangles. That means that we calculate which
part of the application has actually moved,

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.090
has actually changed since the last frame,
and we only we redraw those portions of the

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.720
screen. Another thing that we found out is
using VBO. That's the buffered vertex, some

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.090
buffered texture coordinates and things like
that and also the normals. They spent--they

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:39.020
actually made a huge difference in speed.
So, a few frames per second we earned there.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.540
So for the development environment, we really
like working in Eclipse. We think it's a very

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.570
nice development environment and it's easy
to debug. It's easy to--I mean, since we’re

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.430
using Java in the Android phone, it's really
easy to create quality applications in quite

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.130
a short time. So that, we think that's really
good. Okay. If you compare it to other devices

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:11.460
where you also you have a marketplace on the
internet, we really like the--that is possible

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:19.850
to instantly publish your updates and your
applications onto the store or onto the market.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.870
And it's just a matter of minutes before it's
accessible by other people. Another thing

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.740
that's good, that you can't do on, for example,
the iPhone, it's the vibrator control. You

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.139
can have really, really fine vibrator control
because what we use it for is for tactile

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:43.120
feedback in the game that when you tilt the
device and when the ball bumps into the wall,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.510
we actually turn on the vibrator just a little
for a couple of milliseconds so it's just

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.930
starting up and then stopping again and that
actually really feels like the ball is bumping

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.000
into the wall, and that makes a good feeling
of the game.
