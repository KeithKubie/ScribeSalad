00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.404
It's time to play Super Zeroes,
Super Zeroes.

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:06.373
(cheering)

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.811
I know you've never heard
of this game,

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.146
-so I appreciate your support.
-(laughter)

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.148
Superheroes are known
for having kickass backstories,

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.150
like being bit
by a radioactive spider

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.785
and gaining cool superpowers...

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:21.121
instead of coughing up blood
and losing all their hair.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.023
But... not all heroes
are that lucky.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.193
Some superheroes end up looking
like total butter crystal ball.

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:27.928
Uh, like this...

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.763
(laughter)

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.132
...very sexy light bulb.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.901
-(laughter)
-Uh... but there are tons

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.502
of horrible heroes and villains
to goof on,

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.771
so let's take a look at some,
and then we'll goof.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.039
Comedians, I'm gonna show you

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.175
some obscure comic book
characters, and for 250 points,

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.610
you answer questions about them.
First up, we have...

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.479
Matter-Eater Lad.

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.715
-(laughter) -Matter-Eater Lad.
He seems to be able to eat

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.484
any and all matter.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:52.853
What is his catchphrase?
Josh.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:54.788
Don't judge me,
I'm going through a breakup.

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:58.659
Points.

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.460
Wait a minute...

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.996
Are you sure? I think
he's on the fence about it.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.132
Aw... Hey.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.768
-There you go.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.770
Hey, come on, kids, your ol' dad

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:12.339
knows how to mix it up
with comedy.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.508
Next up, how about NFL Superpro?

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.945
How about NFL Superpro?

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:20.380
Uh, what is his weakness?
Nick.

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:21.515
Uh, turning 30.

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:25.018
Points. Yup.

00:01:25.052 --> 00:01:26.420
CUMMINGS:
Oh, funny.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:27.487
Whitney Cummings.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:30.224
Uh, his weakness
is spelling and pussy.

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.025
Points.

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:33.527
Josh.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.431
His weakness is the state
of Florida's child custody laws.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:38.932
Points. Yeah.

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:42.035
Next up, this viral sensation:
Infectious Lass.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.904
Infectious Lass.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:46.673
What's the name
of her super team? Josh.

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:48.141
The Hepatitis Four.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:51.712
Points.

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:52.980
Whitney.

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:55.449
Uh, HPV for Vendetta.

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.417
Points.

00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:03.924
Next up, we have
Arm Fall Off Boy.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:07.461
Wh...

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:10.597
Can we... can I...

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:14.434
can we just point out the sound
of your arm ripping off is...

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:16.170
-Yeah, yeah, it's-it's "plorp".
-Obviously plorp. -Plorp.

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:18.472
It's plorp. I mean, you know,
you work on <i>Walking Dead,</i>

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:20.340
a lot of people
get their limbs ripped off.

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.409
You-you probably hear
plorps all the time.

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:25.412
Uh, who is his sidekick?
Who is his sidekick? Josh.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:29.116
The drummer from Def Leppard.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.651
Oh, no.

00:02:30.684 --> 00:02:33.887
No.

00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:35.422
Togeth...

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.791
Together they can
both lift a box.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.194
That's...
Nick.

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:41.695
It only makes sense
that his sidekick

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.031
-is Arm Put Back On Boy.
-Yeah, points.

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:45.766
That would only make sense.

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.236
Next up, beware The Fiddler!

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:53.807
Oh, oh.

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:56.777
Green is an evil color.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.147
What is used
to defeat this villain? Nick.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.716
A, uh, younger,
more talented Asian fiddler.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.685
Points.

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.992
Next up, duck,

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.595
-Here comes Codpiece.
-McDERMITT: Oh...

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.332
Uh, where did he
get his super power?

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.100
Where did he get
his super power? Josh.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.202
Let me ask you this, Chris--
have you ever tried

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:25.806
(bleep) a microwave?

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.574
Mm...

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:29.843
I mean, like, you know,
I've 69'd one,

00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:31.745
but I haven't, like...

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:32.913
We all have.

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:33.013
I set it to 69 and then
I hit start and then...
