00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:05.372
&gt;&gt; Jon: I WAS BEING FACETIOUS,
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A BIG

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.307
CONVERSATION NOW THAT WE ARE
HAVING ABOUT CRIME.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:08.542
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:00:08.542 --> 00:00:13.280
&gt;&gt; Jon: SHOOTINGS IN NEW YORK
CITY HAVE RISEN OVER THESE PAST

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.518
TWO YEARS AND ARE NOW AT 20%
LEVEL, I GUESS HIGHER THAN WHAT

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:22.022
THEY WERE SINCE THE STOPPING OF
STOP AND FRISK.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:25.993
IT CAN'T BE THAT THE ONLY WAY WE
CAN CONTROL SHOOTINGS IN

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:32.366
NEW YORK CITY IS WHAT APPEARS TO
BE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.968
ANGERING PROGRAM OF STOP AND
FRISK.

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:37.638
BUT THIS APPEARS TO BE A REAL
THING.

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:38.772
&gt;&gt; LET ME SAY IT A LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:43.777
WHEN BILL BRATTON CAME AS OUR
COMMISSIONER, FIRST PRESS

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:47.080
CONFERENCE HE SAID IN TERMS OF
STOP AND FRISK, YOU CAN'T BREAK

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.782
THE LAW TO ENFORCE THE LAW.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:49.850
&gt;&gt; Jon: RIGHT.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.052
&gt;&gt; THAT FROM THE BEGINNING WAS
THE TEMPLATE WE TOOK.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.988
SO CAN YOU DRIVE DOWN CRIME
WHILE RESPECTING CONSTITUTIONAL

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.823
RIGHTS?

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:01.028
ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE MY FIRST
YEAR IN OFFICE, BILL BRATTON'S

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:04.498
FIRST YEAR AS COMMISSIONER,
CRIME WENT DOWN FROM 2013-2014,

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:09.569
THE LOWEST NUMBER OF MURDERS IN
N EW YORK IN 50 YEARS.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:10.637
&gt;&gt; Jon: I GUESS YOU'RE SAYING WE
CAN DO BETTER.

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:11.371
&gt;&gt; WE CAN ABSOLUTELY DO BETTER.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:12.039
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE CAN KILL MORE
PEOPLE.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.676
(LAUGHTER)

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:16.977
&gt;&gt; YOU MISINTERPRETED.

00:01:16.977 --> 00:01:18.145
THERE'S BEEN A HORRIBLE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:18.779
&gt;&gt; Jon: ALL RIGHT.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.013
I UNDERSTAND.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.883
&gt;&gt; WE BROUGHT DOWN MURDER TO A
RATE SINCE WE'VE NOT SEEN SINCE

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:24.084
THE EARLY '60s.

00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.953
WE BROUGHT DOWN CRIME ACROSS THE
BOARD.

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:29.690
WE DO HAVE A SHOOTING PROBLEM,
LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.528
NOTHING LIKE NEW YORK CITY HAD
15, 20 YEARS AGO, BUT SOMETHING

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:38.298
PERSISTENT PARTICULARLY AROUND
GANGS, AND WE HAVE NEW

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:42.502
STRATEGIES TO GO IN THERE BOTH
WITH AGGRESSIVE POLICING BUT

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:45.372
ALSO GANG INTERVENTION, WHICH IS
THE PROCESS OF UNDERMINING GANG

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.307
RECRUITMENT AT THE THE COMMUNITY
LEVEL, WHICH HAS BEEN PROVEN TO

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:48.542
WORK ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:51.044
THOSE STRAPS NEED TO BE APPLIED.

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:53.280
GOING BACK TO AN
UNCONSTITUTIONAL ALIENATING

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.351
APPROACH IS NOT ONLY UNFAIR AND
INAPPROPRIATE TO THE POPULOUS,

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.518
IT DOESN'T WORK.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.054
IT TIES UP TIME AND ENERGY INTO
THINGS THAT AREN'T SERIOUS

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:05.125
CRIME.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.827
SO WE'RE BROADLY ON THE RIGHT
TRACK.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:09.463
WE'RE RETRAINING OUR POLICE
FORCES TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:10.664
THE COMMUNITY.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.967
WE'RE DOING BODY CAMERAS, WHICH
W ILLINSTILL MORE CONFIDENCE

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.536
WITH THE POLICE AND 
COMMUNITIES.

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:20.073
WE'RE PROVIDING MORE TECHNOLOGY
TO THE NYPD SO THEY WILL BE MORE

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:21.608
EFFECTIVE.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:24.044
THING THESE WILL ADD UP AND
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT WASTING

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:27.047
TIME ON UNNECESSARY AND
UNCONSTITUTIONAL STOPS OR

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:30.150
LOW-LEVEL MARIJUANA ARRESTS
EITHER.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.485
&gt;&gt; Jon: WITH THAT I WOULD BE
ON--

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.187
BUT HOW DO YOU BRING UP THAT
MORALE -- BY THE WAY, IS A POUND

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:35.989
LOW LEVEL?

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.290
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.362
ALL RIGHT, BECAUSE YOU HAVE
COMMUNITIES WHO BELIEVE THE

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.364
POLICE FORCE DOES NOT RESPECT
THEM AND TREATS THEM LIKE

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:48.168
THEY'RE AN OCCUPYING ARMY IN
AN AREA, AND THEN A POLICE FORCE

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:52.272
THAT FEELS DISRESPECT OR
FEELS LIKE THE BAD POLICE

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:57.778
OFFICERS ARE BEING USED TO
TAR THEM IN A SYSTEMIC WAY.

00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:02.416
HOW DO YOU BRIDGE THE GAPS IN
THE COMMUNITY SO PEOPLE FEEL

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:07.854
LIKE THEY'RE BOTH BEING TREATED
FAIRLY WHEN, YOU KNOW AS I DO,

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:12.159
THE MINUTE MURDERS AND SHOOTINGS
GO UP POLITICAL PRESSURE IS

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.429
GOING TO BECOME IMMENSE, GET
THIS OUT OF OUR SIGHT.

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.431
PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE
CONSTITUTION WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:18.632
IT'S NOT SAFE.

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:22.102
&gt;&gt; WELL, I THINK THE GOOD NEWS
IS IN THIS CITY WE HAD A REAL

00:03:22.102 --> 00:03:25.072
THOROUGH DEBATE, AND PEOPLE DID
VOTE IN FAVOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:30.043
RIGHTS AND RESPECT FOR
COMMUNITY, WHILE HAVING STRONG

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:30.844
POLICING.

00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:32.979
THERE'S NO DICHOTOMY HERE.

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.149
IN THE END A SAFER CITY IS ONE
IN WHICH POLICE AND CITY HAVE A

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:40.153
POWERFUL, STRONG, WORKING
RELATIONSHIP THAT ENCOURAGES A

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.155
COMMUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATION
WITH THE POLICE.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:45.959
POLICE OFFICERS WILL TELL YOU
THERE'S POLICE IN EVERY

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.028
COMMUNITY, LAW ABIEWDING PEOPLE
WHO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:49.296
WEAPONS AND THE BAD GUYS ARE.

00:03:49.296 --> 00:03:51.431
WE WANT THEM ON THE SIDE OF THE
POLICE AND THE BOND BETWEEN

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.433
POLICE.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:56.603
WE FIND AS WE HAVE BEEN MAKING
OUR REFORMS AND BRINGING POLICE

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:59.172
AND COMMUNITY BACK TOGETHER,
WE'RE SEE AGO DIFFERENT

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:00.307
RELATIONSHIP.

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:02.209
WE HAVE A CIVILIAN COMPLAINT
REVIEW BOARD, COMPLAINTS ARE

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.147
DOWN 25% FROM A YEAR AGO BECAUSE
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO MOVE PAST

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:11.985
SOME OF THOSE DIVISIONS OF THE
PAST AND ULTIMATELY EVERYONE

00:04:11.985 --> 00:04:15.655
WANTS GOOD AND DECENT POLICING
AND POLICE WANT TO BE PROUD OF

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.858
THEIR PROFESSION AS THEY HAVE A
RIGHT TO.

00:04:17.858 --> 00:04:20.293
&gt;&gt; Jon: ARE THEY BRINGING MORE
COPS, YOU KNOW, POLICING AREAS

00:04:20.293 --> 00:04:22.896
THEY'RE FROM AS OPPOSED TO
COMING IN FROM OTHER -- 

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.698
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY, POLICING AREAS
THEY'RE FROM AND THE OTHER

00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:27.501
VARIATION IS COMMUNITY POLICING,
APPLYING THE OFFICERS,

00:04:27.501 --> 00:04:30.303
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY'RE
FROM, APPLYING THEM TO ONE

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:34.374
COMMUNITY LONG ENOUGH TO DEVELOP
RELATIONSHIPS AND GET TO KNOW

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:35.876
THE COMMUNITY.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:39.479
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS
THAT CREATE TRUST, MUTUAL

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.417
RESPECT, THAT KEEPS COMMUNITIES
AND OFFICERS SAFER.

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:48.421
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE OTHER THING THAT
BOTHERS ME, THEY WANT TO GO TO

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:50.724
END OF THE LINE OF THE SUPPLY
CHAIN BUT NEVER WANT TO DEAL

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:54.161
WITH, YOU KNOW, WHY AREN'T WE
DOWN IN FLORIDA, SOUTH CAROLINA,

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:57.664
GEORGIA WHERE THESE GUNS ARE
COMING FROM AND STOPPING AND

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:58.999
FRISKING GUN STORES?

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.601
WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT AND
SOMEHOW PUT IT ALL ON

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:05.438
COMMUNITIES WHEN THE TRUTH IS
THERE IS A GUN-RUNNING OPERATION

00:05:05.438 --> 00:05:08.875
THAT IS GOING ON IN THE SOUTH
THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT, BUT

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:10.810
NOBODY WILL IN ANY WAY ADDRESS.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.047
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A FIGHT WE HAVE TO
UNDERTAKE IN OUR COUNTRY.

00:05:14.047 --> 00:05:17.918
ASK THE LEADERSHIP, THE NYPD,
THEY WILL TELL YOU A SINGLE GUN

00:05:17.918 --> 00:05:21.254
RECENTLY CAME OUT OF GEORGIA,
RECIRCULATED FROM CRIME TO

00:05:21.254 --> 00:05:25.225
CRIME, USED IN VARIOUS SHOOTINGS
AROUND THE CITY, ONE GUN.

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:26.860
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'VE HEARD OF THAT,
THE ZIP GUN PROGRAM.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.895
(LAUGHTER)

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:32.966
YOU GET THE GUN, USE IT FOR
A CRIME AND OBVIOUSLY BRING IT

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:35.235
BACK AND SOMEBODY ELSE SIGNS
IT OUT.

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:36.369
&gt;&gt; VERY SOPHISTICATED.

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:37.204
(LAUGHTER)

00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:40.974
&gt;&gt; Jon: IT'S ABOUT RESOURCE -- 

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:45.545
BUT AGAIN, THEY KNOW THIS! AND
THEY KNOW THE PLACES THAT ARE

00:05:45.545 --> 00:05:48.748
DOING THIS, THEY KNOW PEOPLE
THAT ARE DOING IT BUT THEY ARE

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:53.019
UNABLE TO -- FOR ALL THE
SURVEILLANCE AND INFORMATION WE

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.622
HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU'RE
TELLING US YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:58.325
THE STUFF IS COMING FROM AND
WE CAN'T STOP IT?

00:05:58.325 --> 00:06:00.293
&gt;&gt; IT'S A POLITICAL WILL
QUESTION.

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:04.231
LOOK, IF I WAS GOING TO THINK
ABOUT THE BIG STRUCTURE OF HOW

00:06:04.231 --> 00:06:07.767
TO GET PROGRESSIVE CHANGE ON AN
ISSUE LIKE THAT, WE'RE NOT GOING

00:06:07.767 --> 00:06:10.804
TO GET TO CREATOR UNIT AS A
NATION ON AN ISSUE LIKE GUN

00:06:10.804 --> 00:06:13.406
CONTROL TILL WE DEAL WITH
ECONOMIC REALITY FIRST.

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:18.979
I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED WHEN YOU
GET TO PROGRESSIVE ECONOMICS,

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.982
YOU WILL UNIT PEOPLE ACROSS
REGIONS AND DIFFERENT

00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:24.384
BACKGROUNDS AND FAITHS AND THAT
MAY BE THE BEGINNING OF A MORE

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:34.327
COMMON POLITICS AND COMMON SET
OF VALUES THAT SOMEDAY MAY LEAD

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.663
TO THE REALIZATION THAT PEOPLE
WHO WANT THE RESPECT OR THE

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:38.765
RIGHT TO HAVE A FIREARM, THAT
DOES NOT HAVE TO EQUATE WITH A

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.734
SITUATION THAT LEADS TO FIREARMS
ENDING UP IN OUR STREETS,

00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:41.901
KILLING PEOPLE IN THE HANDS OF
CRIMINALS.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.638
THAT WILL TAKE A LOT OF
TRANSCENDENCE AND WORK, BUT I

00:06:44.638 --> 00:06:47.574
THINK ECONOMICS IS THE MOST
UNIFYING FORCE.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.210
&gt;&gt; Jon: IS THE WAY TO DO IT,
THEN, TO SAY WE HAVE TO CREATE

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.314
ECONOMIES WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES
THAT CAN COMBAT THE UNDERGROUND

00:06:54.314 --> 00:06:55.582
ECONOMIES IN THE COMMUNITIES.

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:56.750
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.052
&gt;&gt; Jon: IF I'M 10 YEARS OLD
AND I HAVE A CRAPPY PANTS AND

00:06:59.052 --> 00:07:00.954
SHIRT AND SEE SOME OTHER KID
THAT DOESN'T, I WILL BE OFF

00:07:00.954 --> 00:07:04.724
AND THINK, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
OUT.

00:07:04.724 --> 00:07:07.694
YOU HAVE TO FIND AN ECONOMIC WAY
TO COMPETE WITH THAT TO GIVE ANY

00:07:07.694 --> 00:07:09.729
HOPE TO IT.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:10.997
&gt;&gt; THAT'S IT, EXACTLY.

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:13.767
WHAT HAPPENED IN BALTIMORE, PART
OF IT WAS POLICE COMMUNICATIONS,

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.669
BUT A LOT ECONOMIC REALITY.

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:19.372
IF YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY OF
PEOPLE WHO HAVE RARELY SEEN

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:26.379
CONSISTENT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY,
YOU CANNOT BE SURPRISED IF THAT

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.515
COMMUNITY IS IN MANY WAYS
DISCONNECTED FROM THE LARGER

00:07:28.515 --> 00:07:29.716
SOCIETY AROUND IT.

00:07:29.716 --> 00:07:33.053
IF PEOPLE DON'T FEEL A SENSE OF
ECONOMIC HOPE, UNFORTUNATELY

00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:35.088
THAT'S WHERE CRIME BREEDS, WHERE
GANGS BREED.

00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:38.525
KIDS THAT KNOW THEY HAVE
OPPORTUNITY AHEAD ARE MUCH LESS

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:39.693
ATTRACTED TO GANGS.

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:41.594
ONE TIME I WAS IN THE SOUTH
BRONX AND A FORMER GANG MEMBER

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:42.996
SAID SOMETHING SIMPLE TO ME.

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:45.598
HE SAID RECOGNIZE THE FACT A LOT
OF KIDS IF THEY'RE CONVINCED

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:47.100
THERE'S NO HOPE UP AHEAD THEY'RE
NOT GETTING TO COLLEGE OR A

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:51.104
CAREER, THEN A GANG LOOKS
ATTRACTIVE, LOOKS LIKE A FAMILY

00:07:51.104 --> 00:07:52.739
AND A HOME.

00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:56.976
WE HAVE TO SHOW YOUNG PEOPLE
THERE IS A WAY FORWARD TO A

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.111
DECENT FUTURE.

00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:00.480
&gt;&gt; Jon: THIS IS THE SAME
CONVERSATION WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.849
HAVING ABOUT CALTIMORE 40 YEARS
AGO.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.151
LIBERAL AND DEMOCRATIC POLICIES
HAVE BEEN IN PLACE IN THOSE

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.419
AREAS.

00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:08.188
THEY WERE SAYING THE SAME THING,
WE HAVE TO BRING THE AREAS HOPE

00:08:08.188 --> 00:08:12.525
AND OPPORTUNITY, AND YET --

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:14.661
&gt;&gt; WELL, HERE'S THE PROBLEM
THAT WE JUST DEFINED A MOMENT

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.862
AGO.

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:18.665
IF -- PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GOING
BACKWARDS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:22.068
THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY
GOING BACKWARDS.

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:25.038
IF YOU'RE IN A POOR COMMUNITY,
THAT'S HITTING YOU HARDER.

00:08:25.038 --> 00:08:28.441
WAGES HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE
COST OF LIVING.

00:08:28.441 --> 00:08:30.210
OPPORTUNITY IS MORE CONSTRAINED.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.714
WE'RE IN THE STRONG GROWTH AREAS
IN THE ECONOMY, WALM-MART AND

00:08:34.714 --> 00:08:37.517
OTHER PLACES THAT PAY A VERY LOW
WAGE.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.651
SO, NO, WE HAVE NOT.

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.553
WE'VE INVESTED IN CERTAIN
PROGRAMS, SOME WORKED BETTER,

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:43.456
SOME WORSE, BUT WE HAVNE'T BUIT
AN ECONOMY THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:44.557
INCLUSIVE.

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.860
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHAT'S NICE IS IT
SHOWS IN TERMS OF ECONOMICS.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.861
THEY TALK ABOUT TRICKLE DOWN
ECONOMICS.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:53.533
POVERTY TRICK ALSO DOWN, NOT
RICHES.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.667
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:55.802
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN
EXPERIENCING FOR A LONG TIME AND

00:08:55.802 --> 00:08:59.005
THAT'S WHY ADDRESSING INCOME
INEQUALITY HEAD ON, TALKING

00:08:59.005 --> 00:09:02.342
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT
POLITICAL REALITY IS JUST NOT

00:09:02.342 --> 00:09:03.977
WORKING IS WHERE WE'LL FIND A
BREAKTHROUGH.

00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:09.049
&gt;&gt; Jon: THEN YOU WILL FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO STAY --

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.950
&gt;&gt; I SAID INCOME INEQUALITY NOT
HEIGHT INEQUALITY.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.954
&gt;&gt; Jon: SON OF A BITCH.
