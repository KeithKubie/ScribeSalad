00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.330
So when we say that something deviates from

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.689
specified behavior, we really are talking about three different

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.610
things. One is faults, another is errors, and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.230
another is failure. So let's now define each one

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.980
of these three to see where the difference

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.490
is. A fault is when something in the system

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.237
deviates from specified behavior. An error is when

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:25.345
the actual behavior somewhere within the system differs from

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:27.957
the specified behavior. The behavior that

00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:31.230
should be happening within the system. And

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.240
the failure occurs when the system

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.670
deviates from specified behavior for that system.
