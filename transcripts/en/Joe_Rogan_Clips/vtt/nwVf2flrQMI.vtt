1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.370
You skipped past this.
A beat.
Oh,
Jeremy Stephens.
Yeah.
Which I thought crazy.

2
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.360
Crazy and no,
I mean for as a beat to beat the number six here in the world.
Yeah,

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.230
it was good.
Good,
fine.
What'd you think?
Um,

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.910
I didn't think it helps a beet stock because there's so much hype on him.

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.560
You didn't think you look hungry.
I really,
well,
first of all,

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.850
he's fighting Jeremy.
Steve Agree.
Jeremy Stevens is fucking dangerous.

7
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:29.890
You can't pass any mistakes with that guy.
Zero.
You're getting locked out.

8
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:31.290
You look good.
I thought,
I thought I looked okay.

9
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:33.510
I didn't think it stock went through the roof with that fight.

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.730
You didn't walk away from that fight going,
oh my God,

11
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:38.730
I can't wait to see him fight again.
What?
That will look good.
But when you,

12
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.920
when you hear Mark Henry's coach talk about them.

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.650
I mean they talk about him like he's the next fucking,

14
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.330
did you see that three 60 roundhouse kick?
He tried.
Yeah.
That missed

15
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.310
this shit so fast.
He's really fast and his,

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.810
his round kick to the body is just so fast.
Like lightning.
Amazing.

17
00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:59.880
Throw such a tech.
Such a talent.
Yeah.

18
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.380
So technical to everything he does is very smooth.
Doesn't get head,

19
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.400
doesn't play that game.
No,
no.

20
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.890
It doesn't play the game that Cody Garbrandt played with Pedro.

21
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.060
Cody fight was crazy.
I just losses in a row.
Three,
nine,

22
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.630
three Kaos in a row.
I just couldn't believe he was standing with him like that.

23
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.670
He got them hurt and then he got hurt and then he was determined to take him out

24
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:23.400
and then they were literally going right hand,

25
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.760
right hand or right hand till someone fell.
Yeah.

26
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.290
And Pedro can take a shot.
So can Cody.
Yeah.
I hate shots.

27
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.070
He ate some big ones,
but it makes no sense if you're Cody.
So technical.

28
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.720
I know it doesn't make any sense the head,

29
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.540
but he said he got head button than just saw Rett.
But he definitely did.

30
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.810
He definitely got headbutted.
Aaron Peko Ish.
And he talked about it.

31
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.140
He said he saw red,
like got angry after that had bought it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

32
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:49.110
You can't do that.
Yeah.
You got to fight and tell it.
I mean,

33
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.000
obviously it's super easy for us to say,
you know,
sitting here drinking coffee.

34
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.840
Yeah,
don't fight it.
Don't fight her angry bro.
You know,
it's easy to say,

35
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.830
but that's also what makes him so dynamic.
Agree.
It's what got them to the party.

36
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:06.300
But as a former fighter,
it's like coming off two losses,
which I've been there.

37
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.570
You're usually a little more like,
I'm not going to go down that road.

38
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.710
I've been knocked out twice.
I know how that ends.
If I get hit,

39
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.860
let's learn from our mistakes.
That's what's the troubling part.
Yeah.
And He,
uh,

40
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.140
he has a speed advantage.
Patrell monies.
I was very good timing,

41
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:26.370
but I think Colby has a speed advantage technique and speed on the feet on the

42
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:29.880
ground.
It's all Pedro on the feed out here all day.
I mean,

43
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.600
Cody Garbrandt still only 27 years old and still could be world champion again.

44
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.350
No,
no doubt about it.
Well,
three losses.
Pedro Munoz.
Okay.

45
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.160
You played that game laws.
But then the other two are Tj Dillashaw.
Okay.

46
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.050
Still the champ as your number.
Who gives a fuck.

47
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.860
And in both of those fights he hurt Tj Dillashaw.

48
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.500
He's just gotta be more cautious and fight more technical.
More disciplined.
Yeah.

49
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.400
You know,
I mean,
wouldn't be a bad idea to get some mental coaching,

50
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.490
you know,
get some game plan coaching,
which he might've doing.
I don't know.
Yeah,

51
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.720
I don't know.
I'm just speculating.

52
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.110
I don't know who he's training his striking with either.
But you know,

53
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.280
to mix things up more and be more unpredictable would also be a good thing.

54
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:11.650
I mean,
obviously the,
the last exchanges,

55
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:15.760
we're just not predictable at all or I mean not unpredictable at all.

56
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:20.590
Fully predictable.
Just right hand,
right hand,
right hand.
Just chaos.
You know,

57
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.160
what is his last one?
He beat Dominick Cruz,
which is,

58
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:27.070
you've got to be cerebral in that fight to be done.
The cruise.
Yeah,

59
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:30.520
he had Dom's number.
I mean it was a different kind of fun.
It's interesting.

60
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:34.420
Dom said that he did the exact thing that Cody did in their fight,

61
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.230
that he got hit and he got emotional and he fought reckless dom and Tom went

62
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:41.260
after Cody.
That interesting.
Yeah.
He said,
I know what it's like.
You just,

63
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:45.010
you lose your game plan.
You start,
you get wild.
Yeah.

64
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.030
It's just,
it's hard to see him get Kayo three times in a row like fat.

65
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.480
He's going to be fine.
I hope so.
He's going to be fun.
I hope so.

66
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.700
He'll learn from it.
But here's the thing,
when you're ranked,

67
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.820
was he number two in that division?
It's not like,
all right,

68
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.470
let's give you a warm up fight.
Boxing.
There's no warmups.
Right?

69
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.470
He's going to get Jimmy Rivera or fucking stir aljamain.
Hell,
Jermaine.
