JAKOB KALBFELL:
Welcome everybody.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.500
My name is Jakob Kalbfell.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.630
I am part of the Play
business development

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.730
team based in Berlin.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.190
And I'm happy to have you
here at this late hour

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.050
for the last session of the day.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.370
We call it the graveyard shift.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.490
Please stay awake, bear
with us a little bit longer.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.850
We're the only three people
between you and the bar,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.890
so that should
give you some hope.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.096
There's light at the
end of the tunnel.

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:25.720
The topic of the
panelists have already

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.870
been communicated
to you by Tamzin--

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.440
driving conversions
on Android apps.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.990
Now what are conversions?

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.290
Conversions are, in my
opinion, the essence

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.260
of what all of you
guys here are doing.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.570
The best possible
outcome, the result,

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.730
of a good job within the
buckets of quality apps,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.669
engagement, retention, churn.

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:52.210
If you get all of
those things right,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.210
the conversion will come up.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.770
However, a conversion is
not necessarily a purchase.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:06.440
And a conversion can happen
all along the user journey.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.926
Think about your own user
journey during a normal day.

00:01:09.926 --> 00:01:11.050
You wake up in the morning.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.550
You turn off the alarm lock.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.360
You check the news.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.276
You check the weather.

00:01:14.276 --> 00:01:16.420
You check your messages,
your e-mails, your snaps,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.880
your tweets, your
arranged dates.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.810
You work out.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.220
You pay for lunch.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.630
You hail a cab.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.760
You do some shopping.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.130
You buy gems for
your favorite games.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.400
All of those interactions
can be conversions

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.500
to the respective developers.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.760
Moments of opportunity.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.450
So there are loads and
loads of different types

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.090
of conversions on Android apps.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.520
And in general, you
can categorize them

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.960
and distinguish by two types.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.030
One is on-platform,
happening on the smartphone

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.860
within the app or the game.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.870
And the second one is
off-platform, triggered

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.980
by something on the smartphone
or in the app or the game,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.720
but happening in the real world.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.120
So I had a lot of
conversations over last weeks

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.530
with developers--

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.170
what could be interesting for
them to listen to in this panel

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.190
and to discuss
around conversions.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.490
And the statement or
the feedback reconfirmed

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.400
my viewpoint that conversions
is something that cannot be

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.180
thought about one-dimensionally
by us having one KPI.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.550
It's a multidimensional issue.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.144
And for that, I tried to
structure it in four buckets.

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:29.810
And again, I'm going
to put the fingers.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.180
Number one is the basics.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.040
So anything that's around the
definition, the prioritization,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.030
the correlations, the
interdependencies of KPIs.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.990
The second bucket is everything
around organizational issues.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.370
So anything that
goes with processes,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.240
workflows, team structure,
and so on and so forth.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.140
The third bucket is what you
would have expected this panel

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.240
to be about after all--

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.450
anything that's
in-product optimization.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.250
So UX, UI, behavioral design,
hooking, nudging, anything.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.280
The fourth bucket is around
out-of-product optimizations

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.230
or anything that's
happening outside

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.210
of the product in the funnel,
influencing your conversion.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.899
Luckily, I have found two
very interesting partners

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.190
that have an amazing story
to tell to all of those four

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.880
buckets, whilst at
the same time being

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.550
from completely different
industries, completely

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.010
different business models,
and different stages

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.790
in their company lifecycle.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.340
On the one hand, I'm having
Niklas Jansen, who one

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.470
of the co-founders of Blinkist.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.110
Blinkist is an education
startup based out

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.620
of Berlin that takes the
content of non-fiction books,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.410
distills it into small little
packs that can be consumed

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.200
while reading or
listening to, and then

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.390
creates knowledge for the user.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.060
Niklas is responsible
for product strategy

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.382
and ensures that the culture is
flourishing in his own words.

00:03:56.382 --> 00:03:58.090
On the other hand,
I'm welcoming on-stage

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.550
with me Andrea Trocino.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.100
He is the director for
technology, web, and apps

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.910
for ASOS, a multinational
shopping destination.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.080
Huge business.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.400
He and his teams are looking
after the products within web

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.160
and apps, and trying to
build an amazing shopping

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.470
experience for all of
their users globally.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.480
So without further ado,
please welcome with me

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.310
on-stage Niklas and Andrea.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.770
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.180
Hello.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.374
Cool.

00:04:35.374 --> 00:04:36.540
Thanks for joining us, guys.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.170
I'm actually going
to pass this on.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.670
So we've had a lot
of conversations.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.380
And by now, we actually
know each other quite well.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.750
So without further ado,
directly into the basics.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.920
Before I started
our conversations,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.660
I thought that the
topic of conversions

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.329
could be a very easy one.

00:04:56.329 --> 00:04:58.370
At Blinkist, you're trying
to sell subscriptions.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.390
And at ASOS, you're trying
to sell fashion, right.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.760
Now unfortunately, or
fortunately you could say,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.110
I've kind of been--

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.750
well, this premature
assumption wasn't correct

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.360
and it's a little bit more
complicated than that.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.540
Andrea, I'm going
to ask you first--

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.790
what are the basics of how you
look at the conversion topic

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.217
at ASOS?

00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:22.550
ANDREA TROCINO: Hello, everyone.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.640
And before I start, I want
to say to my Google Now

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.574
was trying to suggest how to
say good evening in German

00:05:28.574 --> 00:05:29.990
and actually, I
already forgot it.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.380
So that's a really,
really bad start.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.210
But I think what I can start
with is first point-- that data

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.050
and machine learning are
much better than humans

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.710
at learning and giving
you the right inputs.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.327
So I'm particularly
happy to join the topic

00:05:45.327 --> 00:05:46.910
about the conversion
rate because it's

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.420
been one of my personal crusades
in the last couple of years

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.927
in my career.

00:05:51.927 --> 00:05:54.260
For those of you who are not
familiar with an e-commerce

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.860
business, the conversion
rate is defined as simply

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.610
as the number of orders divided
by the number of visits.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.230
And one of the easiest
way to win an argument

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.510
and explain to people like
Jakob how conversion rate is not

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.820
the holy grail of an
e-commerce is just

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.680
making an example of
if you have a company

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.720
A, making 5 orders
out of 10 visits,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.925
or you have a company B, making
6 orders out of 20 visits,

00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:22.550
you'll probably say
the conversion rate

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.460
of the company A is better.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.560
But actually, if you
really think about it

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.390
for like 2 or 3 seconds,
you will probably

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.030
want to imitate the company
B. Because it doesn't matter

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.446
how many visits you get, it
doesn't matter how many orders

00:06:34.446 --> 00:06:37.020
you get, as long as get
the most of both of them.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.790
So that's why I think conversion
rate has to be put in context.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.634
This is why at ASOS, we
look at conversion rate.

00:06:43.634 --> 00:06:45.050
Obviously, it's
one of the metric.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.758
But then, we also
care-- and actually, we

00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:48.740
care most-- about
the engagement.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.380
That's what for
our Android apps,

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.960
we look at active installs,
monthly active users,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.070
the frequency-- how often they
come back to our properties--

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.270
and how much time they
spend when they are in app.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.040
And then, you take
all these metrics

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.630
and you do your
product optimization

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.390
based on the customer lifecycle,
rather than a single metric

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.789
like the conversion rate.

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:09.080
JAKOB KALBFELL: But do you
prioritize them at all then?

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.330
ANDREA TROCINO: Yes, for sure.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.750
When you are in a company
with 4,000 people,

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.650
you need to give a
clear prioritization.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.400
Otherwise, you're going
to have bombarding

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.630
by every single person with
a top idea for your product.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.250
So we give priority based
on a number of metric.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.635
Again, that could be revenue--

00:07:23.635 --> 00:07:25.635
from a revenue point of
view, from an engagement

00:07:25.635 --> 00:07:28.490
point of view, from a brand
awareness point of view,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.420
and also have to do
legal requirements.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.070
We do a combination of
metrics and once a month, we

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.640
do a prioritization session
across the whole company.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.515
NIKLAS JANSEN: I'm very
happy that we are not

00:07:38.515 --> 00:07:40.300
4,000 people at the moment.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.897
ANDREA TROCINO: That
makes things much easier.

00:07:42.897 --> 00:07:45.230
JAKOB KALBFELL: So how does
this look like at Blinkist--

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.431
this user-centric approach?

00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:49.430
NIKLAS JANSEN: So what
you said in the beginning

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.138
that of course, one
of our business goals

00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:52.879
is to sell subscriptions--
that's true.

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:53.670
That's very simple.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.970
But the way to sell
subscription is probably

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.520
much more complex than just
looking at a conversion rate

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.630
as a KPI.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.930
So we don't think about
conversion as just one KPI.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.100
We think of conversion as a
user journey, which starts off

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.282
in the app store
and ends at a point

00:08:09.282 --> 00:08:11.240
where the person makes
a decision, OK, Blinkist

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.850
is a product I want to spend
money on because it really

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.430
brings me value and is
something I want to use

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.210
on a daily, weekly basis.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.290
So when we look at conversion
or at the outcome of conversion,

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.850
we think of this journey.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.820
There are a lot of small
micro-conversions along the way

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.650
and you can optimize
a lot of them

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.960
with the goal of
creating the outcome that

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.820
is selling a subscription.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.340
So the way we approach
it is there are plenty

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:35.990
of what we call proxy KPIs.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.080
So we think-- like caveats
that happen very early

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.990
in the funnel for example,
where we say if this happens,

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.780
a user is much more likely
to convert afterwards.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.581
The conversion is the outcome
that we measure the success

00:08:47.581 --> 00:08:48.080
based on.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.330
But we would much
rather optimize

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.650
for micro-conversions
along the way, which

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.474
then lead to a subscription.

00:08:54.474 --> 00:08:56.390
So for example, one thing
we tried at Blinkist

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.960
is that instead of
just looking at screens

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.610
of flows that would
directly lead to conversion,

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.430
we try to map the
whole user flow.

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.100
Beginning at the app
store, to the onboarding,

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.460
to the first user experience,
to the up-sell flow,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.442
and really try to understand
what is the user going through,

00:09:13.442 --> 00:09:15.650
what they are experiencing,
what is holding them back

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.270
from making a purchase decision.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.400
And then optimize
these step-by-step.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.830
And these optimizations,
in the end,

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.110
lead up to a higher
conversion rate.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.720
And maybe it will be very
interesting to understand

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.240
how we work as that--

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.960
I think for product people, the
app store-- the app store page,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.270
especially-- is something
you don't spend much time

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.960
thinking of because it's often
taken care by marketing teams.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.030
We actually tried to bring
together the marketing

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.850
team, the product development
team, even the content team

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.580
to look at the whole funnel
together and then prioritize

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.714
experiments together
that would then lead

00:09:47.714 --> 00:09:48.880
to a higher conversion rate.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.755
JAKOB KALBFELL: And also
the formal structure

00:09:50.755 --> 00:09:51.700
is then accordingly?

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.375
NIKLAS JANSEN: So yes, I would
say there are two ways we like.

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:55.750
First, the product
development is

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.810
structured in full-stack teams
around our main business themes

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.942
that are new user activation
and subscriber engagement.

00:10:01.942 --> 00:10:03.400
So we want to
convert people and we

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.066
want to keep them as
a lifetime customer

00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:06.250
once they're converted.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.599
But at the same time, the
product development teams

00:10:08.599 --> 00:10:10.390
work very closely with
the marketing teams.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.015
For example, they
have weekly check-ins

00:10:12.015 --> 00:10:15.610
where they look at data together
and prioritize experiments

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.290
to run.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:17.300
JAKOB KALBFELL: OK, and
how are those two teams

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.740
staffed then, if I can ask?

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.200
NIKLAS JANSEN: The
product teams--

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.110
they are staffed, as
you say, full-stack.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.990
So they have mobile engineers,
they have for-mobile engineers.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.900
For each team, they
have a project manager,

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.769
they have a designer, and
they have a creative person.

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:32.560
JAKOB KALBFELL: OK.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.820
Andrea, how is it--

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.870
now obviously, ASOS is a
lot bigger than Blinkist--

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.820
how is your
organizational structure

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.190
effected by the way you
look at conversions at ASOS?

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.560
ANDREA TROCINO: So the
numbers are slightly bigger,

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.910
but the concept I think is
quite similar in the end.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:51.490
So we divide our technology
based on our architecture.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:53.530
So we have a micro-service
architecture.

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.530
So we have a number of what we
call platform themes looking

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.546
after every single,
let's say, service

00:10:59.546 --> 00:11:00.670
in the e-commerce platform.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.150
So you can imagine the payment
service, the product service,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.610
the subscription
services, et cetera.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:08.290
And then, we have in
the front-end teams

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.540
like the iOS team, the Android
team, and the web team.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.280
So that could bring a little
bit of more separation from what

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.660
Niklas was describing.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.980
But actually, what we do
is we stitch all together

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.720
with our product buckets.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.330
So we look at the-- as I
was saying at the beginning,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.310
we look at the
customer lifecycle

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.010
and we split the our
activities and our products

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:28.880
in three phases.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.020
The first phase is discovery,
then there is fulfillment,

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.940
and then there is retention.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.860
The discovery is
all about how you

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.700
bring new customers or lapsed
customers to our properties.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.580
How you show them what's
new in the platform, what's

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.220
new for them, and how
you can inspire them

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.220
through our content,
campaigns, and products.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.300
Then is fulfillment.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.910
Fulfillment is once you've
been very, very inspired

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:54.400
and you really know what you
want, what you are after,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.850
then is everything starts after.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.210
So everything about making your
purchase the safest possible,

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:03.340
giving you the most important
and relevant information,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.980
like suggesting you
your recommended size

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.290
or giving you all the product
information, the assets,

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.300
videos, et cetera
about that product.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.500
And then, all the
checkout process--

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.704
making it as
frictionless as possible.

00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:16.120
And then, there's
the last bucket.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.030
The last bucket is how
you build the relationship

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.030
after the purchase.

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.750
So how you can bring
back the engagement.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.930
How you can help them to engage
with you like checking where

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.740
is the parcel, getting
what's new in the ASPS world,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.440
what else can be engaged in
them from a loyalties game

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.040
point of view.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.780
So all the activities
that are meant

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.010
to bring that engagement
back after the conversion

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.060
is already done.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.660
JAKOB KALBFELL:
And so you told me

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.835
you have 900 people in
the tech segment in ASOS.

00:12:42.835 --> 00:12:44.710
How do you make sure
that all of those people

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.320
then stay in sync
with this structure?

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.220
ANDREA TROCINO: I wish I know a
silver bullet for this answer.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.589
So the reality is
we tend to do--

00:12:54.589 --> 00:12:56.630
I'll say that we work
very, very closely together

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:57.255
across the business.

00:12:57.255 --> 00:12:58.921
This is one of the
views of the company.

00:12:58.921 --> 00:13:01.610
So we tend to have
a bi-weekly session

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.270
with all the management, with
the data and analytics guys.

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.404
We work on a monthly
prioritization session,

00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:10.820
to make sure that we are all
aligned to the top priorities

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:11.840
of the business.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.720
And we tend to use every
single tool possible, in terms

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.480
of communication, to
keep everyone engaged

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.924
with this is what's
going on, this

00:13:17.924 --> 00:13:20.340
is what is going to be in beta
for the internal employees,

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.990
this is what is
going to be in beta

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:23.355
for new customers, et cetera.

00:13:23.355 --> 00:13:26.960
So we're trying to spread as
much communication as we can.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.799
JAKOB KALBFELL: OK, cool.

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:30.590
Niklas, actually, one
more question to you.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.520
So I know that
traditionally, you've--

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.020
well, originally, you followed
the very traditional approach

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.190
in terms of team structure.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.773
And you only changed
to that structure

00:13:38.773 --> 00:13:40.452
you described recently
and that this was

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:41.660
a challenge at the beginning.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.120
You want to talk a
little bit about--

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.720
well, first of all, the
reasons why you changed?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.890
And then secondly,
the challenges

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.030
and how you overcame them.

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.863
NIKLAS JANSEN: Sure.

00:13:47.863 --> 00:13:50.090
So I think the
main reason why we

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.440
did it can be summarized in
one word, which is pizza.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.549
The long answer to
that question is

00:13:56.549 --> 00:13:58.590
so we kept growing as a
product development team.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:01.550
And at some point you have
10, 12 engineers, 2, 3 product

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.400
managers, 3 or 4 designers.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.847
And the team just got too big.

00:14:04.847 --> 00:14:06.680
And there's this pizza
rule from Jeff Bezos,

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.610
the founder of Amazon.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.859
He says, if a team gets too
big that you can't feed it

00:14:09.859 --> 00:14:12.800
with more than two pizzas,
you should split the team.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.482
And we were at this point where
we said, OK, either we can--

00:14:15.482 --> 00:14:16.940
we have to split
the team in a way.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.523
And then, we thought, OK, what's
the best way to split a team.

00:14:19.523 --> 00:14:22.240
We said, OK, let's organize the
team around our business goals,

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.370
or our main themes which are
activation and retention.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.430
So that was the main
idea-- that every team has

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.650
a mission they can
follow and really

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.810
work towards a shared
purpose as a team,

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.082
and not only doing features.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:36.290
I think is very important,
especially for developers,

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.920
that they know that the
features they're building,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.490
what they're paying towards.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:42.710
And the second reason
was we believed

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.980
that it could paralyze output.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.910
So in the past, we
would always have

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.430
to prioritize experiments
either for conversion

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.340
or for retention.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.170
And now, having two teams
that can run independently

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:59.100
allows us to ship experiments
on both sides at the same time.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.305
Challenges-- of course is huge.

00:15:01.305 --> 00:15:02.930
There's much more
communication needed.

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.190
Because suddenly,
you have teams that

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.630
run independently,
but still work

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:09.960
on the same code base needed
a shared release process.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.460
And I would say, probably
the release process

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.670
was the biggest challenge.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.540
Coordinating different releases,
different feature branches,

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:18.590
bring it together so
that you can, in the end,

00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:20.545
release one version
to the stores.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:22.670
JAKOB KALBFELL: And that
actually leads us directly

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.200
to the next bucket.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.790
For all of you who
paid attention,

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:28.030
we just discussed bucket
number one, the basics,

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.139
and two, which is the
organizational pieces.

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:32.180
And we're going to move
on now to three and four.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:35.000
So next part, the second
part, of the panel

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.450
is about the experimentation,
the nitty-gritty stuff,

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:43.230
and the secret sauce of what
you guys were finding out

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.070
during all of the
testing that is happening

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.730
at all times in your businesses.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.839
So in product
optimization testing,

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:53.630
obviously there are
loads of different ways

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.940
to find success for each
of your own businesses,

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.780
which is why that the examples
we picked between ASOS

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.090
and Blinkist are only
examples to inspire you

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.610
and to take home with you
for potential opportunity

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.790
to test within your
own businesses.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.560
Niklas, we've been
working together

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.110
a couple of months back, with
your teams and our teams,

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.930
on a project where we
applied behavioral design

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:16.790
principles that were
presented earlier

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.636
by my colleague [? Jenny, ?]
to your business

00:16:19.636 --> 00:16:21.760
and where you did some
experimentation around that.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.267
Do you want to talk about this
and I hand you the clicker?

00:16:24.267 --> 00:16:25.100
NIKLAS JANSEN: Sure.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.180
So I wrote one experiment.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.530
I brought this mainly
for two reasons.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.930
The first reason
is why it's very

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.870
interesting is because it
shows a change in how the way

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:37.540
we approach experiments
at Blinkist.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.570
So in the past, we
have been focusing

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.060
on a lot of small
experiments, just

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.630
like changing one
variable at a time

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.410
and see what the outcome is.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.730
But realized as a
company, we haven't really

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.120
found the perfect flow for us.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.270
We thought let's try
bigger experiments.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.580
Let's have something that
can really move the needle

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.110
and try more of those.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.669
And we don't really care
if we change 10 variables

00:16:57.669 --> 00:16:58.460
in this experiment.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.650
All we care about is that
the outcome, for example,

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.060
the conversion rate
goes up in the end.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.393
Because in the end, you can
make a lot of assumptions of

00:17:04.393 --> 00:17:06.619
why something goes up, but
what matters eventually

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:07.719
is that something goes up.

00:17:07.719 --> 00:17:09.260
The second reason
why I bring up this

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.690
is because it's exactly
what Jakob mentioned--

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.169
there are some psychological
triggers we analyzed

00:17:15.169 --> 00:17:18.020
and why this experiment
worked in the end.

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.839
So what you see here is
all the onboarding flow.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.780
This is what happens
right after you sign up.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.710
You get in.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.970
You get a 24-hour
trial right away.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.560
You don't have to
opt-in for anything.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.910
There is no strings attached.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:32.072
You can use the product
for 24 hours for free

00:17:32.072 --> 00:17:33.530
and after that,
you have to upgrade

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.056
to keep using the product.

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:38.180
This was great because
there's no strings attached.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.850
It's very transparent for the
user what they can get out.

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.820
They can use the product
on their own time.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:45.470
At the same time,
24 hours is quite

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:48.180
like it's not enough
time to use the product

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.290
and people were still
a little bit confused.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.130
And what we mostly
lost is this urgency.

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:55.460
So people can use it.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.980
They can come back
seven days later,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.990
but there's nothing
where you say,

00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.531
OK, no, I have to
subscribe or, no, I

00:17:59.531 --> 00:18:02.337
have to re-buy a subscription.

00:18:02.337 --> 00:18:04.670
So what we changed is-- this
is the new onboarding flow.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.128
And as you can see, there are
a lot of things that changed.

00:18:07.128 --> 00:18:09.150
The first thing is that
the layout changed.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.210
The pop-up changed.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.310
The subscription screen--
how we start a subscription.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:15.670
So we promote them changed.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.560
But most importantly,
what changed

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.720
was that we changed
from this 24 hour,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.360
no strings attached free trial
to a 7 day purchase no trial.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.080
So I'm not sure if I have
the right words for that,

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.200
but what Google
Play offers you is

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.930
that a user can start this
free trial for 7 or 30 days.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.669
But after the 7 days or 30
days, their subscription

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:39.460
is automatically turned
into a subscription

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.730
if they don't cancel
within the seven days.

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.355
It's a very similar to what you
know from Netflix, for example,

00:18:44.355 --> 00:18:46.810
when you subscribe for the
first 30 days free trial.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.940
After those 30 days,
if you didn't cancel,

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.480
you become a subscriber.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.390
So we changed this model to a
completely different free trial

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.890
model.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.200
Longer free trial period.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.420
It turns out ultimately
in a subscription.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.640
We changed the UI.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.310
And we saw more than 50%
increase in d10 conversion rate

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.110
and in average revenue per user.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.390
The thing is we can't
really tell you why that is.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.806
Like there are a
lot of the things

00:19:11.806 --> 00:19:16.370
we changed, but what we see it
really increased the revenue.

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.379
So the takeaways from this
is the one side obviously,

00:19:19.379 --> 00:19:21.170
it was like a really
large-scale hypothesis

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.900
we tested here, that for
us, worked really well.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.059
Instead of just doing very
incremental optimization,

00:19:28.059 --> 00:19:29.600
if you change the
flow, it can really

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.940
change the mechanics of
your funnel completely.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.710
If you look at the
distribution curve--

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.180
so in the past, you see a
lot of the purchases happened

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.680
after the first month actually.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.200
So now most of the purchases,
more than nearly 50%

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.480
of the purchases, happen
in the first month.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.210
Actually, most of the purchases
happen on the first day

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:48.230
in the first session.

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:49.695
So most people
start a free trial

00:19:49.695 --> 00:19:51.757
and still stick around
and become a subscriber.

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:54.090
So the whole funnel changed
completely, which of course,

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.900
is a new challenge for marketing
and for product communication.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.350
But we now have a
new playing field

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.880
for what we can optimize from.

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:04.370
So we dared to do a big change--

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.390
I would encourage everyone
to do big changes--

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.617
and just tried to be
transparent, build trust.

00:20:10.617 --> 00:20:13.200
And I think one big learning was
as well-- like the old model,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.330
though we perceived
it as very fair,

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.210
users didn't really
get that it's fair.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.427
The new model is a little
bit less fair, you can say,

00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.260
but it's more transparent
because people are

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.077
used to this flow for example.

00:20:24.077 --> 00:20:25.160
JAKOB KALBFELL: Very cool.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.210
Really good insights.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.390
Thanks for sharing.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:31.580
Andrea, now at ASOS, I assume
given the size of the company,

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.080
there are always
AB tests going on

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.136
and you picked one
or two special ones.

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:36.010
ANDREA TROCINO: Yeah.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.960
So I really like to make my
points or to win my arguments,

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.300
so I picked a
couple of tests that

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.630
are very, very controversial.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.870
So please bear with me the
last 10 minutes of the session.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.530
So what I wanted to
show you is a couple

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.810
of tests that were done
in the Android app.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.870
And the first one is about
the having proposition banners

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:54.950
in the product page.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:56.810
What we mean by the
proposition is mostly

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.980
referred to the
delivery solution.

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.900
And we picked a
couple of examples.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.110
One is our premier delivery.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.290
It's similar to another big
company called prime something.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.350
And they is a yearly
subscription in which you

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.570
get next-day delivery for free.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.910
And the second one was just
the banners say, actually

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:16.550
for your orders, you're going to
get free delivery and returns.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.730
As you can see down at numbers
somewhere on the screen,

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:22.869
the first banner drove
a crazy amount of visits

00:21:22.869 --> 00:21:24.410
to the premier
delivery subscription.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.390
Now that tells,
obviously, people

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.310
want to know more
about the subscription.

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.140
And actually, probably
their awareness

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.244
wasn't great up to that point.

00:21:32.244 --> 00:21:34.160
And the second, actually--
the second banner--

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.785
the free delivery
and returns-- brought

00:21:35.785 --> 00:21:38.120
to a less engagement in
terms of going and tapping

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.230
on the banner.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.330
But in terms of the
overall results,

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:46.040
the second banner was the one
bringing a conversion rate

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.460
increasement-- an increase.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.460
So which one would you take?

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.252
I think everyone will
go for the second one

00:21:52.252 --> 00:21:53.751
because obviously,
it's the one that

00:21:53.751 --> 00:21:54.920
is bringing more money home.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.130
But actually, what we did is
we went completely for option C

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:01.100
and we decided to build a much
more complex solution of having

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:04.370
like a segmentation
across our customers

00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:06.182
and targeting each
type of customers

00:22:06.182 --> 00:22:07.390
with a different proposition.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:10.220
So if we know that a customer
has already shopped with us

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.130
and is most likely to be in
the premier subscription,

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:14.402
we serve that message.

00:22:14.402 --> 00:22:15.860
If actually is a
brand new customer

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.443
that doesn't have
any history with us,

00:22:17.443 --> 00:22:18.890
we server the other banner.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.720
So that was the first trick.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.190
Now the second trick
is about pushing people

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.250
to add to basket.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.790
This is like if you talk
to every single designer,

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:30.570
they will always
try to sell you,

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.530
we need to make the main
action more prominent.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.280
We need to have this
made very, very easy.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.404
You know like, even if you
stumble with your phone,

00:22:36.404 --> 00:22:37.737
you need to tap add to bag.

00:22:37.737 --> 00:22:38.820
So that's what we've done.

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.700
So we've done a
couple of variation.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:42.740
And for most of our
products obviously, you

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.510
need to select the size before
going to the add the product

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:46.460
to the bag.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.850
So we're done two variation.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.782
One was to have a sticky--

00:22:49.782 --> 00:22:50.990
actually, it doesn't really--

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.573
I think we cut a
little bit of slides.

00:22:52.573 --> 00:22:54.200
But basically, it
was a sticky button

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.440
to have the add to bag button
on one side in variant one.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.940
And a sticky bottom to select
your size on the variant two.

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.910
Now the outcome
of both variation

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.210
drove higher
engagement with people

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:10.490
adding to bag because you
are making the action just

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:11.840
in their face.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.910
And then again, if
you look at the KPI

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.800
of this test in isolation
and if you think,

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.050
my objective was to drive
more people to add to bag--

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:19.730
thumbs up.

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.380
Pick one, is a success.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.390
I think number two
has got 14%, so we

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.400
should develop number two.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.900
When you open your
eyes and you look

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.316
at the whole picture of what
are you doing to the customer

00:23:29.316 --> 00:23:31.240
behavior, then
what we experienced

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.830
is that there was no
change in the orders.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:37.730
And actually for an e-commerce
platform like ours in which we

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:42.200
have a huge variety of products
and our catalogs is super

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.480
quick-- so every 12 weeks,
we change completely all

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.010
of our products on the website--

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.830
our stock availability is one of
those things that triggers you,

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.020
a little bit of pressure,
in ordering something.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.570
That's why when we add
something to the bag,

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.780
we reserve the stock
for you for 60 minutes.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.266
So if you succeed
with this experiment,

00:23:59.266 --> 00:24:00.890
you're bringing
people-- pushing people

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.810
to add more stuff to the bag.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:04.374
They're not buying
eventually more.

00:24:04.374 --> 00:24:06.290
What's happening is
you're reducing the chance

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.910
for other people to buy.

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.670
So all of this to trying to say
basically, when you do a test,

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.180
you need to be very clear on
what's the KPI on the test,

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:16.950
but you also need to have
a clear view of what else

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:22.320
is impacting the customer
behavior or the experience.

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.680
JAKOB KALBFELL: Wow, OK.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.310
That's a lot of input.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.810
Very good.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.370
So we're at the end of--

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.180
ANDREA TROCINO: I think I
covered bucket three and four.

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.030
JAKOB KALBFELL: We did
buckets three and four, yeah.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.180
We're at the end of
our time, actually.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.580
And I think we should--

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.120
time's up.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.240
There is the sign.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:39.740
Perfect.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.210
So that was a lot of input
and good examples obviously,

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.066
on how to optimize
in your product.

00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:46.690
We didn't get to do
around the product,

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.065
but there is a
lot of information

00:24:48.065 --> 00:24:50.990
on that as well that we're
going to release later on.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.040
I think what's interesting
and I think that's for me

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.490
the main takeaway is
look at it holistically.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.180
Don't look at one KPI and don't
isolate KPIs from each other,

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.550
but look at it holistically
and in a sustainable manner.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.030
Don't maximize short-term
for one single KPI, that's

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.280
going to then decrease
other KPIs that you're not

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:10.720
looking at so much so.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:11.530
That's my takeaway.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:13.900
However, I'm 100%
sure it's not going

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.750
to be as clever as
your takeaways, which

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:20.830
is why I'm actually going
to let you close the panel.

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.530
From all of the things that
you talked about today, or even

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.000
the things that
you didn't mention,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.900
what would be the one thing
that you would give the audience

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.560
to think about now after
when they have a drink?

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.289
Niklas?

00:25:34.289 --> 00:25:36.580
NIKLAS JANSEN: I wanted first
to say good things happen

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.510
at the happy hour here.

00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:41.356
But I think the
takeaway would be,

00:25:41.356 --> 00:25:43.552
be obsessed with the
problem, not the product.

00:25:43.552 --> 00:25:45.010
I think as product
people, we often

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.310
get obsessed with
the product itself.

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.410
But we should always
take a step back,

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.120
trying to understand what is
the problem we are solving

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.074
and try to put ourselves
into our users shoes,

00:25:51.074 --> 00:25:52.990
and see what they
experience and optimize that

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.770
rather than what we believe is
the right thing to optimize.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:56.770
JAKOB KALBFELL: Perfect.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.190
ANDREA TROCINO: Last
session, last segment--

00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:59.335
that's a lot of pressure.

00:25:59.335 --> 00:26:03.190
So I'm going to copy something I
read in a book a few weeks ago.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.042
The more you learn and
the more you experiment,

00:26:06.042 --> 00:26:08.500
that increase the chances of
you making the right decision.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.601
That is true for both
humans and machine learning.

00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:12.850
That's why I think it's very,
very interesting concept

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:16.582
to optimize, test, learn, and
then go back and do it again.

00:26:16.582 --> 00:26:18.040
JAKOB KALBFELL:
This is even almost

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.820
the final word for the
entire event, Andrea,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.850
and that's Tamzin's job.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:24.800
Cool.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.720
Perfect.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.291
Do we do questions or not?

00:26:27.291 --> 00:26:27.790
No?

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.289
OK.

00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:30.770
So if there are
any more questions,

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.130
please feel free to
find the two of them,

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:36.580
and me if you need, at
the drinks later on.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.130
Otherwise, we're going to
hand it back to Tamzin.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.547
And I thank you both for being
on-stage, and being our guest,

00:26:42.547 --> 00:26:43.880
and sharing your best practices.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.380
Thank you.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.020
Thank you.
