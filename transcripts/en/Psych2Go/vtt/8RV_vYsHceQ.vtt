00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.698
Eleven psychological tips for staying focused whether you're student, professor,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.079
entrepreneur or employee.

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:25.099
People of all walks of life and ages struggle with keeping focus. In this day and age

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.189
with new technologies and life becoming more busy as we grow older,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.679
distractions surrounds us. Here are some tips on how you can keep concentrated more easily.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.009
Number 1: Plan out your time.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.360
Start by figuring out during which times your focus is at its best.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.050
Maybe it's right after dinner or in the first hours of the day.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.869
Well, arrange your schedule so that you do the most important tasks during your most efficient hours.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.479
Number 2: Train your brain. It's become the norm to multitask almost an autopilot without putting much thought into it.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.199
Start by training your brain to put all effort into one task, put away all distracting devices as well.

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.269
It doesn't have to be for longer than 10 minutes. You can work your way up as you go.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.449
Number 3: Let it flow. This is entirely dependent on what works for you.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.850
Sticking to a strict schedule will slow down your efficiency. If you're working very well

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.519
you might want to extend your working time. At the same time, if you can't seem to focus too well,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.310
step away from your work for a bit to clear your head.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.309
Number 4: Sleep well, eat well. Your productivity is proven to increase,

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:40.249
when you have slept well. Not to mention,

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.339
focusing while running on an empty stomach is extra hard. Having 15 minutes the full

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.559
uninterrupted concentration is much better than thirty of exhausted studying.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.248
Don't forget to take time to take care of your needs.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:03.678
Number 5: Make a list. Make it clear to yourself what you want to accomplish in the session by writing it down.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.199
Being specific is key here.

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:12.859
Having a clear idea of what you have to do will not only make it easier to manage your work in separate sessions,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.970
thanks to the visual map, it will be less likely for you to be distracted.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.149
Number 6: Repeat, repeat, repeat!

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.739
Studying a subject for a couple of 30-minute sessions is more effective then studying for one long three-hour period.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.908
This requires a more careful distribution of your time. If done right, your productivity and focus will improve.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.159
Number 7: Clear up! Once you're ready to start a new task,

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.779
it's time to leave all potential distractions from your previous task behind.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:52.009
It's easy to catch something you missed and want to go back to do that, but you need to move forward. Write down

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.739
what you need on your to-do list and go back to do it later.

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.579
Number 8: Pay attention to your habits.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.400
Pinpoint what is exactly that keeps

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.689
distracting you. Maybe it's your phone, your laptop or the fridge that is preventing you to give your full attention to the task at hand.

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.729
Once you have identified the source, you can deal with getting rid of it while you work.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.849
Number 9: Time is up!

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:23.749
You don't always have to work until everything is finished. Taking breaks in between long tedious work sessions

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.389
will help keep you motivated for the time you have left.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.799
Number 10:

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:35.599
Separate relaxation space and work space. Have you ever tried working in bed, and it just made it so hard to focus?

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.698
Designating a specific space to work will let your brain know when it's time to

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:45.109
concentrate. In addition to making it easier to fall asleep when you've finished.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.879
Number 11: Finish! A lot of students will study until late in the evening and then go straight to bed. However,

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:59.839
it's better to end it by doing something you enjoy this gives your brain an opportunity to cool down after your work session.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.809
