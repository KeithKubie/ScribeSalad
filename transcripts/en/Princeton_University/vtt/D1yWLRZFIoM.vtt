00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.650
WENDY LI: I have an interesting
relationship with photography.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.770
I came to this point
last year where

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.770
I didn't know if I wanted to
even make photographs anymore.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.660
And I didn't know what I
wanted to take photographs of.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.740
I went back to sort
of asking myself--

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.820
why do I love photography?


00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.900
And what about photography
makes it so interesting

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.240
and makes it worth my time?


00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.620
My name is Wendy Li.


00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.940
I'm in the class of 2015.


00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.770
And I'm concentrating in
the Woodrow Wilson School

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.460
with a certificate
in visual arts.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.230 position:97%
 


00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.460
So while I'm writing a thesis
for the Woodrow Wilson School

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.040
on the role of women in
developing economies,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.720
specifically in rural
China, this thesis

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.310
is specifically to fulfil the
requirement for my visual arts

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.410
certificate.


00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.040
My senior thesis is
about the process

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.520
of discovering your identity
and of creating memories

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.980
through photographs.


00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.280
I went back to the
first photographs

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.260
I was ever exposed to, which
were my family photographs.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.170
And I realized that
my love of photography

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.450
really came from these
photographs and everything

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.720
that they contained.


00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.140
What you see behind me is
actually the manifestation

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.100
of the process of
discovering who I am

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.860
and who my family is, especially
because we're immigrants

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.700
and because most of my
family I've never met before.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.160
These photographs
were really a way

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.410
to process that information.


00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.120
JOE SCANLAN: As an
advisor, where I gave her

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.360
maybe the most helpful advice
was helping her figure out

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.490
what kind of structure
the show should have.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.620
There were so many threads
that went through the show.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.570
You could pick up
any one of them

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.800
and have a really meaningful
experience in the exhibition

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.240
and maybe not ever really have
the same experience that Wendy

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.610
has with the material.


00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.110
But it wouldn't mean that
your experience was any less

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.190
valuable.


00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.690
WENDY LI: In some
ways I kind of see

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.480
my work in the
Woodrow Wilson School

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.860
as being completely
opposite from my work

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.940
in the visual arts.


00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.010
And I think the
two work very well

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.880
and are sort of symmetrical.


00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.870
This project I think really
sort of distills a lot

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.430
of what we think of as
abstract political ideas.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.650
We think of economic
reform as a very abstract

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.130
political economic idea.


00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.230
We think of migration
also as a very sort

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.140
of abstract
international concept.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.970
What a lot of people
don't realize, I think,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.910
especially, is that these are
very real human things that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.950
are happening and they're
real human experiences.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.580
And so even though I spent so
much time in the Wilson School

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.150
going through data sets, combing
through international relations

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.090
theory and political
philosophy, a lot of it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.000
still doesn't really matter
until you tie it back

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.810
to real people.


00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.310
Most people would be
able to see these photos

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.260
and instantly recognize that
they're personal photos.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.180
A lot of people will
look at these photographs

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.500
and think, oh, these
are photos that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.300
could be in history textbooks.


00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.140
They're very removed,
especially for,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.790
I think, the average American
student at Princeton.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.520
They would look at
these and not be

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.010
able to relate to them
personally at all.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.160
But I think when people start
moving through the timeline,

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.410
and they realize that
the same people are

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.420
in all of these photographs,
and as the photographs become

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.560
more approachable
and more familiar,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.930
that they'll realize that these
seemingly alien concepts are

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.100
actually real experiences
that you can relate to.
