GUEST SPEAKER: I'm
going to present to you

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.430
some important criteria
by which to evaluate

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.120
the legislative proposals
in the legislative hearings.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.700
And I'm going to present
them in my suggested order

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.430
of importance of the criteria.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.810
So number one, I would suggest
the most important criterion

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.930
is science.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.720
So ask yourself,
does the question

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.990
used to evaluate
the proposals, ask

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.590
yourself does the proposal
accord with valid research

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.950
on maintaining fish populations?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.010
Number two, I would suggest the
second most important criterion

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.260
is policy design and economics.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.920
Ask yourself does the proposal
include a well-designed policy?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.990
And number three,
I would suggest

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.180
that the third most important
criterion is politics.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.575
Ask yourself does the
proposal have support and is

00:00:59.575 --> 00:01:04.680
it likely to pass, or can
you make it likely to pass?

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.390
Values and management
are two other criteria

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.830
that I have not ranked in
the top three for this issue.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.110
If you take a look at
the handout on the board,

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.830
you'll see why I haven't
ranked management

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.930
as the most important
criterion for this issue.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.600
We already have the
Magnuson-Stevens Act,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.510
which is the federal legislation
used to manage fisheries.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.740
And since it was revised in 1996
you can see the top map shows--

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.800
with the red circles,
all the red circles

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.380
are fish populations
that have recovered

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.320
in the New England states, your
home constituency since 2000.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.040
And the graph on the bottom
shows an overall decline

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.050
in fish stocks that are
having measured as overfished.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.599
So this isn't primarily a
management problem because we--

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:04.640
there will doubtless be
proposals with management

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.764
problems, but for this
issue, we at least

00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:08.389
know that management
is possible and we

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:12.100
know that we have some
success in managing this issue

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.450
federally.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.250
So we have some
organizational capacity

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.750
that we're already aware of.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.740
So now I'm going to go
over the three top criteria

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.690
and why I've ranked
them that way

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.940
with some important questions
to use to gather information

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.100
during the hearings for
each of the criteria.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.026
So number one is science.

00:02:35.026 --> 00:02:37.150
Science I've ranked as the
most important criterion

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.440
for this issue because
science is our best

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.660
tool for understanding
the natural world, which

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.830
includes fisheries.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.660
Also, it's very
important for this issue

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.940
because as you may
know, there seems

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.420
to be legitimate disagreement
about the science

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.650
on this issue.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.730
So it's very important for you
to use the hearings to assess--

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.230
you're going to
have to take a stand

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.200
on which of the science
that's presented to you

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.520
you think is valid.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.870
And that's going
to underpin how do

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.950
you assess the other criteria.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.042
You're going to have to
take a stand on science

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:14.200
in order to decide which
legislation to support.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.830
You can't really assess the
policy design for example,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.220
without knowing what science
you think is legitimate.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.370
Some really important
questions to ask yourself

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.120
about the science
during the hearings,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.140
some important
information to gather,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.700
it's important to
find out who funded

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.640
the research, each research
that's presented to you.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.640
Also whether the
research was published

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.794
in a peer-reviewed journal.

00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:41.210
Peer-reviewed research has
been vetted by other scientists

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.580
and has had criticism
from other scientists who

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.750
weren't involved in it.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.260
Non-peer reviewed research
there's no guarantee of that.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.630
Ask yourself, is
there broad agreement

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.930
among other scientists
with this research

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.690
or is this research presented
by one or two scientists

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.290
and the rest of the scientific
community disagrees with them?

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.600
And in general,
just ask yourself

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.770
when a proposal presents
a method of management,

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.760
what ways of management,
of fisheries management,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.982
have data to show that
they're actually effective.

00:04:16.982 --> 00:04:21.875
So going on to number two,
policy design and economics.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.720
That's also a very
important criterion

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.890
because any policies
effectiveness

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.890
is going to be dependent
on it being well-designed.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.450
And the economic
costs of each proposal

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.520
are real both to
your constituents

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.360
and to the federal government.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.750
And so far, we have
very little information

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.644
about the different
proposals policy designs.

00:04:44.644 --> 00:04:46.310
So it is important
to gather information

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.630
during the hearings
about the policy design.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.910
So some important
questions to ask yourself

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.070
are what are the economic costs
associated with each proposal

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.550
both to your constituents,
both short-term cost

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.820
and long-term costs
both to our state

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.010
and to the federal government?

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.260
What are the economic benefits
of each proposal again,

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.038
both short-term and long-term?

00:05:14.825 --> 00:05:19.340
It's important to ask yourself
of the proposals which

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.790
proposal is the least coercive
while still being effective?

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:29.180
So if we can incorporate some
aspects of self-organization

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.360
of the fisheries
industry that will often

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.540
make it a less coercive policy.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.290
Also from the policy
design standpoint,

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.380
an important question to try to
suss out from the hearings is,

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.800
are the fisheries likely
to comply with the policy?

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.740
Who's going to make them
comply if they don't?

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.180
Who will implement the policy?

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.720
LAWRENCE SUSSKIND: 20 seconds.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.650
GUEST SPEAKER: And
moving on to politics,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.275
politics is important because
your re-election is important

00:06:05.275 --> 00:06:09.650
and because the hearings
are an important time

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.094
to gather political information.

00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:13.760
LAWRENCE SUSSKIND:
Thank you, very much.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.260
Good.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.910
Good job.
