00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.420
Now, let's get familiar with some of

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.650
the abstractions provided by an operating system. I'm

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.840
sure that you may have heard several different

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.800
terms used in the context of an operating

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.060
system such as program or a process or a thread and task and so on. Let's

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.440
understand these terms. A program is the memory

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.990
footprint that is created when you click on

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.920
an icon to launch an application on your favorite platform. So it is a static

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.810
image of the program loaded into the memory. A process, on the other

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.980
hand, is a program in execution. That is, the operating system, breathes life

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.290
into the program, which is a static entity, by running the program on the CPU.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.180
That is, by scheduling the program to run on the processor, the operating system

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.630
gives life to the program and the

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.440
process is the program in execution. Therefore a

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.700
process is the program plus the state of the running program. And yes, the state

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.050
of the running program is not static.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.220
It is continuously evolving as the program executes.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.070
So these are the two important abstractions related to the process and program.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.290
Which is a static entity created by the operating system when

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.540
you launch a program. And process is the program in execution.
