second misconception is that any game
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.520
second misconception is that any game
can be profitable if you simply sell

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
can be profitable if you simply sell
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.440
can be profitable if you simply sell
aesthetic items only which are like

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
aesthetic items only which are like
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
functional benefit in any way and that
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.690
functional benefit in any way and that
obviously is a misconception as well it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
obviously is a misconception as well it
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.420

depends on the game so in particularly

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430
depends on the game so in particularly
 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.340
depends on the game so in particularly
depends if it's a multiplayer game like

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
depends if it's a multiplayer game like
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.719
depends if it's a multiplayer game like
if you have a multiplayer game where

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
if you have a multiplayer game where
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:51.499

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.330
there's a lot of person-to-person
interaction people can see your

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
interaction people can see your
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.249
interaction people can see your
character doing certain things then yeah

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259

makes perfect sense you can show off for
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.120
makes perfect sense you can show off for
other people you can dress nicely for

really make sense to spend a lot of
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.070

money on aesthetic items it can work I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
money on aesthetic items it can work I
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.720

right there I'm sure there's an
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.649
right there I'm sure there's an
exception that proves the rule somewhere

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659
exception that proves the rule somewhere
 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.320

but for the most part it's a really bad
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.820

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:43.050
heck and they're still number one and
 

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.150
heck and they're still number one and
apparently they're doing they have a

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160
apparently they're doing they have a
 

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.139
apparently they're doing they have a
great rating and they're making good

00:11:45.139 --> 00:11:45.149
great rating and they're making good
 

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:47.749
great rating and they're making good
money so even though I knew that I

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:47.759
money so even though I knew that I
 

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:48.679
money so even though I knew that I
couldn't believe it

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:48.689
couldn't believe it
 

00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:50.540
couldn't believe it
like I just could not internalize the

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:50.550
like I just could not internalize the
 

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:52.939
like I just could not internalize the
fact that forced interstitials would be

00:11:52.939 --> 00:11:52.949
fact that forced interstitials would be
 

00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:54.319
fact that forced interstitials would be
okay because I personally dislike them

00:11:54.319 --> 00:11:54.329
okay because I personally dislike them
 

00:11:54.329 --> 00:11:56.059
okay because I personally dislike them
so much and so we launched without them

00:11:56.059 --> 00:11:56.069
so much and so we launched without them
 

00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:57.769
so much and so we launched without them
we didn't have them in the game and then

00:11:57.769 --> 00:11:57.779
we didn't have them in the game and then
 

00:11:57.779 --> 00:11:59.960
we didn't have them in the game and then
we were disappointed after a ton of work

00:11:59.960 --> 00:11:59.970
we were disappointed after a ton of work
 

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:01.429
we were disappointed after a ton of work
on rewarded video like we spent weeks

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:01.439
on rewarded video like we spent weeks
 

00:12:01.439 --> 00:12:02.689
on rewarded video like we spent weeks
and weeks trying to make our rewarded

00:12:02.689 --> 00:12:02.699
and weeks trying to make our rewarded
 

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:03.889
and weeks trying to make our rewarded
video like the TV time thing that I

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:03.899
video like the TV time thing that I
 

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:05.360
video like the TV time thing that I
mentioned earlier we spent weeks and

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:05.370
mentioned earlier we spent weeks and
 

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:06.829
mentioned earlier we spent weeks and
weeks trying to make that compelling and

00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839
weeks trying to make that compelling and
 

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:09.050
weeks trying to make that compelling and
it didn't really work out we had some

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060
it didn't really work out we had some
 

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.999
it didn't really work out we had some
views but not is not nearly as many as

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:11.009
views but not is not nearly as many as
 

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:13.009
views but not is not nearly as many as
we needed to survive so finally some

00:12:13.009 --> 00:12:13.019
we needed to survive so finally some
 

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:15.019
we needed to survive so finally some
friends of mine hit me over the head

00:12:15.019 --> 00:12:15.029
friends of mine hit me over the head
 

00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:15.949
friends of mine hit me over the head
hard enough and they were like you

00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959
hard enough and they were like you
 

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:16.879
hard enough and they were like you
really needed to try the forced

00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:16.889
really needed to try the forced
 

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:19.160
really needed to try the forced
interstitial fine fine okay but even

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:19.170
interstitial fine fine okay but even
 

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.600
interstitial fine fine okay but even
then we were so worried about it that we

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:20.610
then we were so worried about it that we
 

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.879
then we were so worried about it that we
did an a/b test we weren't willing to

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:22.889
did an a/b test we weren't willing to
 

00:12:22.889 --> 00:12:24.799
did an a/b test we weren't willing to
just put them in the game so we had some

00:12:24.799 --> 00:12:24.809
just put them in the game so we had some
 

00:12:24.809 --> 00:12:26.210
just put them in the game so we had some
users in the a/b test seeing

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:26.220
users in the a/b test seeing
 

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.829
users in the a/b test seeing
interstitials after basically every game

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839
interstitials after basically every game
 

00:12:27.839 --> 00:12:30.040
interstitials after basically every game
and some users seeing them very rarely

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.050
and some users seeing them very rarely
 

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:32.329
and some users seeing them very rarely
so now I can tell you factually cuz they

00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339
so now I can tell you factually cuz they
 

00:12:32.339 --> 00:12:33.590
so now I can tell you factually cuz they
be tested it there was zero difference

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600
be tested it there was zero difference
 

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.790
be tested it there was zero difference
in retention like literally zero none

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800
in retention like literally zero none
 

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.960
in retention like literally zero none
the people who saw them all the time

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:38.970
the people who saw them all the time
 

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.160
the people who saw them all the time
were tamed just as well as the people

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.170
were tamed just as well as the people
 

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.079
were tamed just as well as the people
who didn't who didn't barely see them

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:42.089
who didn't who didn't barely see them
 

00:12:42.089 --> 00:12:43.759
who didn't who didn't barely see them
and then I'm interestingly enough we

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:43.769
and then I'm interestingly enough we
 

00:12:43.769 --> 00:12:44.990
and then I'm interestingly enough we
didn't have a control group where you

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000
didn't have a control group where you
 

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.249
didn't have a control group where you
didn't get forced interstitials at all

00:12:46.249 --> 00:12:46.259
didn't get forced interstitials at all
 

00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:47.119
didn't get forced interstitials at all
just because we were worried about

00:12:47.119 --> 00:12:47.129
just because we were worried about
 

00:12:47.129 --> 00:12:49.879
just because we were worried about
dividing apparati it's too much but we

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:49.889
dividing apparati it's too much but we
 

00:12:49.889 --> 00:12:51.769
dividing apparati it's too much but we
compared our pretest retention to our

00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:51.779
compared our pretest retention to our
 

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:54.290
compared our pretest retention to our
post Reds post-test retention at most

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300
post Reds post-test retention at most
 

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.819
post Reds post-test retention at most
maybe we lost like half a percent

00:12:55.819 --> 00:12:55.829
maybe we lost like half a percent
 

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:57.379
maybe we lost like half a percent
retention it's not like it was it was

00:12:57.379 --> 00:12:57.389

meaningless like so long story short for

interstitials were completely fine and

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:03.029
interstitials were completely fine and
 

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:04.970
interstitials were completely fine and
helped us make a lot more money like am

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:04.980
helped us make a lot more money like am

is the worst excuse I've ever heard for

feature out of some other game and I
 

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.180
feature out of some other game and I
hear it a lot actually and by the way

the reason I included these screenshots

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:40.150
the reason I included these screenshots
 

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:42.450
the reason I included these screenshots
is because this is just showing the

basically the entry like you can that's
the sort of entry portal to one of our

with this specific feature I don't think

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:07.330
with this specific feature I don't think
 

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:08.850
with this specific feature I don't think
I would have thought of the specific

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:08.860
I would have thought of the specific
 

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:10.320
I would have thought of the specific
implementation without having played

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.330
implementation without having played
 

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.000
implementation without having played
Star Wars Galaxies for I mean I've been

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.010
Star Wars Galaxies for I mean I've been
 

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:12.960
Star Wars Galaxies for I mean I've been
playing at this point for over a year

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:12.970
playing at this point for over a year
 

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.789
playing at this point for over a year
but I had to play it for many months to

00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799
but I had to play it for many months to
 

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:18.590
but I had to play it for many months to
to really to really put that together so

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600
to really to really put that together so
 

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.299
to really to really put that together so
so it's worked out very well for us I'm

00:19:21.299 --> 00:19:21.309
so it's worked out very well for us I'm
 

00:19:21.309 --> 00:19:22.470
so it's worked out very well for us I'm
pretty confident that I would have

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480
pretty confident that I would have
 

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.029
pretty confident that I would have
screwed the pooch on this if I had only

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039
screwed the pooch on this if I had only
 

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:28.950
screwed the pooch on this if I had only
played the game for a week yeah and I

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960
played the game for a week yeah and I
 

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:32.730
played the game for a week yeah and I
think that's it thank you very much guys
