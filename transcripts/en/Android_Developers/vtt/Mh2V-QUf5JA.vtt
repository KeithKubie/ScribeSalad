CALVIN KIZANA: I
guess our story is

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.985
one I hope can inspire
other developers,

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:09.380
that reaching a global
audience is possible.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.270
PicMix started out purely as a
photo-video editing and sharing

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.820
app, but today has evolved into
an internet-based community,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.060
content discovery, and
social commerce platform.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.270
My name is Calvin Kizana, CEO
and co-founder of Inovidea,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.140
the developers of PicMix.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.640
Today we have more than 27
million users worldwide, mainly

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.970
on Android devices.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.330
65% of our users
is international.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.840
We realized that to appeal
to a global audience,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.070
we needed to create a
very high-quality app.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.122
We decided to take advantage of
Google Play's developer tools.

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:48.580
SANDY COLONDAM:
I'm Sandy Colondam,

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.520
co-founder at Inovidea,
developers of PicMix.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.060
We needed an intuitive
interface, and the only way

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.680
to do that is to follow
the same set of guidelines

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.910
that Android was built on.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.460
We just made a clear design.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.670
Before we implemented Google
material design guidelines,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.120
the time our users spent in
the app was, like, two minutes.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.250
It jumped to eight minutes now,
and we see a massive increase

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.720
in likes and comments.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.240
PicMix's main feature is
photo and video editing,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.980
so it's very crucial
that our users can easily

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.887
access to create new
photo and video content.

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:24.470
And then we saw a huge increase
in the numbers of photos being

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.230
created by first-time
users, and this

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.970
was when we really began to
see traction with our user base

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.790
on a global scale.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.130
Another thing we
did was to improve

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.500
the quality of our store
listing on Google Play.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.050
This allowed us to test multiple
versions of our store listing

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.220
and to see which one
our users liked best.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.050
Store listing experiment
really helped us

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.110
to avoid making big mistakes.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.370
We decided to change
the PicMix icon to pink,

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.450
to coincide with
Valentine's Day.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.380
But the download rate
actually decreased by 8%.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.660
So this was a very big
learning point to us,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.410
and the obvious choice was to
go back to the blue-colored one.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.860
CALVIN KIZANA: When I
first started this company

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.270
four years ago, I
never imagined it

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.280
can be so successful
just like today,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.210
especially on an
international scale.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.260
My advice for other developers
out there is use the tools,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.760
keep refining your
product, keep innovating,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.990
and make your application a
success, just like PicMix.
