00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.330
NARRATOR: Houston, Texas, 2010.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.000
Doctors at the Texas
Heart Institute

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.620
examine a 59-year-old man
complaining of chest pains

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.380
and make an
astounding discovery.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.540
The patient has a
three-chambered heart,

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.000
similar to that of a reptile.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.580
Researchers attributed
the rare condition

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.750
to an evolutionary
phenomenon called atavism,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.380
when a lost trait of
a distant ancestor

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.420
reemerges in a modern organism.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.750
GAGE CRUMP: So the idea is if
you look at where we evolved

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.080
from, we were first fish.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.830
Fish have a two-chambered heart.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.920
And then we came on land.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.080
We're more like a reptile.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.750
That has a
three-chambered heart.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.500
And then, eventually, we have
a four-chambered heart as we

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.000
became mammals and then humans.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.750
So interestingly,
during development,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.880
that same sequence of evolution
is played out again as embryos.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.250
So if there's any sort of defect
in the embryo along the way,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.960
it could get stalled out
at that earlier state.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.540
And now this man
has a heart that's

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.920
more typical of our distant
ancestors, the reptiles.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.620
NARRATOR: While the discovery of
a human with a reptilian heart

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.290
is incredibly rare,
other genetic conditions

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.210
have been found that suggest
a link with reptiles.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.790
Since the 1800s, over
100 cases of human tails

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.790
have been reported
in medical journals.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.790
People with the
disease ichthyosis

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.790
have dry, scaly skin.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.790
And people with
the diseases called

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.580
syndactyly and
ectrodactyly have fused

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.250
fingers and claw-like hands.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.080
But if such anatomical
irregularities

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.670
are a link to our
ancient ancestors,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.420
as some scientists
suggest, could it

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.830
be that they are not the
remnants of a reptilian stage

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.290
in human development
but, instead,

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.750
reveal that humans
once commingled

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.000
with reptilian aliens?

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.830
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.830
and believe that further clues
can be found in the stories

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.960
of China's first emperor, Fuxi.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.710
Fuxi is one of the
mythical rulers of China.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.960
And he is considered to be the
original or prototypical man.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.170
He was created along
with his sister, Nuwa.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.670
They were humanoid
in form in the sense

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.210
that their upper bodies
were that of humans,

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.710
but their lower bodies
were that of snakes.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.330
And they're often
represented with snake

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.960
tails intertwined together.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.960
NARRATOR: Similar stories
of reptilian humanoid beings

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.330
exist in cultures around
the ancient world,

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.380
including Japan, Greece,
and South America.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.880
DAVID CHILDRESS: We
even have good drawings

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.080
and reliefs of many of
these fantastic creatures.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.830
And so is it possible that
some of these creatures

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.500
really are aliens
that look like that?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.170
And it seems like in some cases
that is probably the case.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.250
NARRATOR: Other
unusual anomalies also

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.580
appear to mirror the
descriptions of divine beings

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.420
from ancient texts.

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.540
Millions of infants are born
with blue patches of skin

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.330
called Mongolian spots,
evoking the blue-skin gods

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.120
common to India and Egypt.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.290
There have also been
many cases of gigantism

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.250
throughout history, bringing
to mind biblical stories

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.120
of the Nephilim,
giants that were said

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.960
to be the hybrid
offspring of humans

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.460
and divine beings
called "the watchers."

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.460
Within us is the whole
evolutionary development

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.290
of humankind, as well
as the other species

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.580
that humans developed from--

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.460
reptiles, fish, and so forth.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.880
Extrapolating this idea, if
extraterrestrials had a hand

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.080
in retooling our DNA, then do we
also carry their genetic makeup

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.420
within us, as we would?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.670
JASON MARTELL: We know
today that our DNA

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.500
contains a lot of junk DNA
that we still don't understand.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.500
So when we see these
genetic anomalies surface

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.330
in physical form in children, it
could be that it's not anomaly.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.830
It's actually a lost
extraterrestrial gene,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.830
a marker that's now
resurfacing at the right time.
