00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.850
If we look at our formula, and match up the different letters here to the

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.360
different numbers over here, we have that a equals 2, the first base here. X

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.090
the input of the first log is equal 8, and b, the new base we're trying to

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.870
change to is equal 10. Since we want log base b of x over log base b of a, we

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:28.376
need to write that log base 2 of 8 is equal to log base 10 of 8 over log base

00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:29.484
10 of 2.
