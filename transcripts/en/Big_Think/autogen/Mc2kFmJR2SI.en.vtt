natural selection chooses among

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510
natural selection chooses among
 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.299
natural selection chooses among
self-replicating entities those

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309
self-replicating entities those
 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.760

self-replicating entities have some kind

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770

means choosing between alternative DNA

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
means choosing between alternative DNA
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.859
means choosing between alternative DNA
genes so it's about the natural

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
genes so it's about the natural
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.690
genes so it's about the natural
selection the disproportionate it's

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
selection the disproportionate it's
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.240
selection the disproportionate it's
about the unequal survival of genes

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
about the unequal survival of genes
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.060
about the unequal survival of genes
through generations that is natural

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
through generations that is natural
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.980
through generations that is natural
selection we see it in the form of

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990
selection we see it in the form of
 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.810
selection we see it in the form of
changes in phenotypes that's to say

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
changes in phenotypes that's to say
 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.090
changes in phenotypes that's to say
changes in bodies because it's through

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
changes in bodies because it's through
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.250
changes in bodies because it's through
the changes in the bodies that the genes

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
the changes in the bodies that the genes
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.550
the changes in the bodies that the genes
induce that they ensure their survival

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560
induce that they ensure their survival
 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.500
induce that they ensure their survival
or fail to survive the ones that are

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
or fail to survive the ones that are
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.270
or fail to survive the ones that are
good at surviving are the ones that are

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
good at surviving are the ones that are
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.640
good at surviving are the ones that are
good at building bodies that are good at

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650
good at building bodies that are good at
 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.700
good at building bodies that are good at
surviving and reproducing

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710
 
 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.990
 
we're G machines in the sense that a

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000
we're G machines in the sense that a
 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.740
we're G machines in the sense that a
body is constructed by genes that have

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750
body is constructed by genes that have
 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.960
body is constructed by genes that have
been successful in surviving in the past

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970
been successful in surviving in the past
 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.789
been successful in surviving in the past
they're good at surviving because

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799
they're good at surviving because
 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.249
they're good at surviving because
they're good at constructing machines in

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259
they're good at constructing machines in
 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.920
they're good at constructing machines in
which they survive so a body is a

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930
which they survive so a body is a
 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.880
which they survive so a body is a
machine for the propagation of the genes

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890
machine for the propagation of the genes
 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.549
machine for the propagation of the genes
that built it
