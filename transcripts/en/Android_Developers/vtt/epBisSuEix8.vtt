00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:08.240
DAN GALPIN: Hello.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.510
KOH KIM: Hey there.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.650
DAN GALPIN: My name's Dan
Galpin, and this is--

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.750
KOH KIM: Koh Kim.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.140
DAN GALPIN: And we're here for
another episode of The Friday

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.300
Games Review.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.560
Also producing for
us is Ian Lewis.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.310
DAN GALPIN: Sorry about that.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.870
I had it legally changed.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.643
My wife is going to kill you.

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:27.590
KOH KIM: That's--

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.440
she's watching, right?

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.610
DAN GALPIN: [INAUDIBLE]
you've heard that--

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.119
IAN NI-LEWIS: My wife always
watches this show.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.180
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: So, Koh,
how about a beer.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.483
I don't think we're going
to give one to Dan.

00:00:36.483 --> 00:00:38.140
KOH KIM: I always want a beer.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.370
I was just in Germany
last week.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.105
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:41.292
KOH KIM: Let's continue.

00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:42.990
DAN GALPIN: Is how
you got tan?

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.150
You know, usually, that's
not supposed to happen.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.905
KOH KIM: Actually, it was
very warm in Germany.

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:50.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: Today's
beer is the Widmer

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.050
Brothers Imperial Stout--

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.670
Raspberry Imperial Stout.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.270
We've been on kind of a Widmer
brothers kick here because we

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.810
used to think of them as
the bland, corporate--

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.900
like, Samuel Adams alike.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.300
And lately, they've been
doing some really cool

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.990
experimental beers.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.690
So we're having the Raspberry
Russian Imperial Stout It's a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.530
really strong beer.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.330
It's got just a hint of
raspberries in it.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.400
We'll see how these guys
can tolerate it.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.310
If we have to carry one of them
out during the show, I'll

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.390
just go ahead and step in.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.230
Back to you, Dan.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.616
DAN GALPIN: Good to know you're
here for us, Ian.

00:01:21.616 --> 00:01:24.660
So, today, I'm wearing the hard
hat, as we're looking at

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.290
brain and puzzle games.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.080
I don't know why that really
actually makes any sense.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.990
But we've got an exciting
[INAUDIBLE] games for you.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410
Some of them we really,
really love this week.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.680
I just wanted to say that.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.425
There's some that we played
more than we might play of

00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:38.320
some of these other games.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.745
These are really addicting
puzzlers.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.240
So, warning, to anyone out
there, if you actually start

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.140
playing these games, expect to
lose a lot of free time.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.340
And we also have some games
that I think have some

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.460
interesting technical issues,
so we'll try to talk through

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.630
those, as well as the ones
we really, really like.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.400
And, as always, these games
were nominated by you out

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.090
there in the audience on
our Moderator page.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.800
So continue to nominate,
and we will

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.000
continue to look at them.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.276
KOH KIM: Yeah, for sure.

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:13.120
Any more ways to make me pass my
commute from San Francisco

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.240
to Mountain View.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.500
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.680
We're here to help fill in that
gap in those long hours.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.840
So which game do we want
to look at first?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.170
So I have them in this order.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.420
Does this make sense?

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.960
KOH KIM: Yeah, we can start with
all the word games first.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.480
DAN GALPIN: So we're going to
start off with Word Push.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.200
So this is going to be a
portrait game, and once it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.330
actually loads--

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.610
there we are.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.470
Excellent.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.850
We're actually looking at a
screen that has it backwards

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.540
here, so it's a little tricky
to look at the screen.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.110
KOH KIM: It's a little tricky.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.350
Yeah.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.350
DAN GALPIN: So Koh and I both
played this game quite a lot.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.740
And some basic things that
it gets wrong and right.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.650
So one of the things that it
gets wrong is that's what

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.066
happens when you hit the Back
key anywhere from the game.

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:04.750
KOH KIM: Yeah, Let me just
say, that was a little

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.350
annoying, because I always
accidentally hit the Back key

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.330
all the time.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.850
It's actually pretty obnoxious
how many times.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.070
And every time I try to solve
it, I'm like, wait, no, no

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.000
progress saved.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.250
It's OK.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.640
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.250
So it immediately loses
all progress.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.470
It immediately exits the game.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.200
And this is actually the
default behavior

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.450
of an Android activity.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.330
But unfortunately, when you
have a game where you're

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.660
having multiple different
interstitials that are going

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.110
on-- we have a title screen,
we have a levels select

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.400
screen, we have the
game itself.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.000
Just exiting doesn't really
help, and also, losing all

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.415
state could be very, very
frustrating if you're in the

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:41.520
middle of one of these levels.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.300
And here is an example--

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.130
Word Push level.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.370
And actually, the game is
super, super clever.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.070
One thing that's also
interesting about this game

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.300
for me is that there is a
large sense of complete

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.010
randomness to the game, as is
how close these blocks are to

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.700
each other.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.130
So the goal in this particular
level, by the way, is to build

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.390
one word using the
blue blocks.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.635
And they must be
used together--

00:04:06.635 --> 00:04:08.280
KOH KIM: Actually, it's using
the orange blocks.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.540
And so the blue blocks
actually gives

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.150
you additional mana.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.030
But to complete a level, you
actually need to make a word

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.340
with the orange blocks.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.050
DAN GALPIN: I see.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.399
The point is, if you use the
blue blocks, they actually

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:22.390
have to be used together.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.280
So that does make things
kind of tricky.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.520
So you can see I've played
this game a lot.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.850
KOH KIM: Clearly.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.210
It's OK.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.570
All word games are almost the
same to us at this point.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.580
DAN GALPIN: And you can move the
other letters out of the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.910
way in different directions by
selecting top, left, right, or

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.740
bottom here.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.600
And it has a nice little
animation.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.680
One of the things that's a
little bit unclear is if you

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.390
don't watch the video, "How to
Play" intro that is built into

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.970
the game, some of these things
may elude you in

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.940
terms of the controls.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.410
And it still is a little bit
confusing as to what top,

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.440
left, right, and bottom mean
in terms of push direction.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.300
I think it's one of the things
that could be made a lot

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.270
clearer in the game itself--

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.870
perhaps a direction indicator, I
think, an arrow on the board

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.680
or something showing you
the way the letters

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.105
are going to move.

00:05:12.105 --> 00:05:13.770
And when we say direction
indicator, it's really what

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.710
happens when you move things
out of the way.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.456
So now we are at
top direction.

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:19.335
KOH KIM: If he creates
a word--

00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:20.240
it's English.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.606
It's OK.

00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:20.972
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:23.497
I put "dane," but it didn't
like "dane." It just

00:05:23.497 --> 00:05:26.431
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:32.480
OK, let's try "tan." OK, you see
now, Top moves the letters

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.260
from the top--

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.150
KOH KIM: Down.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.370
DAN GALPIN: --in.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.620
KOH KIM: Right.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.710
DAN GALPIN: So that's how
this explains here.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.360
So it explains we move
to the right here.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.230
It's going to move letters
in from the right.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.210
KOH KIM: And then it's going to
lift stuff from the bottom,

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.050
so yeah, once you figure it
out-- and a lot of it is is I

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.180
actually didn't even know that
existed until level five or

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.010
six, or at least really made
full attention of that.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.650
So I think a lot of it is is
definitely, if you're a user

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.530
like me who ignores YouTube
videos on the Google Play

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.230
market, you may want to make
that more clear when you start

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.460
setting up the game and
introducing the

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.120
game to your users.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.920
DAN GALPIN: And the tutorial is
nicely integrated into the

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.080
game in the sense that the
YouTube video is a link from

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.235
the main page of the game.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.675
And so the good news, at
least, if you're--

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:26.151
KOH KIM: Got to look at
the camera, dude.

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:26.632
[LAUGHING]

00:06:26.632 --> 00:06:30.290
DAN GALPIN: When I'm operating
the device, I, unfortunately,

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.270
have to either look at one or
the other, and I can't operate

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.330
this game in backwards mode.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's where
it's supposed to be.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.142
DAN GALPIN: So the problem
is also moving this is

00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:40.930
challenging.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.400
All right.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:48.730
So when you're actually
operating the game, you can go

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.225
back into the game by actually
hitting the Home

00:06:52.225 --> 00:06:54.610
key and going back.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.300
Ooh, that's not fortunate.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.150
I was going to try to
demonstrate something else.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.900
The real key thing here is just
navigating within the

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.950
game using the Back button.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:02.930
That just needs to be fixed.

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.860
There's a lot of other subtle
details that I think could be

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.680
cleaned up to make the game
just that much better.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.070
The YouTube video says "YouTube
Gameplay Demo" here

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.160
is actually what--
there's a link.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.610
Which doesn't really tell you,
by the way, you really should

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.370
watch to figure out the game.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.500
But that's Word Push.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.420
Now, I wanted to talk about,
before we get into our next

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.494
word game, one of the things
that was nominated was Fifteen

00:07:23.494 --> 00:07:28.140
Puzzle X, which is the first
game done by this developer.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.840
And this is another game that's
does a whole bunch of

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.140
things that are a little
bit unfortunate.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.270
But they're a lot of
kind of newbie

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.670
Android experience things.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.080
And so what's nice about the
game is that it has really,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.180
really wonderfully rendered
titles, for which the

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:49.540
developer actually went and used
the fantastic open source

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.120
rendering package to use.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.830
But the problem with this game
is actually a problem with

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.890
save state.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.320
So I'll show you the most
obvious problem here.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.610
So you go here.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.720
I'm going to select this tile.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.850
This tile set is only available
in four-by-four, and

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.376
I can select wood, marble, or
plastic for the backgrounds.

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:09.060
And I hit Play.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.950
And now, there's a couple of
problems when we get into this

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:11.720
screen here.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.710
One is that hitting the Back
key actually exits the game

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.285
once again.

00:08:16.285 --> 00:08:18.360
So that's problematic.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:18.885
I'm going to go back.

00:08:18.885 --> 00:08:20.830
Now, that's a nice thing you
see-- it's actually remembered

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.280
the tile that I set--
that I used.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.650
But you notice that it didn't
actually remove these other

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.300
ones again.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.420
So here's the problem.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.170
If I go back to this screen,
I can now select six-by-six

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.070
titles here.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.460
And if I actually hit Play,
you end up with that.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.770
So there are a lot of
just sort of bugs.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:39.309
The other problem is that this
key here looks like Restart,

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:40.700
which would be really nice
if it does that.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.000
But actually, what it does
is it also takes you

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.850
back to the main menu.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:45.980
Other problems this game has--

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.540
I'm going to go back to the
main menu here to get to a

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.440
noncorrupt-looking screen--

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.190
is that this particular view
here sort of feels like an

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.400
intro to the game, But, in fact,
it is all in the same

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.608
activity, and because of that,
hitting the Back key

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:03.536
[INAUDIBLE] out of both.

00:09:03.536 --> 00:09:06.090
The other thing that the game
does, though, which is pretty

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.230
unusual, is if you actually hit
and go back to the home

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.490
screen, and then try to go back
into the game, you'll see

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:18.430
that the game actually has
now changed its state.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.280
And so any exit from the game
at all, however it's

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.820
interrupted, changes
the state.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.230
So this is something that's
definitely worth fixing.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.590
So first of all, we have an
on-screen indicator that sort

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.770
of does what a Back key would
do, but actually doesn't.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.170
And then we have kind
of immediate kill

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.920
behavior on the Back key.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.350
KOH KIM: And one other thing,
at least for me, it actually

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.450
took me forever to
figure out how to

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.810
actually move the tiles.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.180
Because in games like this,
you're always used to

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.250
gesture-based stuff, where it's
like, oh, I've got to

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.210
slide the tile.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.070
Well, apparently, you can't
really slide the tile.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.810
You actually need to
press the side--

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.980
just basically push the side
and push it in the

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.800
direction it moves.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.650
So it's kind of weird, because
it took me while

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.150
to figure that out.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:05.680
But definitely making sure
that your users at least

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.020
understand how the
game is based.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.800
And if they played these games
before, make sure whatever

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.046
gestures or UI that you put in,
make sure it matches what

00:10:12.046 --> 00:10:12.160
they think.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.640
DAN GALPIN: This would be a
great time to use the gesture

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.970
detector that's built into
the Android framework.

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:24.660
You can actually detect that
kind of gesture, which would

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.360
be a paging gesture.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.230
We actually call it a--

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.210
I forgot the name of it.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.400
But, anyway, you can actually
detect this kind of sliding

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.490
gesture, where you'd want
to slide the entire row.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.345
The other thing that I think
would really help this game

00:10:36.345 --> 00:10:38.570
out is actually a way of
demonstrating what the

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.430
solution is.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hang
on, you guys.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.330
Sorry, I just need to break
in for one second.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.306
Engineer Daniel asks, what game
are you reviewing now?

00:10:48.306 --> 00:10:51.790
DAN GALPIN: That is
a good question.

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:55.380
We are actually looking
at Fifteen Puzzle X.

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hey,
wait a second.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.090
I thought we looked at this, and
it was kind of like a lot

00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.980
more awesome-looking.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:00.415
What happened?

00:11:00.415 --> 00:11:01.680
DAN GALPIN: I switched
the tiles--

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.790
KOH KIM: --to plastic mode.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.130
DAN GALPIN: So we
can select wood.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: I liked
wood better.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:07.900
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, wood
looks [INAUDIBLE]--

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wood looks really
cool, except for one

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.830
thing, and it's like--

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:12.660
DAN GALPIN: The use
of Comic Sans.

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.600
KOH KIM: The use
of Comic Sans.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.594
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, and
by the way, Koh.

00:11:15.594 --> 00:11:17.930
I'm not over to your right.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.000
I'm underneath you.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.280
KOH KIM: You're underneath me.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:20.972
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hey, Koh.

00:11:20.972 --> 00:11:22.474
How's it going, Koh?

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:23.358
KOH KIM: Good.

00:11:23.358 --> 00:11:23.800
What's up?

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.690
All right-- whatever.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.460
DAN GALPIN: Actually, I think
you're under both of us.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: (SINGING)
Here's the story--

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.600
what's up with Comic Sans?

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.575
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:30.575 --> 00:11:31.130
KOH KIM: [CHUCKLING]

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.670
Comic Sans.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:32.140
[CHUCKLING]

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.180
DAN GALPIN: I wish Comic
Sans was the largest

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.010
problem this game has.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what's
going to happen, though?

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.350
Now that we've mentioned Comic
Sans, a ton of people are

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.510
going to email us and say, hey,
that's not Comic Sans,

00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:45.130
that's such and such, which
happens to be a typeface that

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.540
looks just like Comic Sans.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.330
You know what?

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.965
Not fooling anybody.

00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:51.500
DAN GALPIN: --so, yeah,
definitely some gestures--

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.960
I also think knowing what
the solution is.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.900
It's not clear that the numbers
actually should be

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:59.560
going across or if they should
be going up and down and where

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.510
one should be.

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:03.170
But I think that would also be
very, very useful to actually

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.495
show the solution.

00:12:05.495 --> 00:12:07.900
But that's kind of
a minor nitpick.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.140
I think most people understand
whether it's going to be--

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.550
KOH KIM: Most people are going
to understand what a number

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.710
puzzle is, at least as--

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.710
DAN GALPIN: But, you know,
sometimes you do want to solve

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:16.900
one, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.910
And maybe both solutions are
actually acceptable.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.490
I'm not sure.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.860
KOH KIM: Yeah, it's true.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.800
DAN GALPIN: I never actually got
to the point of actually

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.330
solving this, but, you
know, I'm not huge

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.060
fan of number puzzles.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.610
But a really great
first effort.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.310
And again, there are beautifully
rendered tiles.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.560
And, again, just some things
to think about.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.020
The biggest one, I think,
really is state.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.650
And these controls here, in
order to disable them when

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:40.890
you're actually going back here,
you need to actually go

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.160
through and run through that
same disable logic.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.940
Because you really don't want
users to get to this screen

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:45.160
accidentally.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.875
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:12:45.875 --> 00:12:48.530
It'd also be nice to see a
splash screen of what I'm

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.586
playing, too, but maybe
that's another thing.

00:12:50.586 --> 00:12:51.373
DAN GALPIN: I actually
don't think it

00:12:51.373 --> 00:12:51.730
needs a splash screen.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.800
But I do think it'd be nice
if it were included.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.340
There's no particular reason why
a game like this needs to

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:57.150
go full screen.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.650
KOH KIM: Right.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.790
DAN GALPIN: And I would much
rather see the time, and my

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.650
notifications, and all that kind
of thing when I'm playing

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.720
a game that doesn't need to
be completely immersive.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.250
I think this game actually is
a game that is damaged by

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.880
immersivity rather than
benefiting by it.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:12.810
KOH KIM: I could see that.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.522
Yeah.

00:13:13.522 --> 00:13:14.120
All right.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.050
Cool.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.570
Next game?

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.200
DAN GALPIN: Next game.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.630
So [INAUDIBLE] talked a
little bit about that.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.920
This game, actually, I had a lot
of compatibility problems

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.695
with this device.

00:13:22.695 --> 00:13:23.725
KOH KIM: Wordruggle.

00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:26.110
[CHUCKLING]

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:31.280
And you can probably see, it's
kind of not wanting to turn on

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.660
on his Transformer, but--

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.860
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, one of the
things that's interesting

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.660
about this game is it actually
goes and immediately creates a

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.730
profile account--

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.670
KOH KIM: Yeah-- using
my email.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.060
Thanks, everyone, for asking.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.260
DAN GALPIN: No, no--
it doesn't--

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:43.795
it is plugged in.

00:13:43.795 --> 00:13:44.800
KOH KIM: It's plugged in.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.070
It's flashing.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.085
DAN GALPIN: So this is
Wordruggle, so we should

00:13:48.085 --> 00:13:49.940
change Fifteen Puzzle X
and go to Wordruggle.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.830
So we're going to have a really
hard time actually

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.980
showing you any gameplay
here on this device.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.920
KOH KIM: I'm sorry, everyone.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:58.830
DAN GALPIN: It does--

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.765
KOH KIM: We're not trying
to give you seizures.

00:14:00.765 --> 00:14:03.260
DAN GALPIN: It does seem to be
an issue with the Transformer.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.110
[INAUDIBLE] this game--

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: Try jiggling
the cable.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.260
DAN GALPIN: --on the Nexus 7.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.875
IAN NI-LEWIS: Let's switch
to the camera.

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:09.430
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, you can switch
to the camera so you

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.890
can see what it's actually
doing here.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:15.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Producer Daniel
asks, did you jiggle it?

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.190
DAN GALPIN: And the
answer is yes.

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.430
KOH KIM: See, no.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.140
We're not kidding.

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.500
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, this happens
whether or not HDMI

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.310
is on, by the way.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:25.975
DANIEL PHAM: Hey, Dan, I think
you might want to move your

00:14:25.975 --> 00:14:27.225
head a little bit, too.

00:14:29.382 --> 00:14:31.470
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, you can see.

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.530
That's what's going on here.

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.005
So unfortunately, we can't
really look at the gameplay of

00:14:35.005 --> 00:14:36.935
this, but I'll get Koh talk
about it a little bit.

00:14:36.935 --> 00:14:38.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: Why don't you
go ahead and just put

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.100
the Nexus 7 up there?

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.555
I think this seems to be
working all right.

00:14:41.555 --> 00:14:42.040
KOH KIM: Nex 7--

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:42.520
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.750
I turn, be like, hey,
right here.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:46.240
Stay there.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:46.930
DAN GALPIN: There we are--

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:48.180
Nexus 7 cam.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.285
To me, I don't know whether
that's a layout issue, because

00:14:52.285 --> 00:14:54.390
I haven't tried it on other
tablet devices other than

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.100
Nexus 7, but it could be.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:15:00.730
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.260
KOH KIM: It's kind of
like a Boggle game.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:06.270
So from the four-by-four set,
you need to swipe as many

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.400
words as you possibly can,
which is pretty cool.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.520
I mean, it's all this.

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.270
DAN GALPIN: And it's a real-time
game shared with

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.360
everyone else.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.200
It's very similar to Word Hero,
which we've looked at on

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.810
the show before.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:17.880
I like the layout, actually.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.730
It looks really, really nice.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:29.800
The only thing I would say about
it is that it does feel

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.680
a little bit borrowed from
another platform, in terms of

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.070
look, with all the roundedness,
and all of the

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.450
excessive use of gradients,
and stuff like that.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.020
IAN NI-LEWIS: By the way,
viewers at home, would you not

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:45.160
all agree that Dan's hair is
rich and luxurious, almost

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.820
rock-star-like in its
silky splendor?

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.460
KOH KIM: I'm kind of jealous.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.040
It's a lot of volume.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.170
I wish I had that much volume.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:52.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:58.620
Also, thank God Dan isn't
leaning slightly to his left.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.810
Because then, his head would be
totally out of shot, and it

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.735
would ruin it for
the rest of us.

00:16:03.735 --> 00:16:06.620
DAN GALPIN: Thank you, Ian.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.950
That's why Ian's producing the
show, so that he can drink

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:12.160
more and make comments
like that.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.233
So (LAUGHING) here we are.

00:16:14.233 --> 00:16:19.290
KOH KIM: [LAUGHING]

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.630
DAN GALPIN: So now, we're
actually competing against the

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.140
entire world.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.262
And there's lots
of good stuff.

00:16:27.262 --> 00:16:28.780
KOH KIM: There's a lot
of good stuff.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.220
DAN GALPIN: So the
game is fun.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.780
I love this kind of random
competition kind of game.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.330
I was a really huge
fan of Word Hero.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.650
You know, basically, I
want to see them do

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.730
some nice tablet layouts.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.635
I think it'd be very, very cool
to see the words that

00:16:40.635 --> 00:16:45.290
you're actually guessing in
larger form, side by side with

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.420
the game board if you're
on a tablet layout.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.050
And, again, there's just a lot
more that can be done here.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.130
KOH KIM: People need to see.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:57.265
There we go.

00:16:57.265 --> 00:17:00.870
DAN GALPIN: Now it's total
rock star thanks to my

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.890
makeover expert over
there on the right.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.350
So, anyway, I don't have
really much more

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.940
to say about this.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:15.930
Because this is a real-time
game, this is actually a good

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:18.329
game for actually putting
up a dialog.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:21.000
It's very, very rare that I
would actually suggest putting

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.400
up a dialog like this.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.980
But this is real time, so
actually exiting the game does

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.540
kind of ruin your ability to
play that particular round.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.720
So it makes sense, and it does
take you back here to the

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.410
level screen, and then
that takes you out.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.660
So that's all good navigation.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.270
The rest of the games will
actually work on the

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.890
Transformer [INAUDIBLE]--

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:39.940
KOH KIM: Yes, we promise.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:40.836
Sorry.

00:17:40.836 --> 00:17:42.920
DAN GALPIN: But that particular
game, we did

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.470
actually have to go through some
additional effort to get

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.840
it to work.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.350
And, again, being able to
test on one tablet is

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:50.360
always a good thing.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.270
It's kind of unusual because
it looks like that game is

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.290
using the framework, so it's
kind of strange thing to see a

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:59.990
game that's having trouble that
is using the framework.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.960
All right, we are going in order
here, so the next game

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.280
is Stack-A-Ball.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.160
KOH KIM: OK, so we can switch
cams because this

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.100
one actually works.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.966
DAN GALPIN: We can actually
switch views, and we're now in

00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:13.690
a portrait game.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.680
And in Stack-A-Ball, the goal is
to make the balls stack to

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:22.210
match the shadows that
you see here at the

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:22.940
bottom of the level.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.470
KOH KIM: It's kind of
like reverse Tetris.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.090
So the object is to stack the
balls, as many as you can,

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.880
without actually having three
balls connecting at any time.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.920
And so you're supposed to
keep stacking until

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.795
you run out of balls.

00:18:34.795 --> 00:18:37.340
DAN GALPIN: And this is going
to be really un-fun on my

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.510
tablet, because it does take
advantage of an accelerometer.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.730
So usually when I rotate, this
thing will lose HDMI.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:47.240
We'll try to be really
careful here.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.580
Ian likes to point out how
dorky this looks when I'm

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.810
actually using the keyboard with
an accelerometer game,

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.560
and it really does.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:58.500
But on the other hand,
I tend to not lose

00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.930
HDMI quite as often.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.605
Do you have to tap the screen to
release the balls, so part

00:19:04.605 --> 00:19:08.200
of the challenge is actually an
arcade-like like challenge.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.130
And it's kind of unfortunately
random also, so you see if

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.760
those three balls touch,
they get destroyed.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.450
But since the balls come in
apparently random colors, the

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.935
challenge is also somewhat
random, which is a little

00:19:18.935 --> 00:19:19.360
unfortunate.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.650
KOH KIM: Well, the one big
thing I actually have a

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.020
problem with is I never know
when I'm actually done.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.590
Because it says just
keep going until

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:27.500
there's no more balls.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.900
But it'd be nice for the ball
counter to be the reverse

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.950
count, not how many balls I
have going down the thing.

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:35.500
And it's also pretty
slow, too.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.080
I mean, for an arcade
game, that's kind of

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.100
like all about falling.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:42.290
I mean, the cool thing about
Tetris or any building block

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.790
game is that it actually
speeds up.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.770
And here, you really can't
control the speed of the ball,

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.890
which is a little strange.

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.360
DAN GALPIN: I really do want to
be able to swipe down the

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.120
balls until it's done.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.660
But the other thing is you just
end up getting a whole

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:59.950
bunch of blue balls like these
in a row in this distribution.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:03.160
You do end up with this kind
of unfortunate situation of

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.860
the balls just all destroy
each other.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.110
So I'm not really sure what
to do about that.

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:10.530
Now, again, the goal is to stack
up the balls so they do

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.310
match the ball shadows.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.050
And that's going to be really
hard for me, because I'm going

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.720
to actually have to destroy
some blue balls here.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.070
KOH KIM: Yeah, because
he's kind of run out.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.750
No, but you can keep stacking
on the left.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:23.670
You can just create
a third one.

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.550
DAN GALPIN: But the goal is to
actually make them match.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.750
So that's the challenge here.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: I totally
don't understand.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.690
The goal is to make them match,
but you also need to

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.400
get them higher?

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.440
KOH KIM: Yeah, I
don't think so.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.950
I think we don't want
them to match.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:43.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think the goal
is to not make them match.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:44.180
KOH KIM: No, the goal is
not to make them match.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.800
DAN GALPIN: No, the goal
is to make the

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.950
balls match the shadows.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.570
KOH KIM: Right.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.930
But if you match three of the
same balls, then they're going

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.520
to destroy everything, right?

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.180
DAN GALPIN: So the key thing is
we want to make the balls

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.390
match the shadow, but we
also don't want to

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:55.640
go above the shadow.

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.580
We have to fit all the balls
into the shadow area.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, OK.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:06.910
So what you're saying is you've
got two rows right now.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.690
If you were to stack it
three-high, that's no good?

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:10.730
DAN GALPIN: Yes,
that's correct.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.190
And you exactly match
the puzzle there.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:15.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.810
DAN GALPIN: And because the ball
distribution seems to be

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.850
pretty random, it can be kind
of random-difficult.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.490
I think one of the challenges
with building a game like this

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.150
is getting the difficulty
consistent.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.910
And the two games that I think
that struggle with randomness

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.580
are this game and Word Push.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.200
Both of them really get you
very different levels of

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:39.240
challenge, depending on which
random numbers you get.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.640
This game actually does
have physics, though,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.250
which is kind of cool.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.690
So you'll see that if there's
actually real physics going on

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.630
when the balls fall, which
sometimes is helpful and

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:48.220
sometimes is not.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:48.290
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:49.210
I think they used Box2D.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.160
DAN GALPIN: Probably.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:50.720
Yeah.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.330
Did they say that?

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.020
KOH KIM: Yeah, they said that in
the About notes if you look

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:54.858
carefully enough.

00:21:54.858 --> 00:21:57.062
DAN GALPIN: I did complete the
beginner level there, as you

00:21:57.062 --> 00:21:58.000
see, which is cool.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.570
KOH KIM: But also, yeah,
it takes a while.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.790
DAN GALPIN: So things
to note about this.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.750
This game sort of uses
Android things.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.800
If you click the Back key, once
again, we just exit the

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.480
game immediately.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.880
This game is just, again, not
modifying the standard

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.100
activity behavior, and it does
a lot of things in the same

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.600
activities.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.050
Select level is also done
in the activity, hitting

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.740
the Back key, Quit.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.480
However, they do push up another
activity for when they

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.452
are doing the--

00:22:29.452 --> 00:22:31.920
high scores--

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.180
when they're doing the Help.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.400
So you see, that's another
activity, how hitting the Back

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.960
key does the right thing,
takes you back

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.200
here to where we were.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.995
So this is another game that's
navigationally challenged.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:44.730
Again, it just doesn't
make sense.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.440
If I hit Select Level, it feels
like the Back key should

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.720
bring me back here.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.100
And, also, it sort of forces me,
in this case, to actually

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.116
select something, which is,
like, what do if I don't want

00:22:55.116 --> 00:22:55.750
to select something?

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.560
Well, you select
the same thing.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.050
So, again, I think from an
Android perspective, it

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:00.600
doesn't make sense.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.640
Putting an OK at the bottom
here of the high

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.140
scores is not necessary.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.100
It's not a dialog.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.035
It doesn't look like one to the
user, so it's not needed.

00:23:09.035 --> 00:23:11.516
What we really do need is the
Back key not to just quit out

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:12.410
of the game at this point.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.690
So that's what I wanted to
say about Stack-A-Ball.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:19.865
We have three games that we
really did love here.

00:23:19.865 --> 00:23:21.650
Let's start off with
Rope Rescue.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:29.480
So Rope Rescue to our helpful
technical director here.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.690
KOH KIM: Yeah, so
Rope Rescue--

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.010
and so this is actually
really cool.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:36.490
Because if you look at it, I
mean, even from the splash

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.400
screen, you can automatically
start controlling the

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.310
character, which I think
is a great way to

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.680
integrate and all that.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.610
For one thing, we've seen all
these games like Cut the Rope

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:46.200
or all this stuff.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.220
You're like, oh, let's cut
something, or, oh, let's

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:48.570
destroy something.

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.000
Well, this one's actually
really interesting.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.120
You basically take rope, and
you figure out once we get

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.570
past the oh, no, what
am I supposed to do?

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:57.620
So the object of the game is
you're supposed to take your

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:07.810
rope and hook up on all the
wheels, and then unlock your

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:09.800
baby birds that have
now been captured.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.240
And what's really cool, there's
different elements.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.060
What's great is that it's a
great way of beginning setting

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.980
up the levels.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.090
It tells you, OK, first, this
is what you need to do to

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:23.910
unlock the birdcage.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.860
Here are some of the hazards
you need to watch out for.

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.080
So in this case, it's a knife.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:28.870
Knife cuts rope.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:29.740
You don't want that to happen.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.740
It's kind of sad.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.260
So there's some other stuff,
too, like fire.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.640
Fire burns everything.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.360
Probably bad for you, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.040
DAN GALPIN: I think the really
interesting thing about this

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.090
game is that-- so they're
showing you here how we can

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.190
avoid the knife.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.896
So you do have to touch every
single one of the loops, but

00:24:48.896 --> 00:24:50.690
you can loop around
them like that.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.140
And what's fun about this
game is it is a 2-D

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.500
game, but it's using--

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.990
in as far as the user's input
and control of it-- but it is

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.710
done in 3-D space with 3-D birds
and some really nice

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.050
looking graphics.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:06.340
And they actually get a little
bit of benefit from that, too.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.840
The backgrounds are fuzzy and
a little blurry, because

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.890
they're a little lower
resolution than this device.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:16.445
But the actual game looks very,
very high resolution,

00:25:16.445 --> 00:25:19.060
and the text looks very
high resolution.

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Do you think it's
actually that they're

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:25.020
blurry because of the device,
or do you think it's an

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.310
intentional depth
of field effect?

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.990
DAN GALPIN: I don't think it's
intentional, but I think it

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.080
works very well for them.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.390
That was my feeling.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.140
I could be wrong, there, but
it felt like [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:35.600
graphic.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.110
So, in this case, there's
actually a shorter path,

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.580
[INAUDIBLE].

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.370
And so there's two interesting
things about this.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:43.280
It looks like we actually--

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.910
KOH KIM: Ah, I can't get
the shorter path.

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:46.400
We have to wait.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.110
Oh, I know what it is.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.810
We have to wait till they--

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.760
DAN GALPIN: --until they get
into the right place.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.010
So there's actually--

00:25:56.332 --> 00:25:56.755
like that.

00:25:56.755 --> 00:25:57.475
KOH KIM: Right.

00:25:57.475 --> 00:25:59.410
DAN GALPIN: --I believe
is the shortest path.

00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:02.930
So again, the game
is pretty cool.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.400
Honestly, there aren't a lot of
issues with this game, in

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.770
terms of technical issues.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.840
I was really impressed
with it.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.960
It's great to see a game
here that's pretty

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.900
much ready to go.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.900
KOH KIM: Another cool thing
about this game is that if you

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.170
go back to the menu, and then
you can actually see the bird

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.560
sanctuary on the lower right.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.160
And you can see all the little
birds that you've actually

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.980
saved, including, hopefully,
the butterflies.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:28.660
The one nice-to-have I'd like
about this is that this would

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.400
be pretty cool as a live
wallpaper just

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.470
to track your progress.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.170
So if there's any way to
do that, that's just

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.440
kind of nice to have.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.590
DAN GALPIN: I think that would
actually take this game over

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.380
the top, definitely, to have
the bird sanctuary as your

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.110
live wallpaper.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.260
I think it'd be really cool.

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.350
It'd be fun to use some
more interactions

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.520
with the birds, too.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.380
You know, you could
feed the birds.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.630
You could do whatever.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.220
Overall, again, this game
is just very well done.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.810
Ooh, Back key doesn't
work out of that

00:26:52.810 --> 00:26:53.750
bird sanctuary, though.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:54.230
KOH KIM: Yes.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.810
DAN GALPIN: Unfortunate.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.790
KOH KIM: But there's a Back key
in the actual thing, but

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:00.010
you don't probably need the--

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:01.710
DAN GALPIN: On-screen Back
is generally bad.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:06.180
Also, you see on-screen Back
here, so, in general,

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.010
on-screen Back is not something
that Android users

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.930
are accustomed to using across
all their games and apps.

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.800
We'd rather have no on-screen
Back [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.120
Back key support like that.

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.950
But other than in that screen,
the Back key support looks

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.230
really, really, good.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.620
Navigation's important
in all these things.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.780
KOH KIM: Good job, guys.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:25.940
DAN GALPIN: Awesome.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:29.830
Another game that we really
liked was iBlast Moki 2.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Before you get
into iBlast Moki 2, though,

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.500
folks, I just want to take
a quick beer score.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.620
KOH KIM: Beer score?

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.782
IAN NI-LEWIS: How
many of you--

00:27:37.782 --> 00:27:38.960
yeah--

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.890
have you even gotten past the
neck of your beer, Daniel?

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:42.876
DAN GALPIN: I haven't even
started drinking yet.

00:27:42.876 --> 00:27:43.370
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, you haven't.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.620
KOH KIM: He hasn't even
started drinking.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.800
At least I've gotten past
the neck of my beer.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.350
Come on.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: What
do you think?

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.540
KOH KIM: Look at-- see?

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.360
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:49.860
IAN NI-LEWIS: So this
is the thing.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.190
You know, when I host
this show, I'm

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.042
drinking all the time.

00:27:53.042 --> 00:27:54.210
What's different?

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:58.080
What makes you guys so much--

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.440
I don't want to say better,
but different?

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.080
KOH KIM: I'm a girl.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:00.473
DAN GALPIN: That's true.

00:28:00.473 --> 00:28:00.866
She is.

00:28:00.866 --> 00:28:01.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, come on.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.162
Wait a second--

00:28:03.162 --> 00:28:04.640
no.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.150
I seem to recall that you are
the girl who asked for the

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.146
beers in bottles, as opposed
to, you know, poured in

00:28:11.146 --> 00:28:12.035
glasses or something
like that.

00:28:12.035 --> 00:28:13.720
KOH KIM: I did, but I like
enjoying my beer.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.500
Come on now.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:14.905
[CHUCKLING]

00:28:14.905 --> 00:28:15.870
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:17.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: Just checking.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.860
What do you think, though,
seriously?

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.570
DAN GALPIN: I think
it's actually--

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:20.140
I like it.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.240
No, I really do.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: Just smell it.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:23.060
Just sort of wave it
past your nose.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:23.920
KOH KIM: I like the smell.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:24.310
I like raspberry.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.770
It's a very interesting
[? take. ?]

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:28.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: On the nose,
there's a little raspberry,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.430
but on the palate,
it's super malty.

00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.730
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:32.510
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:34.354
DAN GALPIN: I'm really happy.

00:28:34.354 --> 00:28:37.220
It really is a subtle raspberry
flavor, but it's not

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:37.620
overpowering.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.310
It adds a lot to
the complexity.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.730
Yeah.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.930
I just had to check, because
honestly, this has become one

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:44.720
of my favorite beers.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.370
I really, really like it.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.050
Buying it today was--

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:51.820
it was hard to actually share.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.480
So I wanted to see if things
were going all right.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.030
KOH KIM: It was awesome.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.810
Ian always comes through
at all the beers.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:57.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: There you go.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.125
KOH KIM: Make sure that
we enjoy our Fridays.

00:28:59.125 --> 00:29:00.140
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.040
He comes through in a lot
of ways, actually.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:01.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: There you go.

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:02.230
Oh, yeah.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.601
DAN GALPIN: But beer is
definitely one of them.

00:29:05.601 --> 00:29:06.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: And by the way--

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.280
I'm sorry-- while I have the
floor, I do want to shout out

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.050
to our friend, Markus
Gusenbauer, in Austria.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.290
Hope you're enjoying an awesome
beer yourself, sir.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:22.350
He's one who said, a glass of
beer and a Friday review--

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.300
what else do you need
on a Friday night?

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.012
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:29:25.012 --> 00:29:26.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: Rock
on, my friend.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.090
DAN GALPIN: It really depends
on how much beer.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.130
Because I've found this
show goes down well

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.280
with a lot of beer.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.630
So one thing you'll see here
right at the beginning of

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:37.960
iBlast Moki 2.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.840
There's Play, Create, and
Share as your function.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.090
Wow.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.770
KOH KIM: I mean, even
just going back,

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:44.260
just restart the game.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.540
I think this is probably one of
the best intro screens I've

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.600
seen for a game.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.550
So after the title.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:53.150
Unfortunately, there's
no audio, unless

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.140
they can hear audio.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.200
But the fact that there's
Godzilab, I mean, you just

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.220
have to start the game.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.000
It's pretty amazing.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.600
[CHUCKLING]

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.525
DAN GALPIN: I love the
design of the screen.

00:30:04.525 --> 00:30:05.770
It feels really good.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.180
There's not lots of icons
cluttering things everywhere,

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.340
and you got three
huge functions--

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.020
Play, Create and Share.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.780
And first of all, let me just
say that having a level

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:18.350
creator built into your
game is incredible.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:19.270
And there is OpenFeint.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.030
KOH KIM: Right.

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.860
There's OpenFeint We'll
say no thank you for

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.710
now, or enable it.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.800
DAN GALPIN: I'll enable it.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.200
KOH KIM: All right.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.430
DAN GALPIN: That's cool.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.710
But the fact that you can
actually go online-- look at

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.450
levels-- you can actually
go and create your own

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:30.800
levels in the game--

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.050
is really, really awesome
functionality.

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.980
So this gives the game just
an enormous long-term

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.230
playability.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.590
And I actually kind of wonder
whether they used this at all

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:48.160
to build levels, actually,
within the game, because it is

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.933
pretty highly functional.

00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:51.720
KOH KIM: Although, one
thing I do wish--

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.672
oh, there's the Back key.

00:30:52.672 --> 00:30:56.500
It's like, back, back,
redo, whoa.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.370
Anyway, I thought the level
creator was really cute.

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.190
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:03.120
There's really a lot
you can do with it.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.890
So these are all elements you'll
see in the game, but

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.040
because I thought this was such
a beautiful and unique

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.513
feature, I wanted to at
least call it out.

00:31:10.513 --> 00:31:12.320
You know, really, really
great [INAUDIBLE]--

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.490
KOH KIM: Couldn't even play
it, even though it's--

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:14.115
DAN GALPIN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:14.115 --> 00:31:14.640
physics puzzler.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.830
KOH KIM: Sorry.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:19.460
DAN GALPIN: This kind of physics
puzzler, you can

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.060
actually create your
own stuff with.

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.090
And I think, you know, a lot
of times, one of the

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.205
complaints that I keep talking
about in this generation of

00:31:25.205 --> 00:31:27.575
computing is that there isn't
enough content creation.

00:31:27.575 --> 00:31:29.540
These are all kind of hunt
and consumption devices.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:33.400
But it's great to see a game
that actually allows people to

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.220
do user-generated [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.980
KOH KIM: It's a really
nice surprise, too.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.320
I didn't even know this content
creator existed until

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.550
I actually looked at it.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.460
But let's go back to the
actual game, like

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.270
go in to the Play.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.430
So it's an arcade level,
kind of like another

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.780
physics-based puzzler.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.370
But it's actually pretty cool.

00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:51.630
We'll play the first level.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.680
But a lot of it is you have
these little things--

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.440
I'm a sucker for cute
puzzler games.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.280
But what's really cool is you
basically use bombs, and what

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.270
you're supposed to do is take
the little creatures and use

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.810
the bombs strategically so that
you can put them in this

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:05.976
red portal.

00:32:05.976 --> 00:32:07.730
DAN GALPIN: And one of the
things I really like is that

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:12.175
they make use of simple graphics
for their tutorials.

00:32:12.175 --> 00:32:13.760
There's no text in
the tutorial.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.680
It makes it really, really easy
for the game developer,

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.810
in terms of actually
internationalizing this game.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.750
You certainly don't need to know
English in order to play

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.790
this game, which is great.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.000
It's also very, very
straightforward.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.420
So, really, just a beautiful
job done there.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.190
KOH KIM: And great job also
on the audio, as well.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.600
I think for one thing is, a
lot of mobile games don't

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.920
really take advantage--

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.070
I'm actually really sad.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.840
You guys can't even hear some
of the audio for this game.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.030
But this game in particular has
some great music, great

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.610
sound effects.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.210
And even just the
transitions--

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.260
simple transitions, as
going between levels

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:47.820
and all that stuff.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.530
You can really tell that
the devs put a lot

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:50.350
of effort into this.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:52.760
DAN GALPIN: The interface is
also really, really well

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.010
thought out.

00:32:58.736 --> 00:33:00.665
Closer to make them fly away.

00:33:00.665 --> 00:33:04.730
There's a little bit of English,
but not a lot.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:07.410
And, again, you can see that his
level there is controlled

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:10.280
by how I actually
move this is.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:11.510
This is a really
nice interface.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:13.480
And then, once again,
he's all set.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.180
So now, we're going to blow
these up, and boom!

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.810
We can actually also change the
timing, which gets more

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.650
important as we get farther
and farther into the game.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.870
So the only real technical
feedback I had for this team

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:32.800
was that the game does actually
restart the music

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.610
when you do pause and unpause.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.910
And so if you're in the middle
of a song, it starts you back

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.420
over at the beginning, which is
a little bit unfortunate,

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:43.300
because you don't even realize
the sound is playing at the

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.550
beginning of the music, because
it's very, very quiet.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.515
Which is nice, and I can see how
that would be useful, but

00:33:48.515 --> 00:33:52.730
it's also something that was a
little bit jarring when I was

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.740
actually in the middle
of playing it.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.490
But that's a really
minor issue.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:59.670
Honestly, I did not find
anything significantly wrong

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.680
with this game.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.835
This game is absolutely ready.

00:34:01.835 --> 00:34:03.595
In fact, it may even
be featured now.

00:34:03.595 --> 00:34:05.420
KOH KIM: Yeah, it may be ready
to be featured now.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.690
But I think what's really cool
is variety of gameplay,

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.469
different uses of bombs,
and then also different

00:34:10.469 --> 00:34:12.300
uses of time, too.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.230
It's definitely very
well thought out.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:18.260
The one thing that I do have a
little bit of problems with is

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.460
that I think it requires you to
three-star in every level

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:25.330
before you move to
the next world.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.739
It's great to add
that challenge.

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:28.340
DAN GALPIN: Well, the other
thing here that was

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.530
interesting-- you notice how
this stuff is cut off the top?

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.870
KOH KIM: Right.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:34.080
DAN GALPIN: So this is because
we're on HDMI.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.040
So if I pull out HDMI-- could
we switch to the other view?

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.330
So we'll switch over to
the other view here.

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.370
We'll pull out the HDMI.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:49.300
One thing you can't actually see
here is that, actually, it

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.920
isn't really cut off.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.694
So this means they're actually
not responding.

00:34:52.694 --> 00:34:53.781
Oh, we're getting
a little audio.

00:34:53.781 --> 00:34:56.275
I should turn that off.

00:34:56.275 --> 00:34:57.450
KOH KIM: There it
is, right there.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.330
DAN GALPIN: There we are.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:34:58.670
Sorry.

00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.960
But

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.530
You see here that it's
not cut off anymore.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.280
So we're not responding quite
correctly to the screen size

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.290
changes that are happening when
the HDMI cable is in.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:10.640
And so that's causing the top of
the screen to get cut off.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.580
And you can see here how many
stars I'm currently working on

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.260
and how many points I've gotten
across the levels.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.650
So that was my only comment with
the game, was it didn't

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:23.120
quite handle this ratio
on this device.

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.482
KOH KIM: Oh, that's kind
of sad, but, anyway.

00:35:25.482 --> 00:35:28.040
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, three level
to unlock this bonus world.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.580
That being said, the
game is filled with

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.070
amazing, rich content.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.544
And we really loved it here.

00:35:33.544 --> 00:35:35.180
So, great job, guys.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:38.210
And there's bombs to do all
sorts of different things.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.470
There are bombs that--

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:42.470
KOH KIM: Glue bombs, where
you can stick the Mokis.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:44.325
There's the slick bombs.

00:35:44.325 --> 00:35:45.390
What else is there?

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:47.760
You use the bombs to take
people off the glue.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.340
It's really very clever,
well done.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.270
And I didn't even get to the
second world, because it takes

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:56.620
me three stars on every level,
which I'm not there yet.

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.380
DAN GALPIN: One thing that's
very, very cool that is you

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.150
can also apply the bomb
effects to characters.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.030
So, one of the cool levels--

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.710
KOH KIM: I think it was the
boulder level, right?

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:07.710
I think it was this level.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:08.180
DAN GALPIN: Is that
level there?

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.430
Yeah.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.360
We're on this view here.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.760
So one of the levels, you
actually have to solve by

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.750
actually applying the glue
to the bomb itself.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.630
So you can see the
bomb is there.

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:24.820
And I'm going to now apply the
glue to the bomb, and boom.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.215
KOH KIM: Now it's covered
in green.

00:36:26.215 --> 00:36:27.042
DAN GALPIN: [INAUDIBLE] the
bomb's covered in glue, and so

00:36:27.042 --> 00:36:27.190
he will usually--

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.900
KOH KIM: And it's sticking--
oh, no, you usually pick up

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.610
all three, but he only picked
up one this time.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:32.130
That's OK.

00:36:32.130 --> 00:36:34.630
DAN GALPIN: But I just
didn't have him quite

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:35.630
centered well enough.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.215
He does have to be centered
right in the middle of it.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.330
As an example of--

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:41.710
KOH KIM: Whee!

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.300
Whee!

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.550
Oh, wait, there it is.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.160
There he goes.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:45.620
Oh, all three.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.270
DAN GALPIN: So, again,
lots of really clever

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:49.600
puzzles in this game.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.710
So, yes, definitely thumbs up.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.770
And on top of that, with the
level creation and the

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.740
[INAUDIBLE], it really does
have a lot going for it.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.200
KOH KIM: The only question I
have for the devs when are you

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.440
coming out with plushies?

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.433
I would totally buy
your plushies.

00:37:00.433 --> 00:37:03.330
DAN GALPIN: Again, on-screen
Back key, in general,

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:04.740
we don't like here.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.990
I'd rather not see that.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.577
It isn't everywhere
in the game.

00:37:10.577 --> 00:37:11.978
Most of the time, it
doesn't have it.

00:37:11.978 --> 00:37:15.720
That was my only other comment
for things to change.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.446
KOH KIM: Overall, great job.

00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:18.200
DAN GALPIN: Thumbs up.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.130
KOH KIM: Thumbs up.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.615
Moving on.

00:37:19.615 --> 00:37:22.190
DAN GALPIN: So those are the six
that we planed to look at,

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:24.200
but we do have one
bonus game here--

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.010
KOH KIM: Bonus round!

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:26.600
DAN GALPIN: --which is
Puppy's Plaything.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.756
Now, one of the problems with
Puppy's Plaything is that it

00:37:28.756 --> 00:37:32.810
actually takes an incredibly
long time to load.

00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:34.860
And this isn't so bad here at
the beginning, although,

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:38.790
again, having some sort of
animated progress is a really,

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:40.886
really nice thing to have.

00:37:40.886 --> 00:37:42.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm sorry.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.870
I just have to ask because
I looked at this screen.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.400
Is the name of this company
Smut Works?

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.960
KOH KIM: Smuttlewerk.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.216
IAN NI-LEWIS: (GERMAN
ACCENT) Smuttlewerk.

00:37:53.216 --> 00:37:54.152
OK.

00:37:54.152 --> 00:37:59.880
DAN GALPIN: And you'll see
[INAUDIBLE] here, there's lots

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.030
of stuff here that
are going on.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.090
Some of this is in, I think, the
PlayPhone middleware, and

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.170
some of this is actually
in the game.

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:07.620
It takes a long time, by the
way, for it to actually get to

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:08.300
where I can click
on these things.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.440
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:12.280
your dog here, and
you can see I'm--

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.275
KOH KIM: Can't really
rename your dog.

00:38:13.275 --> 00:38:15.720
DAN GALPIN: I'm [INAUDIBLE]
screen right now, and it took

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.390
me forever to get through this
the first time I played this.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:21.000
So there's just a lot of places
in which they have to

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.540
look at threading
and how they're

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.230
actually handling this.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.373
Now, I actually played this on
my Nexus and did not play it

00:38:27.373 --> 00:38:29.210
on the Transformer Prime.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.140
KOH KIM: But even on my Nexus,
there's definitely some

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:32.640
performance [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.110
Like sometimes when you hit Back
and exit out of the game,

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:38.130
and then when you want to try
and resume, it takes like 10

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.150
seconds to load.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.490
DAN GALPIN: So the real
issue is this.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.100
I hit go to my lock screen.

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.305
I've now locked the device.

00:38:45.305 --> 00:38:46.740
I unlock the device.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.340
Well, now, of course, that
worked just fine.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.892
Let's go to the home screen,
and I'm going to hit this.

00:38:51.892 --> 00:38:54.290
I'm going to go back into the
play house, and you'll see

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.830
that this is what you get.

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:57.430
Now, you might think
your device has

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:58.730
crashed at this point.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.370
KOH KIM: Right-- like,
what happened?

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:01.510
DAN GALPIN: What is
going on here?

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:03.390
Is the game actually
going to recover?

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:05.250
Am I ever going to see the
title screen ever again?

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.530
Now, sometimes it actually
does crash.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.100
Sometimes it actually manages
to recover from this state.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:10.780
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.250
And it looks like we
got maybe a crash.

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.660
Maybe.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.380
Maybe.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.370
DAN GALPIN: So, on this game,
also, out of the three

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:21.075
high-end games is the only one
that does not use and target

00:39:21.075 --> 00:39:23.050
SDK level 11 or above.

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.838
We are seeing the compatibility
menu showing up

00:39:25.838 --> 00:39:28.180
here, which is unfortunate.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.740
But we aren't seeing a zoom
control, so at least it's

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:34.510
doing some of the work there.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:37.890
And I think now it's
just totally lost.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.985
It's having a lot of trouble
on this device.

00:39:39.985 --> 00:39:48.490
So, yeah, in fact, there were
some comments about various

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:49.040
problems here.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.860
But you'll see we can actually
go into the game.

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.350
After spending all of this work
on a game, you really,

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:57.760
really want to see the game do
well, and so having these

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:00.265
little glitches hold up the
game is unfortunate.

00:40:00.265 --> 00:40:03.310
And the game is fun.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.630
It is a sliding game
done in 3D.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:12.980
And you get the idea of how
these kinds of games work.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.080
So the puzzler is that I can
choose the direction that dog

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:17.870
is going to go in.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.430
The goal is to not only get to
the ball, but to get all of

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.970
the bones, in this case
moving across here.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:26.470
And it's got a light source,
which is fun.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.800
A lot of games don't use dynamic
lighting, so it's

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.190
having fun with its
single dynamic

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.670
light, and that's cool.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:36.530
What it really comes down to
right now is polish on the

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:40.110
platform and getting
to that next level.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:42.770
It also looks like there may
be some issues with the

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:46.250
PlayPhone middleware itself.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.060
And, again, there's also
actually some arcade-y

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.230
elements to this.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.240
And I just did this wrong.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.420
That's OK.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:53.670
I'm going to get a bad score.

00:40:56.186 --> 00:40:57.560
KOH KIM: It's OK.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.325
We're not all perfect.

00:40:58.325 --> 00:40:58.600
It's fine.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.090
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:00.140
I know.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.390
I should've known
this already.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.090
But as you can see, it
is definitely fun.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:10.570
It's actually a very, very
simple game with very, very

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.020
complex presentation and a
very nice presentation.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.880
And so I got one star.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.870
KOH KIM: One star.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:18.180
It's OK.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.520
You completed the level.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.990
DAN GALPIN: I've got
all the bones.

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.560
See, here's where it gets
arcade-y, where you actually

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.533
have to time now his movements
so you don't hit the bat.

00:41:26.533 --> 00:41:31.180
But other than that, this level
is like pretty much all

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:35.590
of the other levels
in the game.

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.040
KOH KIM: Yeah, this is the one
where I was trying to figure

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.750
out how to get to the bone.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:41.610
It's OK, whatever.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:43.205
It's all right.

00:41:43.205 --> 00:41:46.230
DAN GALPIN: I actually
see how to do that.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.070
In any case, the game is fun.

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:50.680
And really, it's these little
polish details.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.440
It's very, very important,
though, that if you're going

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:53.210
to have a game--

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:54.560
especially, this is a very
high-end device.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.020
This is a [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:56.640
[? three ?] device.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.820
It's got a gig of RAM on it.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.840
If you're going to reload all
of the textures, and all of

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:06.220
the geometry, and all of the
shaders, after a pause, which

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:09.190
you may have to do any time,
you really do need to have

00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:12.131
some progress indicator to let
people know that their device

00:42:12.131 --> 00:42:13.090
hasn't crashed.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:16.840
Because the experience of
exiting the game and going

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.453
back into the game--

00:42:19.453 --> 00:42:22.250
oh, interesting.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:25.640
So that way, it works
fine from there.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.570
I guess if it gets swapped out,
then that's where it gets

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.380
into trouble.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.330
So that was this game.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:36.790
That was, once again,
Puppy's Plaything.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:40.470
And it was not actually in the
top six, but it looked

00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:41.010
intriguing.

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:41.830
KOH KIM: Yeah.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:43.640
I mean, puppies are great.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: I recall
that I actually made

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:50.860
you guys review this.

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.570
I'm like, oh, dude, we should
totally look at this on the

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.690
strength of the video alone.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.230
And it was really because
of puppies.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.430
KOH KIM: Puppies, yeah.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.730
I mean, I probably maybe
would have liked

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:01.485
to have seen kittens.

00:43:01.485 --> 00:43:02.230
But it's OK.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:03.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, I don't
know what your thing is

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:04.980
with kittens.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.518
What do you have against
puppies?

00:43:06.518 --> 00:43:07.346
KOH KIM: I like both puppies
and kittens.

00:43:07.346 --> 00:43:08.555
Kittens are pretty
adorable, too.

00:43:08.555 --> 00:43:09.920
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wait, we've
got the wrong--

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.310
yea--

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.260
I don't know what you have
against puppies, Koh.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.400
What the hell is your
problem, Koh?

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.755
KOH KIM: I have nothing
against puppies.

00:43:15.755 --> 00:43:17.930
I like kittens, though, too.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:18.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, whatever.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.180
OK, thanks

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:24.050
KOH KIM: Such a hater.

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:26.550
Dude, cats are where it is
on the internet, man.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.030
I mean, everyone watches
cat videos.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.742
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:43:28.742 --> 00:43:29.992
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:35.760
I bet there's no kitten that
looks as cute on ice as that

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.066
puppy does, though.

00:43:37.066 --> 00:43:38.310
Look at him sliding around.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.750
He's got his legs
all splayed out.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:40.150
KOH KIM: Well, it's a
puppy, first of all,

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:41.270
not a kitten, but--

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:42.990
DAN GALPIN: Actually, I think
the main problem with a cat

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:44.642
for this game is the cat
would just be angry.

00:43:44.642 --> 00:43:46.890
It'd be like, rarr!-- freaking
out [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:47.470
on the ice.

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:48.275
IAN NI-LEWIS: Rarr!

00:43:48.275 --> 00:43:49.110
Screw you guys!

00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.540
KOH KIM: So cats probably also
have claws, too, so it

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.920
probably wouldn't work as well
on ice versus the puppy.

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:54.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually,
cats are kind of

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.075
evil, don't you think?

00:43:55.075 --> 00:43:55.835
DAN GALPIN: [CHUCKLING]

00:43:55.835 --> 00:43:56.280
KOH KIM: I don't know.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.570
Cats are pretty independent.

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:57.952
I don't know.

00:43:57.952 --> 00:44:00.190
DAN GALPIN: Actually, I just
think ice-- you know, my cat

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:02.730
would be seriously pissed
off if it were sliding

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:03.940
around on the ice.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
no kidding.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.708
Yeah, puppies, FTW.

00:44:07.708 --> 00:44:08.130
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:09.990
DAN GALPIN: It could
be kittens, though.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:12.890
Kittens looking kind of cute and
wobbly on the ice would be

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:13.350
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:13.850
All right.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:14.350
Anyways--

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:18.630
KOH KIM: But, anyways, that's
all we have for today, right?

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:21.020
DAN GALPIN: That is all
we have for today.

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.624
KOH KIM: What are we
doing next week?

00:44:22.624 --> 00:44:25.530
DAN GALPIN: That is
a good question.

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: We're actually
doing NFL football.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:29.800
KOH KIM: Oh, it's sports.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.530
Yeah!

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.190
DAN GALPIN: Specifically,
NFL football.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.045
KOH KIM: NFL football?

00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:33.950
That's too bad.

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:35.385
I mean, soccer is a
much bigger sport.

00:44:35.385 --> 00:44:37.470
Or I should say football,
the real football.

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:38.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: No!

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:39.850
KOH KIM: Why?

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.210
DAN GALPIN: We are getting
to the start of football.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:48.394
So we do have a series
here of games.

00:44:48.394 --> 00:44:49.885
We actually are probably not
going to have quite as many

00:44:49.885 --> 00:44:50.840
NFL football games.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:54.530
But, again, it doesn't have to
be a pure football game.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.550
It could be a kick simulation.

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:58.765
For example, there are games
that are just, you know, kick

00:44:58.765 --> 00:44:59.820
a ball through the--

00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.560
KOH KIM: --the field goal.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.790
It could be a field goal game.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:05.020
It could be fantasy football,
football manager.

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:07.620
This is probably going to be my
week, but, unfortunately,

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:08.940
I'm going to be at PAX.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, I think
that's wonderful.

00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:13.570
So Koh is going to be at PAX.

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:14.900
And we are super excited.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:17.780
She is going to be reporting
from PAX live.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.770
KOH KIM: I don't know
about live.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:20.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: She's going to
be using modern technology.

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.900
KOH KIM: By modern,
you mean my phone.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:23.327
[LAUGHING]

00:45:23.327 --> 00:45:24.181
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:45:24.181 --> 00:45:24.940
DAN GALPIN: She's going to be
taking videos [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wait, I'm
sorry, is your phone

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.780
not an Android phone?

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:28.830
Isn't that modern--

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:29.700
even postmodern technology?

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:29.950
KOH KIM: It's an Android phone.

00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:30.290
See?--

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.970
Galaxy Nexus.

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:31.470
It's OK.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wouldn't you say
that you're living in the

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:33.930
future with your Nexus S, Koh?

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.150
KOH KIM: I'm always living in
the-- it's not a Nexus S. It's

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.020
a Galaxy Nexus, dude.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.560
[CHUCKLING]

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.820
Nexus S is so last year.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:42.220
Come on.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:43.360
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually,
you know what, Koh?

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.010
We're going to give you an
even newer phone for PAX.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.675
KOH KIM: Oh.

00:45:46.675 --> 00:45:46.940
DAN GALPIN: Oh.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.595
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:45:47.595 --> 00:45:48.320
KOH KIM: Oh.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:53.390
So if any of you are attending
PAX next week, definitely try

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.870
to find me.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:56.990
I'll probably be wandering the
Indie Megabooth or somewhere

00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.410
around there.

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:01.100
So if you have a game to show
me, be sure to try to find me.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:02.280
I'll definitely give
you a couple of

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:02.960
minutes to look at it.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: You didn't really
introduce yourself.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:04.550
What do you do for Google?

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:05.770
KOH KIM: What do I
do for Google?

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:07.045
IAN NI-LEWIS: Besides
review games.

00:46:07.045 --> 00:46:08.910
KOH KIM: Besides review games?

00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:13.540
I work with game developers to
bring their games to Google

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:15.490
Play and all Google platforms.

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.720
And so maybe a big deal?

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:18.710
Maybe?

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:19.260
Probably not.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.990
I'm not that big of a deal.

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:24.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Koh is
a really big deal.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.340
For all of those of you who
thought I was a big deal or

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:29.720
Dan was a big deal--

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.530
DAN GALPIN: I don't think
anyone, actually, thought I

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:31.030
was a big deal.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:33.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, actually there
were some people who

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:36.330
thought you were a big-- those
in the know knew that you were

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:36.800
a big deal.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.130
You were the power behind
the Google Play throne.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:43.352
But now, Koh has usurped
your position.

00:46:43.352 --> 00:46:44.296
DAN GALPIN: That's
true, actually.

00:46:44.296 --> 00:46:44.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: And mine.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.720
KOH KIM: Mostly because I
fulfill a demographic that's

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.740
kind of weird and rare, but--

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.700
DAN GALPIN: What demographic
is that?

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.760
KOH KIM: Well, I'm bringing
diversity to the show now.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.855
I mean, before it was
two Caucasian males.

00:46:56.855 --> 00:46:57.653
[LAUGHING]

00:46:57.653 --> 00:46:58.579
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hey!

00:46:58.579 --> 00:47:00.894
DAN GALPIN: We had Daniel
Pham here last week and

00:47:00.894 --> 00:47:01.357
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:47:01.357 --> 00:47:03.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: We rather prefer
the word "white."

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:03.670
KOH KIM: White?

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:04.720
OK?

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.080
I was trying to be politically
correct.

00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: We're like two
white guys-- actually, we're

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:08.960
two old, white guys.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.120
DAN GALPIN: Old, white guys--
yeah, absolutely.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:10.430
KOH KIM: Old?

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.770
OK.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:11.960
I didn't think you
were that old.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:12.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, hell yeah.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:16.950
Did you see my picture before
we replaced it with that

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.530
awesome picture of you?

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.320
Yeah, my hair had so much
gray in it, like

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.620
more gray than normal.

00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:29.450
Daniel Pham really did an
excellent job of [INAUDIBLE]--

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.636
DANIEL PHAM: Thanks, guys.

00:47:31.636 --> 00:47:35.100
DAN GALPIN: So, anyways,
we are wrapping up.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:37.310
Again, we did say NFL football,
not because it has

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:39.950
to be licensed by the
NFL, but what we're

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:41.440
talking about is American--

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.230
KOH KIM: American
football games.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:44.490
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually, I seem
to recall that the person who

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:47.070
said NFL football was actually
[? Ray Toh ?]

00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:51.580
when we asked, how will we
distinguish it from "real

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:56.410
football?" No, actually,
[? Ray Toh ?]

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:57.400
doesn't have--

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:57.780
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:58.160
DAN GALPIN: It's
Scottish there.

00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.306
It's real football.

00:47:59.306 --> 00:48:00.556
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:02.982 --> 00:48:04.860
DAN GALPIN: We play
with someone's

severed skull in Scotland.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.180
And that's not like Americans'
pigskin, you know.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:13.050
KOH KIM: I do hope we do cover
real football games, though,

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.470
because, I mean, that's also
starting up as well.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:17.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Do you
mean soccer?

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.250
KOH KIM: In America,
it's soccer.

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:21.880
But outside of the US,
it is football.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:25.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: The point is that
next week is the start of

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.497
the NFL season.

00:48:28.497 --> 00:48:30.994
And, actually, we're doing this
in the App Review, too.

00:48:30.994 --> 00:48:36.480
So, yeah, fantasy football
games, apps for tracking your

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:41.260
favorite team, apps that
involve kicking around,

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.190
really, any ball that's
not round, but more

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:45.680
of an oblong shape.

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.430
KOH KIM: Or even tackling
games are fun, too, man.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:51.030
DAN GALPIN: Live wallpapers that
are truly awesome around

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:52.170
NFL football.

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.630
There's really a lot of
options out there.

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:56.650
Also, I will say--

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.590
I wanted to note that "soccer"
is actually a British term to

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:01.610
describe what is the ball.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:02.565
That's how we got it.

00:49:02.565 --> 00:49:04.000
But then the Brits decided
they didn't

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.150
like that term anymore.

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:07.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: Ooh, kind
of like roundabouts.

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:07.290
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.340
So "soccer" is perfectly
acceptable.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:13.120
It came from the UK, so
therefore, they must find it

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:13.445
acceptable.

00:49:13.445 --> 00:49:14.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: (BRITISH ACCENT)
The only thing we say in a

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.760
British accent must
be believed.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.520
Do you know why?

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.590
Because--

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.815
actually, I have no idea why.

00:49:21.815 --> 00:49:23.960
Why do you speak in a British
accent so often, Dan?

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.930
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:27.500
DAN GALPIN: Because, obviously,
that's what the

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.230
announcers on those made-for-TV
products are

00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.710
using, so--

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:31.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
true-- or the BBC.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.190
DAN GALPIN: (BRITISH ACCENT)
This is really an amazing

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:34.300
tablet-- this Nexus 7.

00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.090
You've got to see
it right now.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:36.810
Look what you can do.

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:38.320
You can use it as a tea tray.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:46.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: What kind of
cable subscription and/or

[INAUDIBLE] stash do
you have, Dan?

00:49:50.644 --> 00:49:51.540
Oh, my God.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.110
KOH KIM: But I suppose Dr.
Who is starting up soon

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.130
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:49:56.130 --> 00:50:01.260
So I've just offended all of
the British and Australian

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:03.810
viewers of this show, so I
wanted to apologize for my

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:07.425
poor approximation of an accent
from the British Isles.

00:50:07.425 --> 00:50:10.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: That was the
first time Dan has ever

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.780
apologized for his
British accent.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:13.220
KOH KIM: I know.

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.730
This is a new one for me.

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:15.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: --even though it
has been deployed more than

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.715
100 times in the past year.

00:50:16.715 --> 00:50:17.750
DAN GALPIN: That's true.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:18.720
But you started it.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.920
KOH KIM: You started it.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:23.300
OK, now we're starting with
who started what.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:24.720
Why am I in the middle of this?

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.105
OK?

00:50:25.105 --> 00:50:26.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, break
this up, Koh.

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:27.240
Come on.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:27.730
KOH KIM: Ah, jeez.

00:50:27.730 --> 00:50:30.620
Well, anyway, thanks for
your time, guys.

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:31.715
Thank you to Daniel Pham.

00:50:31.715 --> 00:50:32.010

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:33.240
It's engineer Daniel!

KOH KIM: Hopefully, I'll see you
all in Seattle next week.

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.991
Definitely wave.

00:50:40.991 --> 00:50:42.344
Stop me and say hi.

00:50:42.344 --> 00:50:42.946
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hey, man,
we're not paying

00:50:42.946 --> 00:50:43.710
for this by the minute.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:44.030
DAN GALPIN: We started
late, also.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.865
Remember that.

00:50:44.865 --> 00:50:45.745
DANIEL PHAM: We did
start late.

00:50:45.745 --> 00:50:47.250
That's true.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:49.710
DAN GALPIN: So, next week,
coming from PAX in Seattle,

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.050
we're going to have Koh Kim.

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:52.710
So definitely find her.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:53.320
Say hello.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.660
And she's going to be finding
some awesome stuff for us to

00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:56.800
talk about.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.030
KOH KIM: Hopefully--
hopefully--

00:50:58.030 --> 00:50:58.495
I'm sure.

the App Review and the

nominate your favorite stuff.

pretty much it.

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:08.190

really sure how to
