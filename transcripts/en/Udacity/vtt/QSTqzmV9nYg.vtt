00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.100
So now that we have our text in place
for our ad, we need to add our keywords.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.689
These are the foundation
of your ad group.

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.460
Your ad has a possibility of
appearing in the top search results

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.620
when people search these keywords.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.720
Google recommends starting with 10
to 20 keywords that are specific to

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.740
phrases that your potential
customers may use when searching for

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.450
your product or service.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.820
Google also recommends
avoiding 1 word keywords.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.810
Which if you think about it makes sense.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.550
Imagine if we use the keyword, dog.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.100
Think of everything that
can be related to that.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.275
Dog health info, blogs about dogs,
news articles relating to dogs.

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:43.025
Videos of dogs, things on Animal Planet,
buying a dog, cute dog pictures,

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:48.855
hot dogs, being sick as a dog, getting
a little hair of the dog, dog whistles,

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:53.760
dog parks types of dogs, I could go
on but I think you get the picture.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.370
Non of these have anything
to do with dog sitting.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.860
To avoid that chaos you can use
Google Trends Keyword Planner

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.010
that we went over previously to help you
choose the keyboards you want to use.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.640
So let's send in our keywords.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.290
After we've filled out our app, I'm
going to scroll down to make keywords.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.230
We'll go with dog sitting, luxury
dog sitting, dog care, pet sitting,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.570
pet care, home dog sitting,
in home dog sitting, dog services,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.780
pet sitter, dog sitter, pet hotel, what
to do with my dog while on vacation.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.880
And we can add more.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.710
Before we move on let's hear from Chris,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.130
a marketing expert about
choosing keywords, and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.820
then Andrea, an ad words expert about
figuring out our budget and bidding.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.280
So we'll be ready to launch our ad.
