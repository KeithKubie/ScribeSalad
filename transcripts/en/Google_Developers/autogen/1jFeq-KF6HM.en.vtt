and upload it that also could take a few
seconds<00:06:17.470><c> but</c><00:06:18.470><c> our</c><00:06:18.919><c> video</c><00:06:19.160><c> is</c><00:06:19.250><c> not</c><00:06:19.400><c> that</c><00:06:19.700><c> big</c><00:06:19.970><c> so</c>

seconds but our video is not that big so
so<00:06:22.789><c> that</c><00:06:22.940><c> should</c><00:06:23.150><c> be</c><00:06:23.180><c> up</c><00:06:23.419><c> in</c><00:06:23.690><c> a</c><00:06:24.320><c> few</c><00:06:24.350><c> seconds</c>

amazing<00:07:59.770><c> demo</c><00:08:00.100><c> can</c><00:08:00.850><c> just</c><00:08:01.120><c> talk</c><00:08:01.270><c> a</c><00:08:01.450><c> bit</c><00:08:01.660><c> about</c>

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
amazing demo can just talk a bit about
 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
amazing demo can just talk a bit about
how<00:08:02.169><c> this</c><00:08:02.320><c> app</c><00:08:02.530><c> implemented</c><00:08:03.160><c> what</c>

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.370 align:start position:0%
how this app implemented what
 

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.690 align:start position:0%
how this app implemented what
programming<00:08:03.820><c> languages</c><00:08:04.360><c> did</c><00:08:04.540><c> you</c><00:08:04.690><c> use</c><00:08:05.700><c> yeah</c>

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:06.700 align:start position:0%
programming languages did you use yeah
 

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
programming languages did you use yeah
certainly<00:08:07.050><c> so</c><00:08:08.050><c> all</c><00:08:08.410><c> our</c><00:08:08.470><c> core</c><00:08:09.130><c> is</c><00:08:09.460><c> built</c><00:08:09.940><c> in</c>

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.030 align:start position:0%
certainly so all our core is built in
 

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
certainly so all our core is built in
C++<00:08:10.979><c> because</c><00:08:11.979><c> we</c><00:08:12.430><c> have</c><00:08:12.580><c> a</c><00:08:12.610><c> lot</c><00:08:12.820><c> of</c><00:08:13.110><c> functions</c>

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.110 align:start position:0%
C++ because we have a lot of functions
 

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:15.270 align:start position:0%
C++ because we have a lot of functions
that<00:08:14.140><c> are</c><00:08:14.260><c> very</c><00:08:14.410><c> close</c><00:08:14.680><c> to</c><00:08:14.800><c> the</c><00:08:14.860><c> operating</c>

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
that are very close to the operating
 

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
that are very close to the operating
system<00:08:15.640><c> so</c><00:08:16.390><c> that's</c><00:08:16.690><c> sort</c><00:08:16.960><c> of</c><00:08:17.080><c> what</c><00:08:17.290><c> we</c><00:08:17.410><c> found</c>

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:17.590 align:start position:0%
system so that's sort of what we found
 

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:20.790 align:start position:0%
system so that's sort of what we found
most<00:08:17.950><c> suitable</c><00:08:18.340><c> and</c><00:08:18.870><c> the</c><00:08:19.870><c> UI</c><00:08:20.080><c> and</c><00:08:20.500><c> other</c>

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
most suitable and the UI and other
 

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.770 align:start position:0%
most suitable and the UI and other

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:33.729 align:start position:0%
guys use the C sharp well it's a it's a
 

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:36.930 align:start position:0%
guys use the C sharp well it's a it's a
pretty<00:08:34.000><c> a</c><00:08:34.780><c> lot</c><00:08:35.650><c> of</c><00:08:35.680><c> people</c><00:08:35.770><c> know</c><00:08:36.010><c> C</c><00:08:36.400><c> sharp</c><00:08:36.729><c> and</c>

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:36.940 align:start position:0%
pretty a lot of people know C sharp and
 

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.390 align:start position:0%
pretty a lot of people know C sharp and
and<00:08:37.120><c> it's</c><00:08:37.750><c> easier</c><00:08:38.229><c> usually</c><00:08:38.650><c> to</c><00:08:38.740><c> develop</c><00:08:39.190><c> in</c><00:08:39.310><c> a</c>

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
and it's easier usually to develop in a

and it's easier usually to develop in a

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
face using C sharp so I think that's why
 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.149 align:start position:0%
face using C sharp so I think that's why
we

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
we
 

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
we

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.370 align:start position:0%
originally chose C sharp okay maybe we
 

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.610 align:start position:0%
originally chose C sharp okay maybe we
all<00:08:45.550><c> talked</c><00:08:45.790><c> about</c><00:08:45.940><c> if</c><00:08:46.269><c> you</c><00:08:46.389><c> guys</c><00:08:46.600><c> use</c><00:08:46.810><c> the</c><00:08:47.170><c> or</c>

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:47.620 align:start position:0%
all talked about if you guys use the or
 

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
all talked about if you guys use the or

a PS through the client libraries or
 

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
a PS through the client libraries or
just<00:08:49.990><c> like</c><00:08:50.170><c> the</c><00:08:50.290><c> straight</c><00:08:50.949><c> to</c><00:08:51.100><c> the</c><00:08:51.160><c> cold</c><00:08:52.649><c> well</c>

just like the straight to the cold well
I<00:08:53.680><c> think</c><00:08:54.100><c> I</c><00:08:54.310><c> can</c><00:08:54.459><c> answer</c><00:08:54.579><c> that</c><00:08:55.500><c> initially</c><00:08:56.500><c> we</c>

00:08:56.639 --> 00:08:56.649 align:start position:0%
I think I can answer that initially we
 

00:08:56.649 --> 00:08:59.309 align:start position:0%
I think I can answer that initially we

00:08:59.309 --> 00:08:59.319 align:start position:0%
were trying to implement it in C++ but
 

00:08:59.319 --> 00:09:02.210 align:start position:0%

a lot of things were changing so it

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:11.890 align:start position:0%
thing that you see on youtube so there's
 

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
thing that you see on youtube so there's
like<00:12:12.070><c> a</c><00:12:12.100><c> 40</c><00:12:12.579><c> 45</c><00:12:12.970><c> second</c><00:12:13.360><c> delay</c><00:12:13.600><c> and</c><00:12:13.839><c> that</c><00:12:14.350><c> would</c>

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:14.589 align:start position:0%
like a 40 45 second delay and that would
 

00:12:14.589 --> 00:12:19.230 align:start position:0%
like a 40 45 second delay and that would
probably<00:12:15.310><c> kill</c><00:12:16.260><c> any</c><00:12:17.260><c> any</c><00:12:18.040><c> sort</c><00:12:18.370><c> of</c><00:12:18.459><c> real-time</c>

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
probably kill any any sort of real-time
 

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
probably kill any any sort of real-time
