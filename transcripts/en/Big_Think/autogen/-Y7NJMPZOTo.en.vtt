are all caught in webs of of power that
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.609
are all caught in webs of of power that
we perhaps not even aware of and that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619

whether we like it or not we are always
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.009
whether we like it or not we are always
in a in a hierarchy of power where we

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
in a in a hierarchy of power where we
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.940
in a in a hierarchy of power where we
are both sort of being submitting to to

are both sort of being submitting to to
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.170
are both sort of being submitting to to
it and enforcing it ourselves and and I

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180
it and enforcing it ourselves and and I
 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.979
it and enforcing it ourselves and and I
was interested in this the nebulous

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
was interested in this the nebulous
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.190
was interested in this the nebulous
nature of of power and complicity in a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
nature of of power and complicity in a
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.540
nature of of power and complicity in a
sense that guilt is never one

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
sense that guilt is never one
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.250
sense that guilt is never one
dimensional and that you know I think in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
dimensional and that you know I think in
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.610
dimensional and that you know I think in
this day and age it's the concept of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
this day and age it's the concept of
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.880
this day and age it's the concept of
evil is talked about any sort of black

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
evil is talked about any sort of black
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.219
evil is talked about any sort of black
and white terms but there's a lot of you

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
and white terms but there's a lot of you
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500
and white terms but there's a lot of you
know very interesting theorists who have

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
know very interesting theorists who have
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510
know very interesting theorists who have
looked at the concept of evil and you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520
looked at the concept of evil and you
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.530
looked at the concept of evil and you
know how the banality of evil is Hannah

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540
know how the banality of evil is Hannah
 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.609
know how the banality of evil is Hannah
Arendt would say or the sense that you

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619
Arendt would say or the sense that you
 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.440
Arendt would say or the sense that you
know ordinary people are capable of

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
know ordinary people are capable of
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.730
know ordinary people are capable of
extraordinary evil things so it's that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
extraordinary evil things so it's that
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.399
extraordinary evil things so it's that
sense of the kind of the bleeding of of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
sense of the kind of the bleeding of of
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.020
sense of the kind of the bleeding of of
power and capacity in it yeah we all are

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
power and capacity in it yeah we all are
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.190
power and capacity in it yeah we all are
in every single act that we that we do

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
in every single act that we that we do
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.609
in every single act that we that we do
we are somehow you know complicit in all

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619
we are somehow you know complicit in all
 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.469
we are somehow you know complicit in all
sorts of things and I guess that brings

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
sorts of things and I guess that brings
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.480
sorts of things and I guess that brings
up the issue of you know whether we are

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
up the issue of you know whether we are
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.090
up the issue of you know whether we are
more accountable for the sins of

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100
more accountable for the sins of
 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.100
more accountable for the sins of
commission or omission and I'm not sure

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
commission or omission and I'm not sure
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.800
commission or omission and I'm not sure
anyone really answers that question

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810
 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.900
this is part of the human condition that

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910
this is part of the human condition that
 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.800
this is part of the human condition that
we go through life hurting people and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810
we go through life hurting people and
 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.469
we go through life hurting people and
that's you know we can't get away from

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479
that's you know we can't get away from
 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.930
that's you know we can't get away from
it but yeah I think it particularly

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940
it but yeah I think it particularly
 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.359
it but yeah I think it particularly
comes to a head in this age of

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369
comes to a head in this age of
 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.410
comes to a head in this age of
globalization where we are I'm really

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420
globalization where we are I'm really
 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.449
globalization where we are I'm really
connected in all these myriad ways that

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459
connected in all these myriad ways that
 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.699
connected in all these myriad ways that
are often invisible to us and so we've

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709
are often invisible to us and so we've
 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.670
are often invisible to us and so we've
in many ways I think lost saints and

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680
in many ways I think lost saints and
 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.530
in many ways I think lost saints and
lost side of the structures within which

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540
lost side of the structures within which
 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.970
lost side of the structures within which
we live and that's the you know that's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980
we live and that's the you know that's
 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.390
we live and that's the you know that's
truly the it's a dangerous road to go

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400
truly the it's a dangerous road to go
 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.500
truly the it's a dangerous road to go
down I think where we've lost touch you

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510
down I think where we've lost touch you
 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.710
down I think where we've lost touch you
know not just from we've become

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720
know not just from we've become
 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.210
know not just from we've become
alienated certainly from the means of

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220
alienated certainly from the means of
 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.220
alienated certainly from the means of
production but I think also from as a

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230
production but I think also from as a
 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.270
production but I think also from as a
result and we've become less and less

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280
result and we've become less and less
 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.100
result and we've become less and less
accountable for the things we do because

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110
accountable for the things we do because
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.070
accountable for the things we do because
they are more and more hidden from us

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080
they are more and more hidden from us
 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:01.259
they are more and more hidden from us
and I feel this a lot in America because

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269
and I feel this a lot in America because
 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.449
and I feel this a lot in America because
you know having sort of lived here now

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459
you know having sort of lived here now
 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.199
you know having sort of lived here now
through this this war in Iraq and having

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209
through this this war in Iraq and having
 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.330
through this this war in Iraq and having
seen really nothing changed at a

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
seen really nothing changed at a
 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.920
seen really nothing changed at a
day-to-day level living your life in in

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930
day-to-day level living your life in in
 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.570
day-to-day level living your life in in
a country that's at war and that's a

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580
a country that's at war and that's a
 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.460
a country that's at war and that's a
particularly American thing right

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470
particularly American thing right
 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.080
particularly American thing right
there's never been conflict on this

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090
there's never been conflict on this
 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.680
there's never been conflict on this
piece of land except for the civil war

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690
piece of land except for the civil war
 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.720
piece of land except for the civil war
but it's that sense that these things

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730
but it's that sense that these things
 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.380
but it's that sense that these things
can be done in our names and yet so

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390
can be done in our names and yet so
 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.810
can be done in our names and yet so
invisible to us unless you seek them out

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820
invisible to us unless you seek them out
 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.930
invisible to us unless you seek them out
and so that we get lulled into a sense

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940
and so that we get lulled into a sense
 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.890
and so that we get lulled into a sense
of complacency and I'll true and the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900
of complacency and I'll true and the
 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.229
of complacency and I'll true and the
blood that's on our hands is you know we

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239
blood that's on our hands is you know we
 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.910
blood that's on our hands is you know we
we don't see it but I do think it has

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920
we don't see it but I do think it has
 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.569
we don't see it but I do think it has
still has a corrupting effect and that

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579
still has a corrupting effect and that
 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.949
still has a corrupting effect and that
you can't help but have your moral

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959
you can't help but have your moral
 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.040
you can't help but have your moral
compass start to go awry when you

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050
compass start to go awry when you
 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.390
compass start to go awry when you
of things are being done in your name

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400
of things are being done in your name
 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:03.740
of things are being done in your name
whether you know it or not
