00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.059
This episode of Crash Course is brought to
you by Squarespace.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:13.379
You run us. YOU run us. You RAN us.
You ran us. Ooo- Ooo ran ose.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.720
There are five planets in our solar system
you can see without a telescope; well, six

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.440
if you include the one you’re sitting on.
But there are two more big ones out there,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.860
orbiting the Sun out in the cold depths of
the outer solar system: Uranus and Neptune.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.500
They’re a lot alike in many ways, but of
course they have their individual quirks.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.740
Uranus was the first planet to be discovered,
and by that I mean it wasn’t known in ancient

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.350
times. It took an astronomer with a telescope
to find it. In 1781, William Herschel was

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.620
mapping the skies through his telescope when
he spotted a greenish object that was clearly

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.310
a disk and not a dot, like a star. He noted
its position, and moved on. But when he went

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.890
to observe it again sometime later, he was
astonished to discover it had moved!

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.770
It was quickly determined to be a planet,
more distant from the Sun than Saturn. In

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.340
true brown-nosing style, he named it Georgium
Sidus, or George’s star, after the reigning

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.479
king George III. Yeah, happily, that name
didn’t stick, and keeping with the nomenclature

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.659
of Roman gods, the new planet was dubbed Uranus.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.740
Interesting tidbit: It actually is visible
to the unaided eye if you have very sharp

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.219
eyesight and very dark skies. It’s right
on the thin hairy edge of visibility. What’s

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.409
funny is that several people had observed
it before Herschel, but none had noticed its

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.579
movement. Some even catalogued it on their
maps as a star!

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.789
The planet is massive—about 14.5 times the
mass of Earth—but not terribly dense. This

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.629
means its interior must be made of lightweight
stuff. Scientific models of the planet based on physics

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:51.460
and chemistry of the outer solar system indicate
its interior is probably made up of three general layers.

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.749
There’s a small rocky core, smaller than
Earth, surrounded by a very thick layer of

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.709
materials like water, ammonia and methane.
This mantle makes up the bulk of the planet,

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.579
in fact, and is dense, hot, and under a lot
of pressure. In many ways, it’s more like

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.459
an ocean than anything else. However, somewhat
confusingly I’ll admit, outer solar system

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.290
planetary scientists refer to water, ammonia,
and methane as “ice,” so even though it’s not

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.580
ice like we usually think of it here on Earth,
we say that the mantle of Uranus is “icy.”

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.320
To distinguish it from the gas giants Jupiter
and Saturn, Uranus is called an “ice giant.”

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.240
Speaking of “ice,” here’s a really weird
thing: Studies have shown that the pressure

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.560
inside Uranus can break up methane molecules,
squeezing the carbon in them so tightly that

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.720
it actually forms diamonds! These would then
fall down to the base of the mantle like sparkly

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.180
hailstones. Except it’s dark. But still,
down there in the depths of Uranus there may

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.540
even be an ocean of liquid diamonds, where
solid ones float like, um, diamondbergs.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.560
Not that we’ll ever see that. When we observe
the planet, we’re only seeing the top of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.280
its atmosphere. Besides hydrogen and helium,
the air there is about 2% methane. Methane

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.560
is really good at absorbing red light, which means the
light we see reflected from Uranus is mostly green

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.980
and blue, making the planet look distinctly cyan or
aquamarine. And it’s pretty striking through a telescope.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.200
But in visible light the planet looks almost
featureless. It doesn’t have that deep banding

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.320
like Jupiter, or even the pale ones of Saturn,
though when you look in the infrared some

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.770
banding can be seen.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.500
There are clouds, but again they’re difficult
to see in visible light. The clouds are made

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.230
of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide—that
last one is what makes rotten eggs smell so

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.320
bad. I’d avoid breathing through your noise
at Uranus.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:36.020
But then, the atmosphere there is negative 220
Celsius, so that might be a better reason not to inhale.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.360
In late 2014, a bunch of storms popped up
in Uranus’s atmosphere, so big and bright

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.510
they were easily visible from Earth. The storms
may have dredged up very reflective methane

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.320
ice from lower down in the atmosphere -- and
this time, I do mean icy ice -- which is why

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.800
they were bright. The northern hemisphere
of Uranus is approaching summertime, which

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.520
may be why these storms formed.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.900
And that brings us to the weirdest thing about
this planet: It’s sideways!

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.620
If you were above the Earth’s north pole
looking down, you’d see our planet spinning

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.780
counter-clockwise, west to east. The Sun spins
that way, and all the planets do as well…

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.200
except Venus and Uranus. While Venus is flipped
all the way over, Uranus is tilted by about

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.340
98°. That means that in the summer, its axis
is pointed almost directly at the Sun, so

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.100
seasons on Uranus are pretty extreme, by outer
solar system standards. Weird.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.680
No one knows why Uranus is tipped so much.
An obvious thought is that it got whacked,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.130
hard, by an impact long ago. If it were a
grazing collision by a BIG object, that could

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.550
have pushed hard enough on the planet to tip
it over.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.860
Unfortunately, Uranus is very far away, and
has only been visited by spacecraft once—Voyager

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.320
2, in 1986—and even then it was a quick
flyby. Uranus’s weird tilt is just one of

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.020
those many mysteries that astronomers are
trying to solve with limited data.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.430
Uranus has a magnetic field, but it’s truly
odd: Its axis is tipped by over 50° from

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.790
the planet’s spin axis, and it’s way off-center;
the center of the magnetosphere is about 8000

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:05.990
km from the planet’s center. It may be that
the magnetic field is generated in the icy

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.290
mantle, or that the core somehow interferes
with the magnetic field, throwing it off.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.340
Truthfully, no one really knows why.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.110
Uranus has more than two dozen moons;
five big ones and a bunch of dinkier ones.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.500
Cool fact: The moons are named after characters
in Shakespeare plays. So we have Ariel, Umbriel,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.500
Titania, Oberon, and Miranda. Even Puck!

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.210
Of them all, I think the most interesting
one is Miranda. When Voyager 2 flew past,

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.080
it revealed an icy world that looks like it
was put together by Dr. Frankenstein: a patchwork

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.510
of jumbled terrains all crammed together,
criss-crossed by canyons and grooves. It’s

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.430
possible a giant impact in its past actually
disrupted the moon somewhat, and it settled

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.389
back together into this weird mishmash.

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.450
But the reason I like it so much is a feature
called Verona Rupes: It’s the tallest cliff

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.590
in the solar system, 5 to 10 kilometers high.
If you jumped off the top, it would take you

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.870
six minutes to fall to the surface! That would
be a fantastic ride.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.280
Like Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus has a ring
system, too. They were discovered by accident

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.870
in 1997; astronomers were observing Uranus
pass directly in front of a star. They were

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.940
hoping to use this to gather information about
the planet’s atmosphere as starlight passed

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.400
through it. But they saw several dips in starlight
before the main event, which they realized

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.060
were from rings around the planet.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.930
The rings are made of dark particles, probably
ice and reddish organic molecules. There are

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.740
13 rings known, most of them are very faint
and narrow. They may have been created by

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.040
an impact completely shattering a small moon orbiting
Uranus, but as for now, the ring origins are unclear.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.000
And then, finally, we have Neptune, the guardian
of the solar system’s nether regions. Neptune

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.250
is an ice giant, like Uranus, and has a lot
of similarities. Like its green brother, it

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:49.660
probably has a rocky core surrounded by a
thick icy mantle of water, ammonia, and methane.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.370
Above that is an atmosphere of hydrogen, helium,
and methane.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.070
But there are differences, too. Neptune is
more massive than Uranus; 17 times Earth’s

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:02.090
mass, versus just 14.5 for Uranus. Neptune
is slightly smaller than Uranus, which means

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.760
it’s a lot denser. Also, while Uranus is
teal, Neptune is a deep, rich azure—I like

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.620
to call it “the other blue planet”, the
first one being, y’know, Earth. Through

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:17.320
a telescope, Neptune’s color is quite lovely.
It has roughly the same amount of red-light-absorbing

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.270
methane in its atmosphere, as Uranus does.
So its deeper blue hue is something of a mystery.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.720
That may have to do with its active atmosphere.
Unlike blander Uranus, Neptune has clouds

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.310
of methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide
lying the skies at different depths, and white

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.780
streaky clouds were seen during the Voyager
2 flyby in 1989. They looked whipped by wind,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.740
and for good reason: Sustained wind speeds
in Neptune’s atmosphere have been clocked

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:46.370
at over 2000 kph: Faster than the speed of
sound on Earth! It’s thought that the low

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.790
temperatures in the atmosphere reduce friction,
allowing the winds to gather to such amazing speeds.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.800
Voyager saw a huge storm marring Neptune’s
face, called—for some reason—the Great

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.240
Dark Spot. A few years later, when Hubble
was used to observe the planet, the spot was

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.320
gone, but others had appeared. They’re probably
vortices, cyclones, which allow us to see

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.800
through the upper atmosphere and peer farther
into Neptune’s depths.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.600
Neptune has a magnetic field, and like Uranus,
it’s offset from the planet’s center.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.200
Perhaps that icy mantle is at work, somehow
interfering with the generation of the magnetic

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.480
fields in both planets.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:26.040
Neptune has rings, too, but SHOCKER, they’re
weird. There are three main rings; two narrow

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.970
and one broad. They’re clumpy, and have
bright stretches that make the rings look

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.690
more like incomplete arcs. It’s possible
those arcs are being constrained by small

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.130
moonlets near the rings.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:41.230
Speaking of which, Neptune has over a dozen
known moons. Most are quite small, but one,

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:47.060
Triton, is by far the largest. At 2700 kilometers
across it’s smaller than our own Moon, but

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:52.290
the rest of them are really dinky. Triton
orbits around Neptune backwards, retrograde.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:57.610
As we’ll learn in a future episode, there’s
a repository of giant iceballs out past Neptune,

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:02.460
so Triton was probably one of those that got too
close to Neptune and was captured by its gravity.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.820
Most of what we know about Triton came from
a single flyby of Voyager 2 in 1989, and only

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:13.330
about 40% of the surface was seen. But this
quick glimpse revealed a weird little moon.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:18.260
The surface is covered in nitrogen ice, as
well as water and carbon dioxide ice. It’s

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.529
really flat, and has very few craters, meaning
something resurfaced it in geologically recent

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:29.520
times. Most likely this was from cryovolcanoes,
cold volcanism; that is, volcanoes where water

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.980
and ammonia take the place of lava there.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:37.220
Also, Triton has been seen to have active
geysers of nitrogen erupting from its surface!

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.260
They’re probably due to warming from the
Sun, and they make Triton one of the few objects

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:46.340
in the solar system seen to be geologically
active. It also has a very thin atmosphere

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.260
of nitrogen, probably due to evaporation from
the surface.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.820
After all this, Neptune is special in another
way, too.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:58.700
Neptune is faint, and can only be seen telescopically.
It was discovered in 1846, and it wasn’t

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.630
an accident. Over the decades, astronomers
observed Uranus, and found something weird:

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:07.670
It wasn’t where it was supposed to be. Over
time, its predicted position was off from

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.500
where it actually was. The French mathematician
Urbain Le Verrier concluded that this was

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:18.149
due to an unseen planet, and was able to use
the mathematics of orbital mechanics to predict

00:10:18.149 --> 00:10:22.270
where the new planet would be. He sent a letter
with the predicted position to the Berlin

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.899
Observatory. Astronomer Johann Galle read
the letter, when right out and found the planet

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:31.199
that very night. Neptune was within a degree
of the predicted spot.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.760
Amazingly, another mathematician, Englishman
John Couch Adams, had also worked on the math

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:41.630
and had made a similar prediction -- but Le
Verrier beat him by two days.

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.930
Two. Days. Of such tight races are fame made
in science.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:51.100
Interestingly, over time, Neptune seemed to
wander from its predicted position as well.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:56.440
A ninth massive planet was predicted, leading
to a grand search that resulted in the discovery

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.540
of Pluto. But Pluto was far too small to affect
Neptune. When Voyager passed both Uranus and

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.680
Neptune, it found the masses of the planets
were different than what had been measured

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.400
from Earth. When the new masses were used in the
orbital equations, Uranus and Neptune were right

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:15.300
where they were supposed to be. It helps to have
the right numbers to plug into your equations.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.660
Pluto, therefore, was found
by accident. That means

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.740
Neptune is the only planet in the
solar system found via math.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.080
See? Your algebra teacher was right: Someday
this stuff will be important.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.500
Today you learned that Uranus and Neptune
are ice giants, with small rocky cores, thick

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.839
mantles of ammonia, water, and methane, and
atmospheres that make them look greenish and

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:40.520
blue. Uranus has relatively dull weather,
while Neptune has clouds and storms whipped

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:46.330
by tremendous winds. Both have rings and moons,
with Neptune’s Triton probably being a captured

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:48.200
iceball that has active geology.
