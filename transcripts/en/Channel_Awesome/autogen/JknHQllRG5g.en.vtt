I don't even care what the hell it is
it's so let's take care that's coming

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:10.900
it's so let's take care that's coming
 

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.730
it's so let's take care that's coming
from somewheres up in the sky

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740
from somewheres up in the sky
 

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:18.490
from somewheres up in the sky

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:18.500
[Music]
 

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.500
[Music]
fried as a Firefly

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:21.510
fried as a Firefly
 

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:27.250
fried as a Firefly
[Music]

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:27.260
[Music]
 

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:40.120
[Music]
and send a wish out if you just say

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.130
 

00:21:40.130 --> 00:22:01.300
a bit of paper that one day
