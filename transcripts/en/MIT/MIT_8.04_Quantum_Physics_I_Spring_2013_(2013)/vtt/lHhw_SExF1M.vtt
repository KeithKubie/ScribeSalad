00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:27.890
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.340
Hello.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.360
So today, as people
slowly trickle in,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.430
so today we're going to talk
about scattering states.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.170
So we've spent a lot of time
talking about bound states,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.140
states corresponding
to particles that

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.765
are localized in a region and
that can't get off to infinity.

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.890
And in particular, when we
distinguish bound states

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.431
from scattering
states, we're usually

00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:54.440
talking about
energy eigenstates.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.480
They're eigenstates
that are strictly

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.190
localized in some region.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.380
For example in the infinite
well, all of the states

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.580
are strictly localized
to be inside the well.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.260
In the finite well,
as we saw last time,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.780
there are a finite
number of states,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.880
of energy eigenstates which
are bound inside the well.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.570
But there are also
states that aren't

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.320
bound inside the well,
as hopefully you'll

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.785
see in recitation,
and as we've discussed

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.660
from qualitative structure
of wave functions,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.580
but under the eigenfunction.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.432
So why would we
particularly care?

00:01:24.432 --> 00:01:25.890
We also did the
harmonic oscillator

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.756
where everything
was nice and bound.

00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:29.130
So why would we
particularly care

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.338
about states that aren't
bound for scattering states?

00:01:31.338 --> 00:01:34.932
And the obvious answer
is, I am not bound.

00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:36.640
Most things in the
world are either bound

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.670
or they are scattering states.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.961
By scattering state just mean
things that can get away.

00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:41.250
Things that can go away.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:51.640
So it's easy to
under emphasize, it's

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.614
easy to miss the importance
of scattering experiments.

00:01:56.614 --> 00:01:58.530
It's easy to say look,
a scattering experiment

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.540
is where you take
some fixed target

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.290
and you throw
something at it and you

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.831
look at how things
bounce off and you

00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:05.719
try to do something
about this object

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:06.760
by helping it bounce off.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.810
For example, one of the
great experiments of our day

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.470
is the LEC, and it's a
gigantic ring, it's huge,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.580
at the foot of the Jura
Mountains outside of Geneva.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.310
And those are people and
that's the detector-- that's

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.050
one of the detectors,
I think, at CMS.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.397
And what are you doing
in this experiment?

00:02:28.397 --> 00:02:30.230
In this experiment
you're taking two protons

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.770
and you're accelerating
them ridiculously fast,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.501
bounded only by the speed
light, but just barely.

00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.750
Until they have a tremendous
amount of kinetic energy,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:40.850
and you're colliding
them into each other.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.150
And the idea is if you
collide them into each other

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.390
and you watch how the
shrapnel comes flying off,

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.170
you can deduce
what must have been

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.711
going on when they
actually collided.

00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:50.850
You could do something
about the structure.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.725
How are protons built
up out of corks.

00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:54.350
And it's easy to
think of a scattering

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.600
experiment as some
bizarre thing that

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.620
happens in particle
detectors under mountains.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.000
But I am currently engaged
in a scattering experiment.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.560
The scattering experiments
I'm currently engaged in

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.960
is light is bouncing from
light sources in the room,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.260
off of very bits of each of you.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.280
And some of it, and probably,
scatters directly into my eye.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.100
That is shocking.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.520
And through the scattering
process and deducing

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.346
what I can from the
statistics of the photons

00:03:24.346 --> 00:03:25.970
that bounce into my
eye, I could deduce

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.450
that you're sitting
there and not over there,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.450
which is pretty awesome.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.910
So we actually get
a tremendous amount

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.820
of the information about
the world around us

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.440
from scattering processes.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.860
These are not esoteric,
weird things that happen.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.290
Scattering is how you
interact with the world.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.010
So when we do
scattering problems,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.490
it's not because we're thinking
about particle colliders.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.970
It's because at the end of
the day I want to understand--

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.260
AUDIENCE: [SNEEZE]

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.885
PROFESSOR: --how
surfaces-- bless you--

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:50.080
how surfaces reflect.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.690
I want to understand why when
you look in the mirror light

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.814
bounces back.

00:03:53.814 --> 00:03:55.480
I want to understand
how you see things.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.146
So this is a much
broader-- scattering's

00:03:57.146 --> 00:04:00.556
a much broader idea than
just the sort of legacy

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:02.780
of how we study
particle physics.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.300
Scattering is what
we do constantly.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.880
And we're going to come back
to the computer in a bit.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.260
I'm going to close this for now.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.760
Yes, good.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.399
So today we're going to begin a
series of lectures in which we

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:20.760
study scattering
processes in one

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.915
dimension in various
different settings.

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:24.290
So in particular
that means we're

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.200
going to be studying
quantum particles being sent

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.360
in from some distance,
incident on some potential,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.400
incident on some object.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.650
And we're going to ask how
likely are they to continue

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.733
going through, how likely
are they to bounce back.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.650
And so we're going to start
with an easy potential,

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.250
an easy object off which
to scatter something, which

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.970
is the absence of an
object, the free particle.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.050
And I want to think about
how the system evolves.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.800
So for the free particle where
we just have something of mass,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.380
m, and its potential
is constant,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.030
we know how to solve the--

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.530
Question?

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.470
Yeah.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.290
AUDIENCE: This may
be a little bit dumb,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.324
but given that these
states, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.360
PROFESSOR: Fantastic question.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.026
I'm going to come
back in just a second.

00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:24.110
It's a very good question.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.120
So we're interested
in energy eigenstates,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.610
and we know the
energy eigenstates

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.275
for the free particle-- we've
written these down many times--

00:05:31.275 --> 00:05:33.150
and I'm going to write
it in the phonic form.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.220
Suppose we have a free
particle in an energy

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.480
eigenstate with
energy e, then we

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.200
know it's a superposition
of clean waves,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.010
e to the i kx plus
b e to minus ikx.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.820
And the normalization
is encoded in a and b,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.981
but, of course, these
are normalizable states.

00:05:51.981 --> 00:05:53.480
We typically normalize
them with a 1

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.760
over root 2 pi for delta
function normalizability.

00:05:57.934 --> 00:06:00.350
Now, in order for this to be
a solution to the Schrodinger

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.100
equation, we need the
frequency or the energy e

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.410
is equal to h-bar squared
k squared upon 2m,

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.660
and omega is this upon h-bar.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.690
And knowing that,
we can immediately

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.730
write down the solution.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.910
Because these are
energy eigenstates,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.451
we can immediately write down
the solution of the Schrodinger

00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:21.290
equation, which begins at
time t 0 in this state.

00:06:29.035 --> 00:06:31.410
So there's the solution of
the time dependent Schrodinger

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.909
equation.

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:35.080
So we've now completely solved
this in full generality, which

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.510
is not so shocking since
it's a free particle.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.560
But let's think about what
these two possible states are.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.720
What do these mean?

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.380
So the first thing to
say is this component

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.879
of our superposition
is a wave, and I'm

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.420
going to call it a
right moving wave.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.253
And why am I calling
it a right moving wave?

00:06:54.253 --> 00:06:57.300
If you draw the real part of
this, some moment in time,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.040
it's got some crests.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.660
And if you draw on it a
short bit of time later,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.900
I want to ask how
the wave has moved.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.000
And, for example,
a peak in the wave

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.400
will be when kx
minus omega t is 0.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.780
If kx minus omega t is 0,
then kx is equal to omega t,

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.010
or x is equal to omega over kt.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.810
And assuming as we have
that k is positive,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.290
then this says that
as time increases

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.420
the position increases.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.580
And this one, by
exactly the same logic,

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.095
x is equal to minus
omega over kt.

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:43.576
So we'll call this a right
going or right moving,

00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:47.610
and we'll call this
a left moving wave.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.080
So the general solution is a
superposition, an arbitrary

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.270
superposition, of a left
moving and a right moving wave.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.603
This should be familiar from
803 in your study of waves.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.910
But as was pointed
out just a moment ago,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.830
we've got a problem.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.550
Phi e or phi e is
not normalizable.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.690
And this is obvious
from if we-- let's

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.470
have b equal 0 for simplicity.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.850
This is a pure phase, and the
norm squared of a pure phase

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.270
is 1.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.275
And so the probability
density is constant.

00:08:22.275 --> 00:08:25.260
It's 1 from minus
infinity to infinity.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.740
So the probability of finding
it at any given point is equal.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.215
So assuming this is on
the real line, which

00:08:31.215 --> 00:08:33.220
is what we mean by saying
it's a free particle,

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.640
there's no constant you
can multiply that by

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.640
to make it normalizable.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.139
This is not a
normalizable function.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.289
So more precisely,
what we usually do

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:50.610
is we take our states phi
sub k equal 1 over root 2 pi,

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.160
e to the i kx.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:09:02.330
Such that phi k, phi k
prime is equal to delta.

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.720
Sorry-- that's not
what I wanted to write.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:10.350
Such that-- well, fine.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.970
Phi k, phi k prime is equal
to delta of k minus k prime.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.932
This is as good as we can do.

00:09:20.932 --> 00:09:22.640
This is good as we
get to normalizing it.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.681
It's not normalized to 1.

00:09:23.681 --> 00:09:25.440
It's normalized 1k
is equal to k prime,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.939
to the value of the delta
function, which is ill-defined.

00:09:27.939 --> 00:09:30.230
So we've dealt with this
before, we've talked about it.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.702
So how do we deal with it?

00:09:31.702 --> 00:09:33.160
Well, we've just
learned, actually,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.320
a very important thing.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.940
This question,
very good question,

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.648
led to a very important
observation which

00:09:37.648 --> 00:09:41.470
is that can a particle, can
a quantum mechanical particle

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.050
be placed, meaningfully
said to be placed,

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:50.290
in an energy eigenstate
which is bound?

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.560
Can you put a particle
in the ground state

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.010
of a harmonic oscillator?

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:54.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.640
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.140
That's fine.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.680
Can you put the
particle in the k

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.285
equals 7 state of
a free particle?

00:09:59.285 --> 00:10:00.397
AUDIENCE: No.

00:10:00.397 --> 00:10:00.980
PROFESSOR: No.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.290
So these scattering
states, you can never

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.010
truly put your particle
truly in a scattering state.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.694
It's always going to be
some approximate plane wave.

00:10:10.694 --> 00:10:12.110
Scattering states
are always going

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.110
to be some plane
wave asymptotically.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.670
So we can't put the particles
directly in a plane wave.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.090
What can we do, however?

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.052
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:20.760
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.150
We can build a wave packet.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:26.070
We can use these as
a basis for states,

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.820
which are normalizable
and reasonably localized.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.890
So we need to deal
with wave packets.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.130
So today is going to be,
the beginning of today

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.034
is going to be dealing with
the evolution of a wave packet.

00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:37.700
And in particular
we'll start by looking

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:41.210
at the evolution in time
of a well localized wave

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.380
packet in the
potential corresponding

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.900
to a free particle.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.650
And from that we're
going to learn already

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.066
some interesting
things, and we'll

00:10:48.066 --> 00:10:50.510
use that intuition for the
next several lectures as well.

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.680
Questions before we get going?

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.195
All right.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.850
So here's going to
be my first example.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:09.080
So consider for
the free particle

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:20.970
or consider a free particle
in a minimum uncertainty wave

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.356
packet.

00:11:23.356 --> 00:11:25.230
So what is a minimum
uncertainty wave packet.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.680
We've talked--

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.190
AUDIENCE: A Gaussian.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.390
PROFESSOR: A Gaussian, exactly.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:29.556
So the minimum uncertainly
wave packet's a Gaussian.

00:11:29.556 --> 00:11:33.410
Suppose that I take my particle
and I place it at time 0,

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:35.494
x0 in a Gaussian.

00:11:35.494 --> 00:11:37.410
I'm going to properly
normalize this Gaussian.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.630
I hate these factors
of pi, but whatever.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:47.690
a root pi, e to the minus
x squared over 2a squared.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:52.500
So this is the wave function
at time 0, I declare.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.400
I will just prepare the
system in this state.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.816
And what I'm
interested in knowing

00:11:55.816 --> 00:11:58.180
is how does the
system evolve in time?

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.080
What is x psi of x and t?

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.005
So how do we solve this problem?

00:12:09.005 --> 00:12:11.380
Well, we could just plug it
into the Schrodinger equation

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.588
directly and just by brute
force try to crank it out.

00:12:13.588 --> 00:12:17.210
But the easier thing to do
is to use the same technique

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.136
we've used all the way along.

00:12:19.136 --> 00:12:20.760
We are going to take
the wave function,

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.080
known wave function,
known dependence on x,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.900
expand it as a superposition
of energy eigenstates.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.220
Each energy eigenstates
evolved in a known fashion

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.460
will evolve those
energy eigenstates

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:35.180
in that superposition, and
do the sum again, re-sum it,

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:38.430
to get the evolution as
a function of position.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.930
Cool?

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.610
Yeah.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:52.938
AUDIENCE: So given that
the x-basis and the t-bases

00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:55.926
are uncountable, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:59.754 --> 00:13:00.420
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.211
Here's the theorem.

00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:03.790
So the question is roughly how
do you know you can do that?

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.665
How do you know you can
expand in the energy.

00:13:05.665 --> 00:13:08.320
And we have to go back to the
spectral theorem which tells us

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:14.210
for any observable, the
corresponding operator

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.639
has a basis of eigenfunctions.

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:19.430
So this is a theorem
that I haven't proven,

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.800
but that I'm telling you.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.525
And that we will
use over and over

00:13:23.525 --> 00:13:24.900
and over again,
spectral theorem.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.540
But what it tells you is that
any operator has an eigenbasis.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.650
So if we find any good operator
corresponding to an observable

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.022
has a good eigenbasis.

00:13:33.022 --> 00:13:35.480
That means that if we find the
eigenfunctions of the energy

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.770
operator, any state
can be expanded

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:41.067
as a superposition
in that state.

00:13:41.067 --> 00:13:43.150
And the question of
accountable versus uncountable

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.970
is a slightly subtle one.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.250
For example, how many points
are there on the circle?

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:48.670
Well, there's an
uncountable number.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:50.586
How many momentum modes
are there on a circle?

00:13:50.586 --> 00:13:51.920
Well, that's countable.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.730
How does that work?

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:54.480
How can you describe
that both in position

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.512
and in momentum space.

00:13:55.512 --> 00:13:57.970
Ask me afterwards and we'll
talk about that in more detail.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.490
But don't get too hung up on
countable versus uncountable.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.600
It's not that big a difference.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.391
You're just summing--
it's just whether you

00:14:03.391 --> 00:14:05.840
sum over a continuous
or discrete thing.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.320
I'm being glib, but it's useful
to be glib at that level.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.330
Other questions before we-- OK.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.340
Good.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:16.223
Yeah.

00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:18.806
AUDIENCE: So the reason we are
going to use energy eigenstates

00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:22.750
is just because [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.500
PROFESSOR: Almost.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.094
So the question is are we
using the energy eigenstates

00:14:26.094 --> 00:14:27.510
because at the end
of the day it's

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.594
going to boil down to
doing a Fourier transform,

00:14:29.594 --> 00:14:31.760
because the energy eigenstates
are just plain waves,

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.870
e to the ix?

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.285
And that will be true, but
that's not the reason we do it.

00:14:36.285 --> 00:14:37.160
It's a good question.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.326
So let me disentangle these.

00:14:38.326 --> 00:14:39.720
Well, I guess I can use this.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.510
The point is that if I
know that si-- for any wave

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.180
function in any system, if
I know that phi of x at 0

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.520
is some function, and I
know the energy eigenstates

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.380
of that system, then I can
write this as sum over n, of cn,

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.300
phi n of x for some
set of coefficient cn.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.930
So that's the spectral theorem.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:00.880
Pick an operator
here, the energy.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.200
Consider its eigenfunctions.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.260
They form a basis and any
state can be expanded.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.287
But once we've expanded
in the energy eigenbasis,

00:15:07.287 --> 00:15:08.870
specifically for the
energy eigenbasis

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:12.310
where e phi n is
en phi n, then we

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.060
know how these guys
evolve in time.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:19.080
They evolve by an e to the
minus i en t upon h-bar.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.250
And we also know that
the Schrodinger equation

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.420
is a linear equation, so
we can superpose solutions

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.590
and get a new solution.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.860
So now, this is the expression
for the full solution

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.820
at time t.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.730
That's why we're using
energy eigenstates.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.515
In this simple case
of the free particle,

00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:37.660
it is a felicitous fact that
the energy eigenstates are also

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.944
Fourier modes.

00:15:38.944 --> 00:15:40.360
But that won't be
true in general.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.340
For example, in the
harmonic oscillator system,

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:46.090
the harmonic oscillator
energy eigenstates

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.440
are Gaussians times
some special functions.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.830
And we know how to compute them.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:50.970
That's great.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.190
We use a raising,
lowering operators.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:52.689
It's nice.

00:15:52.689 --> 00:15:54.280
But they're not plane waves.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.730
Nonetheless, despite
not being Fourier modes,

00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:59.500
we can always expand
an arbitrary function

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.950
in the energy eigenbasis.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.640
And once we've done so,
writing down the time evolution

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.687
is straightforward.

00:16:06.687 --> 00:16:07.770
That answer your question?

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:08.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.090
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.230
Anything else?

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.730
OK.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:11.980
So let's do it for this guy.

00:16:14.752 --> 00:16:16.210
So what are the
energy eigenstates.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.480
They're these guys,
and I'm just going

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.280
to write it as e to the
i kx without assuming

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.110
that k is positive.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:21.960
So k could be
positive or negative,

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.680
and energy is e to the
h-bar squared k squared.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.634
And so we can write this as--
we can write the wave function

00:16:28.634 --> 00:16:30.050
in this fashion,
but we could also

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.710
write it in Fourier
transformed form,

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:37.350
which is integral
dk upon root 2 pi

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:38.700
for minus infinity to infinity.

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.200
I'm mostly not going
to write the bounds.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.450
They're always going to be
minus infinity to infinity.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:50.720
Of dk 1 over root
2 pi e to the i kx.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:57.527
The plane wave times the Fourier
transform, psi tilde of k.

00:16:57.527 --> 00:16:59.860
So here all I'm doing is
defining for you the psi tilde.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.740
But you actually
computed this, so this

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.740
is the Fourier transfer.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.220
You actually computed this on,
I think, the second problem set.

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:18.920
So this is equal to the
integral dk over root 2 pi

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.530
e to the i kx.

00:17:22.058 --> 00:17:23.849
And I'm going to get
the coefficients-- I'm

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:27.115
going to be careful
about the coefficients a,

00:17:27.115 --> 00:17:31.963
so root a over 4 [INAUDIBLE] pi.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:42.340
e to the minus k squared
a squared over 2.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.060
So here, this is
just to remind us

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:45.775
if we have a
Gaussian of width a,

00:17:45.775 --> 00:17:49.780
the Fourier transform is
Gaussian of width 1 upon a.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.930
So that's momentum and position
uncertainty in Fourier space.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.085
And you did this
in problem set two.

00:17:56.085 --> 00:17:58.460
So this is an alternate way
of writing this wave function

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.570
through its Fourier transform.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:00.570
Everyone cool with that?

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:07.000
But the nice thing
about this is that we

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.460
know how to time evolve
this wave function.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:18.100
This tells us that that psi
of xt is equal to integral--

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.840
and I'm going to get these
coefficients all pulled out--

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:29.620
integral of root a over root pi.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.040
Integral dk upon root 2 pi.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.980
e to the i kx minus omega t.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.140
And remember, Omega
it depends on k,

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.650
because it's h-bar
squared k squared

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:44.900
upon 2m divided by h-bar.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.200
Times our Gaussian,
e to the minus

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.215
k squared a squared upon 2.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.330
So everyone cool with that?

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.200
So all I've done is
I've taken this line,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.630
I pulled out the
constant, and I've

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:04.810
added the time evolution
of the Fourier mode.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.389
So now we have this integral
to give us the full,

00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:09.180
OK, so now we just have
to do the integral.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.520
And this is not so hard to do.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.800
But what makes it totally
tractable is that if I just

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.757
do this with some
function of omega of k--

00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:17.090
I mean that's complicated,
know how to do that integral.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:21.300
But I happen to know that e
is h-bar squared k squared

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.850
upon 2m, which
means that omega is

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.980
equal to h-bar k
squared upon 2m.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:35.401
So I can rewrite this as
minus h-bar k squared upon 2m.

00:19:35.401 --> 00:19:35.900
Yes?

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:37.649
AUDIENCE: Where is the
fourth [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:41.810
PROFESSOR: That's a square
root of a square root.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.475
AUDIENCE: Oh, I didn't see it.

00:19:42.475 --> 00:19:42.930
My bad.

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:43.310
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.810
That's OK.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:47.640
It's a horrible,
horrible factor.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.522
So what do we take
away from this?

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.230
Well, this can be
written in a nice form.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.560
Note that here we
have a k squared,

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.351
here we have a k squared,
here we have a k.

00:19:55.351 --> 00:19:58.130
This is an integral over k,
so this is still Gaussian.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.400
It's still the exponential
of a quadratic function of k.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.857
So we can use our formulas
for Gaussian integrals

00:20:03.857 --> 00:20:04.690
to do this integral.

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:06.273
So to make that a
little more obvious,

00:20:06.273 --> 00:20:08.694
let's simplify the form of this.

00:20:08.694 --> 00:20:10.110
So the form of
this is again going

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.690
to be square root of
a over square root pi.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.530
Integral dk upon root 2 pi.

00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:19.699
e to the i kx.

00:20:19.699 --> 00:20:21.990
And I'm going to take this
term and this term and group

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.900
them together because
they both have

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.350
a k squared in the exponential.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:28.540
e to the minus k
squared upon 2 times--

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:34.510
now instead of just a squared,
we have a squared plus i h-bar

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.290
upon 2m t-- there's
a typo in my notes.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.890
Crap.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:41.390
Good.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.150
So before we do
anything else, let's

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.620
just check dimensional analysis.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.287
This has units of one
of length squared.

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:48.286
So this had better have
units of length squared.

00:20:48.286 --> 00:20:49.680
That's a length squared, good.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.000
This, is this a length squared?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.720
So that's momentum
times length, which

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.520
is mass times length over time.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.700
Divide by mass, multiplied by
time, so that's length squared.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.255
Good.

00:21:00.255 --> 00:21:01.255
So our units make sense.

00:21:01.255 --> 00:21:03.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.630
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.512
PROFESSOR: This, too, we need.

00:21:07.512 --> 00:21:08.554
AUDIENCE: In terms of 2m.

00:21:08.554 --> 00:21:09.553
PROFESSOR: Oh, this one.

00:21:09.553 --> 00:21:10.150
Good.

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.170
Thank you.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:11.670
Yes.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:12.169
Thanks.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.460
So this is again a Gaussian.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.850
And look, before we
knew we have a Gaussian,

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:23.380
the Fourier transform
is just this Gaussian.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.310
The only difference is it's
now a Gaussian with width.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.237
Not a, but a complex number.

00:21:28.237 --> 00:21:30.320
But if you go through the
analysis of the Gaussian

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.190
integral, that's perfectly fine.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.730
It's not a problem at all.

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:38.700
The effective width is this.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.450
So what does that tell
you about psi of t?

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.420
So this tells you
that psi of x and t

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:49.800
is equal to root a over root pi.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.840
And now the width.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.130
So we have the 1 over root a.

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.490
But now the effective width
is this guy, a squared

00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:04.452
plus-- so it's square root of
a squared plus i h-bar upon mt.

00:22:04.452 --> 00:22:13.660
e to the minus x squared
over 4a squared plus-- oops,

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.590
where did my 4-- there's
a 2 that-- there's

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.025
a spurious 2 somewhere.

00:22:17.025 --> 00:22:19.260
I'm not sure where
that 2 came from.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.930
There should be a 2 there.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:24.360
a squared plus i h-bar upon mt.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:43.130
So at this point it's not
totally transparent to me

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:45.450
what exactly this wave
function is telling me,

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:48.486
because there's still a phase
downstairs in the width.

00:22:48.486 --> 00:22:50.110
So to get a little
more intuition let's

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:51.430
look at something
that's purely real.

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.513
Let's look at the probability
to find the particle

00:22:53.513 --> 00:22:55.072
at position x at time t.

00:22:55.072 --> 00:22:56.780
That's just the norm
squared of this guy.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.696
And if you go through a
little bit of algebra,

00:22:58.696 --> 00:23:02.610
this is equal to 1
over root pi times--

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:09.170
I'm going to write out
three factors-- times 1

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:18.850
over square root of-- yes,
good-- a squared plus h-bar

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:27.280
upon 2ma squared
t squared times e

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:35.480
to the minus x squared upon
2a squared plus h-bar squared

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.800
over 2ma squared.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.080
Oops-- h-bar over 2ma squared t.

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.760
So what do we get?

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.610
The probability distribution
is again a Gaussian.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.480
But at any given
moment in time--

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.830
this should be t squared--
at any given moment in time

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.380
the width is changing.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.710
The width of this Gaussian
is changing in time.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.550
Notice this is
purely real again.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.720
And meanwhile, the
amplitude is also changing.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.260
And notice that it's changing
in the following way.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.720
At time 0, this is the
least it can possibly be.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.420
At time 0 this
denominator is the least

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.045
it can possibly be
because that's gone.

00:24:13.045 --> 00:24:14.800
At any positive
time, the denominator

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:17.550
is larger so the
probability has dropped off.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:21.470
So the probability at any
given point is decreasing.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.460
Except for we also
have this Gaussian

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.580
whose width is increasing
in time, quadratically.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.450
It's getting wider
and wider and wider.

00:24:32.934 --> 00:24:34.850
And you can check-- so
let's check dimensional

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.440
analysis again.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.148
This should have units
of length squared,

00:24:37.148 --> 00:24:39.160
and so this is
momentum times length

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.110
divided by length divided by
mass-- that's just a velocity.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.050
So this is the velocity
squared times squared.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:45.550
That's good.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.110
So this has the correct units.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.960
So it's spreading
with the velocity

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.800
v is equal to h-bar upon 2ma.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.130
And what was a? a was
the width at times

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.670
0. a was the minimum width.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:09.550
So graphically, let's roll this
out-- what is this telling us?

00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.320
And incidentally, a
quick check, if this

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.500
is supposed to be the
wave function at time t,

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.250
it had better reproduce the
correct answer at time 0.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.010
So what is this wave
function at time 0?

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.180
We lose that, we lose that, and
we recover the original wave

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.290
function.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:31.010
So that's good.

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:40.690
So graphically what's going on?

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.740
So let's plot p of x and t.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:50.770
At time 0 we have a Gaussian
and it's centered at 0,

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:54.890
and it's got a width,
which is just a.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:58.090
And this is at time t equals 0.

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:04.640
At a subsequent time,
it's again centered

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.810
at x equals 0--
modulating my bad art--

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:13.310
but it's got a width, which
is a squared square root

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:22.120
of a squared plus h-bar
upon 2ma squared, t squared.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.620
So it's become
shorter and wider such

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.500
that it's still
properly normalized.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.910
And at much later
time it will be

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:38.580
a much lower and much
broader Gaussian.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:42.880
Again, properly normalized, and
again centered at x equals 0.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.506
Is that cool?

00:26:44.506 --> 00:26:45.880
So what this says
is if you start

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.520
with your well-localized
wave packet and you let go,

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.070
it disperses.

00:26:52.625 --> 00:26:53.500
Does that make sense?

00:26:56.759 --> 00:26:57.550
Is that reasonable?

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.800
How about this.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.630
What happens if you ran the
system backwards in time?

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:09.090
If it's dispersing
and getting wider,

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.780
then intuitively
you might expect

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.201
that it'll get more sharp, if
you integrated it back in time.

00:27:15.201 --> 00:27:17.200
But, in fact, what happens
if we take t negative

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:17.890
in this analysis?

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.604
We didn't assume it
was positive, anyway.

00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:20.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.250
PROFESSOR: It disperses again.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:24.110
It comes from being a
very dispersed wave,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.193
to whap, to being very
well [INAUDIBLE], and whap,

00:27:26.193 --> 00:27:27.310
it disperses out again.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:32.080
And notice that the sharper the
wave function was localized,

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.630
the smaller a was in the first
place, the faster it disperses.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:37.130
This has 1 upon a.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.780
It has an a downstairs.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.760
So the more sharp
it was at time 0,

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.760
the faster it disperses away.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.320
This is what our
analysis predicts.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.635
So let me give you two
questions to think about.

00:27:50.635 --> 00:27:52.260
I'm not going to
answer them right now.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.522
I want you to think about
them-- not right-- well,

00:27:55.522 --> 00:27:57.480
think about them now,
but also think about them

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.670
more broadly as you
do the problem set

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.400
and as you're reading through
the reading for the next week.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:06.390
So the width in this example
was least at time t equals 0.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.617
Why?

00:28:07.617 --> 00:28:09.700
How could you build a wave
function, how could you

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.630
take this result and build a
wave function whose width was

00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:16.150
minimum at some other
time, say, time t0.

00:28:18.872 --> 00:28:19.830
So that's one question.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.450
Second question.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.480
This wave function
is sitting still.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.725
How do you make it move?

00:28:26.725 --> 00:28:29.100
And either the second or the
third problem on the problem

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.520
set is an introduction
to that question.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.380
So here's a challenge
to everyone.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:39.620
Construct a
well-localized wave packet

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.360
that's moving, in the sense that
it has well-defined momentum

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.742
expectation value.

00:28:44.742 --> 00:28:46.950
And again, hint, look at
your second or third problem

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:48.690
on the problem set.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.090
And then repeat
this entire analysis

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:56.940
and check how the probability
distribution evolves in time.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.990
And in particular,
what I'd like to do

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:03.260
is verify that the probability
distribution disperses,

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:05.920
but simultaneously
moves in the direction

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:11.220
corresponding to the initial
momentum with that momentum.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.240
The center of the
wave packet moves

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.562
according to the momentum that
you gave it in the first place.

00:29:16.562 --> 00:29:18.770
It's a free particle so
should the expectation value,

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.460
the momentum change over time?

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.640
No.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.910
And indeed it won't.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:27.910
So that's a challenge for you.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.345
OK, questions at this point?

00:29:30.345 --> 00:29:30.970
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.770
So this wave or this
Gaussian's not moving,

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.645
but it's centered over
0 at time 0 or x0?

00:29:37.645 --> 00:29:39.520
PROFESSOR: Sorry, this
is at x is equal to 0.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.061
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:29:40.061 --> 00:29:42.660
So is that-- so all
those [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.034
are at x equals 0 over here.

00:29:44.034 --> 00:29:45.950
Shouldn't the amplitude
increase and not the--

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:46.240
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.448
So what I'm plotting-- sorry.

00:29:47.448 --> 00:29:49.570
So I'm plotting p of
x and t as a function

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:51.160
of x for different times.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.650
So this is time 0.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:56.250
This was time t equals
something not 0, equals 1.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.320
And this is some time
t equal to large.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.668
Right.

00:30:01.668 --> 00:30:04.163
AUDIENCE: And so but
is it if x is always 0,

00:30:04.163 --> 00:30:08.155
then shouldn't the
[INAUDIBLE] not change

00:30:08.155 --> 00:30:10.224
because it would
equal [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:10.224 --> 00:30:10.890
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:13.790
So if x is 0, then the
Gaussian contribution

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.030
is always giving me 1.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:17.245
But there's still
this amplitude.

00:30:17.245 --> 00:30:18.745
And the amplitude
is the denominator

00:30:18.745 --> 00:30:20.370
is getting larger
and larger with time.

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.440
So, indeed, the amplitude
should be falling off.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.291
Is that--

00:30:24.291 --> 00:30:26.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, but
will the width change?

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:29.160
So what the width is, the
width is saying, look,

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.520
how rapidly as we increase x,
how rapidly does this fall off

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.650
as a Gaussian.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.130
And so if time is increasing,
if time is very, very

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.980
large, than this
denominator's huge.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.010
So in order for this Gaussian
to suppress the wave function,

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.520
x has to be very, very large.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.810
AUDIENCE: So we're assuming
[INAUDIBLE] x hasn't changed.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:47.700
PROFESSOR: Ah, good.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.520
Remember, so this x is not
the position of the particle.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:54.020
x is the position at which we're
evaluating the probability.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.022
So what we're plotting
is we're plotting-- good.

00:30:56.022 --> 00:30:57.980
Yeah, this is an easy
thing to get confused by.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.354
What is this
quantity telling us?

00:30:59.354 --> 00:31:02.000
This quantity is telling us the
probability, the probability

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.710
[INAUDIBLE, that we find
the particle at position

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.980
x at time t.

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.109
So the x is like, look,
where do you want to look?

00:31:08.109 --> 00:31:09.900
You tell me the x and
I tell you how likely

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.100
it is to be found there.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.844
So what this is telling
us is that the probability

00:31:13.844 --> 00:31:16.010
distribution to find the
particles start out sharply

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.384
peaked, but then it becomes
more more and more dispersed.

00:31:18.384 --> 00:31:20.140
So at the initial
time, how likely

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.980
am I to find the
particle, say, here?

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:23.900
Not at all.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.700
But at a very late time, who
knows, it could be there.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:29.160
I mean my confidence
is very, very limited

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.400
because the probability
distribution's very wide.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.210
Did that answer your question.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.523
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:32.523 --> 00:31:32.680
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.568
Yup?

00:31:33.568 --> 00:31:36.496
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] what
happens after [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.730
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:41.896
That's a fantastic question.

00:31:41.896 --> 00:31:44.170
So we've talked about
measurement of position.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.878
We've talked about
measure-- So after you

00:31:45.878 --> 00:31:47.330
measure an
observable, the system

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.800
is left in an eigenstate of
the observable corresponding

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.360
to the observed eigenvalue.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.542
So suppose I have some potential
or I have some particle

00:31:55.542 --> 00:31:56.500
and it's moving around.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.270
It's in some complicated wave
function, and some complicated

00:31:59.270 --> 00:31:59.780
state.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.766
And then you measure
its position to be here.

00:32:01.766 --> 00:32:03.140
But my measurement
isn't perfect.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.181
I know it's here with some
reasonable confidence,

00:32:05.181 --> 00:32:06.980
with some reasonable width.

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:08.862
What's going to be
the state thereafter?

00:32:08.862 --> 00:32:10.820
Well, it's going to be
in a state corresponding

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.690
to being more or less here
with some uncertainty.

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.230
Oh look, there's that state.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.957
And what happened subsequently?

00:32:16.957 --> 00:32:19.290
What happened subsequently
is my probability immediately

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.085
decreases.

00:32:21.085 --> 00:32:22.710
And this is exactly
what we saw before.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:23.570
Thank you for asking
this question.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:24.450
It's a very good question.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.400
This is exactly
what we said before.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.720
If we can make an arbitrarily
precise measurement

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.538
of the position, what
would be the width?

00:32:29.538 --> 00:32:30.596
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:30.596 --> 00:32:31.262
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:32:31.262 --> 00:32:33.370
It'd be delta, so
with width would be 0.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:34.850
That little a would be 0.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.670
So how rapidly does it disperse?

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:37.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.120
PROFESSOR: Pretty fast.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.050
And you have to
worry a little bit

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.050
because that's getting
a little relativistic.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:42.949
Yeah.

00:32:42.949 --> 00:32:45.240
AUDIENCE: If you make a
measurement that's not perfect,

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.250
how do you account
for that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:47.916
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:32:47.916 --> 00:32:49.362
So OK.

00:32:49.362 --> 00:32:50.320
That's a good question.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.326
So you make a measurement,
it's not perfect,

00:32:52.326 --> 00:32:53.450
there was some uncertainty.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.530
And so let me rephrase
this question slightly.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.580
So here's another
version of this question.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.890
Suppose I make a
measurement of the system.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.480
If there are two possible
configurations, two

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.010
possible states,
and they measure

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:05.860
an eigenvalue corresponding
to one of them,

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.937
then I know what state
the system is in.

00:33:07.937 --> 00:33:10.270
And then again, if I'm measuring
something like position

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.061
where I'm inescapably
going to be measuring

00:33:12.061 --> 00:33:13.630
that position with
some uncertainty,

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.320
what state is it
left in afterwards?

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.590
Do I know what state
it's left in afterwards?

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:19.400
No, I-- I know
approximately what state.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.858
It's going to be
a state corr-- OK,

00:33:20.858 --> 00:33:24.350
so then I have to have some
model for the probability

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:26.010
distribution of
being in a state.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.536
But usually what
we'll do is we'll

00:33:27.536 --> 00:33:28.660
say we'll approximate that.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.058
We'll model that unknown.

00:33:30.058 --> 00:33:31.516
We don't know
exactly what state it

00:33:31.516 --> 00:33:33.210
is because we don't know exactly
what position we measured.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.220
Well, model that by
saying, look, by the law

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.722
of large numbers it's going to
be roughly a Gaussian centered

00:33:38.722 --> 00:33:40.430
around the position
with the width, which

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.536
is our expected uncertainty.

00:33:42.536 --> 00:33:44.910
Now, it depends on exactly
what measurement you're doing.

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.701
Sometimes that's not
the right thing to do,

00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:48.900
but that's sort of a
maximally naive thing.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:50.900
This is an interesting
but complicated question,

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.869
so come ask me in office hours.

00:33:52.869 --> 00:33:54.801
Yeah.

00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:56.733
AUDIENCE: So if this
probability isn't moving,

00:33:56.733 --> 00:33:59.160
what is that velocity we
[INAUDIBLE] over there?

00:33:59.160 --> 00:33:59.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.690
So what is this velocity?

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:02.356
So this velocity,
what is it telling us?

00:34:02.356 --> 00:34:05.500
It's telling us how rapidly
the wave spreads out.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.070
So does that indicate
anything moving?

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:08.570
No.

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:11.822
What's the expected value
of the position at any time?

00:34:11.822 --> 00:34:12.570
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.139
PROFESSOR: 0, because
this is an even function.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:14.780
What's the position?

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.480
Well, it's just as likely
to be here as here.

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.440
It's just that the
probability of being here

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.864
gets greater and greater
over time for a while

00:34:19.864 --> 00:34:21.613
and then it falls off
because the Gaussian

00:34:21.613 --> 00:34:23.000
is spreading and falling.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:23.500
Yeah.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:24.110
One last question.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:24.489
Yup.

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:25.691
AUDIENCE: Can you tell
me a little bit more

00:34:25.691 --> 00:34:27.650
about negative time is
the same as positive time?

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:28.239
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:30.090
So the question is can
you talk a little bit more

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.845
about why the behavior
as time increases

00:34:31.845 --> 00:34:36.010
is the same as the behavior
as we go backwards in time.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.230
And I'm not sure how
best to answer that,

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.040
but let me give it a go.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.451
So the first thing is to
say look at our solution

00:34:43.451 --> 00:34:45.159
and look at the
probability distribution.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:47.909
The probability distribution
is completely even in time.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:49.511
It depends only on t squared.

00:34:49.511 --> 00:34:50.969
So if I ask what
happens at time t,

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:53.130
it's the same as what
happened at time minus t.

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.239
That's interesting in a
slightly unusual situation.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:57.780
Let's look back at
the wave function.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.774
Is that true of
the wave function?

00:34:59.774 --> 00:35:00.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:01.273
PROFESSOR: No.

00:35:01.273 --> 00:35:04.000
Because the phase
and the complex parts

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.670
depend on-- OK, so the
amplitude doesn't depend on

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:09.930
whether it's t or minus t.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:11.000
But the phase does.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.610
And that's a useful clue.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.730
Here's a better way.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.526
What was the weird thing that
made this t reversal invariant?

00:35:16.526 --> 00:35:18.150
There's another weird
property of this,

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.150
which is that it's
centered at 0.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.080
It's sitting still.

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.280
If we had given it momentum that
would also not have been true.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.310
So the best answer I
can give you, though,

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.920
requires knowing
what happens when

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.360
you have a finite momentum.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.440
So let me just sketch quickly.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.020
So when we have a momentum,
how do we take this wave packet

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:40.000
and give it momentum k naught?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.180
So this is problem three
on your problem set,

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:44.545
but I will answer it for you.

00:35:44.545 --> 00:35:47.770
You'd multiply by phase
e to the i k naught x.

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.380
And the expectation
value will now

00:35:54.380 --> 00:36:00.080
shift to be h-bar k
naught for momentum.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.629
So what's that
going to do for us?

00:36:01.629 --> 00:36:03.170
Well, as we do the
Fourier transform,

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:06.044
that's going to shift
k to k minus k naught.

00:36:06.044 --> 00:36:07.710
And so we can repeat
the entire analysis

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.680
and get roughly k
and k naught here.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:16.290
The important thing is
that we end up with phases.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:20.360
So the way to read
off time 0 is going

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.220
to be-- well, many
answers to this.

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.560
As time increases or decreases,
we'll see from this phase

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.417
that the entire wave packet
is going to continue moving,

00:36:28.417 --> 00:36:30.000
it's going to continue
walking across.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.920
And that breaks the
t minus t invariance.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.232
Because at minus t it
would have been over here.

00:36:36.232 --> 00:36:37.940
And then think about
that first question.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.500
How would you make it
become minimum wave packet

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.032
at some time which
is not time equals 0?

00:36:43.032 --> 00:36:44.740
So when you have
answers to both of those

00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.790
you'll have the answer
to your question.

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:46.145
Yeah.

00:36:46.145 --> 00:36:47.561
AUDIENCE: What
does it really mean

00:36:47.561 --> 00:36:49.888
for us to say that we have
a probability distribution

00:36:49.888 --> 00:36:53.255
and measure something
like negative time?

00:36:53.255 --> 00:36:57.462
Because it seems like we did
something at time equals 0,

00:36:57.462 --> 00:36:59.630
and we say the
probability that we

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.400
would have found it
[INAUDIBLE] is here.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:01.755
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:37:01.755 --> 00:37:04.230
AUDIENCE: It seems that you
have to be aware [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.896
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:37:04.896 --> 00:37:07.367
So that's not exactly what the
probability of distribution

00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:07.950
is telling us.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.470
So what the probability
and distribution is telling

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:11.880
you is not what happens
when you make a measurement.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.530
It's given this state
what would happen?

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.780
And so when you ask about
the probability distribution

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.670
at time minus 7,
what you're saying

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.100
is given the wave
function now, what must

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.679
the wave function have
been a time earlier,

00:37:23.679 --> 00:37:25.720
such that Schrodinger
evolution, not measurement,

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.260
but Shrodinger evolution
gives you this.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.850
So what that's telling you is
someone earlier-- had someone

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.720
earlier been around
to do that experiment,

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:34.012
what value would they have got?

00:37:34.012 --> 00:37:35.678
AUDIENCE: But wouldn't
that have changed

00:37:35.678 --> 00:37:36.860
the wave function of that?

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.710
PROFESSOR: Absolutely, if
they had done the measurement.

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.260
There's a difference between
knowing what the probability

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.700
distribution would be if you
were to do a measurement,

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.400
and actually doing a measurement
and changing the wave function.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.164
AUDIENCE: So for
the negative time,

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:49.580
is it the earlier statement
about what the wave function--

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:50.770
PROFESSOR: It's merely
saying about what the wave

00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:51.640
function was at an earlier time.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.666
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
really have measurements.

00:37:53.666 --> 00:37:55.790
PROFESSOR: No one's done
any measurements, exactly.

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.170
Writing down the
probability distribution

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:58.390
does not do a measurement.

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.121
Exactly.

00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:00.870
One last question.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:01.910
Sorry, I really-- Yup.

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:04.230
AUDIENCE: Why define it
negative 2, and then prepares

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.619
the states and
its width times 0?

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:07.410
PROFESSOR: Well, you
could ask the question

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.285
slightly differently.

00:38:08.285 --> 00:38:12.010
If you had wanted to prepare
the state at time minus 7 such

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:13.710
that you got this
state at time 0--

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.390
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.399
PROFESSOR: This is
the inverse of asking

00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:17.940
given that the state
is prepared now,

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.150
what is it going
to be at time 7.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.110
So they're equally
reasonable questions.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:23.800
What should you
have done last week

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.170
so that you got your
problem set turned in today?

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.010
There was no problem
set due today.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:38.070
OK, so with that said, we've
done an analytic analysis--

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:42.720
that was ridiculous-- we've done
a quick computation that showed

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:49.640
analytically what happens
to a Gaussian wave packet.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.695
We've done an analysis
that showed us

00:39:08.695 --> 00:39:12.280
how the wave function
evolved over time.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.600
What I'd like to do now is use
some of the PhET simulations

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.420
to see this effect, and also
to predict some more effects.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.170
So what I want you to
think about this as,

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.330
so this is the PhET quantum
tunneling wave packet

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:24.870
simulation.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:26.910
If you haven't played with
these, you totally should.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:27.710
They're fantastic.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:30.330
They're a great way of
developing some intuition.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:31.770
All props to the Colorado group.

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:33.170
They're excellent.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:34.920
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:36.610
to run through a
series of experiments

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.880
that we could, in principle,
do on a table top,

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.050
although it would be
fabulously difficult.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:42.920
But the basic physics is simple.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.260
Instead I'm going to run them
on the computer on the table top

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.882
because it's easier and cheaper.

00:39:48.882 --> 00:39:50.840
But I want you to think
of these as experiments

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.260
that we're actually running.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.510
So here, what these diagram
show, for those of you who

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.643
haven't played
with this, is this

00:39:55.643 --> 00:39:57.940
is the potential that I'm
going to be working with.

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.860
The green, this
position, tells me

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.180
the actual value of the
energy of my wave packet.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.890
And the width tells me how
broad that wave packet is.

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.474
And roughly speaking,
how green it is

00:40:08.474 --> 00:40:10.890
tells me how much support I
have on that particular energy

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:12.100
eigenstate.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.645
And I can change that by tuning
the initial width of the wave

00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:16.280
packet.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.790
So if I make width
very narrow, I

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.900
need lots and lots of
different energy eigenstates

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.870
to make an narrow
well-localized wave packet.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.830
And if I allow the wave
packet to be quite wide,

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:27.840
then I don't need as
many energy eigenstates.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.390
So let me make that a
little more obvious.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:32.690
So fewer energy
eigenstates are needed,

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:34.240
so we have a thinner
band in energy,

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.698
more energy
eigenstates are needed,

00:40:35.698 --> 00:40:36.920
so I have more wide band.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.120
Is everyone cool with that?

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.860
And what this program does is it
just integrates the Schrodinger

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.420
equation-- well,
yeah, well it just

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.530
integrates the
Schrodinger equation.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.860
So what I want to do is
I want to quickly-- oops.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.630
So this is the wave
function, its absolute value.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:02.666
And this is the probability
density, the norm squared.

00:41:02.666 --> 00:41:03.790
So let's see what happened.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:05.710
So what is this initial state?

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:07.240
This initial
state-- in fact, I'm

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:11.470
going to re-load
the configuration.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.070
So this initial
state corresponds

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:18.860
to being more or less here
with some uncertainty.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.930
So that's our psi of x0.

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.394
And let's see how this evolves.

00:41:22.394 --> 00:41:24.310
So first, before you
actually have it evolved,

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:27.270
what do you think
is going to happen?

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:32.660
And remember, it's got some
initial momentum as well.

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:33.270
OK.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.000
So there it is evolving and
it's continuing to evolve,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.720
and it's really quite boring.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:39.730
This is a free particle.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:40.950
Wow, that was dull.

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:42.550
OK, so let's try that again.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.355
Let's look also at
the real part and look

00:41:44.355 --> 00:41:47.452
at what the phase of the
wave function's doing.

00:41:47.452 --> 00:41:49.410
So here there's something
really cool going on.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.074
It might not be obvious.

00:41:51.074 --> 00:41:51.990
But look back at this.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.730
Look at how rapidly
the wave packet moves

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.480
and how rapidly the phase moves.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.244
Which one's moving faster?

00:41:58.244 --> 00:41:59.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.610
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
the wave packet.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:02.082
And the wave
packet, it's kind of

00:42:02.082 --> 00:42:04.450
hard to tell exactly how
much faster it's moving.

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:08.660
But we can get that from this.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:13.060
What's the velocity of a
single plane wave or the phase

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.300
velocity?

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.840
So the phase
velocity from problem

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:23.590
set one is h-bar k squared upon
2m-- let me write this as omega

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:29.999
upon k, which is just
equal to h-bar k upon 2m.

00:42:29.999 --> 00:42:31.790
But that's bad because
that's the momentum.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:35.690
Divide the momentum by the mass,
that's the classical velocity.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.824
So this says that the
phase of any plane wave

00:42:38.824 --> 00:42:40.615
is moving with half
the classical velocity.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.150
That's weird.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:46.691
On the other hand,
the group velocity

00:42:46.691 --> 00:42:48.860
of a wave packet, of a
normalizable wave packet

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:51.460
is do mega dk.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.810
And do mega dk will pull it
down an extra factor of 2.

00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:56.442
This Is equal to h-bar k upon m.

00:42:56.442 --> 00:42:58.365
This is the classical velocity.

00:42:58.365 --> 00:43:00.740
So this is the difference
between the phase and the group

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:05.160
velocity, and that's exactly
what we're seeing here.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.660
So the first thing
you notice is you

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.980
see the difference between the
phase and the group velocity.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.760
So that's good.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.300
That should be reassuring.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:11.930
But there's
something else that's

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.390
really quite nice about this.

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:18.347
Let's make the wave
packet really very narrow.

00:43:18.347 --> 00:43:20.180
So here it's much more
narrow, and let's let

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:22.490
the system evolve.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.490
And now you can see that
the probability density

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.760
is falling off quite rapidly.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.360
Let's see that again.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.886
Cool.

00:43:30.886 --> 00:43:33.260
The probability distribution
is falling off very rapidly.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.520
And there's also kind
of a cool thing that's

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.645
happening is you're seeing
an accumulation of phase

00:43:36.645 --> 00:43:38.530
up here and a
diminution down here.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:41.640
We can make that a
little more sharp.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:44.840
Oops, sorry.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.420
Yeah.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.640
So that is a combination
of good things

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.520
and the code being
slightly badly behaved.

00:43:51.984 --> 00:43:53.650
So the more narrow I
make that initial--

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.860
so let's-- so I made
that really narrow,

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.410
and how rapidly
does it fall off?

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:02.990
So that very narrow
wave packet by time 10

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:04.460
is like at a quarter.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:10.460
But if we made it much wider,
that very narrow wave packet

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:14.364
started out much lower and it
stays roughly the same height.

00:44:14.364 --> 00:44:16.030
It's just diminishing
very, very slowly.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:19.140
And that's just the
1 over a effect.

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.690
So this is nice.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.690
And I guess the way I'd
like to think about this

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:30.577
is this is confirming rather
nicely, our predictions.

00:44:30.577 --> 00:44:32.660
So now I want to take a
slightly different system.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.400
So this system is really
silly because we all

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.800
know what's going to happen.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:44.319
Here's a hill, and if
this were the real world

00:44:44.319 --> 00:44:46.360
I would think of this as
some potential hill that

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.902
has some nice finite fall off.

00:44:48.902 --> 00:44:50.985
The sort of place you don't
want to go skiing off.

00:44:50.985 --> 00:44:52.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:54.030
PROFESSOR: Well, I don't.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:57.050
So imagine you take
an object of mass m

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:00.990
and you let it slide along
in this potential, what

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.950
will happen?

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.852
It will move along
at some velocity.

00:45:03.852 --> 00:45:06.060
It will get to this cliff,
it will fall off the cliff

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:08.870
and end up going much
faster at the bottom.

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:09.554
Yeah?

00:45:09.554 --> 00:45:11.470
So if you kick it here,
it will get over there

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.640
and it will end up much faster.

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:20.460
What happens to
this wave packet.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.210
So we're solving the
Schrodinger equation.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.127
It's exactly the same
thing we've done before.

00:45:24.127 --> 00:45:24.751
Let's solve it.

00:45:24.751 --> 00:45:26.210
So here's our
initial wave packet,

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.730
nice and well-localized.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:28.987
There's our wave function.

00:45:28.987 --> 00:45:29.695
And what happens?

00:45:38.104 --> 00:45:40.270
So at that point something
interesting has happened.

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:42.910
You see that for the most
part, most of the probability

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:45.574
is over here, but not all
the probability is over here.

00:45:45.574 --> 00:45:46.990
There's still a
finite probability

00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:51.150
that the particle stays
near the wall for a while.

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:54.300
Let's watch what happens to that
probability as time goes by.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.220
And now you should
notice that it's

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.540
decayed into a
wave packet that's

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.440
over here, and then a
superposition of a wave

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:05.510
packet over here
moving to the left.

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:09.910
This wave has scattered off
the barrier going downhill.

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:15.170
It's mostly transmitted,
but some of it reflected.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:16.240
Which is kind of spooky.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.865
So let's watch that-- I'm going
to make this much more extreme.

00:46:22.274 --> 00:46:24.190
So here's a much more
extreme version of this.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:25.731
I'm now going to
make the energy very

00:46:25.731 --> 00:46:28.477
close to the height
of the potential.

00:46:28.477 --> 00:46:31.060
The energy is very, very close
to the height of the potential,

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.100
and the potential is far away.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.516
We're still reasonably local--
I can make it a little less

00:46:34.516 --> 00:46:38.135
localized just to really
crank up the suspense.

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:41.880
So watch what happens now.

00:46:44.789 --> 00:46:46.580
So first off, what do
you expect to happen?

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:48.371
So we've made the energy
of the wave packet

00:46:48.371 --> 00:46:50.440
just barely higher than
the energy of the hill.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.815
So it's almost classically
disallowed from being up here.

00:46:52.815 --> 00:46:54.439
What does that mean
about its velocity?

00:46:54.439 --> 00:46:55.610
It's effective loss.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:56.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:56.810
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:58.790
The momentum, the expectation
value for momentum

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.000
should be very low
because it just

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.390
has a little bit
of spare energy.

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:04.260
So the expected value for the
momentum should be very low.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.970
It should dribble, dribble,
dribble, dribble, dribble,

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.219
dribble, dribble till it
gets to the cliff, and then--

00:47:08.219 --> 00:47:10.052
[WHISTLE]-- go flying off.

00:47:10.052 --> 00:47:11.510
So let's see if
that's what we see.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:20.750
So it's dribbling, but look
at the probability density

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:21.700
down here.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.260
Oh, indeed, we do
see little waves,

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:25.320
and those waves are
moving off really fast.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.470
But the amplitude is
exceedingly small.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.320
Instead, what we're seeing is
a huge pile up of probability

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:37.180
just before the wall, similar
to what we saw a minute ago.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:40.369
Except the probability
is much, much larger.

00:47:40.369 --> 00:47:41.660
And what's going to happen now?

00:47:44.873 --> 00:47:46.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:47.220
PROFESSOR: It's leaking.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.950
It's definitely leaking.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:54.730
But an awful lot of
the probability density

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:57.340
is not going off the cliff.

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.650
This would be Thelma and
Louise cruising off the cliff

00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:01.270
and then just not falling.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:04.186
This is a very disconcerting--
you guys get to-- yeah.

00:48:04.186 --> 00:48:06.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.820
So see what happens,
see what happened here.

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:12.480
We've got this nice big
amplitude to go across

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.502
or to reflect back,
to scatter back.

00:48:14.502 --> 00:48:16.210
You really want to
fall down classically,

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.668
but quantum
mechanically you can't.

00:48:17.668 --> 00:48:19.160
It's impossible.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.185
So, in fact, the probability
they reflect back is 41,

00:48:22.185 --> 00:48:23.810
and we're going to
see how to calculate

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:27.051
that in the next few lectures.

00:48:27.051 --> 00:48:27.550
Yup.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:31.237
AUDIENCE: So the transmission
was actually really high.

00:48:31.237 --> 00:48:33.195
PROFESSOR: Transition
was reasonably high, yup.

00:48:33.195 --> 00:48:35.003
AUDIENCE: And it was
really [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:37.532 --> 00:48:38.990
PROFESSOR: It wasn't
really, sorry?

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:41.700
AUDIENCE: It wasn't really
apparent graphically.

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
it wasn't apparent.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.908
The way it was apparent
was just the fact

00:48:44.908 --> 00:48:47.380
that the amplitude that bounced
back was relatively small.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.770
So what was going is any
little bit of probability that

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:52.100
fell down had a large
effective momentum.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.690
Just ran off the
screen very rapidly.

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.980
So it's hard to see that in
the simulation, it's true.

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:02.030
We can make the-- we can
squeeze-- ah, there we go.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.490
So here is-- that's
about as good

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:07.072
as I'm going to be able to get.

00:49:07.072 --> 00:49:08.780
And it's just going
to be glacially slow.

00:49:14.229 --> 00:49:16.270
But this is just going to
be preposterously slow.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:18.430
I'm not even sure
there's much point

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:20.450
in-- But you can see
what's going to happen.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:22.410
They're going to build up, we're
going to get a little leak off,

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:24.076
but for the most part,
the wave packet's

00:49:24.076 --> 00:49:25.285
going to go back to the left.

00:49:25.285 --> 00:49:27.575
Questions about this one
before we move on to the next?

00:49:27.575 --> 00:49:28.242
Yeah.

00:49:28.242 --> 00:49:29.158
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:32.182 --> 00:49:33.640
PROFESSOR: Are
the-- Yeah, exactly.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.056
So r and t here are going to
be defined as the probability

00:49:36.056 --> 00:49:37.860
that this wave packet
gets off to infinity

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.634
in either direction.

00:49:40.634 --> 00:49:43.580
AUDIENCE: What happens if you
make the energy lower than--

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.121
PROFESSOR: Then you
can't have a wave

00:49:45.121 --> 00:49:47.050
packet on the left
that's moving.

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:49.730
Because remember that
the wave packet in order

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:53.956
to have an expected momentum
needs to be oscillating.

00:49:53.956 --> 00:49:56.580
But if the energy is lower than
the potential, its exponential.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.550
So the expectation value
for the momentum is 0.

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:00.080
So you can't have a particle
moving in from the left

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.590
if it's got energy less than
the height of the barrier.

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:04.091
Cool?

00:50:04.091 --> 00:50:04.590
Yeah.

00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:06.750
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what's
this green thing?

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.208
PROFESSOR: The green thing is
the energy of the wave packet

00:50:09.208 --> 00:50:10.620
that I'm sending in.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.960
OK, so let's go to the next one.

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.280
So this is something
we'd like to understand.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.780
The reason I'm
showing you this is I

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:21.580
want to explain this phenomena.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.830
We already did the dispersion.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:24.871
I want to explain this
phenomena that you reflect

00:50:24.871 --> 00:50:27.680
when going downhill, which
is perhaps surprising.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.680
And I want to ask how
efficiently do reflect off

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.450
any given barrier.

00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:31.950
Yeah.

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:32.968
Question.

00:50:32.968 --> 00:50:35.551
AUDIENCE: Can you describe the
[INAUDIBLE] physical experiment

00:50:35.551 --> 00:50:37.429
that would show
that done, though?

00:50:37.429 --> 00:50:38.720
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:42.700
So suppose I have a
little capacitor plate

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.870
and there's a potential
difference across it

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.724
and a hole so a particle
could shoot threw it.

00:50:48.724 --> 00:50:50.890
I mean it doesn't have to
be an insanely small hole,

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:51.390
but a hole.

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.232
So that if a particle
goes from here

00:50:53.232 --> 00:50:54.940
to the other side of
the capacitor plate,

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.800
it will have accelerated across
the potential difference.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.740
So if you think about the
effective potential energy,

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.490
the potential is
decreasing linearly.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:03.970
It's a constant electric field.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.710
So over this short domain
between the capacitor plates,

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:12.632
we have effectively a
linear potential energy.

00:51:12.632 --> 00:51:15.090
So I have a particle that I
send with very little momentum,

00:51:15.090 --> 00:51:16.180
but it carries some charge.

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:17.410
It gets on capacitor
plates, and if it

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:18.784
goes through the
capacitor plate,

00:51:18.784 --> 00:51:20.520
it ends with a lot
more energy relative

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.300
to the potential energy.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.220
That cool?

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:25.400
So a little capacitor
plate with a hole in it

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.100
is a beautiful example
of this system.

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.600
Good?

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.391
Now, making it infinitely
sharp, well, that

00:51:30.391 --> 00:51:31.500
would require-- you know.

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.960
But making it very
sharp is no problem.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.920
So here's the inverse
of what we just did,

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:42.850
which is sending a
particle into a barrier.

00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:46.140
And so there you see it does
some quite awesome things.

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.320
And I want to pause
it right here.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.550
This is the energy band.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.510
So the green
represents-- it says

00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:54.489
that at any given energy
inside this green band,

00:51:54.489 --> 00:51:56.780
there's some contribution
from the corresponding energy

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.730
eigenstate to our wave packet.

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:02.200
There isn't any
contribution from states

00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.680
up here where there's
no green, which

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.732
means that all the
contributions come

00:52:06.732 --> 00:52:08.190
from energy
eigenstates with energy

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:09.960
below the height of the barrier.

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:14.080
None of them have enough
energy to cross the barrier.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.390
And what we see when we
send in our wave packet

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.180
is some complicated mucking
around near the barrier,

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.610
but in particular,
right there, there's

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:26.100
a finite non-zero
probability that you're

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.810
found in the classically
disallowed region.

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:31.030
In the region where you
didn't have enough energy

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:32.670
to get there.

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:33.680
We see right there.

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.770
And meanwhile, there's
also a huge pile up here.

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:36.620
This is a hard wall.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:38.320
Normally classically
from a hard wall,

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.980
you roll along, you
hit the hard wall,

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.740
and you bounce off
instantaneously

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:43.960
with the same velocity.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.750
But here what we're
saying is no, the wave

00:52:46.750 --> 00:52:48.940
doesn't just exactly
bounce off instantaneously.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.760
We get this complicated piling
up and the interference effect.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.590
So what's going on there?

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.482
Well, it's precisely
an interference effect.

00:52:56.482 --> 00:52:57.690
So look at the wave function.

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:59.900
The wave function is a much
easier thing to look at.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.610
So the red is the amplitude.

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:03.930
The red is the real part.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:05.380
The black is the phase.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:08.060
So the real part is actually
behaving quite reasonably.

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.179
It looks like it's just
bouncing right off.

00:53:10.179 --> 00:53:12.470
But the physical thing is
the probability distribution.

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:15.260
The probability distribution
has interference terms

00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:17.030
from the various
different contributions

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:18.844
to the wave function.

00:53:18.844 --> 00:53:20.760
So at the collision those
interference effects

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.062
are very important.

00:53:22.062 --> 00:53:23.770
And at late times
notice what's happened.

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:25.700
At late times the
probability distribution

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.979
all went right back off.

00:53:28.979 --> 00:53:31.020
So that's something else
we'd like to understand.

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.522
Penetration into the
barrier from a classically

00:53:34.522 --> 00:53:35.480
disallowed wave packet.

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:35.980
Yup.

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:40.124
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the wave
packet is also expanding again?

00:53:40.124 --> 00:53:40.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:41.831
The wave packet, exactly.

00:53:41.831 --> 00:53:44.102
So the wave packet is
always going to expand.

00:53:44.102 --> 00:53:46.310
And the reason is we're
taking our wave packet, which

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.560
is a reasonably well-localized
approximately Gaussian wave

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.100
packet.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.340
So whatever else is
going on, while it's

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:53.465
in the part of the potential
where the potential is

00:53:53.465 --> 00:53:56.030
constant, it's also
just dispersing.

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:57.240
And so we can see that here.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.530
Let's make that more obvious.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:03.642
Let's make the initial wave
packet much more narrow.

00:54:03.642 --> 00:54:05.350
So if the wave packet's
much more narrow,

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:06.724
we're going to
watch it disperse,

00:54:06.724 --> 00:54:09.950
and let's move the
wall over here.

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:12.630
So long before it hits the wall
it's going to disperse, right?

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:13.630
That's what we'd expect.

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:15.380
And lo, watch it disperse.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:17.370
OK, now gets to the wall.

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:22.275
And it's sort of a mess.

00:54:22.275 --> 00:54:24.400
Now, you see that there's
contributions to the wave

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:25.630
function over here,
there's support

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:27.260
for the wave function
moving off to the right.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.634
But now notice that we have
support on energy eigenstates

00:54:29.634 --> 00:54:31.999
with energy above the barrier.

00:54:31.999 --> 00:54:34.040
So, indeed, it was possible
for some contribution

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:34.998
to go off to the right.

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:41.890
So one more of these guys.

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:42.970
I guess two more.

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:43.730
These are fun.

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:47.320
So here's a hard wall.

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:51.230
Let's make the-- So
here's a hard wall.

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:53.870
But it's a finite width barrier.

00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:55.970
What happens?

00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:59.530
Well, this is basically the
same as what we just saw.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.230
We collide up against
that first wall,

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:02.782
and since there's
an exponential fall

00:55:02.782 --> 00:55:04.565
off it doesn't really
matter that there's

00:55:04.565 --> 00:55:06.440
this other wall where
it falls down over here

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.856
because the wave function is
just exponentially suppressed

00:55:08.856 --> 00:55:11.070
in the classically
disallowed region.

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:12.110
So let's see that again.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.990
It's always going to be
exponentially suppressed

00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:15.531
in the classically
disallowed region.

00:55:15.531 --> 00:55:18.930
As you see, there's that
big exponential suppression.

00:55:18.930 --> 00:55:20.720
So there's some
finite particle here,

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.850
but you're really unlikely to
find it out here exponentially.

00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:28.320
On the other hand, if we
make the barrier-- so let's

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.850
think about this barrier.

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:34.440
Classically, this is just
as good as a thick barrier.

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.770
You can't get passed this wall.

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:40.210
But quantum mechanically
what happens?

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:43.270
You go right through.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.770
Just--

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:44.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.038
PROFESSOR: --right on--

00:55:45.038 --> 00:55:51.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.657
Yeah, uh-huh.

00:55:53.657 --> 00:55:54.240
Right through.

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.530
It barely even changes shape.

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:57.830
It barely even changes shape.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:58.955
Just goes right on through.

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:01.371
Now, there's some probability
that you go off to the left,

00:56:01.371 --> 00:56:02.372
that you bounce off.

00:56:02.372 --> 00:56:05.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:06.430
I share your pain.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:09.210
I totally do.

00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:14.394
So I would like to do another
experiment which demonstrates

00:56:14.394 --> 00:56:17.060
the difference between classical
and quantum mechanical physics.

00:56:19.744 --> 00:56:20.244
Right.

00:56:20.244 --> 00:56:23.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:27.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.610
So we have some
explaining to do.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.741
And this is going to turn
out to be-- surprisingly,

00:56:30.741 --> 00:56:32.240
this is not a hard
thing to explain.

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:32.780
It's going to be real easy.

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.155
Just like the
dispersion, this is

00:56:34.155 --> 00:56:37.060
going to be not a
hard thing to explain.

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:39.712
But the next one and this
is-- oh yeah, question.

00:56:39.712 --> 00:56:42.319
AUDIENCE: Does the height
of the spike matter?

00:56:42.319 --> 00:56:43.610
PROFESSOR: It does, absolutely.

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:46.640
So the height of the spike and
the width of the spike matter.

00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.050
So let's make it a little wider.

00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:49.841
And what we're going
to see now is oh, it's

00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:54.045
a little less likely
to go through.

00:56:54.045 --> 00:56:55.570
If we make it just
a tiny bit wider

00:56:55.570 --> 00:56:57.695
we'll see that it's much
less likely to go through.

00:56:57.695 --> 00:56:59.320
We'll see much stronger
reflected wave.

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:03.312
So both the height and width
are going to turn out to matter.

00:57:03.312 --> 00:57:05.770
So here you can see that there's
an appreciable reflection,

00:57:05.770 --> 00:57:06.590
which there wasn't previously.

00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:08.173
Let's make it just
a little bit wider.

00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:18.270
And now it's an awful lot
closer to half and half.

00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:20.020
See the bottom two lumps?

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.325
Let's make it just
ever so slightly wider.

00:57:25.844 --> 00:57:27.260
And again, looking
down here we're

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:28.613
going to have a transmitted
bit, but we're also

00:57:28.613 --> 00:57:29.550
going to have a
reflected-- now it

00:57:29.550 --> 00:57:32.010
looks like the reflected bit is
even a little bit larger maybe.

00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:34.551
And we can actually compute the
reflection transmission here.

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:38.336
72% gets reflected and
28% get transmitted.

00:57:38.336 --> 00:57:40.960
I really strongly encourage you
to play with these simulations.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.584
They're both fun and
very illuminating.

00:57:42.584 --> 00:57:43.175
Yeah.

00:57:43.175 --> 00:57:45.905
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
just the higher it got,

00:57:45.905 --> 00:57:47.318
the less got transmitted?

00:57:47.318 --> 00:57:47.943
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:57:47.943 --> 00:57:50.046
AUDIENCE: So if this were
a delta function would

00:57:50.046 --> 00:57:50.990
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:53.350
PROFESSOR: Well,
what's the width?

00:57:53.350 --> 00:57:54.130
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:57:54.130 --> 00:57:57.290
PROFESSOR: So what
happens when we

00:57:57.290 --> 00:58:00.657
make the well less and
less-- or more and more thin?

00:58:00.657 --> 00:58:01.490
More, yeah, through.

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.990
So we've got a competition
between the heights

00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:03.800
and the width.

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.250
So one of the problems
on your problem set,

00:58:05.250 --> 00:58:07.166
either this week or next
week, I can't recall,

00:58:07.166 --> 00:58:09.020
will be for the delta
function barrier,

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.562
compute the transmission
probability.

00:58:10.562 --> 00:58:13.228
And, in fact, we're going to ask
you to compute the transmission

00:58:13.228 --> 00:58:15.140
probability through
two delta functions.

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.450
And, in fact, that's this week.

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.230
And then next week
we're going to show you

00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:20.245
a sneaky way of using
something called the S

00:58:20.245 --> 00:58:23.650
matrix to construct bound
states for those guys.

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:26.510
Anyway, OK.

00:58:26.510 --> 00:58:31.909
So next, the last
simulation today.

00:58:31.909 --> 00:58:33.700
So this is the inverse
of what we just did.

00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:34.865
Instead of having a
potential barrier,

00:58:34.865 --> 00:58:35.950
we have a potential well.

00:58:38.577 --> 00:58:39.910
So what do you expect to happen?

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:45.310
Well, there's our wave
packet, and it comes along,

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:48.084
and all heck breaks
loose inside.

00:58:48.084 --> 00:58:50.000
We get some excitations
and it tunnels across.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.940
But we see there's all
this sort of wiggling

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.670
around inside the wave function.

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:56.820
And we get some support
going off to the right,

00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.120
some support going
off to the left.

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:00.670
But nothing sticks
around inside,

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:03.540
which it looks like
there is, but it's

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.700
going to slowly decay away as
it goes off to the boundary.

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.360
These are scattering states.

00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:10.280
So one way to think about
what's going on here

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.190
is it first scatters off,
it scatters downhill,

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:15.622
and then it scatters uphill.

00:59:15.622 --> 00:59:17.080
But there's a very
funny thing that

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.700
happens when you can scatter
uphill and scatter downhill.

00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.940
As we saw, any time you
have scattering uphill

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:25.302
and there's some probability--
that you reflected

00:59:25.302 --> 00:59:26.760
some probability
that you transmit.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.990
And we scatter uphill.

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:29.573
There's some probability
you transmit,

00:59:29.573 --> 00:59:31.940
and some probability
that you reflect.

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.540
But if you have both an
uphill and a downhill

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:39.290
when you have a well,
something amazing happens.

00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:41.120
Consider this well.

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.660
This didn't work very well.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.601
Let's take a much larger one.

00:59:49.601 --> 00:59:50.100
Uh-hmm!

00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:57.790
So at some point, I
think it was last year,

00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:01.030
some student's cell phone
went off, and I was like oh,

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.290
come on, dude.

01:00:02.290 --> 01:00:03.360
You can't do that.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.520
And like five minutes later
my cell phone went off.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.070
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:09.070 --> 01:00:12.230
So I feel your pain, but please
don't let that happen again.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:16.830
So here we go.

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:20.366
So this is a very similar
system-- well, the same system,

01:00:20.366 --> 01:00:21.740
but with a different
wave packet,

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.031
and a slightly different width.

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:27.950
And now what happens?

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:32.250
Well, all this wave packet
just sort of goes on,

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:35.580
but how much probability is
going back off to the left?

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.890
Very little.

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:38.360
In fact, we can
really work this.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:45.320
Sorry, I need this, otherwise
I'm very bad at this.

01:01:03.306 --> 01:01:05.680
There's some probability that
reflects in the first well.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:07.780
There's some probability that
reflects in the second well.

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:09.154
But the probability
that reflects

01:01:09.154 --> 01:01:13.360
from the combination
of the two, 0.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.220
How can that be?

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.450
So this is just like the
boxes at the very beginning.

01:01:21.450 --> 01:01:22.820
There's some probability.

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:26.370
So to go in this system-- so
let's go back to the beginning.

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:30.280
There's some amplitude
to go from the left side

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.510
to the right-hand side by
going-- so how would you

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:34.620
go from the left-hand side
to the right-hand side?

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:39.520
You transmit and
then transmit, right?

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.500
So it's the transmission
amplitude times transmission

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.050
amplitude gives you the product.

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:46.200
But is that the only
thing that could happen?

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.434
What are other possible
things that could happen?

01:01:48.434 --> 01:01:49.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:50.016
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:01:50.016 --> 01:01:53.330
You could transmit,
reflect, reflect, transmit.

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.270
You could also transmit,
reflect, reflect,

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:57.555
reflect, reflect, transmit.

01:01:57.555 --> 01:01:59.680
And you could do that an
arbitrary number of times.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.360
And each of those
contributions is

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.220
a contribution to the amplitude.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:05.270
And when you compute the
probability of transmit,

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:07.520
you don't take some
of the probabilities.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.440
You take the square of
the sum of the amplitudes.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.010
And what we will
find when we-- I

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:13.926
guess we'll do this next
time when we actually

01:02:13.926 --> 01:02:16.690
do this calculation-- is
that that interference

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:19.130
effect from taking the square
of the sum of the amplitudes

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:21.880
from each of the
possible bouncings

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.680
can interfere
destructively and it

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.200
can interfere constructively.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.345
We can find points when the
reflection is extremely low.

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:32.524
And we can find points where
the transmission is perfect.

01:02:32.524 --> 01:02:33.426
Yeah.

01:02:33.426 --> 01:02:35.230
AUDIENCE: So two questions.

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:39.850
One, the computer says that the
reflection coefficient is 0.

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:42.882
Why did it look like it there
was a wave packet going off

01:02:42.882 --> 01:02:43.810
back to the left?

01:02:43.810 --> 01:02:44.610
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:46.160
And, indeed, there
is a little bit here.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.540
So now I have to tell you
a little bit about how

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.647
the computer is casting
this reflection amplitude.

01:02:49.647 --> 01:02:51.230
The way it's doing
that is it's saying

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.970
suppose I have a state
which has a definite energy

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:56.319
at the center of
this distribution.

01:02:56.319 --> 01:02:58.110
Then the corresponding
reflection amplitude

01:02:58.110 --> 01:02:58.749
would be 0.

01:02:58.749 --> 01:03:00.290
But, in fact, I have
a superposition.

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:02.980
I've taken a
superposition of them.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.810
And so the contributions from
slightly different energies

01:03:05.810 --> 01:03:08.980
are giving me some
small reflection.

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:10.547
AUDIENCE: And also,
why do you have

01:03:10.547 --> 01:03:14.344
to fine-tune the
width of that as well?

01:03:14.344 --> 01:03:15.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:16.600
That's a really-- let me
rephrase the question.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.650
The question is why do
you have to fine-tune

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:18.290
the width of that well?

01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:20.164
Let me ask the question
slightly differently.

01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:22.090
How does the
reflection probability

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.660
depend on the width of the well?

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:27.181
What's going on at these
special values of the energy

01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:28.930
or special values of
the width of the well

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.500
when the transmission
is perfect?

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.940
Which I will call a resonance.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.220
Why is that happening?

01:03:34.220 --> 01:03:35.367
And we'll see that.

01:03:35.367 --> 01:03:37.200
So that's a question I
want you guys to ask.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.820
So I'm done now with
the experiments.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:47.234
You guys should play with
these on your own time

01:03:47.234 --> 01:03:48.150
to get some intuition.

01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.645
Yeah.

01:03:48.645 --> 01:03:50.311
AUDIENCE: Isn't the
[INAUDIBLE] you just

01:03:50.311 --> 01:03:52.740
showed actually a classical
[INAUDIBLE] objects?

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.340
PROFESSOR: So excellent.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.065
So here's what
I'm going to tell.

01:03:57.065 --> 01:03:58.440
I'm going to tell
you two things.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.760
First off, if I take a
classical particle and I

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.047
put it through these potentials,
for example, this potential.

01:04:05.047 --> 01:04:07.630
If I take a classical particle
and I put it in this potential,

01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:11.039
it's got an energy here,
does it ever reflect back?

01:04:11.039 --> 01:04:11.580
AUDIENCE: No.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580
PROFESSOR: No.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.840
Always, always it
rolls and continues on.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.920
Always.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.970
So if I take a quantum
particle and I do this,

01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:18.967
will it reflect back?

01:04:18.967 --> 01:04:19.800
AUDIENCE: Sometimes.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.280
PROFESSOR: Apparently sometimes.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.550
Now, how do I encode that?

01:04:22.550 --> 01:04:27.660
I encode that in studying the
solutions to the wave equation

01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:31.850
dt minus-- sorry--
i h-bar dt psi

01:04:31.850 --> 01:04:36.796
is equal to minus
h-bar squared upon 2m,

01:04:36.796 --> 01:04:39.670
dt squared psi plus v psi.

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:45.770
So this property of the quantum
particle that it reflects

01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:49.060
is a property of solutions
to this equation.

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.880
When I interpret the amplitude
squared as a probability.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.030
But this equation
doesn't just govern--

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.710
this isn't the only place that
this equation's ever shown up.

01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:59.550
An equation at least
very similar to this

01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:01.640
shows up in studying
the propagation of waves

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:03.040
on a string, for example.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.730
Where the potential is played
by the role of the tension

01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:07.324
or the density of the string.

01:05:07.324 --> 01:05:09.240
So as you have a wave
coming along the string,

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.850
as I'm sure you did
in 803, you have

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:12.290
a wave coming along a string.

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:15.340
And then the thickness or
density of the string changes,

01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:17.370
becomes thicker or
thinner, then sometimes

01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:19.203
you have reflections
off that interference--

01:05:19.203 --> 01:05:21.270
from impedance mismatch
is one way to phrase it.

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:22.936
And as you move across
to the other side

01:05:22.936 --> 01:05:24.100
you get reflections again.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.840
And the thing that
matters is not

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.780
the amplitude of the--
one of the things

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:28.840
that matters is
not the amplitude,

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.798
but it's the intensity.

01:05:29.798 --> 01:05:31.850
And the intensity's a square.

01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:33.830
And so you get
interference effects.

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:37.000
So, indeed, this phenomena
of reflection and multiple

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.260
reflection shows up in
certain classical systems,

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:41.490
but it shows up not in
classical particle systems.

01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:45.170
It shows up in classical wave
systems, like waves on a chain

01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:46.830
or waves in a rope.

01:05:46.830 --> 01:05:50.620
And they're governed by
effectively the same equations,

01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.690
not exactly, but effectively
the same equations,

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:56.040
as the Schrodinger evolution
governs the wave function.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.670
But the difference is that
those classical fields,

01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:02.600
those classical continuous
objects have waves on them,

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:04.630
but those waves
are actual waves.

01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:05.670
You see the rope.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:07.260
The rope is everywhere.

01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.430
In the case of the quantum
mechanical description

01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:13.500
of a particle, the
particle could be anywhere,

01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:14.460
but it is a particle.

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:15.668
It is a chunk, it is a thing.

01:06:15.668 --> 01:06:18.870
And this wave is a probability
wave in our knowledge

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:20.500
or our command of the system.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.940
Other questions?

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.210
OK.

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:33.246
So let's do the first example
of this kind of system.

01:06:33.246 --> 01:06:35.620
So let's do the very first
example we talked about, apart

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:38.435
from the free particle,
which is the potential step.

01:06:41.035 --> 01:06:42.535
First example is
the potential step.

01:06:47.386 --> 01:06:48.760
And what we want
to do is we want

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.530
to find the eigenfunctions
of the following potential.

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:54.556
Constant, barrier, constant.

01:06:54.556 --> 01:06:56.180
And I'm going to call
the height here V

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.429
naught, and the height here 0.

01:06:57.429 --> 01:06:59.450
And I'll call this
position X equals 0.

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:06.416
And I want to send
in a wave-- think

01:07:06.416 --> 01:07:09.040
about the physics of sending in
a particle that has an energy E

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:09.539
naught.

01:07:14.871 --> 01:07:16.620
Now to think about the
dynamics, before we

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:20.644
think about time evolution
of a localized wave packet,

01:07:20.644 --> 01:07:22.060
as we saw in the
free particle, it

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.080
behooves us to find
the energy eigenstates,

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.390
then we can deduce the
evolution of the wave packet

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:30.359
by doing a re-summation by using
the superposition principle.

01:07:30.359 --> 01:07:32.150
So let's first find
the energy eigenstates.

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:33.900
And, in fact, this
will turn out to encode

01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.290
all the information we need.

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:38.690
So we want to find phi e of x.

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:43.232
What is the energy eigenfunction
with energy E, let's say.

01:07:43.232 --> 01:07:44.690
And we know the
answer on this side

01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:45.770
and we know the
answer on this side

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:47.100
because it's just constant.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:50.320
That's a free particle and we
know how to write the solution.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:53.630
So we can write this
as this is equal to.

01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:56.460
On the left-hand side it's
just a sum of plane waves.

01:07:56.460 --> 01:08:01.150
It's exactly of that form.
a e to the i kx plus b

01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:07.800
e to the minus i kx on the left.

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:14.500
And on the right we have c e
to the minus i alpha x-- sorry.

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.620
On this side it's disallowed,
classically disallowed.

01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.670
So this is e to
the minus-- sorry,

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:26.340
do you-- plus alpha x
plus d e to minus alpha x.

01:08:29.729 --> 01:08:38.229
Where h-bar squared k squared
upon 2m is equal to e.

01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:42.729
And h-bar squared
alpha squared upon 2m

01:08:42.729 --> 01:08:46.660
is equal to v naught minus
e, the positive quantity.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:09:02.560
So we need to satisfy
our various continuity

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.702
and normalizability conditions.

01:09:04.702 --> 01:09:07.160
And in particular, what had
the wave function better do out

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:07.733
this way?

01:09:07.733 --> 01:09:08.649
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:08.649 --> 01:09:09.870
PROFESSOR: It had
better not divert--

01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:11.910
are we going to be able to build
normalizable wave packets--

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:14.300
or are we going to be able
to find normalizable wave

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.279
functions of this form?

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:16.779
No.

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:18.810
Because there are always going
to plane waves on the left.

01:09:18.810 --> 01:09:20.609
So the best we'll be able
to do is find delta function

01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:22.390
normalizable energy eigenstates.

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:23.931
That's not such a
big deal because we

01:09:23.931 --> 01:09:27.370
can build wave packets,
as we discussed before.

01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:28.979
But on the other
hand, it's one thing

01:09:28.979 --> 01:09:30.880
to be delta function
normalizable going

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.990
to just a wave, it's
another thing to diverge.

01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:36.649
So if we want to build
something that's normalizable up

01:09:36.649 --> 01:09:39.060
to a delta function
normalization condition,

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:41.520
this had better vanish.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.020
Yeah?

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.569
But on top of that, we
need that the wave function

01:09:50.569 --> 01:09:55.370
is continuous, so at x equals
we need that phi and phi

01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:56.340
prime are continuous.

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:02.360
So that turns out to be
an easy set of equations.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:07.980
So for phi, this says that
a plus b is equal to d.

01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:13.210
And for phi prime,
this says that ik a.

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:17.020
And then the next one is going
to give me minus ik a minus b

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:20.820
is equal to, on the right-hand
side, minus alpha c.

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:25.090
Because the exponential's
all value to 0.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:29.450
So we can invert
these to get that d

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:32.979
is equal to 2-- that's weird.

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:34.520
AUDIENCE: You have
a d in the bottom.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.870
There's [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:38.490
PROFESSOR: Oh,
sorry. d. d. d. d. d.

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:39.000
Thank you.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:42.190
To invert those you get 2k
over k plus i alpha, I think?

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:44.070
Yes.

01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:49.210
And b is equal to k minus i
alpha over k plus i alpha.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.530
And so you can
plug these back in

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:57.760
and get the explicit form
of the wave function.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.840
Now, what condition
must the energy satisfy

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.410
order that this is a
solution that's continuous

01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:07.289
and derivative is continuous?

01:11:07.289 --> 01:11:09.955
Last time we found that in order
to satisfy for the finite well,

01:11:09.955 --> 01:11:13.360
the continuity normalizability
conditions, only certain values

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.730
of the energy were allowed.

01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:18.422
Here we've imposed
normalizability and continuity.

01:11:18.422 --> 01:11:19.880
What's the condition
on the energy?

01:11:24.249 --> 01:11:25.290
This is a trick question.

01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:27.280
There isn't any.

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.130
For any energy we
could find a solution.

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:31.830
There was no consistency
condition amongst these.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:32.710
Any energy.

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:35.194
So are the energy eigenvalues
continuous or discrete?

01:11:35.194 --> 01:11:36.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:37.026
PROFESSOR: Continuous.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:39.290
Anything above 0 energy
is allowed for the system,

01:11:39.290 --> 01:11:39.956
it's continuous.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:44.350
So what does this wave
function look like?

01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:46.600
Oh, I really should have
done this on the clean board.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.225
What does this wave
function look like?

01:11:48.225 --> 01:11:56.470
Well, it's oscillating out
here, and it's decaying in here,

01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:57.220
and it's smooth.

01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:05.420
So what's the meaning of this?

01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.014
What's the physical meaning?

01:12:07.014 --> 01:12:08.930
Well, here's the way I
want to interpret this.

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:10.475
How does this system
evolve in time?

01:12:13.819 --> 01:12:15.610
How does this wave
function evolve in time?

01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:18.050
So this is psi of x.

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:19.350
What's psi of x and t?

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.250
Well, it just gets hit
by an e to the minus

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:33.510
i omega t minus omega t plus
omega t minus i omega t.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:38.729
Everyone cool with that?

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:40.270
So all I did is I
just said that this

01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:42.630
is an energy eigenfunction
with energy e,

01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:46.000
and frequency omega is
equal to e upon h-bar.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.500
And saying that this is an
energy eigenstate tells you

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.000
that under time evolution,
it evolves by rotation

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.972
by an overall phase, e
to the minus i omega t.

01:12:52.972 --> 01:12:54.930
And then I just multiplied
the whole thing by e

01:12:54.930 --> 01:12:58.860
to the minus i omega
t and distributed it.

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:01.070
So here's the minus
i omega t minus i

01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:05.370
omega t minus i
omega t in the phase.

01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:07.755
So doing that, though, gives
us a simple interpretation.

01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:15.000
Compared to our free particle,
e to the i kx minus omega t,

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.020
it's a wave moving to the
right with velocity omega

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.420
over k, the phase velocity.

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:21.535
This is a right-moving
contribution.

01:13:21.535 --> 01:13:22.175
So plus.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:29.760
And this is a
left-moving contribution.

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:30.760
Everyone cool with that?

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.140
So on the left-hand
side, what we

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.979
have is a superposition
of a wave moving

01:13:33.979 --> 01:13:35.770
to the right and a wave
moving to the left.

01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:38.570
Yeah?

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:44.970
On the right, what do we have?

01:13:44.970 --> 01:13:52.060
We have an exponentially falling
function whose phase rotates.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.001
Is this a traveling wave?

01:13:54.001 --> 01:13:54.500
No.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.660
It doesn't have any crests.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.410
It just has an overall
phase that rotates.

01:14:00.730 --> 01:14:02.700
And now here's one key thing.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.880
If we look at this, what's b?

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:07.610
We did the
calculation of v. v is

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.660
k minus i alpha
over k plus i alpha.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.060
What's the norm
square root of b?

01:14:17.824 --> 01:14:19.240
Well, the norm
square root of b is

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:21.320
going to be multiply this
by its complex conjugate,

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.945
multiply this by its
complex conjugate.

01:14:22.945 --> 01:14:25.640
But their each other's complex
conjugates will cancel.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.390
The norm squared is 1.

01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:28.480
So pure phase.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.950
So this tells you
b is a pure phase.

01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:33.120
So now look back at this.

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.837
If b is a pure phase--
sorry-- if b is a pure phase,

01:14:37.837 --> 01:14:39.920
than this left-moving piece
has the same amplitude

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.450
as the right-moving piece.

01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:42.770
This is a standing wave.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:47.799
All it's doing is it's
rotating by an overall phase.

01:14:47.799 --> 01:14:49.340
But it's a standing
wave because it's

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:51.480
a superposition of a wave
moving this way and a wave

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.146
moving that way with
the same amplitude.

01:14:53.146 --> 01:14:54.215
Just slightly shifted.

01:14:54.215 --> 01:14:55.840
So the fact that
there's a little shift

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.840
tells you that it's norm
squared is not constant.

01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.673
It has a small wave.

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:03.990
So what we see is we
get a standing wave that

01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:05.740
matches nicely onto a
decaying exponential

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:09.820
in this classically
disallowed region.

01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.780
So what that tells you
is what's the probability

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.280
to get arbitrarily
far to the right?

01:15:16.910 --> 01:15:17.480
0.

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.730
It's exponentially suppressed.

01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:21.480
What's the probability that your
found some point on the left?

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.980
Well, it's the norm
squared of that,

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.470
which is some standing wave.

01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:28.624
So the reflection of how
good is this is a mirror.

01:15:28.624 --> 01:15:29.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:30.915
PROFESSOR: It's
a perfect mirror.

01:15:30.915 --> 01:15:32.750
Well, it's not-- Now
we have to quibble

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:34.379
about what you mean
by perfect mirror.

01:15:34.379 --> 01:15:35.420
It reflects with a phase.

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.710
It reflects with a
phase beta, and I'm

01:15:39.710 --> 01:15:42.810
going to call that phase-- I
want to pick conventions here

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:44.240
that are consistent throughout.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:48.380
Let's call that e to the i phi.

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.424
So it reflects with
a phase phi, which

01:15:51.424 --> 01:15:53.090
is to say that
[INAUDIBLE] squared is 1.

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:03.580
And what happens-- I
don't want to do this.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.130
So in what situation
would you expect

01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:15.440
this to be a truly perfect
mirror, this potential?

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:17.603
When do you expect reflection
to be truly perfect?

01:16:17.603 --> 01:16:18.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:19.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:20.961
So if the height here
were infinitely high,

01:16:20.961 --> 01:16:22.140
then there's no probability.

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.181
You can't leak in at all.

01:16:23.181 --> 01:16:24.560
There's no exponential tail.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.590
It's just 0.

01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:29.626
So in the case that v0 is much
greater than e, what do we get?

01:16:29.626 --> 01:16:31.362
We get that v0 is
much greater than e.

01:16:31.362 --> 01:16:35.200
That means alpha's gigantic,
and k is very, very small.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.870
If alpha is gigantic and k is
very small, negligibly small,

01:16:38.870 --> 01:16:42.020
than this just becomes
minus i alpha over i alpha.

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:44.640
This just becomes
minus 1 in that limit.

01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.200
So in the limit that the wall
is really a truly hard wall,

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:48.850
this phase becomes minus 1.

01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:51.886
What happens to a wave when it
bounces off a perfect mirror?

01:16:51.886 --> 01:16:52.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:55.370
PROFESSOR: Its phase
is inverted, exactly.

01:16:55.370 --> 01:16:57.580
Here we see that the
phase shift is pi.

01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:01.640
You get a minus 1 precisely when
the barrier is infinitely high.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.760
When the barrier's
a finite height,

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.525
classically it would be
a perfect mirror still.

01:17:06.525 --> 01:17:08.900
But quantum mechanically it's
no longer a perfect mirror.

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:11.100
There's a phase
shift which indicates

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:14.740
that the wave is extending a
little bit into the material.

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:16.160
The wave is extending
a little bit

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.290
into the classically
disallowed region.

01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:21.310
This phase shift, called
the scattering phase shift,

01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:22.810
is going to play a
huge role for us.

01:17:22.810 --> 01:17:24.410
It encodes an enormous
amount of the physics,

01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:25.930
as we'll see over
the next few weeks.

01:17:25.930 --> 01:17:27.660
At the end of the semester
it'll be important for us

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:29.450
in our discussion
of bands and solids.

01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:40.500
So at this point, though, we've
got a challenge ahead of us.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:42.442
I'm going to be using
phrases like this

01:17:42.442 --> 01:17:44.650
is the part of the wave
function moving to the right,

01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:46.760
and that's the part of the wave
function moving to the left.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.930
I'm going to say
the wave function is

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:49.740
a superposition of
those two things.

01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:52.220
But I need a more
precise version of stuff

01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:54.130
is going to the right.

01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:58.650
And this is where the
probability density,

01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:01.870
phi squared, and the probability
current, which you guys

01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:10.640
have constructed on the problem
set, which is h-bar upon 2mi.

01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:23.300
Psi star dx i minus
psi dx psi star.

01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:26.370
These guys satisfy the
conservation equation

01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:28.630
which is d RHO dt.

01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:30.220
The time rate of
change of the density

01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:34.580
at some particular
point at time t

01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.260
is equal to minus the gradient,
derivative with respect

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:41.350
to x, of j.

01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:42.725
And I should really
call this jx.

01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:49.610
So the current in
the x direction.

01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:56.110
So this is the
conservation equation,

01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:59.170
just like for the
conservation of charge,

01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:01.780
and you guys should have
all effectively derived

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:02.780
this on the problem set.

01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:03.610
Yeah.

01:19:03.610 --> 01:19:06.430
AUDIENCE: Is the i under
or above [INAUDIBLE]?

01:19:06.430 --> 01:19:10.950
PROFESSOR: Is the i-- oh,
sorry, the i is below.

01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:12.450
That's just my
horrible handwriting.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:21.817
So what I want to
define very quickly

01:19:21.817 --> 01:19:24.400
is I want to be able to come up
with an unambiguous definition

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.270
of how much stuff is
going left and how much

01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:27.682
stuff is going right.

01:19:27.682 --> 01:19:29.140
And the way I'm
going to do that is

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:33.350
I'm going to say that the
wave function in general--

01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:38.370
I'll do that here-- when we have
a wave function at some point.

01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:40.260
It can be approximated
if the potential is

01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.975
roughly constant at that point.

01:19:41.975 --> 01:19:43.930
It can be approximated
in the following way.

01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:46.650
The wave function
is going to be psi

01:19:46.650 --> 01:19:50.610
is equal to psi
incident plus psi

01:19:50.610 --> 01:19:57.580
transmitted--
yeah, psi reflected

01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.530
on the left of my barrier.

01:19:59.530 --> 01:20:02.970
And psi transmitted
on the right.

01:20:02.970 --> 01:20:06.089
Where psi incident is
that right-moving part.

01:20:06.089 --> 01:20:07.880
The part that's moving
towards the barrier.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.730
Psi reflected is the left-moving
part that's reflected.

01:20:10.730 --> 01:20:12.602
Psi transmitted is
the part that is

01:20:12.602 --> 01:20:14.310
on the right-hand
side, the entire thing.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:16.768
So here the idea is I'm sending
in something from the left.

01:20:16.768 --> 01:20:20.134
It can either reflect
or it can transmit.

01:20:20.134 --> 01:20:22.300
So this is just my notation
for this for these guys.

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:27.950
And so what I wanted
to measure of how much

01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:30.810
stuff is going left, how
much stuff is going right.

01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:34.660
And the way to do that is to
use the probability current.

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:40.240
And to say that associated to
the incident term in the wave

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.840
function is an
incident current, which

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:47.659
is h-bar k upon
m from a squared.

01:20:47.659 --> 01:20:49.950
So if we take this wave
function, take that expression,

01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:52.850
plug it into j, this
is what you get.

01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:56.490
If you take the reflected
part b to the minus i kx

01:20:56.490 --> 01:21:00.980
minus omega d, and you plug it
into the current expression,

01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:04.000
you get the part of-- sorry,
I should call this capital

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.370
J-- you get the part of
the current corresponding

01:21:06.370 --> 01:21:12.410
to the reflected term, which
is h-bar k with a minus k

01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:16.330
upon m v squared.

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:18.384
And we'll get that
J transmitted is 0.

01:21:18.384 --> 01:21:20.300
Something that you proved
on your problem set.

01:21:20.300 --> 01:21:24.770
If the wave function is real,
it must-- the current to 0.

01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:27.000
So let's think about what
this is telling us quickly.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:27.800
So what is this [INAUDIBLE]?

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.830
So what is a current?

01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:33.250
A current is the amount of
stuff moving per unit time.

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:35.294
So charge times the velocity.

01:21:35.294 --> 01:21:36.960
So what's the stuff
we're interested in?

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:38.830
It's the probability density.

01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:39.580
There's a squared.

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:40.204
Norm a squared.

01:21:40.204 --> 01:21:42.010
That's the
probability amplitude,

01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:46.750
or probability density of
the right-moving piece.

01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:48.390
Just consider it in isolation.

01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:49.809
So that's the
probability density.

01:21:49.809 --> 01:21:50.850
It's the amount of stuff.

01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:55.310
And this is the momentum of
that wave, that's e to the i kx.

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.990
There's h-bar k.

01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:58.160
That's the momentum
divided by the mass, which

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.625
is the classical velocity.

01:21:59.625 --> 01:22:01.250
The amount of stuff
times the velocity.

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:02.266
That a current.

01:22:02.266 --> 01:22:05.220
It's the current with
which probability

01:22:05.220 --> 01:22:07.960
is flowing across a point.

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.250
Similarly, Jr, that's the amount
of stuff, and the velocity

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.832
is minus h-bar k upon m.

01:22:13.832 --> 01:22:15.290
So again, the
current is the amount

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:16.605
of stuff times the velocity.

01:22:19.190 --> 01:22:21.790
I'm going to define-- this
is just the definition,

01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:23.910
it's the reasonable
choice of definition--

01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:27.960
the transmission probability
is the ratio, the norm squared

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.494
of J transmitted
over J incident.

01:22:31.494 --> 01:22:33.660
And here's why this is the
reasonable thing-- oops--

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:34.400
incident.

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.730
Here's why this is the
reasonable quantity.

01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:41.382
This is saying how much current
is moving in from the left?

01:22:41.382 --> 01:22:43.590
How much stuff is moving in
from-- And how much stuff

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:48.160
is moving off on the
right, to the right?

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:50.920
So what is this in this case?

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.890
0, although this is
a general definition.

01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:57.404
And similarly, the reflection
you can either write as 1

01:22:57.404 --> 01:22:59.820
minus the transmission, because
either you transmit or you

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:03.950
reflect, the probability
must sum to 1.

01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:07.980
Or you can write r as
the current reflected.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:11.230
What fraction of the incident
current is, in fact, reflected?

01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:12.490
And here this is 1.

01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:15.351
Because beta-- b is a phase,
and the norm squared of a phase

01:23:15.351 --> 01:23:15.850
is 1.

01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:21.490
So on your problems
set, you'll be

01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:24.380
going through the computation
of various reflection

01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:28.730
and transmission amplitudes
for this potential.

01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:32.630
And we'll pick up on this with
the barrier uphill next week.

01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:34.870
Have a good spring break, guys.
