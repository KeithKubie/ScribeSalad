00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.540
So you wanna cause a little mischief, do you?
Here are 6 easy pranks to help you on your

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.779
way.

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:07.009
#6

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.929
You can prank someone who watches a lot of
TV with one simple trick. Just look on the

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.960
front of the remote for a little LED like
this, and cut a small piece of black electrical

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.700
tape about the same shape. When you smooth
it down over the LED it will hardly be noticeable

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.100
at all. Now when your victim goes to use their
remote, they'll be frustrated and confused

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.720
by why it doesn't work anymore, even after
they change out the batteries.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.460
#5

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.970
Carefully remove the lid to the toilet tank,
and pour in 10 - 20 drops of food coloring.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.490
Replace the lid, and now the next time your
victim goes to flush, they'll get an unexpected

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.610
surprise. There's a good chance the next person
in the bathroom will be a little concerned

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.980
as well.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.130
#4

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.200
This little prank, is on your local drive
through. Follow the link in the description

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.610
to download and print off this sign, then
cut along the dotted line at the bottom. Now

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.489
simply add some tape, and post it near the
microphone on the drive through station. You

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.540
can get a lot of people to fall for this one
because the signature makes the notice seem

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.230
authentic.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.920
#3

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.420
If you dig through your pile of junk mail,
chances are you'll find one of these business

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.250
reply envelopes. The return postage is paid
by the advertising companies, so why not load

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.190
the envelope with your junk mail, and send
it back? You'll cut down on garbage, and this

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.830
joke, will be at their expense.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.280
#2

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.000
This prank works best with a bunch of bananas.
Look for any natural brown spots on the peels

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.299
where you can push in a pin without the hole
being noticed. Rock the pin side to side a

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.909
few times, then repeat the process all the
way up the banana, spacing the holes about

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.700
an inch apart. Now the next time someone goes
to eat one of these delicious pieces of fruit,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.619
they'll be shocked to see it's already sliced
into bite sized pieces. Just tell them it's

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.740
probably a new brand that's been genetically
modified.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.979
#1

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.450
Ask someone to try an experiment that will
test their coordination. When they agree,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.619
see if they can hold a half full plastic cup
with just their teeth. Next, have them place

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.299
both arms out in front of them with their
palms facing down and tell them to balance

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.039
two more cups on the backs of their hands.
Now just walk away.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.900
Well there are a few ides to help get you
started on your quest for making mischief.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.489
