00:00:01.352 --> 00:00:04.435
(traffic passing by)

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.110
- [Man] The hardest part
was just kind of feeling

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.183
like I was a failure.

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:17.745
(building music)

00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:24.799
Why am I sleeping here
with my kids in my car?

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:27.216
(soft music)

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.670
- We've seen a great shift
in the last few years

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.503
as we came out of the recession

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.070
where it's not the job issue anymore

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.453
it's the housing prices.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.950
People who have born,
raised, generations here

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.800
that are finding themselves homeless.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.320
And it's just families getting pushed out.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.760
And it has nothing to
do with income, jobs.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.453
It's just the doubling of rent.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.130
- Well my wife works for a dental.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.750
My brother's a general manager for Shell.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.920
Even with that, we still find it hard

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.320
to even get a place to live.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.190
'Cause we got jobs, so
since we got income,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.990
we can't qualify for programs
that consider us homeless.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.173
Two bedroom apartments
that are like almost $1900.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.990
Is that something that we can afford?

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.823
No.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.790
- Without any changes,
we don't see this problem

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.690
getting any better in the near future.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.280
- [Darrick] Eva, come on.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.313
Come on, look at me.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.303
Ay, bye-bye.

00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:42.136
- Bye bye.

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:43.960
- [Darrick] We had an apartment.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.083
We were doing good.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.020
- [Lola] We had become good
friends with our landlord,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.910
and they were selling to a realty company.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.183
They were basically just
interested in freezing us out.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.870
We decided it was time to leave.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.210
- The places that we were finding

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.370
wanted like three times the rent

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.163
or they wanted 650 credit score or above.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.620
We didn't have that going on.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.230
- The motels were first.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.950
We went to the motels and
tore through our savings.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.960
So then we went to the emergency shelter,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.993
and it was just a tailspin at that point.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.380
What we did discover
is that being in a car

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.130
was far better for us as a family

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.170
than being slopped in with people,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.520
kind of pressed against us.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.610
- So my thoughts I was like oh my gosh,

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.386
I'm gonna sleep in my car,

00:02:35.386 --> 00:02:36.580
and it's gonna be all of these weirdos,

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.695
but then I got there and it's just,

00:02:38.695 --> 00:02:40.656
they're just people, they're just going

00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:41.489
through the same thing I was.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.210
All right, love you guys.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.560
See you later.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.710
- [Lola] Darrick has
almost always had job.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.763
- When I started working at
the drug treatment facility,

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.010
I'd get up at five, get ready,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.510
and then I'd leave the lot
and I wouldn't get back

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:02.020
'til like three o'clock.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.983
I was always tired.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.840
There was people depending on me.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.803
I can't just sit and wallow and be sad.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.350
I have things I have to take care of,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.560
and I want my family to be happy

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.710
and I want to be happy.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.480
We were in and out of the car
for I think about four years.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.170
It wasn't the best
experience at all times,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.920
but there were some great memories.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.080
- [Lola] We would drive to a nearby park

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.100
and I got to watch the sun rise.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.439
Say good morning to the whole city.

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:44.913
It felt hopeful in those moments.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:47.966
- Hi!

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:48.799
I'm Mimi.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:49.870
- And I'm Lola.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.028
- So we're here at the library.

00:03:53.028 --> 00:03:56.778
Well, every single day
was kind of different.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.603
- [Daughter] Home is where you live.

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:04.910
Home is where you

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.840
will be passion-able.

00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:13.954
- [Daughter] Home, I don't know, cars.

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.660
- Well I've been here almost five years

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.690
and I just like to see when people come

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.590
into this place they get
a place to call their own,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.630
and I have a little happy
dance that I do for them.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.785
I say,

00:04:30.785 --> 00:04:31.916
♪ I'm so proud of you ♪

00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:33.562
♪ I'm so proud of you ♪

00:04:33.562 --> 00:04:36.286
And that's it, and then
I jump up and down.

00:04:36.286 --> 00:04:38.536
(laughing)

00:04:39.763 --> 00:04:41.247
- We moved out of the car

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.527
and I really like this
place, so it's kind of cool.

00:04:46.527 --> 00:04:47.483
- 14, 15,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.793
16.

00:04:49.793 --> 00:04:52.328
Ready or not, here I come.

00:04:52.328 --> 00:04:53.161
Found you.

00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:55.440
(laughing)

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.993
I think we're still kind
of getting used to it.

00:04:57.993 --> 00:05:00.373
(laughing)

00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:01.670
Every once in a while I
wake up I go oh, whoa,

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.200
whoa there's not a roof right here.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.570
What's going on?

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.187
We got lucky.

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:08.145
(yelling)

00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:08.978
You're fine!

00:05:08.978 --> 00:05:09.811
You're fine.

00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:10.647
- Yay.

00:05:10.647 --> 00:05:12.848
♪ I believe I can fly ♪

00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:15.410
- Yeah we've had ups and downs,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.790
we just need to get through it.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:18.623
Band together.

00:05:20.047 --> 00:05:22.735
(yelling)

00:05:22.735 --> 00:05:25.152
(soft music)

00:05:26.274 --> 00:05:27.791
Can you hold it?

00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:29.474
My dad used to do this.

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:30.900
He'd go, you'll know when it's ready,

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.053
when it sticks to the wall.

00:05:32.053 --> 00:05:34.930
- [Mom] So what was your
favorite part of today?

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.089
- My favorite part is when me and Mommy

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:43.250
went to do laundry.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.277
- Well I liked doing lessons with you,

00:05:45.277 --> 00:05:46.793
I thought you did good today.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.440
What about you?

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.360
- I think this is the highlight of my day.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.548
We all hang out and have dinner together.

00:05:53.548 --> 00:05:54.810
- Yeah.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.690
- People should understand
about the situation

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.349
is it could happen to anyone.

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.182
- Hi, guys.

00:05:59.182 --> 00:06:00.240
- At the last second, I veered.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.541
How you doing?

00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:02.374
Good.

00:06:02.374 --> 00:06:03.225
Nice to see you.

00:06:03.225 --> 00:06:04.058
- Things are going good?

00:06:04.058 --> 00:06:05.433
- Yeah, they're going good.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.294
We miss you.

00:06:08.294 --> 00:06:09.991
We miss saying hi to you.

00:06:09.991 --> 00:06:11.080
- Okay.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.198
- And having a sense of community.

00:06:14.198 --> 00:06:15.780
- And, go.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.170
- It's kind of bittersweet in a way.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.263
But at the same time it's a relief, too.

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.280
When we first left, in our
apartment it was too quiet.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.130
We were all like.

00:06:29.044 --> 00:06:29.877
- Yeah.

00:06:29.877 --> 00:06:30.710
- I don't hear no traffic.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.543
- Yeah, we didn't hear any.

00:06:31.543 --> 00:06:33.050
It sounds like the ocean to me.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.320
For the most part it was
a positive experience.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.600
Because we just chose for them to be.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.937
Yeah?

00:06:49.937 --> 00:06:51.079
- When are we gonna leave?

00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:53.470
I don't wanna be here so long.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.303
- [Woman] Would you like your phone?

00:06:54.303 --> 00:06:55.661
- No.

00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:56.790
- [Woman] You wanna go
sit in the car with dada?

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.623
- No.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.381
- Hey, are you afraid that
we're gonna be staying here?

00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:03.214
- Yeah.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.240
- We're not staying here, honey.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.457
We're going back to our apartment.

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:11.334
