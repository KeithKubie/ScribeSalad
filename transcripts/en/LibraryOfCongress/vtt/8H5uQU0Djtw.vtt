&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.230
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Elizabeth
Blair: Megan Abbott as most

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.200 position:56%
of you probably know, is the queen
of noir, the queen of crime fiction.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.560
She's an Edgar-winning author of
seven novels, including The End

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.510
of Everything, The Fever and,
most recently, You Will Know Me.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.810
Her stories have appeared

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.320
in multiple collections including
Best American Mystery Stores

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.730
of 2014 and 2016.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.310
She's from the Detroit Area.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.800 position:56%
She graduated from the university of
Michigan and got her PhD in English

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.910
and American literature from NYU.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.610
And was the John Grisham writer
and resident of Ole Miss.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.630
But better than all of that,
Megan Abbott writes about girls

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.560
and women we probably
all feel like we know,

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.520
and puts them in some
pretty harrowing situations.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.820
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.620
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Please
welcome Megan Abbott.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.040
[ Applause ]

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.340
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Thank you.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.640
Thank you so much.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.940
I feel a little bit like Norma
Desmond with these lights.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.240
It's very dramatic.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.540
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: I know.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.840
You can't really see their faces.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.140
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.440
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: You don't know
what expressions they might have

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.740
on them.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.040
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: But definitely I
would love to start with just women,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.190
girls, teenage girls, moms.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.490
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.110
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: This is a
world you seem to really love.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.280
And I have my own reasons why that
might be, but please tell us why.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.100
Why do you want women at
the center of your novels?

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.160
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: I guess, you
know, it just sort of happened.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.120
It's so interesting that it's sort
of specific to write about women.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.420
If you have crime novels and you
write about men, no one says,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.790
"Why do you write about men?"

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.820
But it is weird because
historically in America at least,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.340
crime fiction has this
reputation for being

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.820
about men, about the world of men.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.260
Or these traditional
male areas of you know,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.950
the police and private detectives.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:57.390
And so I was more interested in
the sort of mystery of women.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.260
Especially because it seemed to
me -- to start with teenage girls,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.970 position:56%
there were sort of awful stereotypes
that were perpetuated in fiction

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.550
and in society of teenage
girls as vapid, as superficial,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.720 position:56%
as sort of the selfie-taking morons.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.880
And it was so offensive to me.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.630 position:56%
And I just thought there was, you
know, so much more interesting stuff

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.320 position:56%
to say about girls, particularly the
things we're not supposed to feel.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.080
Like aggression or
ambition or desire.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.420
And so that was sort of
how I found my way in.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.090
And that became a way to explore
all kinds of female relationships.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.060
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Well having
been a teenage girl once,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.020
I can tell you it is
like fertile ground.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.320
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: When I'm reading
your books I'm always thinking,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.920
"I know that girl.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.840
That girl was -- " well I won't say
her name, but Megan knows her also.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.140
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: That's right.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.440
We all know those girls.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.740
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: That's right.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.040
And I interviewed you
when The Fever came out.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.340
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.880
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: And I
remember you said you quoted Freud

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.990
as saying something like, "We're
all arrested at a certain age,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.690
and I'm arrested around 14 or 15."

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.990
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.290
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: So
I didn't ask you then,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.920
but I'm going to ask you now
in front of all these people,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.640
what were you like as a teenager?

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.940
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Oh boy.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.240
That's a great question.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.660
I suppose I was bookish, you know.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.060
I certainly was.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.730
But I do remember I
grew up in the Midwest,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.840
sort of really All-American
girl land

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.740
where these expectations
-- this was in the '80's.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.900
So there really was
an idea of girlhood

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.750
that was very dominant in that era.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.550
The era of the John
Hughes movies, you know,

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.720
which were actually welcome
relief compared to sort

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.990
of the more stereotypical
version of teenage girls.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.520
But I was sort of insatiably
curious and fascinated

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.700
by I suppose what we would
now say are dark things.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.140
I liked creepy books.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.440
I like true crime.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.810
I like to have adventures.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.800
You know, which I think
is most girls at that age.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.100
You want out.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.440
You want out in the world.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.940
You're not quite ready
for it, but you want it.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.310
Which makes it sort of a terrifying
moment once you're an adult

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.780
and you have kids of your own.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.640
But at that age it feels
exactly the right thing.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.940
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.390
Teenage girl relationships are
really important in your novels.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.060
How would you describe those
relationships when you were

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.440
in high school between girls?

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.740
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.790
Occasionally, what they would
now call toxic I suppose.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.090
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Right.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.010
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: You know, all of
you who are women in the room know,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.490
and I'm sure most of the men
know from the women they know,

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.380
that there can be very volatile
friendships at that age.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.540
In some ways they're
rehearsals for romances to come,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.110
for what you don't want in a
relationship as an adult, you know?

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.570
So you're kind of figuring
out what the boundaries are

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.170
and what's acceptable.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.410
And there's a lot of passion to
it that can be heartbreaking.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.410 position:56%
So many women I know who've read
one of my books and talked about it,

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.860
their first heartbreak was
really from a friendship,

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.650
not from a romantic relationship.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.890
But the friendships
are somewhat romantic.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.650
So that just seems obviously for a
crime novel, that's ripe terrain.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.950
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.680
And that's very much
the case in The Fever.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.640
But I would love to talk
about your last book.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.940
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.240
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair:
You Will Know Me.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.710
And I would love for you to read
the first page, if you don't mind.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.010
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Sure.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.310
Sure, yes.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.610
This is from the point
of view of Katie.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.250
So Katie is the mother of a
gymnast, and this is her --

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.340
I'm not going to say any more
because it's the first page.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.470
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Okay.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.400
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: If she
ever had to talk about it,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.730
which she never would,
Katie would have to go back.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.740
Back years before it happened,
before Coach T and Haley

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.170
and Ryan Beck, back
before Devin was born.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.050
When there were only two Knoxes,
neither of whom knew a Tuck

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.830
from a Salto or what you called
that glossy egg-shaped platform

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.820 position:56%
in the center of the room, the
vault that would change their lives.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.380
And Katie would tell the
story in three parts:

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.840
the foot, the fall, the pit.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.770
You could only begin to
understand what happened and why

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.520
if you understood those
three things.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.620
And Devin's talent, because that
had been there from the beginning.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.490
Maybe even before the beginning.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.960
In proud parent moments in which
there were too many to count,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.240
she and Eric would talk about
feeling Devin in the womb,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.830
her body arching and minnowing
and promising itself to them both.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.280
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: How
important is that first page?

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.580
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: So much.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.640
It's the part that gets written,
rewritten the most times.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.250
And sort of you know, in this case
weirdly the first line remained

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.550
the same.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.490
But most everything else
I just read changed.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.040
Even that foot, fall, pit thing
which becomes the structural device

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.860
for the first part of
the book came later.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.190
You know, the first page is really

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.920
when most readers decide
a lot of things.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.220
We all know it.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.520
I do it too.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.980
Sometimes it's because
you're in the bookstore

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.740
and you're looking
at the first page.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.570
Sometimes you get the sample on
your E-reader or whatever it is.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.530
You need to be grabbed.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.010
So I always wanted
to feel very intimate

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.350
and sort of like a confessional.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.340
So trying to sort of reach out
to the reader and you know,

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.780
"I need to tell you this thing."

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.540
You know. And that's always what
I'm going for in the first page.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.870
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Well it's
funny about the first page,

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.170
about sort of confessing.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.130
Yes, I go to the bookstore
and if you don't have me

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.420
at that first page, I'm probably
not going to buy that book.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.880
But I have a 12-year-old son and
the teachers tell the kids now,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.290
read the first few pages.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.590
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.890
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: I mean,
I think they're not saying,

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.190 position:56%
"If you don't like it, put it down."

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.020
They're saying, "If it's just
right for your reading level,

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.300
then this is something
you should buy."

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.600
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Right.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.070
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: But I think
in any form of entertainment,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.430
the first few notes of a song,
the first words of a book,

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.570
the first scene in a
movie are so important.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:08.510
And I was wondering
if it's something

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.880
that takes longer than
everything else.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.180
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: It is.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.770
I mean, you know it when
you're writing and you have it.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.070
Or you think you do.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.680
You think you have something
that is arresting in some way,

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.830
and it is a lot like the culture
of oversaturation, you know?

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.500
And peak TV and podcasts
and all these things.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.520
And I think we make a lot
of decisions all the time

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.150
about what we're going
to continue with.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.050
So you know, you want to
connect and you want it

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:38.480
to feel personal or intimate.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.760
And with a crime novel, obviously
you want to suggest in some way

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.720
that something's going to happen.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.540
Which is what separates
us from some other genres.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.840
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Right.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.140
Right, right.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: So I love them all.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.740
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair:
For You Will Know Me,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.770
where did the story idea come from,
the idea to focus on gymnasts?

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.070
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.370
It was a slow process.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.640
I was really interested in
prodigy families and I had read

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.360
that wonderful Andrew Solomon book
from a few years ago called Far

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:09.080
From the Tree, which is a
nonfiction book about the parents

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.440
of different kinds of
exceptional children.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.450
But prodigies, some
had a disability.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.470
Some had come into decline.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.070
There's this range of experiences.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:26.920
But how the families sort of dealt
with the child's issue or concern

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.500
or special talent,
and how power operated

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.990
in the family was really
interesting.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.720
And then I landed on gymnastics

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.810
because I was watching
the 2012 Olympics.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.580
And I will never forget it.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.470
It was the London one

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.960
and the gymnastics team
was fabulous of course.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.410
And Allie Reisman who was
also on the 2016 team,

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.110
her parents were watching
her perform

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.400
and there was this
famous viral footage.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.000
And they did this again in 2016

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.330 position:56%
where they were watching her do her
bar routine and they were both going

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.140
like this as her body would turn.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.440
And they would go like this,
and then they would go, "Oh!"

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.280
And then at the end when she
sort of nailed it, they stood up

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.850
and did this fist pump,
this Boston proud family.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.450
And I became so interested in
that kind of marriage, you know,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.040
when both parents are so invested.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.580
And that's how I sort of found
Katie and Eric in the book.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:25.260
I wanted to sort of explore
what that would be like.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.560
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.200
Well in many ways this book is
a lot about moms and parents

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.970
and how they deal with each
other and then they deal

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.010
with the community that they're in.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.470
And the ambitions of this
community and individuals.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.940
And it's kind of scary because
it does mirror some reality,

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.820
because you think, "Yes, I've been
to that soccer game with the moms

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.880 position:56%
who are far too invested, and dads."

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.540
But I am wondering, for you,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.290
the gymnastics world
-- were you a gymnast?

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.960
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah, I have
no athletic capacity at all.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.370
And it comes out in a
lot of books I write.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.770
I've written about cheerleaders.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:08.180
I had a hockey player in The Fever.

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.110
And I think this is my
other Freudian revelation,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.780
is that clearly I want
to be an athlete.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.080
And I'm working it out.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.990 position:56%
A 14-year-old Megan says, "Why can't
I be good at any of these sports?"

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:22.850
So when you're short and you
can't even do gymnastics -- so no.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:28.820
I think for me, anybody who sort
of has mastery of their body

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.130
in some way fascinated me.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.840
But gymnastics in particular
has this function

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.400
where they start training
so early, serious gymnasts,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.690
that it actually can sort
of stall their development.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:44.500
Puberty can be delayed.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:48.220
And that seemed fascinating
to me for a number of reasons.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.520
But not the least of which,
what it's like as a parent

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.410
to somehow be involved in something

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.790
that stops your daughter
from coming of age.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.010
You know, she doesn't
get her period.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:59.000
Most gymnasts don't
get their period --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.010
sorry for talking about
periods on a Saturday afternoon.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.070
But they don't hit their periods
till their 20's, you know?

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.430
Like everything is stopped and
their body develops differently

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:09.730
to accommodate it.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.290
And they don't want to get breasts

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.920
because it will affect
the physics of gymnastics.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:22.320
So that just like for a writer,
of course that's so exciting.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.200
For a person it's tragic.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.390
[ Laughter ]

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:28.690
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.940
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair:
And why crime fiction?

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.000
Why do you think you are so
drawn to writing crime novels?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.260
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah,
I think of that a lot.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.180
I mean, you know, some crime
writers are very much interested

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.100
in the procedural elements,
which I am as a reader,

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.580
but not as a reader
but not as a writer.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.010
Because my mind doesn't work.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.910
My books don't have
like a series of clues.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.280
I mean, there are clues sort of,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.760
but it's not like the Agatha
Christie you know, or Nancy Drew

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.300
or any of the sort of classic ones.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.320
But I do like sort
of people in crisis,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.820
how they handle it
and how they respond.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.070
And people kind of reckoning
with their own darkness,

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.860
or the darkness of those they love.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.100
That just endlessly fascinates me.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:15.820
So I was really the kid who --

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.730
and so many crime novelists I
know have had the same experience.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.630
But you know, you'd be in the
used book store and you're

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.340
like ten years old and
there's Helter-Skelter

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.860 position:56%
and you open the new one and look
at the pictures, which is grotesque.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.240
But you do.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.000 position:56%
There's a curiosity that you have
to get comfortable with it yourself.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.270
And also know what
its limits are too.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:42.670
So it doesn't become
indulgent or sensational.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:43.970
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.310
And then with your process, do
you come up with the crime first

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.160
and then build the world and
the characters around it?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.900
Or what's your --

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.300
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: It's usually the
character first and situation.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.750
Sometimes I have a crime and then
I'm trying to find the character.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:05.910
I'm trying to matchmake, and it
doesn't -- that's a little harder.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.600
Almost always it's have a
character and then I'm sort

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.900
of searching for a crime.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.050
And it's also a real-life
case, like The Fever

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:18.260
or in this case it wasn't a crime,
but a real-life inspiration.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.830
But I start with character.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.950
If I can't nail the
voice of the character,

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.070
then it's the wrong story.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.370
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.670
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: So
that has to be --

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.220
you know, I've had
many false starts.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.000
You know, every book
there's been two

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.190
or three false starts
before I find the one.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.490
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.620
I don't know how many
people know about The Fever,

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.970
that it really was
drawn from a true story.

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.120
If you want to talk
about that a little bit.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.420
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes, yes.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.270
Some of you may remember it, but
there was this famous case --

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.230
I think it was about
five years ago now.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.190
In upstate New York
these young girls,

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.680
all of them developed these
ticks, these motor ticks.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.910
And it sort of spread through the
school in this very small town.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.000
And it became sort of a phenomenon.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.020
And Aaron Brockavic arrived.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.380
They thought maybe
it was environmental.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.190
Other people thought there
was some kind of Lyme disease.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.150
There were all these
theories about it.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.180
And in the end it was
primarily diagnosed

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:23.340
as this psychogenic illness,
this kind of hysteria.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.470
So the symptoms were real, but it
came from a psychological place.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.870
So that just -- I mean
that just felt

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.470
like it was right in my wheelhouse.

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.780
It was calling to me,
"Write about me."

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.080
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.510
I mean, maybe it was planned,

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.670
because it was a Megan Abbott
novel in the making for sure.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:45.400
For sure. Tell me a little bit more
about your process and your day.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.700
When do you write?

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.310
What's the best time of
day for you to write?

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:50.610
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.510 position:56%
I have to sort of block out the day.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.530
So I tend to be most productive in
the morning, but I don't just sit

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.520
down and do my two hours.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.590
I'm not fast enough or
organized, a thinker enough.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.660
So I just basically write on and
off all day in these sort of spurts

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.900
between you know, the distraction.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.560
I mean now, the last eight
months or so there have been

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.860 position:56%
so many distractions with the world.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.540
You know, I talked to so
many writers across genre

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:24.340
that the distraction
of the news has been --

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.340
and sort of the need to follow
the news has made it harder.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.200
But I do try to block that out.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.720
And I have these spurts.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.090
In the last few years
I've done some TV writing.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.870
And that's a different motor.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.840
Like I can turn that on
at any time and plug in.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.720
It's much faster, because
it's not as interior.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.040 position:56%
So I'm really aware of how important
the novel writing process is for me,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.890
that I don't sort of just plug in.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.810
That I really like try to sit in
that world, imagine the characters

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.380
and just sort of --
it's sort of like going

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.390
into cold water stage
by stage by stage.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.710
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:10.540
I heard you say once that you
can't sort of have lunch and sort

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.850
of pull yourself away
from the atmosphere,

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.240
because then you're
completely derailed.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.540
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: It's true.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.690
People get annoyed and they
think I'm being suppressive.

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.360
Like, "Let's have lunch."

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.010
And I say, "Can we
have dinner instead?"

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.920
You know, because if we have
lunch, then I will sit at lunch

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.310 position:56%
and I will probably order a beer,
something I never would normally do,

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.940
because I know I don't
have to go back to work now

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.900
and I have the rest of the day off.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.720
I can't get in that head again,

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.970
because I'm in this
social head, you know?

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.620
And it's impossible to get back in.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.920
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.680
Are there real stories going
on in the world right now

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.430
that you're watching and
thinking, "That's my next novel"?

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.730
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.030
I have a few on my ticker now.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.550
I'm sort of following them.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.770
People now send me them all
the time, which is great.

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.780
There was -- I shouldn't
even say it,

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.130
because maybe I'll write about it.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.110
But there was this great case last
year of these twin yoga teachers

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.920
and one of them killed the
other one on a Hawaiian cliff.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.640
She drove the car off a cliff.

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.890
And then it turned out they had
this very weird relationship.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.470
And it's fascinating.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.090
And I think 30 or 40 people sent
me that article when it came out.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.970
[Laughs]. "You've got
to write about this."

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.390
Or the teenage girl who
texted her boyfriend

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:30.760
and then he killed himself,
which is a terrible store.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.970
And actually I wouldn't
write about that.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.540
You know, you make these decisions.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:43.480
That one felt very upsetting to
me and I didn't want to write it.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.800
But a lot of people
sent me that too.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.270
So in fact, another writer I know
actually emailed me yesterday

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.090
to say, "Are you going
to write about it?

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:55.390
Because I might."

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:56.690
That's a no-go.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:57.990
[Laughs].

00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:59.290
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Just
don't make it a hit.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:00.590
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: That's right.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.890
And I wouldn't -- you know,
these decisions we make about --

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:03.190
because you live when
you write a novel.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.490
It takes me a year and a half maybe

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:05.790
to write a novel, sometimes
a little more.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.250
And so you're living in
this space for a while.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.830
And there are certain spaces that
I just know I don't want to live

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:12.370
in for that long, you know.

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:14.150
It's too unpleasant.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:19.950
I don't have any copilots that feel
right, like with You Will Know Me,

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.250
there were characters I liked.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.450
And I knew I would be
comfortable with them.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:24.750
I like Katie.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:28.660
Once I figured out how I liked
her, I could go with her.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.960
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair:
Tell us about Katie.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.300
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Katie, she's -- I
was really resistant to doing kind

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.900
of a classic stage mom,
even though in some ways

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.040
from the outside she could
be viewed as a stage mom.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:45.860 position:56%
So I really wanted her to be someone
who had no plan for her daughter

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.530
to be anything but her daughter.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.370
But her daughter had
this special talent.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:51.670
And early on in the book --

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.990
very early so it's not a spoiler
-- but I won't go into it.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.570
There's something that happens
to Devin when she's a little girl

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:01.570
that increases Katie's worry for
her and protectiveness of her.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.870
And her wanting to make
everything right for her.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.190
And so I think she really thinks
she's doing the right thing

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.490
by Devin.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:11.790
In many ways she is.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.380
But I think it also can be, when
you're in these communities,

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.740
these sports communities
or music communities

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.620
or whatever the special
talent is, can be really hard

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.790 position:56%
to keep perspective because everyone
you know is also in that world.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.850 position:56%
And you have no barometer -- you
know, you have no way to measure it.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:31.080
And I think that Katie does
get a little lost in that.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:35.110
But I wanted it to feel that
she was coming from a good space

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.250
so that we would follow her there.

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:38.800
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: I
love when the mothers say

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.040
to her, "What's your secret?

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.430
You know, what are
you guys feeding her?

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:47.300
I'll feed my daughter so
she'll be just as successful.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.810
Yeah, I do think there's
some of that that goes on.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:56.970
The parents are thinking all they
have to do is tweak the appetite

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:00.660
or the schedule, and it's
really hard on kids I think.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.960
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: I think so too.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.190
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: The
parents' expectations can be very

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.540
debilitating for the kids.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:07.840
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Oh, so true.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.140
You know, it's almost
like they're talking

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.240 position:56%
about a horserace when they do that.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.540
What's the diet?

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:14.690
You know, this is our show horse.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:15.990
We're competing.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:20.100
But there's another part of
it that a lot of prodigies

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.220
or just very talented
young athletes,

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.190
they do want it very badly.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.050
And I think it's very
hard to tell them apart.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:28.530
And sometimes they
want it very badly.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.380
My brother was a very intense
baseball player as a kid.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.420
And my parents were very involved.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.310 position:56%
And we went to all the Little League
games and I was the kid sitting

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:41.570 position:56%
in the stands bored to tears because
the games would last forever.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.130
And my parents were
really motivated.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.780
And at a certain point he
lost interest, you know?

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.050
He was 14.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.770
Other things started to
seem interesting to him.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:58.840 position:56%
But luckily he felt comfortable
saying it and they felt fine I think

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:03.630
with not surrendering
yourself to baseball anymore.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:04.930
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: So you're Drew?

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.230
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: I'm Drew.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:07.640
There's a little brother.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:09.560
I am definitely Drew.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.470
Yes. I was the bookish one.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.860
My brother is really bookish too,
but he was a really good athlete

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.610
and I was never -- as stated,
I was never the athlete.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.910
I wanted to be.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:25.770
So I did see it from the outside
so I had a little more perspective.

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.800
The little brother in the book I
think is the only one in the family

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.790 position:56%
who really kind of sees what's going
on, even though he's quite young.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.850
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: I also
noticed that technology --

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:40.940
social media, which has so
revolutionized what it's

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.590
like to be a teenager right now.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.230
You don't engage in that a lot.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.620
And I'm wondering if as a
writer, if you grapple with that,

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.230
given that teenagers are
who you really like to --

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.530
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.830
I think about that a lot.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.010
It's sort of I got a
free pass with this

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:02.960
because Devin doesn't really have
friendships because she's so --

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.940
she doesn't have many
peer relationships.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.560
So that's not part
of her experience.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.210
It's somewhat a part of The Fever.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.280
But the book I wrote
before that, Dare Me,

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.870
which is about the
cheerleading squad --

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.670
if I wrote that now --
that came out in 2012.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.890
There's some texting
and social media in it.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:24.250
But if I wrote it now, I would have
to write it completely differently.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:29.490
Because it's become you know
-- so when I wrote it was 2010.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.140
So in the past eight years --
you know, every seven years --

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.550
it's become so much
a function of it.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:40.600
But there is something deadly about
reading text messages in a novel.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.380
You know? Because if your text
messages are anything like mine,

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.120
they are not very literary.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.930
And they are filled
with emojis and things

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:53.600
that you know -- that's
not why we read.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.900
On the other hand,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:59.430
if used effectively I
think they can be a tool,

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.660
the way we're so attached
to our phone now.

00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.390
And I'm addicted to my phone
as much as teenagers, right?

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.700
We all know it.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.540 position:56%
Your phone, you're so used to having
it in your hand or on your person,

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:10.920
you're always looking for it.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.100
You feel those false vibrations
that they say some of us feel.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.290
That can be useful in a crime novel
because of course it adds the sort

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:23.120 position:56%
of nerve-wracking element, you know.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.110
They've used it sometimes
in TV and movies too,

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.210
that jolt you know of the phone.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.260
This phone is like a living thing.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.100
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Because I
know you talk to teenagers a lot

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.410
as part of your research, right?

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.690
Talk to gymnasts or
cheerleaders or whoever.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.990
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.290
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Do you sense
that you're understanding them

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:44.650
as much as -- did you want
to understand teenagers

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.730 position:56%
since you were arrested in that age?

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.180
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.020
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Or is it now
becoming a real cultural shift

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.570
for what they're like?

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.870
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:55.170
Boy, that's a good question.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.470
I think there's certain eternals.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.770
There's certain things
I'm never going

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.070
to get, and I don't pretend to.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:03.640
And sometimes I'll go on
say Tumblr or something.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.950
Sometimes they'll be on Tumblr.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:11.180
It's a big teenage girl space,
or at least was as of last week.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.560
Because sometimes they'll
tag one of my books, right?

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.860
So I'll go there.

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.390
I don't even know what
I'm looking at, you know.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:21.840 position:56%
They do book trailers for your book.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.180 position:56%
You know, it's wild and these images
and there's this slang I don't know.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.450
And so I really do try to keep up.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.630
But there's a lot of stuff
that I do not have access to.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:34.900
On the other hand, there are
so many eternals, you know.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.030
The friendship element is the same.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:43.950
That sense of being on the
precipice and seeking more.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:48.620 position:56%
That sense of -- I think for teenage
girls now you have all this power

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.410
and no power at all.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.140
I think that's always there.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.590
So I try to in the books stick
to those things and not rely

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.050
on the more ephemeral elements.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:04.420
I've been developing my
novel Dare Me for TV.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.000
And I've had to keep changing
all the cultural references

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.570
with each stage of development, you
know, because it goes on forever.

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:11.870
So you're rewriting the script.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:15.600
Like I have to take this Rihanna
thing out because you know,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.960
that is no longer a
teenage thing, you know?

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.270
I mean, for some teenagers.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:24.120
But you know, the cultural
references just date immediately.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.250
And in a book you really don't want
to do that if you can avoid it.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.620
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.800
So you are writing
for HBO's The Deuce.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.100
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.400
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.700
And that's really exciting.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.000
I haven't seen it yet.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.300
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah,
it premiers next weekend.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.600
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.050
But as I understand it,
another great crime novelist,

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.850
George Pelecanos, who I adore --

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:45.150
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:46.450
DC proud!

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:47.750
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: DC.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.050
Go DC. In the house.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.440
How did it come about?

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.040
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: David
Simon is fairly local.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.040
Some of you may know The Wire.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.900
And George Pelecanos
developed the project together.

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.200
It's called The Deuce.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.920
It's set in 1970's Times Square.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.300
And it's about the birth
of the porn industry

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.820
in Times Square at that moment.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:19.280
And they were looking for crime
writers to add to the cast.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.450
There's crime elements in
the show, but I don't know.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.080
I think David Simon
and George Pelecanos --

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.640
well, George as a crime novelist --

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.500
they both tend to work
with crime novels.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.780
Richard Price is also
in the writers room.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.660
And Dennis Lehane of course
famously wrote on The Wire.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.330
And so they like to
have crime writers.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.330
And because of the
pornography subject,

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.320
I think they thought,
"We need some women."

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.630
[ Laughter ]

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.290
So I knew George pretty well
and I knew David a little bit

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.920
through his wife, the great
crime novelist Laura Litman.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.710
So they asked if I
would be interested.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:59.550 position:56%
And of course it was like -- you
know, between David Simon, Pelecanos

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.190
and Price it was like the
holy trinity of crime fiction.

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.760
So there was no way I
was going to say no.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.250
I would have done anything.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:10.620
I would have done it for free if
the Writers Guild would let me.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.180
Thankfully they didn't,
so I actually got paid.

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.260
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Well we have
15 minutes left and we'd love

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:22.940
to hear some questions
from people out there.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.490
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:27.790
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Hi.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.430
&gt;&gt; As a huge sports fan,
a graduate of Notre Dame,

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:34.730
a fellow Midwesterner, as also a
parent of a daughter and two sons

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.360
who all play competitive sports,
I really want to thank you

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.450
for really ripping the scab
off of the predatory nature

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.150
of specialized sports and youth.

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:47.730
I think it's really
gone way too far.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.850
I actually refuse to let any of
my kids do individualized sports,

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:52.790
because I said the only
value of sports is learning

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.130
to be a good team player.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:29:01.970 position:56%
And I was wondering if you
interviewed any gymnasts from Bella.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.990
Specifically any of the members
of the 2008 gymnastics team.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:10.410
Sports Illustrated did a huge
article and it was fascinating.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:14.280
None of those women will let any
of their daughters do gymnastics.

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.260
They say no way.

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.560
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.860
Thank you.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.160
Thank you so much for your
question and your kind words.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.010
This has been quite a
gymnastics scandal since the book.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.210
But it was already there.

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.710
You know, a lot of
gymnasts, so sort of coaches

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:32.840
who were predating on gymnasts.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.170
And it's sort of slowly
unfolded over a long time.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:40.800
And it was somehow covered up,
as all these stories usually are.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.430
And that was something
that came up a lot.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:48.130
Not in the interviews I did,
but in the sort of exposes

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.810
that had been written,
and the memoirs.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:52.710
A lot of former gymnasts
had written about it,

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.240
but nobody had really covered it.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.540
And nobody saw it

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.970
as an institutional problem
or a systemic problem.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:03.750
But I didn't interview any

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.910
of Bella's very famous
gymnastics coaches.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:10.590
And famously abusive -- not
sexually, but a mean guy.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.830
I didn't interview
any of his gymnasts.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.980
So I did interview a gymnast
whose sister had trained with him.

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.000
And I interviewed some gymnasts

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.270
who had had very intense
training experiences

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.420
and had been homeschooled,
which a lot of them are.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:31.090
And could really speak to a
lot of the weird body issues.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.960
But also it was a good balance,
because a lot of them spoke

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.430
to how wonderful the sport was
for them and what it did for them

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:41.170
in making them feel powerful
and strong at a young age.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.680
There are so many positives to it
that it makes it doubly a shame

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.760
when these other elements sort
of you know, take that away

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.670
from the kids doing it,
and from the parents

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:53.190
who are just enjoying
it and being supportive.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.010
So like anything, it
has a dark side.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.890
But gymnastics in particular
is a dark side.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:03.500
It's really reared
its ugly head of late.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.800
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Yeah.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.420
&gt;&gt; Hi. This is more
of a process question.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.620
You were saying how if somebody
wants you to take a break,

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.920
that you can't get back into it.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.760
But do you ever have times where
you're done writing for the day

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.540
but then an idea comes to you
and you're just like, "Oh,

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.370
I have to go back and
write this now"?

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:21.670
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes, yes.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:22.970
I do. Thankfully.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:24.270
Those are the best moments.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.940
You know, it's sort of
the news takes over.

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:30.700
Yes, it's often when I've
moved away from the computer.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.470
The ideas immediately come.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.960
You know, because I think we do
get stuck in our -- do you write?

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:39.030
If we stuck in our tunnels, and
I think it becomes very hard.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:43.240
I'll take a walk and I'll be
walking and I will like figure

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.090
out the whole plot problem or like
what the character needs to say.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.200
And often I'll do this.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.690
I used to write it down
in a little notebook.

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:52.990
I still have the notebook
in my purse.

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.470
But now I'll actually
send an email to myself.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:58.260
I'll like punch it out and.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.230
And I have this weird
thing that happens.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:05.340
Someone has an email address
exactly like mine, a Gmail address.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.730
And there's only one
difference in our address.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:11.370
And so occasionally she gets emails
that are supposed to be for me.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:16.100
Occasionally she gets emails that
I think I'm emailing to myself.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.190
[ Laughter ]

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:19.870
And sometimes they're really
violent and she gets it

00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:21.240
because she knows I'm
a crime novelist now.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:24.610 position:56%
But at first she was really
frightened because it would be like,

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:29.270
"She should take the
knife right now."

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.090
So we have a good relationship.

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:32.980
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.680
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: She does crew and
occasionally I get emails about --

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.200
she actually lives in DC.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.190
It would be great if
she were here today.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.490
Megan?

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.900
&gt;&gt; Hi. So you were talking
earlier about how sick you were

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.750
about this sort of reductive mean
girls stereotype when it comes

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:53.550
to the writing of teenage girls.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:57.970
How do you balance that so that
when you write them you're able

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.790
to make them sort of complex,

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.620
flawed people who make
questionable choices?

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.950
But people's take away isn't, "Wow,
teenage girls are really bitchy."

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.250
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Right.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.550
I mean, that's exactly it.

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:08.850
It's the tricky part.

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.900
I mean, I think part of
it is sort of like --

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.760
in crime fiction there's the
famous fem fatale character, right?

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.830
Who's the lethal lady.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.680
And I was always interested

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.140
when I read classic crime
fiction what the book would be

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.740
like if it were written
from their point of view.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.470
In which case everything
would be different, right?

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.970
And we would sympathize
with the fem fatale

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:33.250
and we would understand her motives
for making the guy kill her husband

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.550
or whatever she's making him do.

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:37.340
And I think it's a similar
thing with mean girls,

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.000
only they're much less lethal.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.250
But I really do try to view
things from their point of view.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.320
And I've always -- perhaps
this just speaks more

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.620
to my high school experience --

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.040
but it was always kind
of like a battlefield.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.740
And the strong survive.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:00.930
And there is a Lord of the
Flies element for a lot of us.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:05.810
And you know, in some ways the
armor the mean girls wear is

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.850
because of the circumstance
they're in.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.830
And girls can be really
hard on each other in ways

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.590
that are not obvious, you know.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:18.260
And they're not socialized to
express certain feelings, you know.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:21.990
Whereas boys may get in
a fistfight or something,

00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:23.490
but it's not the way
girls are supposed to be.

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:25.030
So it becomes very complicated.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.050
So I try to sort of put
all that into perspective.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:32.700
And usually what happens -- so in
my book Dare Me I have what people

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.800
often call my classic mean girl,

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.780
looking at that trope
and looking at my books.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.720
And her name is Beth.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.210
And she's my favorite character.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.780
And I grew to love her so
much by the end of the book,

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:48.210
even though I intended her to
be the antagonist in some way.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.960
But I actually changed
the whole plot

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.780
so that she would have a more
sympathetic place in the story.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:58.890
And I just grew to love her.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:04.180
So I try to really like view
that as my role, is to love them.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.480
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.060
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Even though
other people hate her.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.330
[ Laughter ]

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.460
&gt;&gt; I guess my question was
actually about Dare Me.

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:17.210
And this is kind of a spoiler
for the end of the book, but --

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:18.600
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: So
everyone close their ears

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.900
if they don't want a spoiler.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.660
&gt;&gt; So I guess I was just
wondering what your thinking was

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.720
about the fact that Beth and
the main character had this

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.380
like sexual relationship?

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:35.480
And in what sense do you
think that formed the rift?

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.780
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yeah.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:39.100
Yeah. That to me was always there.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:46.100
And it was just a question
of like when to reveal it.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.880
But I guess what we were
talking about before,

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.610
these intense female
friendships that often border

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:52.910
on romance and sometimes are.

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:57.670
And sometimes they're the space in
between and you don't really know.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:02.330
In some ways one of the things I
love most about the millennials is

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:07.980
that all these sort of strict
divisions that my generation had

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:12.690
in terms of gay, straight,
male, female, very --

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:14.650
like we knew what we were.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.150
But there was no space in between.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:21.400
It's really kind of
in large part gone.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.020
And I wanted the book to be
in that space where this --

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.680 position:56%
it definitely explained a lot of
the intensity of their relationship,

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.980
but it didn't define them.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:35.630
It wasn't meant to be this
is why this all happened.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:42.220
It was meant to show how
truly emotionally involved

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.440
with one another they
were and how deep it went.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.380
Does that make sense.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.440
&gt;&gt; So many of your early books
focused on this noir universe.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.740
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.940
&gt;&gt; And I'm curious if you
miss that universe at all.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.080
And also how that shaped
the way that you write

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.930
about you know, current day.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.230
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Yes, yes.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:03.050
My first four books are
all sort of historical,

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:06.600
more classic noir,
inspired by film noir.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:10.970
And sort of viewing the fem
fatale from the inside was sort

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:12.420 position:56%
of the way I approached those books.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.270
And I really love -- I
started writing those books

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:20.180
because I loved the mid
last century, you know,

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.830
30's, 40's, 50's America.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.130
And I do miss that.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.070
That's mostly what I have
done short stories in.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.910
It's sort of my outlet for it.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.640
But I do hope to go
back to it someday.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.950
I think the carryover
is that weirdly,

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.820
those noir novels are
at a very high pitch.

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.880
They're very baroque and big.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.960
And it was very easy to go

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.120
into writing teenage girl
world from that world.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.920 position:56%
It felt like it was a perfect match.

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:50.520
I didn't have to step down at all.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.150
And then it kind of
feels the same to me.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:57.290
The thing I miss is getting
to talk about the clothes

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:01.120
and the nightclubs
and the race tracks.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:04.310
That I miss.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.350
You know, suburban life
is not as compelling.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.660
So I try to give texture to that.

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:12.190
And that's kind of one way
how I know I'm into a book.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.490
Like the gym world.

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:18.670
Once I've pounded out sort of
the visceral stuff to hang onto

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:21.890
and the details of it
and the body stuff,

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.940
and that sort of is a
substitution for the great clothes.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.240
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair:
Well now we've got HBO.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.130
We've got the whole visual
porn industry I guess.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.430
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: That's right.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:30.730
That's right.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:32.030
That's right.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.330
&gt;&gt; Hi, Megan.

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:34.630
I loved You Will Know Me.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:35.930
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Thank you.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.230
&gt;&gt; Goodreads tells me you have
something coming out in 2018.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.840
And I just wondered if
you can give us any sense

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.320
of what we have to look forward to.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.620
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Oh, thank you.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.310
Yeah, I have a book coming out.

00:38:43.310 --> 00:38:45.430
I think it's going to be next July.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:48.070
It's called Give Me Your Hand.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.370
And it's about two
female scientists.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:56.410
I really became interested in
the role that women in science --

00:38:56.410 --> 00:39:00.310
still so much the minority
in so many of the sciences.

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:05.430
So very much a male
universe still by and large.

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:11.620
And so this is about two female
scientists who share a secret.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:15.290
And then lots of bad stuff happens.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:18.650
So I guess I sort of wanted

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.450
to do something a little
more Hitchcockian.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.370
So the lab is sort of
to me a fascinating

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.520
and creepy and beautiful space.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:31.810
So that was sort of the
inspiration behind that.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:33.660
And like for women working

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.770
in that world it becomes
a kind of sub-story.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:38.880
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: I think we
only have a couple of minutes.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.180
It goes fast.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.130 position:56%
But I do want to find out -- there's
a book that's always on your shelf

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.210
with the word psychic in the title.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.510
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Oh yes.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.040
There is. How to Defend
Yourself Against Psychic Attacks.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.900
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: This is the
book that's always on her shelf.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.910
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Which makes
me sound crazy in parting.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:57.970
But a friend of mine,
another crime novelist,

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:01.420
Sarah Graham gave me that book.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.080
Because we get very superstitious.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.170
Writers in general I think are
very superstitious, like athletes.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:11.100
And like good energy around a
book seemed really important.

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.690
And so she gave me this book
which is sort of to ward off --

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:19.390
and she also gave me a
voodoo sort of bag of charms

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:20.960
that her other friends
have given her.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.560
I also do prayer candles.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.860
It's crazy.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.160
It's crazy.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.400
But it's not that I do or don't
believe in psychic attacks.

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.610
But having the book there,
everything's gone okay

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.080
in my personal life, at
least in my writing life.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.380
It's gone okay.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:38.720
so I'm keeping the book
there until things turn.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.020
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Blair: Well,
Megan Abbott, thank you.

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.320
Thank you very much.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.620
&gt;&gt; Megan Abbott: Thank you.

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.920
Thank you so much.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.720
