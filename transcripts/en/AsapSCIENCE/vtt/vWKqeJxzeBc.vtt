00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:02.579
56 million abortions occur annually worldwide

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.500
And though opinions on the matter are strong,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.320
many are simply unaware of how they actually work

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.400
So, regardless of whether you're pro-life or pro-choice:

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.900
What actually happens during an abortion?

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.500
Abortion procedures range from taking a pill to surgical options

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.089
often based on availability or how far along a pregnancy is

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.600
And 92% of legal U.S. abortions take place within the first thirteen weeks of gestation

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.500
The oral tablet is effective 49 days from one's last menstrual period

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.200
Often containing mifepristone, it works by blocking the hormone progesterone

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.415
Progesterone promotes smooth muscle relaxation in the uterine wall throughout pregnancy

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:40.590
and so the pill causes the uterus to contract

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.709
and the embryo to be expelled in what seems like a heavy period

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.079
Vacuum aspiration is a surgical procedure

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.000
usually used up to 16 weeks after conception

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.680
and is typically performed under local or general anaesthesia

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.000
The cervix is numbed and opened wide enough to pass the Slender Tube into the uterus

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.600
where suction is used to empty the contents

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.529
Within the same time line, a D&amp;C or dilation and curettage abortion can be used

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.639
First, this cervix is dilated using small instruments or medication

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.200
and then a curette is used to remove the contents of the uterus

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.800
If your pregnancy is between 12 to 24 weeks,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.500
a D&amp;E or dilation and evacuation abortion is likely used

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.460
although only 1.2 percent of abortions occur after 21 weeks

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.650
In a D&amp;A abortion, the cervix needs to be dilated wider

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.801
often using osmotic dilators which are short rods made of seaweed or synthetic material

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.800
which absorb moisture and slowly stretch the cervix

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.660
These are usually inserted the day before surgery

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.000
Once dilated a fetal, aplacental tissue is removed at the evacuation of forceps and a curette

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The decision to have an abortion after 24 weeks is extremely rare and often due to severe fetal anomalies

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.500
When abortions are allowed by the local law, they are one of the safest procedures in medicine

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.000
with case fatality rates less than one death per 100,000 procedures

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.440
In the U.S., the risk of death associated with childbirth is 14 times higher in women than that of an abortion

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.800
There are also myths that abortion is linked to an increased risk of cancer as well as

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.060
difficulties in conceiving or carrying a future pregnancy

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.089
But both of these claims have been refuted by extensive medical research

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.102
However, unsafe abortions practiced by individuals without the necessary skills

00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:22.190
or in an environment that does not conform to medical standards

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.560
caused an estimated 68 thousand women to die yearly

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.859
while a further 5 million suffered temporary or permanent disability

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.700
Methods range from ingesting toxic solutions, inserting foreign bodies into the uterus and even trauma

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.000
The World Health Organisation has called unsafe abortions a 'preventable pandemic'

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.300
And laws that limit a woman's access to an abortion or make abortions illegal do not reduce the number of abortions

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.770
Countries where abortions are illegal have roughly the same number of abortions

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.300
What changes instead is the incidence of unsafe abortions

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.000
A 2011 study did find that state-level anti-abortion laws in Texas

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.240
correlated with lower abortion rates in the state

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.029
But these results did not account for women traveling to other states with less restrictive laws to receive a procedure

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.020
Conversely, researchers have found that sex education and access to contraceptive methods do reduce the number of abortions

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.000
by minimizing unwanted pregnancies

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.500
This can be seen in the abortion rates decreasing significantly in the developed world since 1990

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.120
Ultimately, access to legal abortions make women's lives safer and healthier

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.700
If you'd like to learn about plan B or emergency contraceptive

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.520
which is not the same thing as an abortion

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.200
