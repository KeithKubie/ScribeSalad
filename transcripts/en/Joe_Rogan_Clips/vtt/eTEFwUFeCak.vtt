1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.790
The Joe Rogan experience.
The vendors are out three hours long.

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.580
It's theirs.
I stayed awake.
I haven't seen it yet.
I stayed awake.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.810
I heard it's great.
Good enough to keep me awake.
That's,
that's uh,

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.310
at saying something from the,

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.570
I go to sleep off with time from the heart transplant.
Or You sleep here now?
No.

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:26.510
No.
I went to sleep all the time before the orange.
No,
I get comfortable.
Fuck.

7
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:30.640
And he's over me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's zero.

8
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.680
That's the thing too with people train a little body fucking with me.
Yeah.

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.120
They train a lot though.
You're always ready to take a nap.
Yeah.

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.440
Cause your body's always recovering.
Yeah.
I'm out,
man.

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.360
No problem.
Or overtraining is bullshit trainings.
Bullshit.

12
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.300
Oh,
I know you don't.

13
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:56.301
I think I picked you think that it's not bullshit and overtraining is very real,

14
00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:00.630
don't you?
Yes,
I do.
Yes.
I know who you would say that.
You know what?

15
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:05.040
Robbed on my Losa says,
uh,
no.
I have no ideas.
When you're overtraining,

16
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:07.920
your literally,
your muscles start breaking down to pollute your kidneys.

17
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.480
People die from it.
Wow.
That's a big ass long words.

18
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.740
And if you look in the dictionary,
it'll say boasts,

19
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.070
no dry pick beers under resting under recuperation.
That's true.

20
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.400
But a overtraining.
Now if you get enough rest and enough recuperation,

21
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.370
I think overtraining is right.

22
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:35.610
But if you have to work out hard and then you have to work out again the next

23
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.120
day and you work out hard the next day,
that's a,
that's rubbed on my losis piss.

24
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.470
When you get robbed,
doe you pissed?
Comes out looking like iced tea.
Yeah.

25
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.300
I don't mean the rapper.
[inaudible]

26
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.280
more than a rapper though.
Right?
It's hard to say.
He's a rapper.
Actor.
Yeah.

27
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.640
He's a cool dude.
Yeah.
I mean he had body count,
so that's a metal band.

28
00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:01.590
So he that too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
Cool.
Um,
but yeah,

29
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.450
it looks like diet coke piss looks like it's fucked up.
Yeah.
That's,

30
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:08.830
um,
that's what happens in that train.
Every,

31
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.550
I've worked fucking eight hours a day,
eight,
10,

32
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.190
12 hours a day at the post office.
Went to the gym,

33
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.240
put it in another four to six hours for fucking 25 years.

34
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:19.800
And My piss never looked like,

35
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.420
yeah.
I think that's more endurance athletes and uh,
particularly crossfit.

36
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.910
Lot of crossfit people get robbed.
Oh yeah.

37
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.480
There's a competing gets other people and they get real wrapped up in it.

38
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:36.930
And I got to ask Jason,
can we put out this good friend of mine?

39
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.320
See if he's pissed.
If it looks like root beer.
It's a real,

40
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.080
real issue for crossfitters and like ultra endurance athletes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

41
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.700
He's one of the top crossfitters kind of,
yeah.
He's like world champion.

42
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:51.480
Two or three times.

43
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.010
Guys are ridiculously Rediculus Lee fit and him in the,

44
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.980
in my gym and I put them through my training.
He was one of the,

45
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.880
he did this shit like 11.
Yeah.
He's fucking act,
gag,
cross fit.

46
00:03:04.881 --> 00:03:09.080
Neat and [inaudible] kind of laugh at crossfit or something like,
ah,

47
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.480
that's,
you know,
you know girly shit man.
It's boiled.

48
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.980
Crossfit is bullshit,

49
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.300
but that motherfucker is in extremely good shape.
Yeah.

50
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.950
Crossfitting is definitely not,
definitely not bullshit.

51
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.990
No.
It's very hard.
Yep.
What those guys do is very,
very,
very,

52
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:32.920
very hard.
Yeah.
The real question is whether or not it's good for your body.

53
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.690
And that's where,
um,

54
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.650
that's where I'm not qualified to judge,

55
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.540
but there's a lot of people that are professional strength and conditioning

56
00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.600
coaches to frown upon it because they think that those kinds of movements like

57
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.340
power lifting movements like clean press,
that kind of shit.
Yeah.

58
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.750
That should not be done for the maximum amount of repetitions.

59
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:55.630
I think that should be done for power then you should,
you know,

60
00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.100
you should holy stop your maximum or 85% of your maximum for x amount of times

61
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.680
and that's it.
But what they're trying to do is just,
you know,

62
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:07.570
if Mike does 10 I want to do 12 Mike does 12 I want to do 15 you know,

63
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:08.080
and they,

64
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.070
they think that there's like Steve Maxwell who's a pretty famous strength

65
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:14.470
conditioning coach,
he frowns upon it and he just thinks it's just,

66
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.200
those movements are not designed for endurance.

67
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.120
Those movements are designed for power.

68
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.220
He thinks ultimately it's detrimental for your body and that if you want to have

69
00:04:24.221 --> 00:04:28.390
a long career in fitness and constantly be able to work out like deep into your

70
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:33.310
50s and 60s he just thinks it's very detrimental for your body.
Again,

71
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:36.700
I'm not the guy to tell that's true or not true and me either.

72
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.640
I'm sure a lot of these,
I need to get one of those top level crossfit guys.

73
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:44.050
I know I've gone back and forth with rich Froning is that see online,

74
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.960
but I'd never got him on.
Oh yeah,
we'll reach out to him again.

75
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.310
I'm sure Jason would die to be on here,
but um,

76
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.660
he is exceptionally fit.
Ain't no,

77
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.830
they're longterm.
I don't know,
cause he's still a pretty young guy.
