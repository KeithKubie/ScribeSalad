ready to leave on a trip to Phoenix
Arizona and what was your first reaction

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489
 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.560
do you think this do you think the trip

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570
do you think this do you think the trip
 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.680
do you think this do you think the trip
to Phoenix is going to go ahead

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690
to Phoenix is going to go ahead
 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.639
to Phoenix is going to go ahead
well it's postponed there may be careful

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649
well it's postponed there may be careful
 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.930

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:15.639
 

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.450
because friends of mine repeatedly tell

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460
because friends of mine repeatedly tell
 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.940
because friends of mine repeatedly tell
me they think that they expect me to win

me they think that they expect me to win
 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.459
me they think that they expect me to win
it but I've always reflected that there

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469
it but I've always reflected that there
 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:35.919
it but I've always reflected that there
are so many worthy people who was the

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929
are so many worthy people who was the
 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.080
are so many worthy people who was the
first person you told after you after

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090
first person you told after you after
 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:54.609

the household I woke my wife up I just

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619
the household I woke my wife up I just
 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.260
the household I woke my wife up I just
wanted to ask you how just one question

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270
wanted to ask you how just one question
 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.480
wanted to ask you how just one question
because this is going to expose your

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490
because this is going to expose your
 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.889
because this is going to expose your
field of research to a very wide

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899
field of research to a very wide
 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.629
field of research to a very wide
audience who weren't previously been

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:01.639
audience who weren't previously been
 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.080
audience who weren't previously been
aware of it it's all to do with the

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090
aware of it it's all to do with the
 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.859
aware of it it's all to do with the
predictability of asset pricing how good

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869
predictability of asset pricing how good
 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.749
predictability of asset pricing how good
a handle do you think we have on that do

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759
a handle do you think we have on that do
 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.580
a handle do you think we have on that do
you think it's very much a work in

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590
you think it's very much a work in
 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.839
you think it's very much a work in
progress or have we got things pretty

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849
progress or have we got things pretty
 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.640
progress or have we got things pretty
well worked out

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650
 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.850
yeah well I could really say that it's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860
yeah well I could really say that it's
 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.640
yeah well I could really say that it's
it we've learned a lot about asset

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650
it we've learned a lot about asset
 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.160
it we've learned a lot about asset
pricing but there's a basic human

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170
pricing but there's a basic human
 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.479
pricing but there's a basic human
element in it that is irreducible so

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489
element in it that is irreducible so
 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.210
element in it that is irreducible so
predicting what assets prices will do is

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220
predicting what assets prices will do is
 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.509
predicting what assets prices will do is
partly similar to trying to predict what

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519
partly similar to trying to predict what
 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.300
partly similar to trying to predict what
one person will do and so it should

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310
one person will do and so it should
 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.580
one person will do and so it should
there ever be a science in predicting

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590
there ever be a science in predicting
 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.710
there ever be a science in predicting
what you will be doing no because

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
what you will be doing no because
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.770
what you will be doing no because
there's an irreducible human element and

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780
there's an irreducible human element and
 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.069
there's an irreducible human element and
that's part of the reason why the the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079
that's part of the reason why the the
 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.660
that's part of the reason why the the
field of Finance will never completely

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670
field of Finance will never completely
 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.839
field of Finance will never completely
understand a bit frightning movement

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849
understand a bit frightning movement
 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.229
understand a bit frightning movement
that was a lovely very understandable

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239
that was a lovely very understandable
 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.589
that was a lovely very understandable
comment thank you very much indeed

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599
comment thank you very much indeed
 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.960
comment thank you very much indeed
ok so I look forward to talking again at

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970
ok so I look forward to talking again at
 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.080
ok so I look forward to talking again at
length later in the autumn but for now

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090
length later in the autumn but for now
 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.970
length later in the autumn but for now
