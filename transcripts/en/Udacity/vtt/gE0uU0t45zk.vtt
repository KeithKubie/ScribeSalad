00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.570
All right so I just written
out our equation for Q' and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.570
substituted in the definitions
that we think are true.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.870
What the new Q' is in
terms of the old Q and

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.440
what the new rewards are in
terms of the old rewards.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.810
And so if this works.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.040
If we can do a bunch of if and only ifs
that actually bring us to something that

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.450
we know is true then we should be good.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.740
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.180
&gt;&gt; All right how can we,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.810
we do have an equation for Q.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.920
We don't have an equation for
Q minus psi of s.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.330
But maybe we can cancel some things?

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.590
&gt;&gt; Oh,
I can see two things we can cancel.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.270
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.020
&gt;&gt; Okay, so the first psi of s on
the left side of the equals sign?

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.590
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.190
&gt;&gt; That matches up with the first
psi of s right next to r.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.200
Yes, right there.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.940
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because we're summing this
over all next states, all next S'.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.380
And this sums up to 1,
it's a convex combination.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.430
&gt;&gt; Right, so that means,
effectively you could take it out.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.820
It doesn't depend on S' anyway.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.810
And they go away.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.050
Good, so now we got Q(s,a) on one side.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.840
And then you can actually
handle the next one.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.860
If you look at the next psi of S'.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.670
The gamma of psi S'.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.670
Well that matches with
the minus gamma of S'

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.470
inside the max because that
max is multiplied by a gamma.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.100
&gt;&gt; Good.
Right.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.680
Right, right, right.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.810
Yeah, so it's interesting.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.870
And the max itself is not impacted
by this quantity because it doesn't

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.060
depend on a prime.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.100
It is in fact a constant.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.420
&gt;&gt; So
we can actually take out this constant.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.910
And it actually cancels this one.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.080
And look what we're left with.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.130
&gt;&gt; The original equation.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.760
&gt;&gt; Ta da.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.250
We're left with the original Q equation,
which we know is true and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.830
so this is true if and
only if the original thing is true.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.280
This is an actual solution
to the Q equation.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.920
The Bellman equation and so, right,
this is what happens to the q function.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.330
It's the old q function shifted
down by the potential function.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.891
&gt;&gt; Right.
And at no point do we divide by zero, so

00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:49.676
everything is great.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:50.440
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.840
And how do we know that we still
have the same optimal policy?

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.890
&gt;&gt; In which case?

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.880
So we know we have some optimal
policy for this Q function.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.510
This new Q function Q prime
has an optimal policy.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.480
How do we know it's the same?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.320
&gt;&gt; Well because it's just
the original Q function and

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.180
you're just being shifted
around by a constant and so

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.700
it doesn't change the max and therefore
it doesn't change the optimal policy.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.278
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:14.640
Awesome.
All right, so this now gives us

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.400
three total different ways of
messing around with rewards

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.940
to give us new q functions that
don't actually change the policy.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.600
&gt;&gt; That's really nice.
So, I have a question.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.240
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; You didn't

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.590
write anything down here about any
restrictions on the potential function.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.640
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; Does there have to be any

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.630
restrictions on the potential functions?

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.260
Maybe potential
restrictions potentially?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.630
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm going to say no because
it is all going to end up being okay and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.540
cancelling out.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.140
So, there is a sense that
you've actually not changed

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.570
anything by throwing in one of these
additional potential functions.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.770
Maybe it can help us learn faster?

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.620
Here, let's look at an example
where this might matter.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.
