00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.360
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.010
Let's talk a little bit
about backgrounds again,

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.690
but this time we'll see
how you can digitally

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.680
change the background.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.250
Now, if you remember
from previous tutorials,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.920
we discussed collecting
interesting backgrounds

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.190
to use while making the
images, whether you're

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.830
working with the flatbed
scanner or a camera.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.530
But sometimes we're
in a bit of a rush,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.370
as I was while making this
initial image of these two

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.430
paper devices.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.010
At the time, I didn't think
about enhancing the image

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.960
by including an
interesting background,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.170
maybe to pop out the
devices visually.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.720
So after I made the image
on the flatbed scanner,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.940
this is what we got.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.830
And as we zoom in,
we see a problem.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.990
A bit of a mess with all
sorts of stuff all over it.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.530
That's the price I pay
for being in a hurry

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.170
and not cleaning
the glass that day.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.000
Hint, hint.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.960
So because of the
presence of all

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.500
of this extraneous
material, we can't simply

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.510
select the background with,
let's say, the Magic Wand,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.930
and fill in that selected
area with the color.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.090
The algorithm for
that selection tool

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.090
will not select the dirty spots.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.600
And the Paint Bucket
won't do it either.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.270
You see here that the Paint
Bucket filling the background

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.930
will not fill in the
dirty bits either.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.670
So that's not going to work.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.630
Let's undo that
with Command-Z. What

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.320
I'm going to wind up doing, if I
want to change this background,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.150
is to do it in a different way.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.120
Let me show you how.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.370
We're going to try.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.140
OK.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.449
I'll use the Polygonal Lasso.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:13.560
And I'll enlarge this
again and move it over.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.930
Watch how I select
what is initially

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.930
going to be selecting
just the two devices.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.480
This will take a bit,
so we can speed up

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.800
the video a little
bit, not to bore

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.290
you too much-- although a little
boredom is good for the soul.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.060
OK.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.140
I'm getting there.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.980
Almost there.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.480
OK.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.770
Here we go.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.350
So what's going on is that I
selected, in fact, actually

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.280
a couple of things.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.450
If you really think about it,
yes, I selected the devices,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.160
but if you go to the
inverse of the selection,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.690
that means it will invert
the selection to everything

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.740
other than the devices, which
means the full background.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.770
Now that I'm completely
selecting the full background,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.930
I'm going to fill
it with the color

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.100
that I previously selected.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.190
It's shown as the
foreground color at 100%.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.720
And here we go.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.710
And the background is filled.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.050
Now I want to show you
a little extra which

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.200
I think is worth thinking about.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.230
I'm going to once again
go to the selection menu

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.840
and invert the
selection once again, so

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.920
that we are, in fact, back
to selecting the devices.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.570
I'm going to open up the
Layers window because I'm

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.520
going to show you that we're
working just, at this point,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.661
with one layer.

00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:47.160
OK.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.910
Here we go.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.180
Here's the Layers window.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.020
So remember, I first
selected this, inverted

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.100
the selection, which
selected the background,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.370
and inverted it back again
to select the devices,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.200
so we are back to
selecting the devices.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.420
I'm now going to make a
layer of these devices

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.930
by copying it-- that's
Command-C-- which has just

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.660
copied the selected
devices, and then Command-B,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.670
which has pasted
what I just copied,

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.140
creating basically another
layer of just the devices.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.550
You can't see that
because the copy layer

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.870
is identical to the devices in
the original background image.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.850
Now what I'm going to do
is something I think is fun

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.300
and I think helpful
to the image.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.330
I'm going to go to
Layers, then Layer Style.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.550
Now remember, we're
talking about what

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.380
is labeled here as Layer One.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.390
I'm going to create a
drop shadow, which I like.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.890
You can play around with
the various qualities,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.500
like angle of the
shadow, distance

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.470
of the shadow, the
spread, the size,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.860
but watch as I change these
particular characteristics.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.810
What you're seeing
here is a drop shadow.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.310
OK.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.580
I'm going to say OK.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.680
I'm going to zoom
in a little bit

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.630
to show you what
we've done-- created

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.760
the shadow in that layer only.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.580
I'm going to make this new
layer invisible to show

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.510
you the difference.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.000
Here is how the background,
the original image,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.980
looks on its own, and here
it is with the drop shadow.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.050
So for me this looks
a little bit more

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.940
like the initial image with
its own shadows on the flatbed.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.230
One more thing.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.440
I'm going to convert the image
into a more horizontal image.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.520
Sometimes you want
to add more space,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.620
either making it more
vertical or horizontal,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.510
to fit it for a certain format.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.660
So the color with which we
want to extend the image

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.380
is this color.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.460
That needs to be in
the background box

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.511
when we increase canvas size.

00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:10.010
OK.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.180
I'm going to go to the image.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.260
Canvas Size.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.220
And here, I think
this might work.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.270
And if it doesn't, we
can add a little more

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.880
to change the width,
making the image longer.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.980
Let's just go, let's make it 15.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.590
So the algorithm will divide
the additional five inches

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.000
on both sides of the
image, keeping in mind

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.830
that the original
image is placed

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.210
in the center of that process.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.120
And here is the revamped image.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.600
It gives us a little
more space on both sides.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.270
So the last thing
I'm going to show you

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.080
is just a little
bit of labeling.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.030
So I'd like to insert
a label indicating

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.320
that this area from here
to there is a centimeter.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.040
But before we do that,
we still have two layers.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.530
So let's flatten the
image, so there, we're

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.650
only working with one layer.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.750
As you see, there's only
one in the window now.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.150
I'm going to take our
line, trying it in white.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.940
You can try in black or
whatever color you want.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.930
OK, that's not bad.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.660
Let me undo this.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.580
That's Command-Z. I want the
lines to be a little closer

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.980
to the area that I'm
connecting it to.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.010
There's one.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.420
There's another.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.800
It's OK.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.080
We're going to add
some text, which

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.230
I think I'm also going
to make in white.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.590
And I'm going to label
it, let's say 1cm.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.250
And then-- that's too small.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:55.040
Let's see, it's 18
using your style.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.840
Let's go to 24 points
and see how that looks.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.870
Almost there.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:07.010
I'll go back to move
it a little bit.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.260
That should do it.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.420
Yeah.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.290
I like it.
