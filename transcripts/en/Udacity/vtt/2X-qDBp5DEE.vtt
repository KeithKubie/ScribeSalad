00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.100
Okay, hopefully you didn't find that too hard.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.080
Let's take the name in order. Deoxy here

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.160
deoxy, what do you think that means? Is

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.010
probably missing an oxygen. So the deoxy part

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.220
of a name for DNA describes this part

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.810
of the chemistry. The next part, ribo, indicates

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.590
that there's a ribose sugar as part of

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.120
the deoxy nucleotide. This is the sugar molecule

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.590
called a ribose sugar. So that's what

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.100
the ribo represents in the name. Nucleic was

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.070
probably the toughest one if you couldn't figure

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.900
it out. Actually represents the nitrogenous base here

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.430
or the nucleic acid. This means that it's

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.480
found in the nucleus. And then the last

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.160
bit, actually over here, the acid Is an

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.440
artifact from this, what we call a phosphate

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.710
group right here. Under some conditions when

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.520
DNA was first isolated, it actually had acidic

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.840
properties, and it is because of the nature of this group right here. So you can

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.050
see that the name, deoxyribonucleic acid, which

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.770
is the long form for the abbreviation DNA

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.270
Actually, it's just describing the chemistry of missing

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.720
an oxygen, being part of a ribose sugar,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.960
containing a nitrogenous base, that can be found in the nucleus.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.360
And, also containing a group that can be acidic under certain conditions.
