00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.969
Now you may not have heard the term constant function before,

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.784
but intuitively we think that this is a function that has a constant value, at all values of the input.

00:00:08.784 --> 00:00:16.064
That's what graph A is.
It's of the form y equals some constant, c, let's say.

00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:19.885
Actually in this case it looks more like 3,
so we'll just write that.

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:23.230
Linear functions you recognize.
It's graph C right here.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.150
The quadratic function is the parabola, graph F.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.741
The absolute value function, which you saw in a problem set earlier in the course, is graph B.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.391
The cubic function is graph D.

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:42.110
And the square root function is graph E. 
Now you may not have seen this graph before either.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.064
But as always, you can test points picking values of x

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:49.494
and then plugging them into the function to figure what the y coordinate should be.

00:00:49.494 --> 00:00:53.565
The graph of this function is
y equals the square root of x.

00:00:53.565 --> 00:00:57.667
So if x equals 0, y equals 0.
If x equals 1, y equals 1.

00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:06.415
And we can see that moving further over,
if x equals 5, y equals just over 2.
