by side stuff like this too and it's
it's<00:07:59.870><c> tricky</c><00:08:00.290><c> so</c><00:08:00.620><c> I</c><00:08:00.650><c> mean</c><00:08:01.100><c> the</c><00:08:01.220><c> fact</c><00:08:01.400><c> that</c><00:08:01.610><c> they</c>

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's tricky so I mean the fact that they
 

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.550 align:start position:0%
it's tricky so I mean the fact that they
got<00:08:01.970><c> it</c><00:08:02.150><c> down</c><00:08:02.270><c> that</c><00:08:02.540><c> well</c><00:08:02.720><c> is</c><00:08:03.170><c> really</c>

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:03.560 align:start position:0%
got it down that well is really
 

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.610 align:start position:0%
got it down that well is really
something<00:08:03.800><c> to</c><00:08:03.830><c> be</c><00:08:03.950><c> admired</c><00:08:05.230><c> but</c><00:08:06.230><c> the</c><00:08:06.410><c> other</c>

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:06.620 align:start position:0%
something to be admired but the other

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:08.600 align:start position:0%
thing in my opinion is I think they did
 

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.740 align:start position:0%
thing in my opinion is I think they did
to<00:08:08.780><c> show</c><00:08:09.160><c> you</c><00:08:10.160><c> know</c><00:08:10.250><c> this</c><00:08:10.700><c> isn't</c><00:08:11.060><c> an</c><00:08:11.150><c> act</c><00:08:11.360><c> this</c>
