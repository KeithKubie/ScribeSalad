00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.726
- [Instructor] We're told that Polygon Q

00:00:02.726 --> 00:00:05.640
is a scaled copy of Polygon P

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.195
using a scale factor of one half.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:13.362
Polygon Q's area is what
fraction of Polygon P's area?

00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:19.913
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:22.983
Alright, my brain wants to
make this a little bit tangible

00:00:22.983 --> 00:00:24.571
and once we get some
practice, you might be able

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:26.520
to do it without drawing pictures

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.641
but they're saying some
arbitrary Polygon Q and P

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.017
so let's just make a simple one.

00:00:31.017 --> 00:00:32.824
Since we're talking about
area, I like to deal

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.279
with rectangles since it's easy to think

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:37.195
about areas of rectangles.

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:40.279
And so, let's see, Polygon Q
is a scaled copy of Polygon P.

00:00:40.279 --> 00:00:42.555
So let's start with Polygon P.

00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:44.695
And I will do this in red.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:47.790
So Polygon P, let's just say,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.677
I'm just gonna create
an arbitrary polygon.

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:52.242
So let's say that this is,

00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:53.574
and I'm gonna scale it by one half

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.549
so I'm gonna make its sides
have nice even numbers.

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:59.282
So let's say this side
right over here is four

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:02.962
and this side right over
here is equal to eight,

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.161
this is Polygon P right over
here, it's a quadrilateral,

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:07.453
it's in fact a rectangle

00:01:07.453 --> 00:01:11.954
and its area is just going
to be four times eight

00:01:11.954 --> 00:01:13.743
which is 32.

00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:16.962
Now let's create Polygon Q, and remember,

00:01:16.962 --> 00:01:19.725
Polygon Q is a scaled copy of P

00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:21.969
using a scale factor of one half.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.612
So we're gonna scale it by one half.

00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:29.272
So instead of this side being
four, it's going to be two

00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:32.191
and instead of this side
over here being eight,

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.496
the corresponding side
in the scaled version

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:36.689
is going to be four.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.997
So there you go, we've
scaled it by one half,

00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:41.413
and now what is our area going to be?

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:44.268
Well our area, and this Polygon Q,

00:01:44.268 --> 00:01:47.917
and so our area is going
to be two times four

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.181
which is equal to eight.

00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:53.931
So notice that Polygon
Q's area is one fourth

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:58.604
of Polygon P's area and that makes sense

00:01:58.604 --> 00:02:01.609
because when you scale the dimensions

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:05.836
of the Polygon by one half,
the area is going to change

00:02:05.836 --> 00:02:07.427
by the square of that.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:10.042
One half squared is one fourth

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:13.110
and so the area has been changed
by a factor of one fourth

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.686
or another way to answer this question,

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:18.973
Polygon Q's area is what
fraction of Polygon P's area?

00:02:18.973 --> 00:02:23.140
Well it's going to be one
fourth of Polygon P's area.

00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:27.852
And the big takeaway here
is if you scale something,

00:02:27.852 --> 00:02:32.107
if you scale the sides of
a figure by one half each,

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:36.393
then the area is going
to be the square of that

00:02:36.393 --> 00:02:39.810
and so one half squared is one over four.

00:02:41.067 --> 00:02:42.608
If it was scaled by one third,

00:02:42.608 --> 00:02:45.932
then the area would be scaled, or the area

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.264
would be one ninth.

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:49.702
If it was scaled by a factor of two,

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:54.123
then our area would have
grown by a factor of four.

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:57.039
Let's do another example.

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.763
Here we're told, Rectangle N has an area

00:03:00.763 --> 00:03:02.877
of five square units.

00:03:02.877 --> 00:03:04.633
Let me do this in a different color.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:08.626
So Rectangle N has an
area of five square units.

00:03:08.626 --> 00:03:11.625
James drew a scaled version of Rectangle N

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:13.442
and labeled it Rectangle P.

00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:14.934
So they have that right over here.

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:17.882
This is a scaled version of Rectangle N.

00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:20.004
What scale factor did James use

00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:23.863
to go from Rectangle N to Rectangle P?

00:03:23.863 --> 00:03:24.779
So let's think about it.

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.581
They gave us Rectangle P right over here,

00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:30.360
and let's think about its dimensions.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.250
This height is one,
two, three, four, five,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.318
it's five high, and it
is, one, two, three,

00:03:37.318 --> 00:03:41.503
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine wide,

00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:44.086
and so its area is equal to 45.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.806
Now, Rectangle N had an
area of five square units.

00:03:54.404 --> 00:03:57.167
So our area, let me write this down,

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:58.834
so N area to P area,

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.987
N area to P area, we are
multiplying by a factor of nine.

00:04:09.094 --> 00:04:10.975
If we're going from an
area of five square units

00:04:10.975 --> 00:04:14.808
to 45 square units, you
notice N area is five,

00:04:16.773 --> 00:04:20.897
N's area is five square units, P's area,

00:04:20.897 --> 00:04:23.263
we just figured out is 45 square units,

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:27.717
and so we have it growing
by a factor of nine.

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:30.277
Now what would be the
scale factor if our area

00:04:30.277 --> 00:04:32.138
grew by a factor of nine?

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:36.305
Well we just talked about
the idea that area will grow,

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:39.481
the factor with which area grows

00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:41.838
is the square of the scale factor.

00:04:41.838 --> 00:04:45.272
So one way to think
about it is scale factor,

00:04:45.272 --> 00:04:46.939
scale factor squared

00:04:49.303 --> 00:04:51.323
is going to be equal to nine,

00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:52.286
or another way to think about it,

00:04:52.286 --> 00:04:56.119
our scale factor is going
to be equal to three

00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:01.134
to go from N to P.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.857
Now let's verify that we
answered their question

00:05:03.857 --> 00:05:05.728
but I just want us to feel good about it.

00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:10.114
Let's draw a rectangle
that is scaled down from P

00:05:10.114 --> 00:05:12.005
by a factor of three.

00:05:12.005 --> 00:05:13.753
So a rectangle if we were to scale it up

00:05:13.753 --> 00:05:16.738
by a factor of three, we get rectangle P.

00:05:16.738 --> 00:05:20.905
So its bottom would have
length three instead of nine.

00:05:21.912 --> 00:05:23.749
So it'd be like this.

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:26.260
So that would be three, and its height

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.194
instead of being five,
it would be five thirds.

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:31.115
Five thirds is one and two thirds,

00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:33.153
so it'd go about that high,

00:05:33.153 --> 00:05:34.639
it would look something like that.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.639
It would be five thirds.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.337
And so our Rectangle N

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:43.692
would look like this,
and what is its area?

00:05:43.692 --> 00:05:46.841
Well five thirds times three
is indeed five square units.

00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:50.792
So notice, when we have the area growing

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:54.545
by a factor of nine, the
scale factor of the size

00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:58.289
to go from five thirds to
five, you multiply by three.

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.289
To go from three to nine,
you multiply by three.
