[music]

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.750
Narrator:
Open spaces are natural areas

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:40.750 position:97%
Narrator:
where development has been set aside. Sometimes known as "green space," an open space could be a forest,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.750
Narrator:
wetland, park or pond.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.000 position:98%
Narrator:
Dedicated nonprofit groups, like Friends of Princeton Open Space,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000 position:97%
Narrator:
are striving to conserve these natural areas in our communities.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.770 position:97%
Steve Hiltner:
My name is Steve Hiltner. I'm natural resources manager for Friends of Princeton Open Space.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.000 position:98%
Steve Hiltner:
There's a lot of ecological services rendered through open space.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000 position:98%
Steve Hiltner:
Well, a big part of it is clean water. The water that runs off this land is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000 position:97%
Steve Hiltner:
essentially going to be our water supply, our drinking water, x-number of weeks later.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000 position:97%
Steve Hiltner:
So, it's really important that the water that's running into these streams is clean.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000 position:98%
Narrator:
The waters that flow through these lands support a vibrant ecosystem.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.000 position:97%
Steve Hiltner:
Biodiversity is having as many different species that have evolved in this area,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000 position:98%
Steve Hiltner:
and the more different kinds of species you have living in balance with each other,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.300 position:73%
Steve Hiltner:
the stronger the ecosystem, the more resilient.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.500 position:86%
Narrator:
These various species live in balance with one another.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.500 position:98%
Steve Hiltner:
Of course, you have all the insect life that depends on the native plants, and then the birds depend on

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.500 position:98%
Steve Hiltner:
those insects for survival, so there's this whole food chain that the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500
Steve Hiltner:
open space provides a basis for.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.000 position:63%
Narrator:
But these ecological havens are at risk.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000 position:98%
Steve Hiltner:
Through climate change and through habitat loss and so forth, fragmentation of habitat,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000 position:98%
Steve Hiltner:
you're essentially removing species one at a time, taking them out of the ecosystem

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000 position:75%
Steve Hiltner:
and making it ever more unstable and vulnerable.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.200 position:98%
Narrator:
Although open spaces are facing ever-greater threats from human development, human action

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.200 position:97%
Narrator:
can also reverse this trend. We can all conserve open space by getting involved.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:59.000 position:98%
Narrator:
Spread awareness of the value of natural areas. Take a walk, hike, jog or just connect with nature.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:17.300
