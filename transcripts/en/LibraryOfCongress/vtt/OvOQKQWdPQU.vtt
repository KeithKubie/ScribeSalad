00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.550
I want to welcome
you to today's Topics

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.350
in Preservation Series
talk by Elham Bakhtary,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.490
"Tracking the Provenance of
Printing in Afghanistan."

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.560
Elham was the 2016, '17
CLIR Mellon fellow here

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.950
in the Preservation Research
and Testing Division.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.730
And this is [inaudible]
here from CLIR with us.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.050
And this is a program, a
doctoral fellowship program

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.150
that we are just
delighted to be involved in.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.450
It means we get to
really see people,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600
up-and-coming people
with new research.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.090
And it means that they get to
use any of the instrumentation

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.800
in our lab to look at original
materials within the library.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.600
So it's been for us all
a fascinating journey

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.120
as we learn more
about collections

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.420
that we didn't know about.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.100
So I'm going to hand over
to Elham to talk about some

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.400
of his research today.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700
Thank you.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.340
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: Oh, man.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.450
Yeah, sorry about that.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.470
I just want to give some
brief acknowledgment.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.040
I want to thank the
Council on Library

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.340
and Information Resources for
making all of this possible.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.070
And giving me the
opportunity to work

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.510
with the Preservation
Research and Testing Division

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.810
of the Library of Congress.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.480
And I want to extend a warm
thank you to everyone in PRTD.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.110
Not every single member of
PRTD worked on this project,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.590
but everyone offered
their assistance.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.430
And so I want to give a
special thank you to Fenella

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.690
for approving and
overseeing this project.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.850
Also to Amanda Jones,
Megan Wilson

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.550
and Chris Bolser [assumed
spellings] for being

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.240
with me every step of
the way in this project.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.960
And also to Jasmine
Hahn in conservation

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.520
for giving constant advice.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.230
And also Stephanie Stillo
[assumed spelling] as well

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.170
from the Rosenwald Collection
for being a great advisor

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.740
as well through some tough
times and doubtful moments.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.540
But thank you for helping
me get through this as well.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.970
And also just to recognize
the Library of Congress

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.340
as an incredible institution
that helps with some

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.640
of these challenging issues.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.510
Like the history of
print in Afghanistan.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.120
Which began in the reign of
this fearsome looking gentlemen.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.340
This is Amir Shayr Ali Khan.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.900
This came from an issue
of a London paper called

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.030
"The Graphic" in
November of 1878,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.130
immediately after the
British invaded Afghanistan

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.620
to dethrone Amir Shayr Ali Khan.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.950
They feared that he was creating
an alliance with the Russians.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.250
And that the Russians

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.530
in the future could potentially
use Afghanistan as a base

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.180
from which to attack
British India.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.950
And so they invaded him
and dethroned him in 1878.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.240
He died actually trying to
escape to Russia in the process.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.070
When they invaded Afghanistan,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.060
the British shelled
the Amir's fortress

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.270
where the first printing
press was housed.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.950
And the printing house
caught on fire and all

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.960
of its materials were burned.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.780
And it was subsequently
looted as well.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.760
So we actually have
very, very few materials

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.150
from this time period left.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.730
But thanks to the
diligence of the Library

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.670
of Congress we have some of
these materials available to us.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.980
And I know this doesn't
look like a very long list.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.470
But this is actually a
really large percentage

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.310
of the materials that are known
to exist from this time period.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.490
The first work of "Hujjat-i
qaviyah dar ibtal-i aqayid-i

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.530
Vahhabiyah-i ghaviyah" means
Conclusive Argument Invalidating

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.170
the Misleading Wahabbi Creed.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.760
This was a heresiography
targeting Wahabbis.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.730
"Shams al-Nahar,"
Afghanistan's first newspaper.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.480
"Shams al-Nahar" meaning
"The Morning Sun."

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.380
The library has two original
issues of "Shams al-Nahar."

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.010
And "Tuhfat al-Ulama," which
means a "Gift to the Ulama."

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.060
Now the first item,
as the title suggests,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.490
is a heresiography
condemning Wahabbis.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.730
The second two I would describe
as mirrors for subjects.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.150
Meaning that they instruct
subjects, including the ulama

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.550
on how to behave
as good Muslims.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.900
And in this talk I
will suggest that,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.100
although the Amir's court
initially used propaganda

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.060
to attack the Wahabbis,
it was the Wahabbis

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.520
that inspired these
latter forms of propaganda

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.350
in both form and substance.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.850
And through my research with
PRTD, I will also propose

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.060
that the amir of Kabul not only
shared a common market of ideas

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.260
with the Wahabbis, but
also a common market

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.310
of printing materials
with them as well.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.040
So I want to give a brief
survey of the history

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.050
of print during Amir
Shayr Ali Kahn's reign.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.870
According to colonial
records in 1869,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.250
he starts using a
lithographic press explicitly

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.660
for the purpose of
printing stamps.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.070
On the left you have an
image of a lithographic press

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.640
from around this time period.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.040
And on the right you
have an image of a stamp

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.080
of Amir Shayr Ali Kahn.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.640
That image in the
middle is of lion.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.480
That was the symbol of Amir
Shayr Ali Kahn's reign.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.370
His name Shayr meaning lion.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.390
That he imported the press to
print stamps is quite telling

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.990
in that it shows the press
was not originally intended

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.290
for propaganda.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.590
It's not until two years later

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.840
that we actually have
works of propaganda.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.500
So why did he begin to use
the press for propaganda?

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.810
To answer that we look
at the two oldest works,

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.650
both of which were religious
polemics targeting Wahabbis.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.490
Now, they were called Wahabbis,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.960
but their actual name was
the Tariqah-i-Muhammadiyah,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.590
which means the Muhammadan way.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.520
They were a militant
revivalist movement

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.530
in British India founded
in the 19, in the 1820s.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.710
And you can think of them
as a Muslim counterpart

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.400
to the Protestant
movement in Europe.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.990
They believed that Muslims
should not rely on saints

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.830
to be mediators between
them and God.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.870
They believed Muslims
should access holy

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.810
scriptures themselves.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.110
Read them for themselves.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.560
And interpret it themselves.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.700
And like Protestants they were
enthusiastic about using print.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.900
If you think everyone should
read the scriptures themselves,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.940
there needs to be a means by
which they can get access.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.690
So in 1824, they established a
printing press from Calcutta.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.460
And then shortly thereafter they
established printing presses

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.560
in other cities such as Delhi.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.920
Lucknow. Lahore.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.600
And Bhopal.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.070
They printed pamphlets that
were easy to understand

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.540
in simplified language.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.170
And in those pamphlets
they would explain

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.550
to people how traditional
clerics,

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.880
traditional ulama
had prevented Muslims

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.670
from understanding true Islam.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.150
Which could only be found
in the holy scriptures.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:50.460
This is an image of a later
Wahabbi publication housed here

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.760
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.060
We actually had to order this

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.770
from the field office
in Islamabad.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.050
But it came relatively quick.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.910
I mean, faster than the
stuff I order off of Amazon.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.580
But this author,
Shah Abd al-Aziz,

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.550
he was not actually a
member of the Wahabbis.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.060
He was sort of a
forerunner to them.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.550
But they revered his work.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.650
And this image just kind
of gives you an idea

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.090
of how the works look.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.390
Very simple.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.690
Simple design.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.990
But the writing is very elegant.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.840
You see three different types

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.260
of scripts there
Nasta'liq, Naskh and Thuluth.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.320
So this kind of gives
you an idea

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.810
of how their other
publications looked.

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.360
Now, in 1826, not too long

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.690
after they established the
printing press, the founders

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.980
of the movement go to
what is today the Punjab

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.810
to fight the Sikhs, who
had been Muslim there,

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:40.400
from certain practices.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.750
Like the public declaration
of prayer.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.400
And also the consumption
of beef.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.700
And at first the people,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.000
at first the Wahabbis were
welcomed by the locals.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.040
But then they started
to have conversations

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.340
with them about religion.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.510
And found that their
ideas were very unorthodox

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.160
and very untraditional.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.520
And one of those individuals
was the Akhund of Swat.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.530
This is his tomb, which
is frequented today

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.780
by many pilgrims.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.310
This, the Akhund of Swat was
an illiterate saintly figure

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:11.190
who had hundreds of
thousands of followers

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.490
in India and Afghanistan.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.030
He was so influential
that the British referred

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.670
to him as a pope.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.570
And he has some conversations
with these Wahabbis.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.720
And he figures out how
different their outlook is.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.850
And he declares the
Wahabbis to be infidels.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.840
And so he basically
expels them from the areas

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.450
that are under his influence.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.490
They go and find refuge
with the religious rival

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:36.130
or spiritual rival, if you will,

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.080
of the Akhund, the
Moolla of Kotal.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.130
And this individual had a
large following himself,

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.530
but not as great at
the Akhund of Swat.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.780
And this Moolla listens
to the Wahabbis

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.360
and he actually agrees
with their views.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.630
Even though he was a
saintly figure himself,

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.570
he actually came to, came

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.200
around to accepting
most of their doctrines.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.500
And when Akhund finds this out,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.250
he declares the Moolla
to be a Wahabbi too.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.330
And to make matters more
complicated for himself,

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.590
the Moolla also embraced
Protestant missionaries.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.360
Such as T.P. Hughes, who was
a very important missionary

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.280
in the Pashto speaking areas
of what is today Pakistan.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.960
He let's these missionaries,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.930
these Protestant missionaries
preach to the people

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.880
and circulate translated
copies of the Bible.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.380
And what happens then is

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:28.460
that Christian converts become
labelled Wahabbis as well.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.850
And part of the reason is

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.230
that people didn't really know
they were Christians a lot

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.530
of time.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:36.260
Because, when they would come
to the villages, they would try

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.730
to talk about Islam strictly
using the Quran and Hadith.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.670
But in this part of the
world, there are more sources

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.100
about what Islam could be.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.650
There could be oral traditions.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.110
Saintly figures and so forth.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.780
And so, when you only use Quran
and Hadith, they were like, oh,

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.140
these guys are Wahabbis.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.660
And they, sometimes they
would never even find

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.640
out that they were actually
Christians because of that.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.270
So sometime before 1871,
the Akhund requests

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.950
from Amir Shayr Ali Kahn
and his ulama a refutation

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.400
of the beliefs of the Wahabbis.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.880
Now, why ask Amir
Shayr Ali Kahn?

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.820
Well, the Akhund was
illiterate for one.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.180
But there were already
refutations written

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.180
in India about this group.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.950
Massive refutations
by eminent scholars

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.310
like [inaudible] of Delhi.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:27.790
But traditionally it was the
prerogative of an Islamic ruler

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:29.300
to deal with heretics.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.650
Even if he would commission
ulama to write heresiographies

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.650
about them, it was still his
responsibility to do that

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.870
and also to punish the heretics.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.510
The problem is, is that
India's ruled by the British.

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:41.810
They're not Muslims.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.050
And, therefore, they can't
really give these types

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.040
of polemics any legitimacy.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.100
But the Amir of Kabul, the
Amir of Afghanistan could.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.930
And he was the closest
independent Islamic ruler

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:54.520
to India at the time.

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.920
And it also helped that
he had a printing press.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.760
And I believe that because the
Wahabbis were very effective

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.770
in using the press and
perhaps the Akhund recognized

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.340
that manuscripts and even
oral traditions were not going

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.790
to be enough to counter the
effects of Wahabbi publications.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.570
It was time to fight fire with
fire, print against print.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.120
And so in 1871, the Kabul court,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:22.920
the court of Afghanistan
issues two refutations

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.050
of Wahabbi doctrine.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.080
The one on the left is the one
I mentioned "Hujjat-i qaviyah."

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.380
And the one on the right is

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.550
"Shihab-i Saqib,"
"The Piercing Flame."

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.550
The one on the left, which
is housed here at the Library

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:38.670
of Congress, was
authored by Abd al-Rahman.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.940
This is a very scholarly work.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.700
It is in very sophisticated
Persian and Arabic.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.400
The one on the right is
actually authored by the Amir.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.400
And it's not scholarly at all.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.680
And the Amir admits
this in the work.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.260
And he explains why.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.710
He says "In this tract I have
not entered into a discussion

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.010
of many Islamic sciences.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:02.160
I believe the ulama in every
country have already crafted

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.990
scholarly responses
to this unbelief.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:08.080
But because those writings
include scholarly terminology,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.230
the masses cannot
understand them.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.590
Hence, it is not the clerics
that are falling into the claws

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.030
of these owls, rather the
hunt of these enslavers is

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.810
after the mice who are ignorant.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.950
This is a teeth-shattering
response to the infidels

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:23.120
that no one has yet to give,
which will render the infidels

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.630
without the strength
and ability to speak."

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.840
So, yeah, you can't really
talk without your teeth.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.130
So, and that kind
of gives you an idea

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:33.000
of how flowery this language is.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.570
And what kind of
language Persian actually,

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.580
it goes in all kinds
of twists and turns.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.650
But this was actually
very simplified.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.710
This, the kind of Persian used

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:44.410
in "Shihab-i Saqib" was
much more simplified

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.910
than the one used in "Hujjat."

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:50.790
And, in general, this was
one of the traits that

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.410
"Shihab-i Saqib" shared
with Wahabbi literature.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:59.870
The focus was on using the Quran
and Hadith, not using auxiliary

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:03.060
or supplementary texts
from the Islamic sciences.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.670
Those materials were
not really used at all.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:08.880
At the top I have some of
the works that were cited

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.050
in "Hujjat," the scholarly work.

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:12.710
Those are just a fraction.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.010
I mean, there are many,

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.380
many works from different
time periods.

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:16.780
Different schools of thought.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.270
And "Shihab-i Saqib" only
two works are mentioned.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.700
And they're not really
even cited.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.100
They're just kind like
the Amir is saying,

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.400
I'm not really making
all this up.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.400
If you don't believe me, you
can find something similar

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.620
in these works, if you want.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.640
Otherwise he just uses
the Quran and Hadith,

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.740
which was very common of
the Wahabbi literature.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.550
They didn't use auxiliary
materials either.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.280
And it's written for
society at large.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.710
It's in this accessible
language.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.680
The Amir states in "Shihab-i
Saqib," "For the honor

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.590
of the strong Muhammad in
religion, I have desired

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.780
to present in some
plain words, in simple,

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.230
fluent Persian the
beliefs and opinions held

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.760
by these unfortunate people."

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.740
So that was his opinion
of what simple Persian is.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.830
But, nonetheless, yes, I mean,
relative to the time period,

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.050
it was actually quite
accessible.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.220
After these two heresiographies
are published, Amir decides

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.980
to produce more propaganda.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.420
But not to attack the Wahabbis.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.310
But to attack Afghanistan's
own ulama,

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:11.820
Afghanistan's own
religious clerics.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.690
He actually never
mentions the Wahabbis again

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:15.820
after these publications.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.720
And I suggest that, although
the first two Kabul publications

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.480
went after the Wahabbis
viciously, the Amir learned

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.890
from the Wahabbis just how
effective print propaganda could

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.830
be in changing the
minds of society

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.410
in challenging recalcitrant
clerics.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.030
The Wahabbis had really
shaken the authority

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:31.450
of traditional ulama in India.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.840
They had drawn tens of
thousands of followers away

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.130
from eminent ulama,
including seminary.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.600
Some prominent scholars
even became members

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.880
of the tariqa became
Wahabbis themselves.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.050
And the tariqa also
inspired the Deoband

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.690
and Ahl-i Hadith movements,
which are today major schools

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.780
of thought in India,
Pakistan and Afghanistan.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.830
Now, why is the Amir
so interested

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:58.890
in challenging his
own country's ulama?

00:14:58.890 --> 00:15:00.190
Well, historically

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:01.600
in Afghanistan the
ulama were central

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.560
to legitimizing the
power of the Amir.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.750
And also recruiting
volunteers for his army,

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.200
especially during civil
wars and foreign invasions.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.410
And the Amir was trying to
centralize the government

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.610
of Afghanistan, primarily
through a central, modern army.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.090
The problem was that a lot

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.400
of ulama were financially
independent of the Amir.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.700
They didn't need his patronage.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.600
They already had other
sources of patronage.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.900
Tribal chieftains.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.200
Local rulers.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.350
Even the Amir's brothers who are
rival claimants to the throne.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.910
And, moreover, these
reforms threatened

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.860
to disenfranchise
the ulama's patrons

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.530
of their traditional military
authority and revenue.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:38.830
Historically these chieftains

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.570
and local rulers provided
military levies to the Amir

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:43.910
in exchange for revenue
and autonomy.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:47.290
But the Amir was looking to
circumvent them and reduce them

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.790
to pensionaries, to
state pensionaries.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.900
And so the ulama, almost
like representatives,

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.940
articulated opposition
to the Amir.

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:55.450
But instead of saying,
hey, you know,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.440
you're disenfranchising
our patrons,

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.070
they crafted a religious
argument.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:00.910
And said these reforms
you're trying

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.800
to institute have no
precedence in Islam.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.880
They're innovations and,
therefore, they are violations

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.910
of Islamic law of the sharia.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.090
Therefore, the Amir had
been in need of a way

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.930
to respond to that argument.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.410
But it's only after the Wahabbi
debates he begins printing

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.150
materials that address
that opposition.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.630
One of those pieces

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:22.330
of propaganda is
Afghanistan's first newspaper,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.810
"Shams al-Nahar."

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.190
This was more like a gazette.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:30.450
It was first printed in
1873, and it contained news

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.750
from around the world.

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.660
Now, the Amir didn't actually
have correspondence, you know,

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.110
in Africa and Europe
and these other places.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:41.560
What he did was he took
stories from British-Indian

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.670
and even British newspapers.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.870
And he would have those,
this is a table just kind

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.450
of giving you an idea of
some of the newspapers used.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.340
There were many other
newspapers used.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.460
But you can see they're
from all over South Asia.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.010
Karachi. Lahore.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.720
Bombay. Calcutta.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.360
Very distant parts.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.000
And in very, in different
languages as well.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.330
Persian, Urdu and English
were the main ones.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:06.670
He had a translation bureau.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.010
They would translate these
materials into Persian

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.110
if they weren't already
into Persian.

00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:13.650
And there was a pretty, I mean,

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.700
there was all kinds
of different topics.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.980
A lot of them focused
on conflicts in Europe.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.690
Civil wars in Spain.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.590
Franco-Prussian War.

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:25.900
Also topics about science.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:31.280
But the most important
pieces in "Shams al-Nahar"

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.440
for my research were
these think pieces

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.090
that could be reflections
on news items.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:40.000
Or they were printed speeches of
the Amir or his chief secretary.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.050
And sometimes they were
even original articles.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.700
And all of these think
pieces had a common argument.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.280
That the Amir's subjects needed

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.360
to take the example
of other countries.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.890
And pursue knowledge
and show loyalty

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.910
to their ruler, to the Amir.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.120
And they also voiced
opposition to the clerics

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.990
that opposed the Amir's reforms.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:03.450
And in 1875, a book was
published addressing this

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.910
very issue.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.760
This is "Tuhfat al-Ulama," the
book that addresses this issue,

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.410
housed here at the
Library of Congress.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.880
You can see it's pretty beat up.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.780
These lithographs have witnessed
quite a bit of war going back

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:22.280
to the second Anglo-Afghan
War in 1878.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.580
This work was authored by the
Amir and his chief secretary.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.770
And the way this work
opposes the ulama

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.650
of Afghanistan is
almost identical

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:34.090
to how the Wahabbis opposed
the ulama of British India.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:36.000
For one, I mean,
it's in print just

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.360
like Wahabbi literature was.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.780
But also it was an
accessible language.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.370
It emphasized the holy
scriptures, the Quran and Hadith

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.020
to the exclusion of
supplementary materials

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.730
from the Islamic sciences.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:49.710
And it casted the ulama of
Afghanistan as being misleading,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.050
holding people back from
the true message of Islam.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.120
The same way the Wahabbis
characterized the ulama

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.420
of India.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.340
And this raised the
question for me,

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:02.750
if the Amir's court was
getting discursive ideas,

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.590
rhetorical ideas
from the Wahabbis.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.570
Were they also getting
printing materials from some

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.730
of the same places Wahabbis
were getting materials?

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.260
Or just simply where did the
Amir get his printing materials

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.870
and his printing press from?

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.170
This is something

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.450
that scholarship has
not really addressed.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.880
Very few scholars have
even touched upon the reign

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.210
of Amir Shayr Ali Kahn.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:27.080
I've even seen in some books
on the history of Afghanistan,

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.470
they just don't even
mention him.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.630
Even though, I mean, he's there
for about two decades involved

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.040
in Afghanistan's history.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.590
It's a very difficult
period to talk about

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:37.890
and not for no reason.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.190
Because, again, most
of the materials

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:41.660
from that time period
were destroyed

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.080
when the British
invaded the country.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.760
Also British colonial records
have a lot of information

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.060
about Amir Shayr
Ali Kahn's reign.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.140
But they don't have
much information

00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:52.910
about the printing press.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:56.180
When I was doing research
in India, I found an item

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:01.040
in the catalog saying it
was about the newspaper.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.460
And I was so excited.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.980
And I got the item,
and I opened it up.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.280
And it was one sentence.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.100
The Amir wants to
start a newspaper.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.210
So the British didn't,
weren't really interested

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.670
in where the Amir was getting
his printing materials from.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.130
They were really only concerned
where he was getting his weapons

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.070
and those type of materials.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:22.670
So we don't have a lot of info.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:27.810
We can gather bits and pieces
from the lithographs themselves

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.210
by looking at the colophons.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.560
And in the colophons we see

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.580
that there was a
clear Iranian element.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.540
That there was definitely
Iranians involved

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.560
in the production
of these works.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.700
Two of the names,
Muhammad Sadiq Tabrizi

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.270
and Mirza Bayza Khan Shirazi.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.770
The [inaudible] onomastics,
Tabrizi, Shirazi,

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.140
note where their
city of origin was.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.570
So we know they came from Iran.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.160
And the fact that they were
from Iran was not surprising.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.780
Because Iran had long
established printing there,

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.840
both topography and lithography,
early in the 19th century.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.390
And they had learned
it from the Russians.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:06.070
They had sent individuals from
Tabriz initially and then later

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.660
from Shiraz to go there

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.560
and learn topography
and lithography.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.470
It's not clear how they
came to Afghanistan.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.630
But since there was no printing
press in Afghanistan prior

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.930
to Amir Shayr Ali Kahn's reign,

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.240
we can deduce there weren't
people in Afghanistan

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.030
who had adequate knowledge
on how to work a press.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:25.040
And, therefore, the Amir
solicited the services

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.340
of these men to work the press

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.800
and possibly import
printing materials as well.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.450
These were the only clues I
got from the text themselves

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:33.990
about the possible
origin of the press.

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.020
But instead of answering the
question concerning the origin

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.370
of the press and
printing materials,

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.600
it just created more
confusion for me.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.650
Iranians got lithography
from the Russian.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.690
But Indians got it
from the British.

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:47.750
The Afghans have Iranian staff,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:51.000
but they're getting their
newspapers from India.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.310
So where do the Afghans
get their printing press

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.610
and printing materials from?

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:56.250
Well, thanks to the
clear Library

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.090
of Congress Mellon Fellowship I
got to work with PRTD in trying

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.390
to answer this question.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.840
And what we did was
analyze the paper used

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.060
in the Afghan lithographs to
see if we could identify point

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.090
of origin or points of
origin for that paper.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.220
And we compared the paper in the
Afghan prints with paper used

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.700
in prints from neighboring
areas.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.180
So we first assessed the paper
used in the Afghan prints.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.990
And we saw that there was
a combination of laid paper

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.290
and machine-made paper.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.930
And we used multispectral
imaging and x-ray fluorescence

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:28.870
to see if we could
establish the characteristics

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.840
of both the Afghan
and foreign paper.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.460
And to see if there
were any matches.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.260
XRF didn't help much
because each source had a

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:37.560
unique reading.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.760
There were some patterns,
such as zinc peaks,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.160
were characteristic of Amir
Shayr Ali Kahn's lithographs

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.060
in comparison to those
produced outside of Afghanistan.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.990
As well as those produced inside
Afghanistan after his reign.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:52.180
But none of these patterns could
give us a definitive indication

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.450
of where the paper came from.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.210
Multispectral imaging was more
helpful in that it allowed us

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.170
to see watermarks
on the laid paper

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.230
without too much interference
from the ink and chain lines.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.550
And so just going
to go through some

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.450
of these watermarks with you.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.900
The first here is C. Millington.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.970
This appears to be referring

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:16.770
to the English paper
company Millington and Sons,

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:21.390
which was managed by
Charles Samuel Millington

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.480
and Charles Leschallas
Millington.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.580
This watermark is found in a few
materials from around the world.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.300
Including England.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.460
India. Japan.

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.760
New Zealand.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.070
And, of course, Afghanistan.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:42.270
Next one is of a lion and
a unicorn with a shield

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.170
and a cross in the center.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:46.800
I believe this is,
was the counter mark

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.460
to the C. Millington watermark.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:56.420
And you can see that the font
of the years is identical.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.710
The next one is Pro
Bono Publico.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.320
It says universal foolscap
at the bottom there.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.360
This was also found in a
few works around the world.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.660
Including India.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.960
Indonesia.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:18.970
And possibly among the Armenian
community of Iran and Jaffa.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.960
This one, Leschallas.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.640
I don't know if I'm
pronouncing that right.

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.480
This one, as you can
see, is a shield.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.940
Leschallas across the front.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.240
Horses head at the top.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.090
I believe this one also came
from Millington and Sons.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.210
Because the middle name of one

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.490
of the sons was Charles
Leschallas Millington.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.330
There were other
people with this name,

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.190
but that's my inference is

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.250
that this also came
from that company.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:52.560
And the use of the crescent
moons is quite interesting.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.690
Because crescent moons
were commonly used

00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:58.580
by other European mills to
produce paper explicitly

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.870
for the Islamic world.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.460
And thus we see this
watermark mostly in the,

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.020
used in the Muslim
parts of India.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.840
Like Kashmir and Hyderabad.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.730
And the last one is
Dorling and Gregory.

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:16.810
This one doesn't seem to have
been used very commonly outside

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:18.690
of the British.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:23.420
I only saw one instance
of it being used outside

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.870
of British India in Ethiopia.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.210
But it was being used by
British Indian officials.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.640
So it doesn't seem like
this one had a particularly

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.940
wide distribution.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.450
And we only had one
case of this being used

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.520
in the Afghan lithographs
as well.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.190
Now, all of these
mills or the companies

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:45.240
that owned them were
based in London.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.890
And so this gives us a pretty
good indication that the press

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.180
and printing materials came
from British India or at least

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.830
by way of British India.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.150
So that helped answer
the question

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.420
of where the Amir got his
printing materials from.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:04.140
But a couple of these watermarks
have even more significance.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:11.710
The C. Millington watermark
was found in a work printed

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:17.790
by Reverend T.P.
Hughes in British India.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.210
And he was one of
the missionaries

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.140
that worked very closely
with the Moolla of Kotal,

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:26.480
the Akhund's rival
and accused Wahabbi.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:32.250
And the Pro Bono Publico
universal foolscap, I found this

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.820
in a book authored by
the son and successor

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.350
of the Moolla of Kotal.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.080
So it's interesting
that at least part

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.790
of the group the
[inaudible] referred

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:48.550
to as Wahabbis were probably
procuring printing materials

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:51.130
from the same distributors
the Amir was using.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.330
And at a minimum it shows that,

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.100
although the heresiographies
implied a sharp divide

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.870
between the Amir
and the Wahabbis,

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.440
in actuality not only did
they share discursive methods.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.300
But also sources of
printing materials as well.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.430
So reminds us not to take
polemical works at face value.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.990
And to see how they can often be
produced within a common market

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:12.700
of both ideas and print.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.500
Thank you.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:22.630
[ Applause ]

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:23.950
Has anyone, okay,
so the question is,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:29.020
is there any research existing,
scholarship on the importation

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.470
of materials originating
in Britain to India?

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.770
&gt;&gt; Paper.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:35.070
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary:
Paper, paper specifically.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.240
So it's interesting, I mean,
there were newspapers printed

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.570
in the 19th century
just about paper.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:44.340
And they would discuss
the mills of England.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.990
That's where I got
the information

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.500
about these watermarks
from mostly.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.640
And they would talk about
how much the rates were.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:56.380
And where they were
landing in British India.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.770
But at that point the
trail kind of gets lost.

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.730
We don't really know what
happens with the paper itself,

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.940
who it was sold to specifically.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:10.400
There's also the issue of paper
being produced in India itself.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.770
Especially starting in 1870.

00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:16.820
The British actually, the
British raj passed a law stating

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.600
that all paper used in
official tasks needs

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.270
to use domestically
produced paper.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.640
And they had a huge campaign to
have paper produced in prisons.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.360
I don't know if they really
followed up with their act.

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.110
Because when I was looking
at, you know, colonial records

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.410
from the 1870s, I mean,

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.510
they still were using paper
produced mostly from Britain.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:40.910
So I'm not sure how
far that went.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.570
But based on those
newspapers that were produced

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.900
in the 19th century, there's
not a very strong indication

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:49.340
of what happened to the paper
once it got to India; right?

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:51.920
It was mostly just
tracking the rates

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.200
and how much they sold for.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.250
So there aren't really
any, not to my knowledge,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:01.400
there aren't really any
sources, primary or secondary,

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.450
about where the paper ended up.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:05.350
Especially machine made paper.

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.580
I mean, because there was
so many different producers

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.350
in Europe at the time,
it's very chaotic.

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:12.170
And they didn't have
watermarks either.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.860
And so that kind of made our
task quite difficult as well.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:22.990
&gt;&gt; Does the design of the
polemical lithographs,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:28.660
is that sort of specific
to a manuscript tradition?

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:33.090
Or was it sort of reaching out
to something that was familiar

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:37.700
in terms of sort of a
visual cue or culture?

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.570
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: I would
say it was mostly in line

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.450
with the manuscript tradition.

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:49.690
It's interesting though, yeah, I
would say it was mostly in line.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.780
Like there's things
that, there are changes

00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.160
that don't take place yet.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.830
I mean, because I've
thought about this.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:01.040
So you don't really see
punctuation marks yet.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.170
And this was one of the reasons
why lithography was so popular

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.610
in the Islamic world is
that because it wouldn't be

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:09.540
so different from the
manuscript tradition.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:13.280
People would be able to keep
their jobs as calligraphers

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:15.620
and scribes and what have you.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.260
What's interesting,
though, about this one is,

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:23.140
"Hujjat" on the left, is that
it doesn't use a colophon.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.640
And I still don't know why.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.620
It just has an imprint
on the front.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:29.140
Whereas, "Shihab-i Saqib" does.

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.080
Another interesting thing is,

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:34.380
this is not exactly
related to your question.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.560
But I'll just bring it
up since we're talking

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.750
about the colophons
and everything.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:43.330
The editor for the one on the
left, for the scholarly one.

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.110
His last name was Shirazi,

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.830
which would have been
a good indication

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:51.260
that he was Shia from Iran.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.370
And this author is Sunni.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:58.580
The Shirazi is left out of
his name in the imprint,

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:03.190
but it's not in the
Amir's publication.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.220
And so it kind of highlights
perhaps the different mentality

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.030
that the Amir, mentalities
the Amir had.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.970
Or different mentality
the Amir had in contrast

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:16.000
to his own ulama
at the time, yeah.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.560
And this individual,
Mulla Abd al-Rahman,

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.510
he did not author
anything else besides this.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.460
So "Tuhfat al-Ulama,"
which criticized ulama,

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.800
he had nothing to do with that.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.040
And he probably was not very
fond of it either, yeah, yeah.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.280
But it's interesting because
there is its own system

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:38.580
of punctation that I'm not sure
how far, how much it goes back

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.650
into the history
of the manuscript.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.950
But I had to figure it out.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.190
Because they would use things
like the letter [inaudible]

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.090
in Persian over certain words.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.960
And then I finally realized
that that's an indication

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.700
that it's a foreign word.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.000
You know, they would
do things like that.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.630
They would have the first word
of the next page at the bottom.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.550
That was a standard
process carried

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.680
over from the manuscript
tradition.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.600
Which is funny because that
helped people when they,

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.880
they used codex style bindings.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:12.020
And that helped making sure
that the binding was accurate.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.640
They don't use that kind of
binding for most of these works.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.940
The one on the left, they did.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.240
But for the rest they didn't.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.810
But they still kept that system
of putting the first word

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.360
of the next page at the bottom.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.660
So, yeah.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's very interesting

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:39.360
that they would have
imported that much paper.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:44.640
So I'm interested in local and
whether there's any evidence

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.790
that local paper making
was done [inaudible]

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:51.880
like the mills would establish
local mills and so [inaudible]?

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.160
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: Yeah.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:00.140
So the question is did any of
these mills based in London

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.840
or any of these companies have
mills set up in other locations

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:07.900
in South Asia where they
could produce this paper

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.460
with the same watermarks?

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.820
I think it's a possibility.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.950
Based on my research I was not
given any indication of that.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:16.650
But there were a few mills.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:20.770
I think India at
the time, in 1870,

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.970
only had something
like five mills.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.640
And I don't have much
information about those mills.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.580
And it seems like they were
making machine made paper

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.880
as well.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.650
Not the laid paper
with watermarks.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:37.010
But it's possible.

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.310
I wouldn't rule it out.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:43.220
There's also, there was paper
being made in Iran as well.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.450
But it's so confusing because
in a country like Iran,

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:48.750
they are making their own paper.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.470
But they're still importing
the majority of their paper.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.770
And they're importing
it from places

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:55.120
like Russia and British India.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.020
And so in a particular work, you
don't even actually really know

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.320
where the paper came from.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.620
Was this Iranian paper?

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.100
Was this British Indian paper?

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.540
Was this Russian paper?

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.800
Again, you know, once the
paper is, arrives, it's like,

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.380
it's just lost as to where
the origins were and so forth.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:14.170
So it's just kind
of hard to kind

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:15.470
of figure out all these things.

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:16.770
I wouldn't rule that out though.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.070
I wouldn't rule that out.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.370
I think that still
is a possibility.

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.710
We would just need more
research in that respect.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:26.200
But because the watermarks,
they were not altered at all.

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.910
Like, you know, they would still
say London or what have you.

00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:32.350
That, to me that suggests
they had actually come

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.980
from British India, produced
in, excuse me, in Britain

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.280
and imported to British India.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.510
But we still have to keep that
possibility open as well, yeah.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:55.250
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:56.550
Yeah.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:03.910
&gt;&gt; And you see that paper
appear in archival records,

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:06.970
different principalities.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:13.530
Right. And this particular
work, "Tuhfat al-Ulama,"

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:17.890
it had some really, I mean, it
used some really weird paper.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:19.210
It was very thick.

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:22.170
It reminded me of some of
the paper samples I saw

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:27.360
in Dard Hunter's work
on paper made in India.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:30.610
And, I mean, one of the
questions we had was,

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:34.320
were the Afghans possibly
making their own paper?

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.050
And, you know, I
don't want to jump

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:41.530
into a crazy conspiracy
theory for you guys just yet.

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.490
But this work was
printed in 1875.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:48.050
This was the same year that
relations between the Amir

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.470
of Afghanistan and
the British soured.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:52.210
Like, they really went south.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:55.580
The British really
started having suspicions

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.050
that the Amir was entering
into an alliance with Russia.

00:35:59.050 --> 00:36:01.150
The Amir starts talking
a lot about jihad.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.250
And the British are afraid
that he's trying to, you know,

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:09.100
prepare his own people for a
possible war with the British.

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:12.050
And so I sometimes,
it seems kind of odd

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.180
that the paper would
just be so different

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:18.180
from all the other ones that
we had from earlier years.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.440
And I feel, I suspect
that there's a possibility

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.520
that the British started
restricting the Amir's access

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.820
to paper.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.190
And he had to start getting
paper from some other sources.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:35.530
So that's a possibility as well
too that we have to keep open.

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.950
Just can't say definitively,
yeah.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.420
Any other questions.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.420
You can ask general questions,
too, about the Wahabbis.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:48.030
I mean, I know that that's
a lot of information.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.940
Hopefully I explained it in a
way that was easy to comprehend.

00:36:55.510 --> 00:37:01.380
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.680
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.740
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: So just
please, if you can join

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.510
