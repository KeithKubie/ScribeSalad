00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
As I said before chemistry is, like many aspects
of your own life, all about a search for stability.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.040
Last week we talked about radioactive decay

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.000
and how atomic nuclei get rid of various particles
in order to become more stable.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.240
But what is this illusive stability that all
things seem to be striving for exactly?

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.820
In nuclear chemistry it simply has to do with
keeping the nucleus together.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.200
If the nucleus is going to break apart, then that's not going to be something that lasts very long.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.460
Stability really, is kind of just a way of
saying, it can exist.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.200
And the amount of energy, that holds each
proton or neutron in an atom's nucleus,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.060
is the same amount that's released when it's
removed.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.260
This is known as binding energy and it's one
of the fundamental principles of nuclear chemistry.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.700
It's actually what we mean when we talk about
nuclear energy.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.510
Now I'm not going to lie to you, nuclear chemistry
is terribly complicated,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.980
but we have a way of understanding it that, while not exactly simple, is one I'm sure you've heard of.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.560
The binding energy of an atom is calculated
with the formula E = mc2.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.680
Probably the most famous equation in the world,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.780
and since it was first hit upon by a young patent clerk in 1905 it has become synonymous with scientific genius.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.600
Part of why it's so famous, I like to think, is because the logic behind it is so elegantly simple,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.280
and yet totally counter intuitive, but it's
probably also famous because it's important.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.640
It explains one of the most powerful sources
of energy known to humanity.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:28.300
[Theme Music]

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.479
E = mc2 is formally known as the mass-energy
equivalence formula

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.299
and it states that mass is interchangeable
with energy.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.040
OK, there is a lot there, in what I just said.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.770
To tease it apart consider the nucleus of
an atom of oxygen: 8 protons and 8 neutrons.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.530
Collectively, by the way, these particles
are known as nucleons.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.140
If you were to add up all the individual masses
of all 16 nucleons separately

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.090
and then compare that to the total mass of
an actual oxygen nucleus,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.690
you'd find that there's a difference between
the two.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.810
Specifically the mass of the nucleus,
exactly 15.99 atomic mass units,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.190
is lower than the mass of its individual nucleons
put together, in this case 16.13 amu's.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.550
That mass went somewhere.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.000
That "missing mass" in the nucleus, known as its mass defect, is actually present in the form of energy.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.799
It's the energy that holds the nucleons together,

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:23.109
so for example the mass defect for an oxygen
atom is negative 2.269 x 10^-28 kilograms.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:30.569
To find out how much binding energy that missing mass amounts to, you can use it as the 'm' in Einstein's formula.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.780
This ingenious little equation relates mass
and energy by a simple proportionality constant,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.930
and thanks to Einstein we know that constant
is the square of the speed of light, or c2.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.280
Solve for 'E' and you find that the binding energy in that oxygen nucleus is 2.04 x 10^-11 joules,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.560
with the negative sign indicating that the
energy is being released.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.440
Now of course 2.04 x 10^-11 is a very small
number.

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:57.510
That might surprise you, but hold the phone,
that is just for one single nucleus.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.860
If we multiply that by Avogadro's number to find the energy change for a whole mole of oxygen nuclei,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:10.659
a mere 16 grams of oxygen, we get an amazing
1.23 x 10^13 joules of energy.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:19.020
To produce that energy with coal, you would have to burn 420,000 kilograms, 420 metric tons of coal.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.219
That energy is what we mean when we talk about
nuclear energy,

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:26.189
the binding energy that's released when a
nucleon is removed from its nucleus.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.529
Now, to dislodge one of those nucleons and
unleash that energy there are two general

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.920
types of nuclear reactions:
fission and fusion.

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:37.869
Fission occurs when a large nucleus splits
into two lighter ones.

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:42.559
Fusion is the opposite when two light nuclei
join together to form a heavier one.

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:45.900
In both cases the products of the reactions
are more stable than the starting materials,

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.209
and this is, as always,
what drives the reaction.

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.879
This is a graph of the binding energies of
various elements compared to their mass numbers.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.100
Elements with very high binding energies such as iron-56 are very stable and rarely undergo nuclear reactions.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.620
But elements with lower binding energies can
react much more readily.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.940
If the nucleus is heavier than iron-56 it will tend to break into two or more smaller nuclei; a fission reaction.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.220
If it's lighter than iron-56 it will more
likely participate in a fusion reaction,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.620
joining two nuclei together to form a heavier
one.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.199
But the most important thing to notice here
is that

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.659
with both fission and fusion stability increases
as a result of the reaction.

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.490
Fission is the type of reaction that we use
more often

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.970
because it's the one that we're better at
initiating and controlling, at least so far.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.260
And whether it's used in power plants or bombs,
the most common fuel for fission is uranium-235.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.220
There are several ways that it can react,

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.840
but the reaction is almost always triggered by hitting uranium with neutrons from another source.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.800
When that happens the uranium splits into
smaller atoms.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.960
One such reaction produces krypton-92, yes
krypton is a real thing,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.360
along with barium-141, three free neutrons
and lots of energy.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.370
This energy is released mainly as the kinetic
energy of the escaping particles,

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.289
which is immediately transferred to the surroundings
as heat.

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.430
Some energy is also released in the form of
electro-magnetic radiation such as

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.910
visible light, X-rays,
and gamma radiation.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.420
Nuclear power plants use the energy released
by these reactions to convert water to steam,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.300
which then is passed through turbines spinning
a generator, powering cities and stuff.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.860
Because of the enormous amounts of energy
these reactions can release,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.189
nuclear power plants can potentially produce
lots of electricity,

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:20.930
but there's also, I think you may have heard,
some serious draw backs.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.930
For one thing, as you know, atoms rarely exist
in isolation.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.120
We write the equation of a fission reaction
as it fits just one atom,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.370
but in reality that one atom is surrounded
by many, many more.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.480
And if one little neutron can trigger the reaction and that reaction liberates three more neutrons,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.479
well I think you can see where this is going.

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.270
If the reaction isn't controlled each reaction
trigger three more,

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.039
and every reaction releases the same amount
of energy, which adds up fast.

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.110
This is pretty much the definition of a chain
reaction

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.169
and it is the basis of the remarkable power
of the nuclear weapon.

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.250
The same type of reaction occurs in nuclear
power plants,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.289
but those reactions are controlled in several
ways to keep them from getting out of hand.

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.529
The fact is these chain reactions have the potential to produce far more heat than the plant can use,

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:06.220
so much more that the temperature can easily rise to dangerous levels, enough to melt the uranium.

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.120
This is the meltdown that you hear about

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.340
and most reactor cores are immersed in water to disperse the heat and prevent this from happening.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.940
But that, that's not enough on its own to
control this thing.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.680
If the chain reaction is allowed to run freely,

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.999
no amount of water can remove the heat fast
enough to prevent a meltdown.

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:23.050
A real way we control nuclear reactions is
with control rods.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.310
They're made of materials that readily absorb
neutrons

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.560
and they're inserted between the fuel rods of uranium to slow the neutrons down and therefore slow the reaction.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.220
They can be put in more to slow the reaction more, and lifted out more if you need more heat.

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:39.599
Now the other sticky wicket of fission reactions
is the stuff that's left behind.

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.499
These reactions not only produce products
that are still radioactive,

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:45.780
they produce tons of them, lots of different
troublesome kinds.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.379
Like we saw last week, uranium undergoes many
different types of nuclear decay,

00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:52.599
so not only does each uranium atom produce
isotopes of krypton and bromine,

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.020
but that process also produces many other
isotopes of other elements.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.930
And as these various nuclei break down they
release more neutrons

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.499
and more unstable products and the process
continues for a long time.

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:05.550
All of these reactions eventually yield stable
products

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.550
but they have half-lives ranging from a few
years to tens of millions of years.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.969
The products with shorter half-lives stabilize
pretty quickly

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:16.259
but they release particles and energy like
crazy during that time so they're extra dangerous.

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:19.840
The ones with longer half-lives decay more
slowly, release less energy

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.969
but that means it takes a very, very long
time for them to stabilize.

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:27.659
So long in fact, that for human purposes,
it may as well be forever.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:32.211
That means they'll always be an issue in our
environment which is why we're always looking

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.720
for ways to store them,
and keep them out of our way.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.860
Fusion reactions, as you'd expect, are very
different from fission.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:43.060
For one thing, the energy released in many fusion reactions dwarfs even the huge amount released by fission.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.660
You might be familiar, for example, with the
wonderful work done by our sun.

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:49.800
The reactions that power the sun are like
most fusion reactions,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.740
in that they involve very small nuclei like
isotopes of hydrogen and helium.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.840
This reaction begins when two atoms of hydrogen,

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.509
accelerated by the sun's fantastically high
temperatures and contained by its high pressures,

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:04.580
join to form an atom of deuterium,
an isotope of hydrogen.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.639
This fusion of particles releases a positron
and some heat energy in the process.

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:12.689
Then another atom of hydrogen is joined to
the deuterium to form helium-3.

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:16.240
This step also releases a lot of energy in
the form of gamma radiation.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.400
When two atoms of helium-3 are available they
join together to form an atom of helium-4,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:26.380
as well as two atoms of regular hydrogen which then can be used to begin the process all over again.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.320
This final step also, as you might imagine, releases a large amount of energy in the form of mostly gamma radiation.

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:36.880
So this is a chain reaction too, but it's
not a self-perpetuating one like we saw before.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.169
This reaction requires a total input of 6
atoms of hydrogen but it only produces two,

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.310
in the end the remaining mass being released
in the form of helium.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.170
For this reason more fuel is always needed,

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:51.709
which is why our sun is going to run out of
hydrogen in about 5 and a half billion years.

00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:53.940
We can produce fusion reactions here on Earth
too,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.750
but they're not very useful for us because
we haven't figured out how to control them.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.620
They're super useful if you just want to blow
up a big city though,

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.649
just to be clear, depending on your definition
of use.

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:07.550
One reason is, as you can see on the mass-energy
graph,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:12.990
light nuclei that fuse together undergo a much larger energy change than heavy nuclei that break apart.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.880
That means their reactions release far more
energy than fission reactions do,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.380
so much more that it's nearly impossible to
contain and therefore use.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.440
Also, because fusion involves joining nuclei,

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.940
the reaction has to overcome the really strong repulsion that naturally exists between their positive charges.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.500
For this reason, fusion reactions can only occur when particles collide at very high speeds,

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.860
or under very high pressures.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:40.850
At these mind-blowing speeds, the kinetic
energy of the particles produces insane temperatures,

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.480
like in the 100 million kelvin range,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.579
at which point, the material being accelerated
actually exists in the form of plasma.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:53.080
So not only are those speeds really hard to reach but material at that temperature, how do you control that?

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.980
Which is why we can't use fusion for things like generating electricity which would be super nice.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.340
We've only found applications for it when we don't need to control it at all like in nuclear weapons.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.670
So as you can tell, there is plenty of room
for new ideas in nuclear chemistry.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.759
Fusion would be really great because it would
produce a lot of energy

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:13.949
and you'd just get helium out of the process
and helium is awesome!

00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:17.070
How can we use radioactive materials more
efficiently?

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.509
Is there a way to achieve the speeds and manage
temperatures that come with fusion?

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:25.009
And how can we do this stuff without blowing
our faces off?

00:10:25.009 --> 00:10:27.089
You've already taken the first step by learning
the basics.

00:10:27.089 --> 00:10:29.290
It's up to you how far you want to go from
here.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:35.009
Maybe you'll write the next totally crazy ingenious and counter intuitive equation that takes us to the next level.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.209
For now though, thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:42.209
If you paid attention, you learned how Einstein's
famous formula helps us calculate

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:45.240
the binding energy of a nucleus from its mass
defect.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.610
You also learned the difference between fission
and fusion.

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.240
You saw an example of each one.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.759
and you learned about their applications in
the real world.
