00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.036
- [Narrator] Though I'm
interested in finding

00:00:02.036 --> 00:00:05.856
the relationship between
people's height in inches

00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:08.241
and their weight in pounds.

00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:10.332
And so I'm randomly
sampling a bunch of people

00:00:10.332 --> 00:00:12.207
measuring their heights,
measuring their weight

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:14.161
and then for each person
I'm plotting a point

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.709
that represents their height
and weight combination.

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:19.687
So for example let's say I measure someone

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:22.559
who is 60 inches tall, that'll
be about five feet tall

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:24.686
and they weigh 100 pounds.

00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:28.680
And so I'd go to 60 inches
and then 100 pounds.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.162
Right over there so that
point right over there

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:34.912
is the point 60 comma, 60 comma, 100.

00:00:38.097 --> 00:00:39.831
One way to think about
it, height we could say

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:43.078
is being measured on our
X axis or plotted along

00:00:43.078 --> 00:00:47.500
our X axis and then
weight along our Y axis.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.544
And though this point from
this person is the 0.60, 100

00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:53.400
representing 60 inches, 100 pounds.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.596
And so so I've done it
for one, two, three, four

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:59.977
five, six, seven, eight, nine
people and I could keep going

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:01.890
but even with this I could say, well look,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.435
it looks like there's a roughly
linear relationship here.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:08.200
It looks like it's positive,
that generally speaking

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.621
as height increases so does weight.

00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:14.461
Maybe I could try to put a line that can

00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:16.753
approximate this trend.

00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:19.491
Let me try to do that
so this is my line tool.

00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:21.121
I could think about a bunch of lines.

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.379
Something like this
seems like it would be,

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:26.974
you'd be, most of the
data is below the line

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:29.250
so that seems like it's not right.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.417
I could do something like,

00:01:32.314 --> 00:01:33.710
I could do something like this

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.263
but that doesn't seem like a good fit.

00:01:35.263 --> 00:01:38.339
Most the data seems to be above the line.

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:40.873
And so once again I'm
just eyeballing it here,

00:01:40.873 --> 00:01:43.844
in the future you will learn
better methods of finding

00:01:43.844 --> 00:01:44.927
a better fit.

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.493
But that's something like this
and I'm just eyeballing it

00:01:49.493 --> 00:01:51.500
looks about right.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.347
So that line, you could view
this as a regression line.

00:01:56.347 --> 00:01:59.870
We could view this as y equals mx plus b.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.696
Where we would have to
figure out the slope

00:02:01.696 --> 00:02:03.324
and the Y intercept and
we could figure it out

00:02:03.324 --> 00:02:06.343
based on what I just drew or
we could even think of this

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:07.176
as weight.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.069
Weight is equal to our slope times height.

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:17.472
Times height plus whatever
our Y intercept is,

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:20.651
if you think of the vertical
axis as the weight axis

00:02:20.651 --> 00:02:22.949
you could think of it as
your weight intercept.

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:24.958
But either way this is
the model that I'm just

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:28.402
through eyeballing, this
is my regression line.

00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:30.291
Something that I'm trying
to fit to these points.

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:32.067
But clearly it can't go through,

00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:34.698
one line won't be able to
go to all of these points.

00:02:34.698 --> 00:02:38.914
There's going to be for
each point some difference

00:02:38.914 --> 00:02:40.872
or not for all of them
but for many of them,

00:02:40.872 --> 00:02:44.309
some difference between the
actual and what would have been

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.466
predicted by the line.

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:49.278
And that idea, the difference
between the actual four point

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:51.909
and what would have been
predicted, given say the height

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.016
that is called a residual.

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:56.204
Gonna write that down.

00:02:56.204 --> 00:03:00.136
The A residual for each
of these data points.

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:02.974
And so for example if
I call this right here,

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:06.765
if I call that point one,
the residual for point one.

00:03:06.765 --> 00:03:10.750
Is going to be well, for our variable,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.263
for our height variable 60 inches.

00:03:13.263 --> 00:03:16.411
The actual here is 100 pounds.

00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:20.578
From that we would subtract
what would be predicted.

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:26.407
So what would be predicted
is right over here.

00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:30.563
I could just substitute
60 into this equation

00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:33.558
so it would be M times 60 plus b.

00:03:33.558 --> 00:03:35.675
So I could write it as M,

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:39.056
maybe let me write it
this way, 60 M plus B.

00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:40.970
Once again I would just take the 60 pounds

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.204
and put it into my model here and say,

00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:44.922
well what weight would
that have predicted.

00:03:44.922 --> 00:03:48.236
And I can even, just for the
sake of having a number here.

00:03:48.236 --> 00:03:52.153
I can look, I can, let
me get my line tool out.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.304
And try to get a straight
line from that point.

00:03:57.304 --> 00:04:01.137
So from this point let
me get a straight line.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.553
So that doesn't look quite straight,

00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:05.892
okay a little bit, okay.

00:04:05.892 --> 00:04:09.309
Okay so looks like it's about 150 pounds.

00:04:12.107 --> 00:04:15.893
So my model would have
predicted 150 pounds.

00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:20.060
So the residual here is going
to be equal to negative 50.

00:04:21.124 --> 00:04:23.572
So a negative residual is when your actual

00:04:23.572 --> 00:04:26.107
is below your predicted.

00:04:26.107 --> 00:04:27.696
So this right over here.

00:04:27.696 --> 00:04:30.797
This is our one, it is
a negative residual.

00:04:30.797 --> 00:04:33.676
If you had, if you tried to find,

00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:36.755
let's say this residual right
over here, for this point.

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:40.338
This r2, this would be a positive residual

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:44.791
because the actual is larger

00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:49.046
than what would have
actually been predicted.

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:51.441
And so a residual is good for saying,

00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:54.598
well how good does your
line, does your regression,

00:04:54.598 --> 00:04:57.723
does your model fit a given data point

00:04:57.723 --> 00:04:59.946
or how does a given data
point compare to that.

00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:03.249
What you probably want
to do is think about

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:05.476
some combination of all the residuals

00:05:05.476 --> 00:05:07.872
and try to minimize it.

00:05:07.872 --> 00:05:10.209
Now you might say, well
why don't I just add up

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:11.866
all the residuals and
try to minimize that.

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:14.143
But that gets tricky
because some are positive

00:05:14.143 --> 00:05:18.997
and some are negative and
so a big negative residual

00:05:18.997 --> 00:05:21.285
could counterbalance the
big positive residual

00:05:21.285 --> 00:05:23.192
and it would look, it would add up to zero

00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:24.974
and then it look like there's no residual

00:05:24.974 --> 00:05:27.750
so you could just add
up the absolute values.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.758
So you could say, well
let me just take the sum

00:05:29.758 --> 00:05:33.560
of all of the residual,
of the absolute value

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.738
of all the residuals.

00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:38.238
And then let me change M and B for my line

00:05:39.132 --> 00:05:42.641
to minimize this and
that would be a technique

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.284
of trying to create a regression line.

00:05:46.284 --> 00:05:47.939
But another way to do
it and this is actually

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:50.009
the most typical way that
you will see in statistics

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.509
is that people take the sum of the squares

00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:56.703
of the residuals.

00:05:56.703 --> 00:05:59.119
The sum of the squares and
when you square something

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:00.612
whether it's negative or positive,

00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:03.229
it's going to be a positive
so it takes care of that issue

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:06.164
of negatives and positives
canceling out with each other.

00:06:06.164 --> 00:06:09.707
And when you square a number,
things with large residuals

00:06:09.707 --> 00:06:12.543
are gonna become even
larger, relatively speaking.

00:06:12.543 --> 00:06:15.528
You know, if you square
a large, you know one is,

00:06:15.528 --> 00:06:18.138
if you think about this way,
let me put regular numbers,

00:06:18.138 --> 00:06:20.103
one, two, three, four.

00:06:20.103 --> 00:06:21.586
These are all one apart from each other

00:06:21.586 --> 00:06:25.076
but if I were to square
them, one, four, nine, 16,

00:06:25.076 --> 00:06:27.170
they get further and further apart

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.732
and so something, the
larger the residual is

00:06:29.732 --> 00:06:32.568
when you square it,
when the sum of squares

00:06:32.568 --> 00:06:36.438
is going to represent a
bigger proportion of the sum.

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:38.081
And so what we'll see in future videos

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:39.724
is that there is a technique called

00:06:39.724 --> 00:06:41.807
least squares regression.

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.022
Least squares regression.

00:06:49.022 --> 00:06:53.189
Where you can find an M and
a B for a given set of data

00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:58.334
so it minimizes the sum of
the squares of the residual.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.046
And that's valuable and the
reason why this is used most

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:04.564
is it really tries to take in account

00:07:04.564 --> 00:07:06.249
things that are significant outliers.

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:09.135
Things that sit from pretty
far away from the model,

00:07:09.135 --> 00:07:11.038
something like this is going to really,

00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:13.478
with a least squares regression.

00:07:13.478 --> 00:07:15.389
It's going to try to be minimized

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:17.580
or it's going to be weighted
a little bit heavier

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:18.963
because when you square it becomes

00:07:18.963 --> 00:07:20.844
even a bigger factor in this.

00:07:20.844 --> 00:07:23.029
But this is just a
conceptual introduction.

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:26.416
In future videos we'll do
things like calculate residuals.

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.848
And we'll actually derive the formula

00:07:27.848 --> 00:07:31.877
for how do you figure out
an M and a B for a line

00:07:31.877 --> 00:07:35.039
that actually minimizes
the sum of the squares

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:36.456
of the residuals.
