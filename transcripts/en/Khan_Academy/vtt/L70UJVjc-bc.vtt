00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.131
- [Instructor] You put
$3,800 in a savings account.

00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:08.225
The bank will provide
1.8% interest on the money

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:09.173
in the account every year.

00:00:09.173 --> 00:00:10.185
Another way of saying that,

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:14.352
the money in the savings account
will grow by 1.8% per year.

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:19.048
Write an expression that
describes how much money

00:00:19.048 --> 00:00:22.024
will be in the account in 15 years.

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:23.323
So let's just think
about this a little bit.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:25.795
Let's just think about
the starting amount.

00:00:25.795 --> 00:00:29.023
So in the start, we're
just gonna put $3,800.

00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:31.690
We could view that as year zero.

00:00:33.638 --> 00:00:35.089
Actually, let me write it that way.

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:38.672
So the start is the
same thing as year zero

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:43.792
and we're gonna start with $3,800.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:47.473
Now let's think about year one.

00:00:47.473 --> 00:00:50.242
How much money will we
have after one year?

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:54.409
Well, we would have the original
amount that we put, $3,800,

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.005
and then we're gonna get the
amount that we get an interest

00:00:58.005 --> 00:01:01.122
and they say that the bank
will provide 1.8% interest

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:02.789
on the money in the account

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.039
so it'll be plus 1.8% times $3,800

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:16.602
and we could also write this as a decimal.

00:01:16.602 --> 00:01:20.767
This is equal to 3,800
plus and I'll just write,

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:22.429
I'll switch the order
of multiplication here,

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.346
plus 3,800 times 0.018.

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:32.720
1.8% is the same thing
as 18,000ths or 1.800ths

00:01:35.085 --> 00:01:37.985
depending on how you want to pronounce it.

00:01:37.985 --> 00:01:38.939
And so here you might say,

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.751
"Well, there's an interesting
potential simplification

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:42.954
"mathematically here."

00:01:42.954 --> 00:01:46.566
I could factor 3,800 out
of each of these terms.

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:49.690
I have a 3,800 here, I have a 3,800 here

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.529
so why don't I factor it out?

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:53.456
Essentially undistributed.

00:01:53.456 --> 00:01:56.373
So this is going to be 3,800 times,

00:01:57.986 --> 00:01:58.819
when you factor it out here,

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.402
you get a one plus,

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:03.006
when you factor it out here,

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.089
you get 0.018

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.096
and so I could just rewrite
this as 3,800 times 1.018.

00:02:16.185 --> 00:02:18.329
So this is an interesting time to pause.

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.396
We're not at the full answer yet,

00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:22.245
how much will we have in 15 years,

00:02:22.245 --> 00:02:23.794
but we have an interesting expression

00:02:23.794 --> 00:02:26.482
for how much we have after one year.

00:02:26.482 --> 00:02:30.557
Notice that if the
money is growing by 1.8%

00:02:30.557 --> 00:02:33.807
or another way it was growing by 0.018,

00:02:35.114 --> 00:02:37.256
that's equivalent to multiplying

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.641
the amount that we started the year with

00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:43.808
by one plus the amount that
it's growing by or 1.018.

00:02:45.462 --> 00:02:47.577
And once again, why does
this make intuitive sense?

00:02:47.577 --> 00:02:49.598
Because at the end of the year,

00:02:49.598 --> 00:02:52.388
you're going to have the
original amount that you put,

00:02:52.388 --> 00:02:54.131
that's what that one really represents,

00:02:54.131 --> 00:02:57.061
and then plus you're gonna have
the amount that you grew by

00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:59.120
so you multiply both the sum here

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.740
times the original amount you put

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.498
and that's how much you'll
have at the end of year one.

00:03:04.498 --> 00:03:06.662
What about year two?

00:03:06.662 --> 00:03:07.662
So year two.

00:03:11.047 --> 00:03:13.790
Well, we know what we're going
to start with in year two.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.548
We're gonna start with whatever
we finished year one with.

00:03:16.548 --> 00:03:20.215
So we're gonna start
with 3,800 times 1.018,

00:03:23.034 --> 00:03:27.201
but then it's gonna grow
by 1.8% or grow by 0.018.

00:03:29.983 --> 00:03:32.476
And we already said, if you're
gonna grow by that amount,

00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:36.226
that's equivalent to
multiplying it by 1.018.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.373
Well, this is the same
thing as 3,800 times 1.018

00:03:44.867 --> 00:03:46.898
to the second power.

00:03:46.898 --> 00:03:49.475
I think you see where this is going.

00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:52.142
Every time we grow by 1.8%,

00:03:52.976 --> 00:03:56.024
we're gonna multiply by 1.018.

00:03:56.024 --> 00:03:58.194
And if we're thinking about
15 years in the future,

00:03:58.194 --> 00:04:00.019
we're gonna do that 15 times.

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.132
So one year in the future,

00:04:01.132 --> 00:04:02.972
your exponent here is essentially one.

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:04.831
Two years, your exponent is two.

00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:08.677
So year 15, I can just
cut to the chase here,

00:04:08.677 --> 00:04:09.594
so year 15,

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:13.699
well that's just going to be,

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.065
we're going to have the
original amount that we invested

00:04:17.065 --> 00:04:20.315
and we are going to grow 1.018 15 times

00:04:22.507 --> 00:04:25.659
so we're gonna multiply
by this amount 15 times

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:27.812
to get the final amount.

00:04:27.812 --> 00:04:28.759
And one of the fun things,

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.892
this is actually called compound growth

00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:33.413
where every year you
grow on top of the amount

00:04:33.413 --> 00:04:34.848
that you had before.

00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:36.967
You'll see if you type
this into a calculator

00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:41.077
that even though 1.8% per
year does not seem like a lot,

00:04:41.077 --> 00:04:43.962
over 15 years it actually would amount

00:04:43.962 --> 00:04:45.778
to a reasonable amount,

00:04:45.778 --> 00:04:47.098
but this is the expression.

00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:48.490
They're not asking us to calculate it.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.211
They just want us to know
an expression that describes

00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:55.378
how much money will be in
the account in 15 years.
