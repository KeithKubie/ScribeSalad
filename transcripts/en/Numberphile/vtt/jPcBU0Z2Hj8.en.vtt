00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
So we're gonna do one of the famous puzzles that you can play with a chess board.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.540
It's not chess, itself, but it's a puzzle you can play.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.560
The standard 8 by 8 chess board, and queens.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.380
So a queen, if you don't know, a queen is the strongest; it's the best piece on a chess board

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.280
'Cause it can move any number of squares to the left and the right.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.420
It can move any number of squares up and down, and it can move diagonally as well, any number of squares.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.460
Oh! If there's another piece in its way, it takes it. Aha! Gotcha!

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.140
Right, so that's how a queen moves: diagonally,  up and down, left and right.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:50.180
Now the puzzle is: Can you place 8 queens on a chess board so that none of the queens can attack each other?

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:58.740
So all of the queens are safe. So this wouldn't work as a placement, because we've got one queen here  that can take another.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.820
They are under attack. But maybe something like this would work just fine.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.380
Now I've only got 2 queens here. All queens can take each other queen, so the colors don't matter.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.480
The question is, can we place 8 queens on the board? Can we?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.840
Well, how many ways can we place 8 queens on the board?

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.640
First of all, how many ways are there to do that? Let's look at that first.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.180
Right, which does mean that we've got 56 blanks? I think we can do this calculation.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.960
I think even Brady can do this calculation.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.380
How many ways can we arrange 64 objects, Brady?

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.260
Brady: 64 factorial.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:50.240
James: Yeah, 64 factorial. If you have 64 objects, there are 64 factorial ways to do that: 64 times 63 times 62... all the way down to 1.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:00.480
So, there are 64 objects, 8 queens and 56 blanks. But you can rearrange the blanks between themselves, and it doesn't change the position on the board.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.780
So, we're going to divide by how many blanks there are: 56 factorial ways to arrange the blanks.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.640
So we have to consider that the queens are the same. I can move the queens between each other, I can commute the queens between each other

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.900
And it doesn't affect the solution; the positions they are on the board.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.760
So for that reason, we are also going to divide through by 8 factorial.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.640
There are 8 queens, and they can be swapped around between each other.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.280
So we'll divide through by 8 factorial.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:45.540
So the number of ways you can arrange those 8 queens naively is 4,426,165,368.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.960
So there are over 4 billion ways you can place your 8 queens on the board, but that's naively doing it.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.600
That's not considering how the queens attack each other, so you're going to get silly solutions

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.240
Like this one, or this, or this. These are no good; these aren't solutions.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:14.160
So, how many solutions are there, out of that 4 billion figure that do work, so the queens don't attack? What do you think?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.180
It is in fact only a small fraction of this 4 billion.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:27.680
There are 92 distinct solutions.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:36.780
Now that 92 out of 4 billion as a percentage is... tiny! Unbelievably tiny.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.180
So here is one of the solutions you could place.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.500
A queen here, I can put one here, they don't attack each other.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.080
They're not on the same row, they're not on the same column,  they're not on the same diagonal.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.360
I can put a queen here. Again, not in the same row, column or diagonal.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:02.140
I could put one I think down here. One here. And maybe I'll put one here.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.920
And here, and... where shall I put it? Here? Yeah.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.000
And I think I got away with that. So that would work -

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.460
No queens are attacking each other.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.860
Now, there are 92 distinct solutions you could have.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.620
That includes rotating the board, and reflecting the board as well.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.960
So they're not all going to be really different. Some of them are just turning this 90 degrees.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.280
That would count as a solution. Now, there are 8 ways that you could rotate the board and reflect it.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.460
4 rotations, and 4 reflections. So, how many actual individual ways are there to do it?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.580
There's 12. There's only 12 fundamentally different solutions.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:55.260
11 of them have 8 reflections and rotations, which takes us up to 88.

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.860
1 of them only has 4 rotations and reflections

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:10.580
And it's actually this one I drew. This only has 4 different solutions, because if I rotate it 180, it's symmetric.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.000
So that only has 4, that has half as many. But the others have 8.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.420
So that's 92 distinct solutions. 12 fundamentally different ones.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.020
So you can do this - you can do this with other pieces.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.200
Can you place 8 knights on the board without attacking each other?

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.460
I think that would be quite easy.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.980
Could you place 8 bishops on the board without attacking each other?

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.060
I think that's quite an easy problem as well.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.820
Maybe 8 rooks? Again, I think these are easier problems.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.840
Although how MANY ways you can do it - that's a much more interesting question. How many different ways can you do it?

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.420

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.060
Funnily enough, I was just browsing the site this week and found an amazing coincidence:

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.020
They have a course called "Code Clinics" that happens to use the 8 queens problem.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.620
It seems this problem might be quite old, but it's a popular aid when teaching people about computer programming.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.740
So if you're a coder, why not check that one out?
