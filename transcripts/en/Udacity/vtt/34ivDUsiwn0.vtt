Our brain receives most of it's input from our senses. So, development of our

00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:15.797
of the following clip do you think is more like the way a new born experiences

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:21.517

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:23.196

00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:28.882
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi baby! Can you smile?

00:00:28.882 --> 00:00:31.090
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Give it your best shot and try to select one.
