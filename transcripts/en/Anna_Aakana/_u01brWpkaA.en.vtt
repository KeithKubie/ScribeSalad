00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:02.099
I got to go to Sundance this year,

00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:03.321
and Sundance was kinda..

00:00:03.321 --> 00:00:04.699
everything that I thought it would be.

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:05.542
(sad music)

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:07.093
So many dead dogs..

00:00:07.093 --> 00:00:08.765
And I went to one of the afterparties,

00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:10.970
where I was being totally cool and charming.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:17.161
(music)

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:19.904
And I got to talking to this very rad Asian girl.

00:00:19.904 --> 00:00:20.939
Hey, I just..

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.126
I just wanted to say, you were really great in Ant-man.

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:24.268
Oh, thank you.

00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:24.792
Yeah,

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:26.439
You know, I've always wanted to get into acting,

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.210
but um,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.357
My parents said, "Asians don't make it in Hollywood."

00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:30.884
What?

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:32.459
It really struck a chord with me.

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:34.886
Because the feeling radiating off of her

00:00:34.886 --> 00:00:36.260
was what I used to feel,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.939
every time I watched a movie,

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.261
or I saw a show,

00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:42.209
or even when I sat in an assembly in high school.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:45.324
There was always something about 
being just an audience member

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:48.081
and not a performer that made me feel weird.

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.781
Like, I wasn't where I belonged.

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:52.439
Like, I wasn't doing what I was supposed to be doing.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:54.423
So hearing her say that..

00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:55.626
just broke my heart.

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:57.231
Dude, you should totally pursue acting,

00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:58.175
it's never too late.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:00.718
No, no, I've--I've got a really stable career

00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:03.032
in marketing and advertising now..

00:01:03.032 --> 00:01:03.730
So?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.925
If you know that's not what you want,

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:05.793
then fuck it!

00:01:05.793 --> 00:01:08.021
I mean, you should totally chase your dream!

00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:08.887
(nervous giggle)

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:11.355
And I knew she wasn't going to.

00:01:11.355 --> 00:01:13.231
You know, I could see from the 
look in her face she wasn't going to,

00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.450
but it still..

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.260
it still just like, completely broke my heart

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.756
that she had been discouraged from 
her dreams when she was a tiny child,

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:24.595
like, so many people I know aren't pursuing
what they want to do because of discouragement

00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:26.500
from their friends, or their family,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.545
or society's institutionalized racism and sexism.

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:31.353
Sidebar, let's change that.

00:01:31.353 --> 00:01:32.018
(ding)

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:34.749
And I hate to break it to you,

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:36.000
but we all die.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.535
So what exactly is the point in spending your life

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:41.004
doing something that's not your calling?

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.001
And sure, maybe this industry in particular

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:47.323
is very hard, and it's very reliant 
upon luck and opportunity,

00:01:47.323 --> 00:01:48.970
and being at the right place at the right time,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.293
and working very hard for years 
and with potentially no reward,

00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:53.915
but if you love what you're doing,

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:56.826
and you know what you're doing 
is what you were put here to do,

00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:58.823
then how could you be doing something wrong?

00:01:58.823 --> 00:01:59.792
How you make money

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:02.133
and what you pursue as your career

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:04.554
don't necessarily have to be the same thing.

00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:09.385
Whenever people tell me like taking a risk
isn't financially stable, I can't help but think,

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:11.895
"What's the point of financial stability,

00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:13.293
if you're miserable?"

00:02:13.293 --> 00:02:15.064
You can totally have a day job

00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:17.417
and pursue what you really want to do

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:18.547
at the same time.

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:20.764
There's a lot I want to say on this topic,

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:23.471
and a lot of unique situations that I can't speak to,

00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:26.371
but ultimately what I took away 
from the whole conversation was,

00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:29.845
What's the point of living if 
you're not chasing your dreams?

00:02:29.845 --> 00:02:31.584
No matter how grand they are.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:32.699
Hey!

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.413
Marvel, how's it going?

00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:37.729
So I heard uh, you got all these like,

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.459
TV shows and movies, that's really cool,

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.130
Uh, I just wanted to put myself on your radar

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.124
you know, cause I haven't seen like,

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:46.948
an Asian female superhero, you kno- you know?

00:02:46.948 --> 00:02:48.623
I'm--I'm Cindy Moon.

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:50.634
Silk?

00:02:50.634 --> 00:02:52.470
You know, I was bit by the same spider

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.627
as Peter Parker?

00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:54.607
HEY MARVEL!

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:56.199
Don't you fucking ignore me, motherfucker, okay?

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.586
I'm here in Hollywood and I'm here to stay, okay?

00:02:58.586 --> 00:03:00.069
I'm here for that representation, motherfucker,

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.939
YOU GOT ME?!

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.001
(beep)

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:03.199
I'm Anna Akana.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.356
