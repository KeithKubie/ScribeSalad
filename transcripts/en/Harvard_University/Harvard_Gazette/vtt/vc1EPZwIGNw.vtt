00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.690
The Harvard jazz band is just a standard

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.810
jazz band with 17 musicians what makes

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.640
it unique is like the students

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.920
they're very passionate for music and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.170
if you ask them what are their

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.119
concentrations you know it goes from

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.610
government to physics to computer

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.500
science it's an unusual I would say big band

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.840
the reason we chose Cassandra

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.750
Wilson for our residency

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.730
first this series is special because it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.100
celebrating women in jazz and Cassandra

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.129
Wilson is one of the most singular voices of

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.530
her generation who has been able to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.579
channel the huge legacy of her

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.739
predecessors going back even to Charlie

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.469
Parker to Duke Ellington she's one of

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.240
the jazz masters that we have working today

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.600
this is going to be a privilege

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.220
for the students who have someone like

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.210
Cassandra Wilson here to share with them

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.939
her incredible knowledge about this

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.939
musical tradition but not only jazz she

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.130
has been someone that has always been

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.409
curious to learn about other musical

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.820
traditions and trying to incorporate

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.320
that into the work that she does so we

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.259
hope that the Harvard students can

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.490
benefit a lot from all of this knowledge

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.260
that's she's sharing that's why I consider

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.380
the students fortunate to have someone of her

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.340
caliber and her stature to come and share with them
