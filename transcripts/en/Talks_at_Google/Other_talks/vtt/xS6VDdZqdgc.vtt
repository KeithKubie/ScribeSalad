&gt;&gt;Google Rep: San Francisco near base design
branding firm that he established in 1999.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.910
He has also the chief creative officer at
Jawbone, you can see the jawbone up on his

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.910
wrist.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.999
He has collaborated with renowned partners
such as Herman Miller, we are sitting in his

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:19.009
sail chairs.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.579
[Laughter]
This isn't a product placement advertising

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.550
forum, but we try to celebrate who we bring
in.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.390
Jawbone, GE, Puma, Prada and many others.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.410
Yves Bahar believes that design should be
a force for positive social and environmental

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.410
change.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.650
He is well known for his humanitarian work
on projects such as "One Laptop Per Child",

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.770
and "See Better To Learn Better."

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.160
For each of these he was honored with the
INDEX award, making him the only designer

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.370
to have received the award twice.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.790
Bahar's works are included in the permanent
collections of museums worldwide including

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:01.170
the MoMA, the SFMoMA here in SF, the Centre
Pompidou and the Art Institute of Chicago.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.570
Bahar's a frequent speaker on design, sustainability
and business topics.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.950
He has given talks at TED, The World Economic
Forum in Davos, the Clinton Global Initiative

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.360
and now the Googleplex.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.219
Please welcome Yves to the Googleplex.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.950
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Yves: thank you for the nice welcome.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.619
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: I try to keep it a little bit
short.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.619
So let's kick this off.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.639
How and why did you become a designer?

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.069
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah, let's start with easy question.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.100
[Laughter]
So I first became a designer because I wanted

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.959
to be a writer, I wanted to write stories.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:40.289
I was a teenager, I was 12 or 13 years old
and in Switzerland there wasn't really a school

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:41.289
for design.

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.920
You know my parents weren't in design either.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.590
So I wanted to be a writer, I wanted to tell
stories.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:03.459
And my high-school teacher kind of discouraged
me from that which kind of, I slowly became

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.439
aware that it was possible to tell stories
through the mind.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.000
And so it became my new passion and the thing
I dedicated myself to probably from the age

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.520
of 15 or so.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.450
And slowly got my 10,000 hours by the time
I was 20.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.220
&gt;&gt; Google Rep: Yeah Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000
hours.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.220
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yep, and you know it's been all I
do and what I do since then.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.560
So when it comes to telling stories, I brought
you a few slides cause you gave me a nice

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.150
list of questions which I think a lot of you
participated in coming up with.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.290
But you know like when you get to work on
the type of project we work on, telling stories

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.560
and perpetuating stories has become what I
feel.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.530
Not just, I can do it, but a lot of designers
can do.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.840
And this is probably one of the nicest stories
and one of the nicest things that ever happened

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.840
in my career.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.770
Which is Uruguay, having a stamp to support
and to speak of the $100 laptop.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.320
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Totally
&gt;&gt;Yves: Which every single child in Uruguay

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.310
between the age of 6 and 18 years old actually
has one.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.690
Every child in public school has one of the
laptops.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.000
I have a whole sheet of these stamps.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Yeah, the presentation isn't
just stamps though.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.290
&gt;&gt;Yves: Plus my father.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.080
So when I said my parents are not in design,
and my father was essentially, he's a philatelist.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.190
And that was his sort of childhood passion,
so stamp collecting and being an expert at

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.950
stamps was his thing.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.250
So after 25 years of practice and design,
I kind of got around to having a stamp.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.370
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Perfect.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.800
So who's influenced you?

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.270
I mean you know if we think about some of
the, there was a recent exhibit of Dieter

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.360
Rams at SF MOMA (Museum of Modern Art).

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.240
And I went there and I was like wow Johnny
I've obviously receive such inspiration from

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.240
this.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.660
You know is there an equally profound influence
on Yves Bahar?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.600
&gt;&gt;Yves: You know, in many ways I feel, and
this is where I have another little visual.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.370
Unfortunately they all look a little wider,
like they gained a little weight over lunch.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.760
[Laughter]
There's a distortion on the screen.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:32.190
So of course there's designers, 20th century
designers that have had a big influence on

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.190
me.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.630
Whether it's Shoal Bass or Charles Eames or
George Nelson.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.930
And I'm also a big admirer of people who have
built companies who have built businesses

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:50.040
out of processes that they've discovered and
that they've kind of owned through design.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.460
You know somebody like Issey Miyake for example
which I was very lucky to do a couple of projects

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.889
with.

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:03.450
But it's less of a stylistic influence on
my part.

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.100
You know I'm not really style driven.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.169
To me design, architecture or graphic design
isn't about just imprinting sort of style

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.980
and repeating it over time, it's really about
finding the context in which a design is gonna

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:26.760
be, and doing something unique or magical
or important in this particular area.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.860
But I'm generally influenced by makers.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.590
I would say people who make things whether
they're designers or entrepreneurs is kind

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.640
of what gets me out of bed in the morning.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.240
And these guys were incredible makers of their
times.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.440
Whether it was again graphics or furniture.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:53.440
And in many ways have influenced not just
American design, but the whole world of design

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.440
sense.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.139
And I think in many ways they were also the
best thinkers of their time.

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.080
You know, Charles Eames didn't really follow
a style.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:09.130
You know for a few years, initially he really
created with the LC2 chairs, you know this

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:18.030
amazing way to bend plywood and then to kind
of have a similar style an plexiglass, or

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.620
fiberglass sorry.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.900
But then he also went to aluminum with the
aluminum group chairs right.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.330
And so you can't really speak of repetitive
style or signature across his work, but you

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:37.860
can speak of somebody fascinating, fascinated
by making, innovating and creating something

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:44.860
appropriate both from a socioeconomic set
point at its times.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.130
But also sort of on the cusp of material and
technology innovations.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:54.560
So those are, those are strong influences
in general in my career.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:01.699
You know I'm a big fan of Dieter Rams as well.

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:08.050
But it's less because of his style and more
because of the way he was able to deeply influence

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.630
Brown, you know the company.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.110
You know from a design point of view and help
the company build itself through design and

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.110
through brand.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.870
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So in 1999 you started Fuseproject.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.151
Kind of what was your vision in starting Fuseproject
and is it still true today, kind of what you

00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:32.860
hoped or seen it wanted to be when you start
a Fuseproject?

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.500
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah in 99 I started Fuseproject.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:45.260
It was the high before the bubble burst, the
.com bubble.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:50.300
I started it because I felt like a lot of
people were speaking about integration, how

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.850
different design fields were gonna come together.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:08:01.360
How interaction design, user interface, industrial
design, packaging brand were gonna merge or

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.360
should merge.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.600
But nobody in my opinion back then was practicing
it.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:13.130
And so I became kind of obsessed almost about
practicing a form of design which actually

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:19.990
I had seen practiced in Eames office, I mean
not personally seen but I had spoken, my first

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.880
job was one with a person who had worked in
the Eames office.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.550
And so I was fascinated with this notion of
a multidisciplinary place where we would literally

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:36.800
fuse all these different types of design disciplines
on our projects.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.669
Of course when I started it was just me and
a computer so I the multidisciplinary designer,

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:49.980
but we built the team now to 250 really diverse
group.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.670
And the name Fuseproject comes out of this
idea

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.240
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Of fusing together things.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.240
.&gt;&gt;Yves: Exactly.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.240
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Yeah.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.660
So you mentioned Charles Eames, they had a
very unique shop down in LA.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.250
Kind of how he described Fuseproject as a
culture or as a company?

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:13.390
&gt;&gt;Yves: so what I believe in is you know for
a while design got broken down into these

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.600
tiny little specialties.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:23.830
Design got in a way almost obfuscated and
became very much relegated in the sort of

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.330
corporate food chain to providing a service.

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.100
A graphic design service.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.930
You know brand or an app software or advertising
or strategy.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.710
These became you know broken down.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:45.490
And what was the most important factor in
the 80s and 90s was really marketing or advertising

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.750
in the way that you build the ethos or that
you build the way a company is known in the

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.750
world.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.140
And then you build a brand.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:10:01.760
And so what we believe is more of a 360°
process where everything influences the other

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.760
elements.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:09.070
Always from a design point of view, but if
you're building a user experience, or the

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:17.670
name of a company or the way it's going to
present itself visually or a product.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:25.660
We do all these things at the same time, sort
of in parallel rather than sequentially at

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.150
what was traditionally done in the 80s and
90s.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.800
Which means that the team, the way the team
works and the culture is very much about that

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800
as well.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:44.020
So we all share desks, there is no divisions,
there's no departments in a sense.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.670
There are practices, you know people come
from certain practice and they are good at

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:56.290
something but everybody has a voice in how
we build businesses and how we help companies

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.230
sort of build themselves by design.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:06.209
And the same goes for seniority, there isn't
really a hierarchy of practices or a hierarchy

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:09.370
of seniority in the team.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.959
So we tend to work around very collaboratively
around big tables.

00:11:14.959 --> 00:11:22.149
We'll set up labs, as many labs as we can
that essentially study, research and develop

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:28.260
solutions to a certain problem.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:36.120
And what you'll see is tons of materials,
you know sketches, drawings, diagrams, thoughts

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:44.350
being uploaded on walls and constantly sort
of picking up and put back up, taken down

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.350
and put back up.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.940
So is not an ivory tower type of process at
all.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.510
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: It's very hands-on.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:54.790
&gt;&gt;Yves: It's very hands-on, very much about
making, very much about stress testing ideas

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.200
with design and building that as a multidisciplinary
team.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.950
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So it's interesting right, at
Google, if you look at a project we have a

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.820
PM, we have engineers, designers, they're
all distinct roles.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:11.459
It sounds like it's in stark contrast to a
project, a Fuseproject where things are much

00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:14.670
more organic and probably less controlled
or less structured.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.590
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah, I don't know how structured
things are here.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:18.800
Maybe we should ask the audience how they
feel.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.090
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Yeah maybe we can bring this
up later on.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:31.769
&gt;&gt;Yves: But yeah, I would say that the idea
is to get sort of maximum amount of participation.

00:12:31.769 --> 00:12:34.750
That said, our teams probably don't look that
different from yours.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:41.190
I mean we have outside engineering firms,
outside developers, outside specialties that

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:45.410
come in and complement whatever we're doing
at the moment.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:51.250
And people do come from a place of knowledge
and specialty maybe initially.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:13:00.950
But they very quickly become sort of T-shaped
people you know in the sense that they have

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.940
deep knowledge of a certain area but they
become really, really good at understanding

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:12.279
the whole process and being able to participate,
plug-in in the whole process.

00:13:12.279 --> 00:13:16.660
And because we're addressing, we're constantly
addressing new problems were not really working

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.029
on old problems.

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:23.649
We're really always addressing new challenges
or new types of companies or new types of

00:13:23.649 --> 00:13:25.880
opportunities.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.390
Those skills are fundamental for that.

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:31.560
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So the approach they used on
the last project isn't necessarily immediately

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.160
applicable in your current project.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.160
&gt;&gt;Yves: No.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:41.370
I mean there's certainly an approach, but
the resolution is gonna be different.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:45.690
There's certainly a way that we do things
you know, I'm not sure if that's covered in

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:49.180
other questions, but we start with ideas.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:55.940
And then we build the products, companies,
expressions around those ideas.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.450
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Well it's probably a perfect
segue because one of the questions that definitely

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:03.700
came up when we kind of opened this up to
the community was kind of what are Yves Bahar's

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.940
10 principles right?

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:09.300
You know Dieter Rams has 10 principles that
have become very widespread if you're into

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.300
design.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.380
So what would be the Yves Bahar equivalent
right that kind of guide?

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.380
Sorry.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:23.460
&gt;&gt;Yves: I realize, I was like, I printed,
because I couldn't remember my own 10 principles.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.250
And besides I don't really have them.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.490
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: If you want to cheat, I actually
have them printed out.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.860
&gt;&gt;Yves: Oh, okay.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.520
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: This wasn't scripted at all.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.750
[Laughter[
&gt;&gt;Yves: I was looking, I left my own little

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:41.470
sheet with your questions and just a couple
ideas I wanted to touch upon in the car.

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:46.810
And I got here and I was all macho thinking
ah that's fine I'll figure it out.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:53.420
But those, so a while back, this is something
I said about three or four years ago so it

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.910
may have evolved quite a bit.

00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:05.810
But first of all my number one principle is,
design is how you treat your customer.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.450
The best definition I can think of for design,
and people always ask me, "So what is good

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.530
design?"

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:16.829
And most people when they ask you this question,
they always think about you know what kind

00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:22.000
of style or what should something look like
or feel like to be considered good design,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.710
to enter a museum or to win a competition
or to win many, many customers.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:37.440
And my answer here is not aesthetic, it's
really about how businesses practice what

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.620
they do, what they sell or the services they
offer should be about how they treat their

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:43.620
customers.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.440
And design can significantly enhance that.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:53.579
So if you treat your customer well from an
emotional standpoint, from an environmental

00:15:53.579 --> 00:16:00.380
standpoint, from an ergonomic standpoint,
from a health standpoint, you probably are

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.010
doing good design.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:09.660
The second one is for me design must be integrated
throughout the organization.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:14.670
It isn't a sort of nice add-on at the end
of the process.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:21.830
It isn't something that, it isn't a surface
layer, it isn't veneer.

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:27.520
Good design needs to live throughout the entire
organization to have an influence in the beginning

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.330
and to have an influence at the end.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.810
And everywhere in between.

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:41.170
So the third one relates to that, design is
not a short-term fix, it's a long-term engagement.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.980
That's the way we work.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:47.470
There's lots of people who will call you up
and say, "Look we just need a logo", or "We

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.630
just need a website", and "You'll be done
in three months."

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.139
And that's not the way good design is done.

00:16:53.139 --> 00:16:54.600
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: That's not a client you want?

00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:00.860
&gt;&gt;Yves: It's not the kind of client we want,
but it's you know the clients I want depend

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:09.069
on mostly depend on what kind of quality I'm
gonna be able to create with them.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:14.640
And so it's not about short-term fixes, it's
really about thinking long-term you know how

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.569
a company wants to build itself by design.

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:24.939
The fourth one is design must be driven from
the top.

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:30.390
This is a part of the discussion we had at
lunch, how you get people to stick to the

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:31.790
initial intent of design.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:40.690
How do you get sort of the initial vision
to be implemented and executed throughout.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:46.360
And for that we need supporters, and we need
supporters often that come from the top of

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.360
the company.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.750
This is something that people need to believe
in, top down, in order to be executed throughout

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.210
in the right way.

00:17:55.210 --> 00:18:02.929
I think number six is with design the solution
to the problem will be different every time.

00:18:02.929 --> 00:18:11.549
It isn't you know design isn't formulaic,
five-step or ten-step program.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:19.650
It has to be, both the process and the outcome
has to be custom made, custom thought.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:26.380
I find this fascinating today because there's
so many different companies coming into realization

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.120
that design is important.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:34.230
Pharmaceutical companies, distribution, shipping,
logistics companies.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:43.380
I mean all kinds of unexpected people realize
how much better design can realize things

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.220
for them.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.390
The process is fundamentally different.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.810
And we need to accept that I think.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.669
I think the time of sort of consultants presenting
you the five-step program.

00:18:56.669 --> 00:19:01.210
And by the time we get to number five you'll
have good design in place.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.460
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Ten times more revenue.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.460
&gt;&gt;Yves: Hmm?

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.460
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Ten times more revenue.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.460
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yes.

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.460
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: ROI is high.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.970
&gt;&gt;Yves: Isn't gonna work.

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:18.570
So design is really about finding solutions
that are gonna be unique and a process that's

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.390
gonna deliver those solutions, it's gonna
be probably different every time.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:31.450
And then finally, this is never ask customers
what they want, ask them about their aspirations.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:39.240
I think it is our job, the job of the designer
to conceive of the future.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.230
I do think it's important to listen to people,
I think it's important to listen to people

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:48.630
before you start and after and during the
process.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:58.710
But asking them what their future should be
like is, you know I don't think it's gonna

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:05.350
work as well as designers who are sort of
living and breathing this process all the

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.730
time.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:11.340
And who will also bring.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:19.490
I mean I've quoted this recently, you know
if you ask people when the Ford Model T was

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:26.490
built, Mr. Ford said, "If you asked people
what they wanted back then, they would have

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.990
said faster horses."

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.650
And designers thought of the car.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:35.929
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So if you guys weren't paying
attention, it was seven.

00:20:35.929 --> 00:20:37.020
&gt;&gt;Yves: Seven yes.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.070
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So less but better right?

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.500
Dieter Rams had ten principals, you have seven.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.010
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yes.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.460
I don't mean to improve on Dieter but.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.140
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: All right I need the card back,

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.140
it's scripted.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.140
&gt;&gt;Yves: Oh yes.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.670
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: What's the next question?

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.710
Lets see.

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.130
Alright, give us a sense of how you approach
design.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.260
So is there something uniquely Baharian?

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.590
&gt;&gt;Yves: I've never heard that, Baharian.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.590
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Baharian Yes.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.309
[Laughter]
I coined it, trademarked it.

00:21:05.309 --> 00:21:07.990
I have a patent on it.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.980
&gt;&gt;Yves: Usually we do that well.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:17.520
[Laughter]
So it isn't about style, and certainly we

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.100
tend to base our work in ideas.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:29.919
And we tend to really find some way to speak
of something or a way to express something

00:21:29.919 --> 00:21:42.260
or the way to make everyone kind of inspired
or delighted by a certain product or a certain

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:46.000
digital or physical or the offering of a business.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:53.910
We try to find that key notion that is an
aspiration that may exist but hasn't been

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.799
sort of fulfilled yet.

00:21:55.799 --> 00:22:01.730
And that becomes our key notion, our key principle.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:06.480
And I can probably go back, it is a little
bit abstract but I can go back to probably

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.850
almost every product we've done and say this
was the key moment, the key idea we tried

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.070
to express.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:20.170
Through all these kind of executions, that
we try to express in the product.

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:23.580
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So what was the...
&gt;&gt;Yves: Let me see if I have something to

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.960
illustrate that.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:29.290
I don't know but, yes, that's for the next
question.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:33.169
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So what was the hardest lesson
you've had to learn in your career?

00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:37.150
I mean people obviously probably know about
most of your successes.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.840
But I think it's always interesting to just
learn a little bit about what difficulties

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.809
you've faced and kinda what that taught you.

00:22:41.809 --> 00:22:46.330
&gt;&gt;Yves: Well the whole point is that you wouldn't
know about the numerous things that didn't

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:47.330
work.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.900
[Laughter]
They tend to remain; sadly, they tend to remain

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.370
in someone's drawer.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:56.490
And that's the biggest frustration as a designer
I think is to see your product, and I'm sure

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.429
you experience this here as well.

00:22:58.429 --> 00:23:00.289
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: [whispers] Yeah.

00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:09.230
&gt;&gt;Yves: Is to see your product kind of locked
up in somebodies drawer.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:18.840
The other lesson for me is that it's possible
for us to move mountains as designers but

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.190
the mountains have to want to move.

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:29.809
Which means simply that when you're brought
in as a designer in a situation where there

00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:40.370
isn't really a will to go someplace new or
to experiment or to discover or to get on

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:43.460
a journey, it becomes very difficult to do.

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:53.250
And I probably spent most of the 90's here
in Silicon Valley feeling pretty miserable

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.679
about how people were looking at design.

00:23:55.679 --> 00:24:01.100
You know back then it was, there was no clear
ROI on design.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:07.110
Nobody, you know the first question you would
get from anybody in business is, "Really,

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.299
I need to work with you guys?

00:24:09.299 --> 00:24:13.390
My marketing guy says so or my wife."

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:19.520
And they would be like, "C'mon between us,
what's the ROI on design.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.520
Tell me."

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:21.520
Cause you know.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.030
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: It's like a dirty secret or
something.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.740
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah it's like we all know there is
none right?

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.790
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: And that you're a con man.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:34.520
&gt;&gt;Yves: So that was a pretty miserable time.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:40.140
And I think that the last 10-15 years have
been really really good for us.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.830
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So help us understand what changed
that.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:47.620
The 90's and post the 2001 crash.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:53.480
&gt;&gt;Yves: Well I think we have Steve Jobs to
thank for our credibility, our newly found

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.179
credibility in business.

00:24:57.179 --> 00:25:01.220
Without Apple and without Steve Jobs, the
ROI would be somewhat unclear.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:06.100
And with Steve Jobs and Apple, the ROI is
pretty clear.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.250
And of course others have done it.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:14.630
I mean companies like Target and companies,
numerous start-ups obviously.

00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:24.360
And it seems today that we have a complete
reversal of the attitude.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:31.110
It seems like people know pretty clearly that
design is gonna play a key role in any new

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:35.850
type of venture or in the future of any mature
type of business.

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.870
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: But is that achieved in a sustainable
way?

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.310
Steve jobs has passed away.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.070
Apple will at one point cease to exist.

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.990
What makes design fundamentally important?

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:53.059
Or is this change that you've seen in Silicon
Valley here to stay?

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:58.360
&gt;&gt;Yves: I think the change that happened in
the 50's both in Europe and in the United

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:05.200
States around design having a key role has
still impact today, you know 60, 70 years

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.549
later.

00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:12.900
The work of the people I showed before is
celebrated all around the world.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:18.230
Still derives economic value.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:25.710
And certainly there was a lot of cultural
value both for this country and the rest of

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.710
the world.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:32.419
So I do think that historically the value
of design has been established by companies

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:37.659
like Herman Miller and you know maybe Knoll
as well obviously.

00:26:37.659 --> 00:26:41.780
And that's still something that obviously
you guys live with.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:42.780
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Yeah.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.530
And so how does working with a Herman Miller
compare to working with maybe a more purely

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.610
technology firm?

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:53.340
You know like a furniture, a very physical
object versus the more digital kind of Silicon

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.450
Valley based products.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:27:00.809
&gt;&gt;Yves: You know I'm one of the people who
say it's not different at all.

00:27:00.809 --> 00:27:05.390
For me the process which you can see online,
the process we use to develop the sail chair

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:11.850
here is the same kind of process we're using
to develop a digital product or a very technologically

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.670
advanced product.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.340
It's a lot of thinking about the user.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:23.770
It's a lot about thinking about new technologies
or new ways of doing things or what are new

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:29.289
you know socio-economic kind of factors in
place that will influence the work that is

00:27:29.289 --> 00:27:30.289
done now?

00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:35.510
And it's a lot about sketching and trying
and falling and trying again and making mock-ups

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:40.620
and building and rebuilding and testing and
breaking.

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:50.380
I mean the process of design as being iterative,
as kind of pushing the boundaries and stretching

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.980
the notion of what's possible, all of that
is very much the same.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.140
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: And what about the role of actual
technology in the design process.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.010
What do you guys use, what do you guys rely
on?

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:04.230
And how important is it in you know improving
the design process?

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:15.200
&gt;&gt;Yves: So the role of technology is in many
ways central and in many ways it is not.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.940
Ideas aren't technology generated.

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:26.610
Drawing sketches, quick iterative things tend
to be done by hand.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:31.929
We draw, I mean for this chair here which
you are seeing in more of an advertising shot

00:28:31.929 --> 00:28:40.240
for it, we generated about 70 functioning
prototypes just within our studio.

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:44.090
Probably 100+ with the partnership with Herman
Miller.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:46.600
We generated thousands of drawings.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:57.220
Just like for a user flow or a user interface
or, you would generate lots and lots of different

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.220
iterations.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:00.809
All centered for one idea.

00:29:00.809 --> 00:29:07.799
Our process is never about splattering the
world of possibilities on the wall and showing

00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:12.720
a client oh these are the 20 different ways
this can be done.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:17.050
What we do instead is we pick one thing that
we think would be really extraordinary, really

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:19.029
amazing to deliver.

00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:24.470
Really sort of puts you over the top right.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:31.250
And we go really really deep into that and
keep trying to reach this magical place.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:37.049
But technology has a role when it comes to
building other types of prototypes.

00:29:37.049 --> 00:29:42.110
Digital prototypes, physical engineering prototypes.

00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:45.940
When it comes to testing.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.789
When it comes to sort of getting feedback.

00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:50.179
When it comes to doing research.

00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:51.779
Technology has an important role there.

00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:59.730
But I don't see it, I really see it as a tool,
I don't see it as the reason why you would

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:00.730
do anything.

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:05.059
Google Rep: And so in that process where you're
coming up with thousands of drawings or hundreds

00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:08.950
of prototypes right, where do you guys go
or where does Yves go for inspiration?

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.540
Like what inspires you, like what are you
doing in your daily life?

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:16.390
What are the most important drivers of like
the thoughts in there?

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:23.970
&gt;&gt;Yves: So I'm not somebody who's gonna go
and look at, just tell you that oh nature

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:26.740
inspires everything that we do.

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:32.460
I'm much more sort of a product of our, the
numerous, the thousands of different inputs,

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.440
the cultural inputs.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.240
Everyday life inputs that we get in our lives.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.190
That said my life is almost split.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:52.400
I have a city life that's very intense, an
office life that's very intense.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.880
I tend to work with clients all over the world,
in urban centers.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:03.230
And so culture is a very important role in
what we do, travel technology.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:09.240
You know there is sort of the intensity of
work and urban centers is important.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:17.110
But then I also have a whole part of my life
which I spend in nature physically.

00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:24.980
I surf, I spend time in a little village up
North, you know, the coast.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:33.149
And this is where the neurons are still firing
and everything processes.

00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:41.419
But the environment is sort of cleaned up
for inspiration and ideas to come.

00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:45.390
I mean I'm not someone who, to me everything
is mixed.

00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:50.330
I mean it not like I go to this little place
and this is where I get all my ideas.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:58.860
I think for most of us inspiration happens
all the time, continuously.

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.620
And our jobs allow us to do that right?

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:07.380
I mean were not sort of expected to be just
doing one thing today, were expected to be,

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.760
to have multiple roles, to have multiple ways
to input into the process.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:14.640
And I think that helps in some ways.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.950
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So this seems tied to your concept
of holistic making a little bit maybe then.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:23.580
Can you, I think some people might be familiar
with her, but can you help, perhaps explain

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.789
this a little bit more, this kind of concept
I think you're trying to bring to the conscious?

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:34.340
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah, you know holistic making for
me is the opportunity designers have today

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:48.760
to take that 360° view and to really again
not be used as just the problem solver for

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:55.299
one problem which is a graphic problem or
a user interface or a user experience problem

00:32:55.299 --> 00:32:58.690
or a physical product problem.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:07.820
What is being seen is somebody who can create
cohesiveness across a lot of these different

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.820
places.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:16.830
And I think it's widely understood today that
consumer experiences cannot have disconnected

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:18.380
points.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:25.649
They have to be, what we are doing now is
we're really sort of serving entire brand

00:33:25.649 --> 00:33:30.890
ecosystems in a way that doesn't have these
points of disconnects.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.570
Because those get noticed immediately.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.440
Those get, those points get pointed out immediately.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:41.180
And as designers we can now look at things
like, I mean this is a very physical thing

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.720
but it's kind of a cute project.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.330
We can look, you know we're giving these sort
of problems which is, oh why don't you rethink

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:50.330
the chandelier?

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:56.890
And then you go well, what people love about
chandeliers for centuries is all this sparkling

00:33:56.890 --> 00:34:01.360
little lights and the reflections and the
sort of rainbow colors that happened when

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.809
the light hits it.

00:34:03.809 --> 00:34:07.420
And then in a holistic way you're like okay
so that's the experience I think people are

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.060
looking for.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:18.229
Not this ancient physical thing that has like
thousands of crystals and you know 20 or 30

00:34:18.229 --> 00:34:21.010
lights or candles in the past on it.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:26.119
And we built this thing out of, not all the
reflections and all the magic and with one

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:28.960
crystal and one specially tuned LED light.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:37.019
And so holistically we looked at the effect,
we looked at the sustainability in our proposition.

00:34:37.019 --> 00:34:40.579
We looked at the attainability, making it
affordable rather than very expensive.

00:34:40.579 --> 00:34:48.710
So this has a bond that makes this a product
that can be retailed for $100, right.

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:55.220
So we can look at all these different elements
including the packaging and say this is a

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.240
holistic experience.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:02.759
Or it's looking at physical products like
what I'm wearing here.

00:35:02.759 --> 00:35:05.190
Or the first LED light here.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:11.049
But also the way you touch it and the way
it feels under hand pressure and looking at

00:35:11.049 --> 00:35:14.819
that first touch interface, this is a touch
interface before everything became touch,

00:35:14.819 --> 00:35:16.849
you know before the iPhone.

00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:21.529
Google Rep: what year was this?

00:35:21.529 --> 00:35:24.650
Yves: That was 2006.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:25.650
Yes.

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:28.650
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So just before the.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:29.650
&gt;&gt;:Yves: It's hard to imagine.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:30.650
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Yeah, I know.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.670
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Kids nowadays grow up with TV

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:33.560
screens that are broken right?

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.039
&gt;&gt;Yves: So this you know you would just touch
the surface there was no button to turn it

00:35:37.039 --> 00:35:38.469
on and off.

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:43.499
You just, you could change the intensity of
the light or the coloration of the life.

00:35:43.499 --> 00:35:49.420
And to me that's sort of, you know all of
this is sort of holistic making.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.009
Including thinking about the social ramifications
of what is that we do.

00:35:53.009 --> 00:36:01.670
In many ways, businesses can't really afford
to not look at sustainability or the social

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:07.769
impact that they have as part of the product,
as part of what it is that they make.

00:36:07.769 --> 00:36:10.660
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: One laptop per trial basis.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:18.260
&gt;&gt;Yves: This is in Peru and they have 1 million
laptops in Peru.

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.180
So we do a lot of nonprofit work.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:24.069
We do a lot of, just like Google of course.

00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:31.230
We do a lot of projects that try to bring
the intelligence of designs back to the widest

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.230
possible audience.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:36.809
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: And how do you justify the ROI
of those products?

00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:38.940
&gt;&gt;Yves: That's a good question.

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.589
We don't really; I think there's an ROI in
how you feel when you get up in the morning.

00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:44.589
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So the emotions, yeah.

00:36:44.589 --> 00:36:47.599
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Yves: I think there is.

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:54.650
That said, I mean I don't want to, these are
other things that we do.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:37:04.289
Or you know, like looking at sustainability
as this incredible opportunity to make the

00:37:04.289 --> 00:37:14.109
entire experience better, not to make something
recyclable or reusable or using less energy.

00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:19.069
But actually looking at the engagement at
the end and making that even better.

00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:20.719
So we can think about all these things holistically.

00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:25.470
But this is a program that I'm particularly
excited about and proud of because in many

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:33.479
ways this is a nonprofit program for the government
of Mexico at a nonprofit in Mexico that distributes

00:37:33.479 --> 00:37:35.180
eyeglasses to children.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:41.359
They can pick the top and bottom colors so
they become really involved into their own

00:37:41.359 --> 00:37:42.359
glasses.

00:37:42.359 --> 00:37:48.640
There's a big stigma everywhere in the world,
but in South America against wearing glasses.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.809
And so this makes them more personal and makes
them wear them.

00:37:51.809 --> 00:37:58.390
But as designers we can figure out how these
things are built, how they're robust, how

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:05.249
they cost five dollars to make including the
custom-made lenses.

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:11.739
But then so you do something like this which
is nonprofit and then working under these

00:38:11.739 --> 00:38:18.200
extreme constraints makes you look at the
entire value chain and the entire logistics

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.349
system in a new way.

00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:21.210
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Down to the actual object?

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:26.640
&gt;&gt;Yves: Down to the actual object, but also
the distribution, how they're picked.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:33.029
And then what you realize is I did something
for this nonprofit but there is a whole business

00:38:33.029 --> 00:38:34.130
model here.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:39.339
So we're building a for-profit version of
this sort of starting from the nonprofit and

00:38:39.339 --> 00:38:48.269
going to the for-profit version of this which
will finance the nonprofit, but also create

00:38:48.269 --> 00:38:50.390
sustainable business.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:39:00.529
We just now launched actually a bus that's
in the East Bay that's distributing eyeglasses,

00:39:00.529 --> 00:39:01.529
these very eyeglasses.

00:39:01.529 --> 00:39:03.160
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: The same ones that are going
to Mexico?

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.210
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah the same ones to kids up here.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:11.309
So we're already moving some of the aspects
of the nonprofit out here.

00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:13.700
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: And the "One Laptop per Child"
is a similar story right?

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.150
It was meant for Africa but it's been used
all over, right?

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:27.849
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah I mean in a way the $100 laptop
kind of made this idea that a smaller lighter

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:33.279
computer is something that was desirable which
we had heard from certain people in industry

00:39:33.279 --> 00:39:34.329
that it wasn't.

00:39:34.329 --> 00:39:35.740
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: MacBook Air.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:43.950
&gt;&gt;Yves: And so in a way it kind of, and Google
is a huge supporter of the $100 laptop.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:53.920
So in a way it kind of initiated maybe a different
look at the space.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:58.579
But it's most prominent now, the $100 laptop
is most prominent in South America..

00:39:58.579 --> 00:39:59.930
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Wow.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:03.369
Which is totally different from its original,
I mean the original mission was Africa.

00:40:03.369 --> 00:40:05.160
&gt;&gt;Yves: Well it was global.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.989
But the first large task and the first large
distributions were in...

00:40:09.989 --> 00:40:11.410
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Sub-Saharan Africa
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.489
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So, what is Yves dream project?

00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:17.499
I mean you've had the chance to work on chairs;
you've had the chance to work on glasses.

00:40:17.499 --> 00:40:20.949
You've had the chance to work on quantified
self wristbands.

00:40:20.949 --> 00:40:23.869
What is your dream project in many ways?

00:40:23.869 --> 00:40:32.499
&gt;&gt;Yves: So my advice to all designers is not
to have a dream project.

00:40:32.499 --> 00:40:39.589
Because if you have a dream project and you're
not gonna consider everything that you worked

00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:42.079
on as a potential dream project.

00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:46.619
And I can promise you, I can assure you that
in the first couple of meetings that I had

00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:51.519
with Puma and they're like, "We want you to
rethink our shoebox", and it's like oh, can

00:40:51.519 --> 00:40:58.079
I work on 
the shoes?

00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:02.760
[Laughter]
Until I realized wow no, the shoebox is gonna

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.500
have a much bigger impact.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:12.809
The shoebox is 80 million shoes that get shipped
around by this one brand and the consequences

00:41:12.809 --> 00:41:19.709
rather than a small kind of hipster line of
shoes that gets into a few kind of cool stores.

00:41:19.709 --> 00:41:24.430
I realize the impact of the shoebox is actually
so much bigger, so much more important, so

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:25.430
much more long-lasting.

00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:34.800
And so I turned the shoebox into, what many
people would now consider a dream project.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.359
Because you have this big impact, because
it's global.

00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:40.319
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: That chart you were showing
before.

00:41:40.319 --> 00:41:41.319
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah.

00:41:41.319 --> 00:41:43.150
This one.

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:48.559
And so many of the projects that have come
through to us, I'm just somebody who gets

00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:51.990
really excited about the really big potential
of it.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:42:00.640
I tend to see beyond maybe even the frame
and the limits that clients have brought us

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.789
these projects within those frames and limits.

00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:10.109
And I think I've turned a few and the team
at Fuseproject has turned a few things into

00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:11.339
potential dream project.

00:42:11.339 --> 00:42:19.469
But I can guarantee you that's not what they
seem to be at the onset.

00:42:19.469 --> 00:42:23.539
And so I think that's the best..

00:42:23.539 --> 00:42:24.690
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Dream project.

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:27.210
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah, that's the best one to live
in a way.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.789
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Yeah, without a dream project.

00:42:28.789 --> 00:42:37.009
&gt;&gt;Yves: Cause if you're constantly thinking
about if I worked on a car, or if I worked

00:42:37.009 --> 00:42:40.859
on a train, then I would really make it.

00:42:40.859 --> 00:42:45.349
Then I would live the designer dream.

00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:49.279
You can spend a career waiting for that.

00:42:49.279 --> 00:42:52.900
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: So let's get a little more abstract
then.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:57.509
What is the biggest challenge that you think
design needs to solve in the coming years,

00:42:57.509 --> 00:42:58.509
decades right?

00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:01.800
What are you most excited about in terms of
maybe a space.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:12.020
&gt;&gt;Yves: Well I think the things that design
is gonna solve are a few simple notions.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:15.819
I mean every business is gonna become sustainable
one way or the other.

00:43:15.819 --> 00:43:21.660
There's absolutely no way the current infrastructure
is gonna remain as is.

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:30.109
So at every stage when you're rethinking the
way things are done, the way things are built,

00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:36.940
the way things are shipped, the way things
are consumed, sustainability is gonna have

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.670
a very important role in that.

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:46.380
And that means that designers have this amazing
opportunity to participate in things like

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.769
the puma shoebox which is a logistics and
distribution...

00:43:49.769 --> 00:43:51.989
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Manufacturer.

00:43:51.989 --> 00:43:54.789
&gt;&gt;Yves: Manufacturing type of problem.

00:43:54.789 --> 00:44:02.079
But also a consumer, an engagement type of
design opportunity.

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:05.829
And so I think everything is gonna have to
be rethought in this way. and when you have

00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:13.920
to remake every factory or when you have to
reconceive the way everything is made designers

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.579
I gonna have an incredible role to play in
that.

00:44:16.579 --> 00:44:24.819
I also think that technology is the other
huge opportunity because technology has still

00:44:24.819 --> 00:44:28.160
numerous barriers.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:39.529
And in many ways making it attainable in the
sense of easy, approachable sort of magical,

00:44:39.529 --> 00:44:41.690
not disruptive.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:47.900
I mean just looking at the idiosyncrasies
of the ways that we use technology today.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:52.039
There's some huge improvements that are gonna
go on.

00:44:52.039 --> 00:44:54.319
And they're gonna in my opinion be design
driven.

00:44:54.319 --> 00:44:58.690
&gt;&gt; Google Rep: Great, so I've asked all the
questions that I have.

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:03.029
I think there's a number of Googlers here
that would love to have a time or a chance

00:45:03.029 --> 00:45:04.200
that's the question.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.890
So I opened it up to the audience.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.309
Looks like there's one back there.

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:12.920
&gt;&gt; Male #1: [Inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah, so the question is what is the

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:19.509
proportion of time that I spend or maybe my
team spends coming up with ideas versus implementing

00:45:19.509 --> 00:45:20.559
them?

00:45:20.559 --> 00:45:31.279
You know sort of crafting the sort of final
bits of those products or those experiences.

00:45:31.279 --> 00:45:38.729
You know it's to me, if we don't spend the
time to be there all the way through, til

00:45:38.729 --> 00:45:44.430
the final implementation, til the final refinement.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:51.599
If we're not there at the end sort of doing
quality control to make sure that the big

00:45:51.599 --> 00:46:01.150
idea, the big design, the visual, the experience
we've created isn't exactly as conceived at

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:07.589
the end, were gonna ship products that are
gonna be mediocre.

00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:10.940
Or that are not gonna achieve their full potential.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:15.559
So we actually spent a lot of time at the
very onset.

00:46:15.559 --> 00:46:20.109
You know what's the name of the company, what's
the big story here?

00:46:20.109 --> 00:46:23.989
Making the product again digital and physical.

00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:27.979
And testing it and using it and living with
it.

00:46:27.979 --> 00:46:34.460
All the way through the end so that when it
comes out the design criteria, the things

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.280
you get excited about in the beginning.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:43.769
The pillars that you created for this brand
of product are still there.

00:46:43.769 --> 00:46:50.390
So for me it's completely critical that as
designers we stay engaged all the way through.

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:56.319
And it's not just like passing the baton to
a developer or to an engineering group for

00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:57.319
to a manufacturer.

00:46:57.319 --> 00:47:01.309
You really have to be there all the way.

00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:09.490
That just means just engaging over a long
period of time and being fully supported in

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:12.440
that engagement obviously with whoever you
work with.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:19.940
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So on that topic, my question is
actually about platforms and what role design

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:23.759
takes in actually establishing or building
or creating platforms that other people build

00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:25.109
upon.

00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:33.079
And what role, I mean can you have like the
iPhone, [inaudible] Android or better microphones.

00:47:33.079 --> 00:47:38.819
When other people ultimately have to build
on thing that you've created.

00:47:38.819 --> 00:47:43.849
Is there sort of a hand off, how far do go
down the path of making things fairly restrictive

00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:47.539
in terms of the things that people built or
even like the old PC, like the apps that people

00:47:47.539 --> 00:47:48.539
would build there.

00:47:48.539 --> 00:47:53.469
How do you communicate I guess the things
you were trying to achieve and help them actually

00:47:53.469 --> 00:47:58.089
extend the value of what you are creating
as opposed to diminish that value?

00:47:58.089 --> 00:48:06.539
&gt;&gt;Yves: I think it's essential to create products
and experiences that fit within the current

00:48:06.539 --> 00:48:15.269
ethos which is people want to be able to modify,
change, own this sort of just in time mentality

00:48:15.269 --> 00:48:19.289
that we are all experiencing today.

00:48:19.289 --> 00:48:27.609
I'm taking a picture and I'm posting it immediately,
I wasn't doing that, I wouldn't take the picture

00:48:27.609 --> 00:48:28.609
anymore.

00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:33.960
I mean it used to be that I would wait a week
for that picture to be developed and handed

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.809
back to me.

00:48:36.809 --> 00:48:45.509
So in many ways I think the platforms have
to sort of tap into what simply is the current

00:48:45.509 --> 00:48:51.049
way everybody lives which is instance.

00:48:51.049 --> 00:48:55.469
You know and at the same time you want to
be able to have some things there that ensure

00:48:55.469 --> 00:49:01.319
level of quality or level of even potentially
design.

00:49:01.319 --> 00:49:12.859
But I think it's an interesting mix between
providing a well-designed platform that is

00:49:12.859 --> 00:49:20.119
sort of solid and exciting and that people
really want and at the same time leaving enough

00:49:20.119 --> 00:49:23.599
there for other people to own and to build
on top of.

00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:31.420
So I think that's definitely very different
from designing products that never change.

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:38.009
That, or that are very restrictive in a sense.

00:49:38.009 --> 00:49:41.499
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Pass it to, down there.

00:49:41.499 --> 00:49:42.999
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Hi.

00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:47.549
So you said your number one design principle
is to think about the user experience and

00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:48.970
not really asked aesthetics.

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:54.099
In your mind, what's an example of a really
ugly but well-designed product?

00:49:54.099 --> 00:50:00.380
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Yves: I don't know, I mean I don't know

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:08.499
if the paperclip is ugly, I don't think it's
ugly.

00:50:08.499 --> 00:50:13.689
I don't know that that product would be ugly
on purpose unless sort of there was a reason

00:50:13.689 --> 00:50:16.579
for it to be ugly.

00:50:16.579 --> 00:50:18.099
Do you have something in mind?

00:50:18.099 --> 00:50:19.099
&gt;&gt;Male #3: No, no.

00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:21.640
I was just wondering, I'm trying to understand
the principle.

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:29.589
&gt;&gt;Yves: I mean in many ways I think for something
to be beautiful is a function as well.

00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:36.599
It isn't just, you know I don't see the two
elements as separate.

00:50:36.599 --> 00:50:43.979
So I think you probably have some very useful
things that are very ugly.

00:50:43.979 --> 00:50:47.670
I mean I'm sure I see them every day.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:54.999
But that doesn't mean that, that doesn't make
them sort of the perfect product or the end

00:50:54.999 --> 00:51:00.089
all and be all of what this thing could be
or do for you.

00:51:00.089 --> 00:51:06.559
&gt;&gt;Male #4: So you talked about the role that
industrial design comes in 90s style more

00:51:06.559 --> 00:51:07.559
and more.

00:51:07.559 --> 00:51:12.939
Also taking on strategy, understanding how
to transform organizations to be successful.

00:51:12.939 --> 00:51:17.269
Given that though, what is the differentiating
role of the traditional industrial design

00:51:17.269 --> 00:51:19.849
aspect of form giving, of speaking through
form.

00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:22.029
Is that still relevant as a differentiator?

00:51:22.029 --> 00:51:26.411
I mean we are now competing against strategy
firms, against firms that don't have the design

00:51:26.411 --> 00:51:30.660
aspect but maybe covering a lot of other aspects
that organizations are looking for.

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:35.869
&gt;&gt;Yves: I think that there were certainly
in the 90s a whole tendency to go towards

00:51:35.869 --> 00:51:38.499
management consulting.

00:51:38.499 --> 00:51:46.609
And I think there are all kinds of interesting
reasons to do that, but they're not the ones

00:51:46.609 --> 00:51:50.789
that are we're shaping our firm around.

00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:52.469
We believe in making.

00:51:52.469 --> 00:51:58.499
I believe in organizational change by making,
by example.

00:51:58.499 --> 00:52:08.849
I do believe that when projects, anywhere
in any business kind of sort of acquire a

00:52:08.849 --> 00:52:14.720
level of success by having been done differently
or by proving that the company can do things

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:21.859
differently or achieve things differently
is a much better way to do management change

00:52:21.859 --> 00:52:29.969
or education than just trying to have a few
brainstorms with top management.

00:52:29.969 --> 00:52:36.539
And so I think what you need to find though
is you need to find companies that will open

00:52:36.539 --> 00:52:38.390
up the door for this to happen.

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:45.670
That will say okay well we'll give a chance
with something different to happen and prove

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:54.180
that there is a new approach that we are not
familiar with that could be successful.

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.809
And we find more and more of those companies
now.

00:52:56.809 --> 00:53:05.729
We're not really competing because we don't
deliver a strategy product, or we don't deliver,

00:53:05.729 --> 00:53:09.719
we don't even deliver a product product per
se only.

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:13.369
You know what we do is we build brands and
we build businesses.

00:53:13.369 --> 00:53:15.010
And in that sense...

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:20.300
&gt;&gt;Male #4: But you're taking a recognizable
Fuseproject identity that kind of weaves through

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:26.269
a lot of the physicalness of the product,
like anywhere from perfume bottles, to some

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:29.900
of the watches, to some of the things where
there's some unique aspect I would say is

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.180
still there that maybe.

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.809
Like consciously people feel attracted to.

00:53:33.809 --> 00:53:38.099
&gt;&gt;Yves: Yeah I mean we definitely want people
to be attracted to what we do.

00:53:38.099 --> 00:53:45.150
And so being attractive, or being successful
for our products is a key element, and I could

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:50.849
certainly say that that's intentional, that's
something we look for.

00:53:50.849 --> 00:53:59.500
We don't really, unless there is a role of
more of a laboratory type of project or an

00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:07.079
experimental type project the goal is certainly
for things to reach as many people as possible

00:54:07.079 --> 00:54:15.029
and make whatever idea or business or experience
understood and adopted and loved.

00:54:15.029 --> 00:54:18.019
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Alright, well I think we're
out of time.

00:54:18.019 --> 00:54:21.859
If you still have a question you should come
up and ask Yves but let's all thank him for

00:54:21.859 --> 00:54:22.859
coming in.

00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:24.189
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Yves: Thank you.

00:54:24.189 --> 00:54:25.900
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: Thank you.

00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.609
&gt;&gt;Yves: Thanks very much.

00:54:27.609 --> 00:54:29.749
&gt;&gt;Google Rep: That was awesome.
