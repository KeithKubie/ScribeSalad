1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,150
When I realized that losing your
temper was a sign of weakness.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,660
As soon as I read, as soon
as I made that connection,

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,770
I said to myself this week I'm
gonna try not to do it anymore.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,000
And what's weird is when you're a kid,
I don't know if you remember this,

5
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:23,001
but when I was a kid and you'd see
someone get angry and it made you afraid.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,530
And so for a while I saw it
as like a power, you know,

7
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:33,531
it's kind of a way to achieve power that
you can lose your temper and then all

8
00:00:33,661 --> 00:00:37,980
of a sudden you have this extra strength.
And so when you're a little kid,

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,600
and when I say a little kid, I mean when
I was 1314 years old, I thought, hey,

10
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:46,500
if I go, if I could get that rage
going, and people are scared,

11
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:50,670
like I used to feel. That's a
positive thing. And then like I said,

12
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:52,580
as I got older, now you, you know,

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,240
now you're talking 1615
1617 I realized, hey,

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,883
this isn't,

15
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,120
yeah,

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,610
this isn't cool. This isn't
strength, it's actually weakness.

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,420
And when I realized it was weakness,
and I didn't realize that overnight,

18
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,130
but I started getting the
idea that that was weakness.

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,180
And now

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,040
when you see someone that is in control
and even when bad things are happening

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,250
there, you know, there's, there's
standing stoically saying, okay,

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,820
let me take another look at that and
I'll get it done. You know what I mean?

23
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,510
When they're just okay, then you realize,
okay, this guy's really unflappable,

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,520
which is a lot more impressive. So again,

25
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,300
you, you gotta be able to
detach from this. And you know,

26
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,750
I like to take pride in the fact that
I'm gonna keep my cool no matter what

27
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,600
happens. And definitely once I was in
that, once you're in the seal teams,

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,150
you definitely want to be
that guy that's keeping your,

29
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:46,500
keeping your cool no
matter what's happening,

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,550
whether it's people are doing the wrong
thing or you just want to be the guy

31
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:53,070
that's, hey, okay, come back
over here. We need to Redo this.

32
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,850
You just want to be that guy that's way
more impressive than the guy that does

33
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:01,820
not get bullied. Don't be that person.
So, and I've talked about this before,

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,840
what are the pre event indicators that
show you or reveal to you that your

35
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:13,350
temper is about to be lost? What are
they? Is it you clench your fist,

36
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:17,700
right? Is it you raise your voice and
you start doing it, doing that stuff?

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,020
Do you start to heavy breathing? Do
you flow, flair your nostrils, right.

38
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,290
Cause that's an animal thing where
you're going to take in more oxygen.

39
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:28,950
So you open up the nostrils cause
you're about to get after it. Do you,

40
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:33,750
you know, use your, does your, your
head, you know, shaking or whatever.

41
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,610
You can just like these
things. What is it,

42
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,660
what indicators do you have when you know
that you're starting to feel that and

43
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:44,460
as soon as you feel that you're detach,
you go, oh, that's what that is.

44
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:48,540
That's an indicator and it's a
weakness and I don't like weakness,

45
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,500
so I'm not going to allow it. And then,

46
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,790
yeah, take a breath.

47
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,120
Okay.

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,780
I like to say, know what?
Here's a good one. You want to,

49
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,540
you want to get through that, that moment.

50
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,570
Nod your head slowly in the affirmative,

51
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,710
right? So, so when someone's telling
me something that's making me mad,

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,660
I'll just slowly nod my head. Like,

53
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,320
I understand this is the way things are.

54
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,530
I accept this and this is

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,360
calculating what my next move is
gonna be. Uh, and then, you know,

56
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,650
you're seeing whatever, you know,
guys will count to 10. You know,

57
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,830
you tell you a little kids that tell
you a little kids when they start losing

58
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,790
their temper, you know what?

59
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:39,340
You need to count to 10 count
to 10 count to a hundred,

60
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:43,300
counter thousand or whatever did
you gotta do and get control.

61
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,710
Because like I said, if you're losing
control, it's not strike it's weakness.
