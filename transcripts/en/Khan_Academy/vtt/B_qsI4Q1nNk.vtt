00:00:00.823 --> 00:00:01.760
- [Instructor] In a previous video,

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.930
we started thinking about things
like population growth rate

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.880
and how it relates to the birth rate

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.670
and the death rate within a population,

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.190
and we related that to some

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.770
of the seemingly complex formulas

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.380
that you might see on an
AP Biology formula sheet.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.370
Now we're going to
extend that conversation

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.490
to discuss some of the other
formulas you might see,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.380
but to realize that they
really are just intuition

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.930
using a little bit of fancy math notation.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.170
So just as a little bit of review,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.080
we looked at an example where,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.260
in a population, the birth
rate is 60 bunnies per year,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.240
we're talking about bunnies here,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.530
it's a population of bunnies,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.580
and the death rate is 15 bunnies per year,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.630
well, what's the population growth rate?

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.890
Well, in a given year,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.910
you would expect 60 bunnies to be born,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.630
so that would add to the population.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.610
And you would expect 15 bunnies to die,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.730
so that would take away
from the population,

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.720
for a net increase of 49 bunnies per year.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.170
And to put that in the language

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.640
of your AP Biology formula sheet,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.890
the notation they use for
population growth rate,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.810
they use a fancy notation,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.310
so actually, let me
just write it over here,

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.163
they say N is equal to your population,

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:09.710
N is equal to population,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.350
and then your population growth rate,

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.240
they use calculus notation.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.240
So our change in population
per change in time.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.940
This is really talking
about something in calculus

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.470
known as instantaneous change,

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.990
but we don't have to get too bogged down

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.150
with that just yet.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.610
But your population growth rate,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.310
which you could use this notation for,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.990
is equal to your birth
rate, 60 bunnies per year,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.830
and the notation they use
for birth rate is just B.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.250
They don't use the same
rate notation for that.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.490
I probably would have, but that's fine,

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.990
I'm just trying to make you familiar

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.130
with what you might see.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.100
And then minus the death rate.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.780
Minus D.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.700
So this right over here is something

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460
that you would see on that formula sheet,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.940
but it makes fairly intuitive sense.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.310
Now the next idea we're
going to think about

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.410
is something known as a per capita

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.270
growth rate of population.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.500
Let me write it out in words first.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.440
So, here we're going to think about

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.290
a per capita

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.270
growth rate, or population growth rate.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.150
Per capita population growth rate.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.010
Now per capita means you could view it

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.240
as on average per individual.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.010
What is the average growth
rate per individual?

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.010
What is that going to be?

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.930
Pause this video and
try to think about it.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.340
Well, one way you could think about it,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.500
is the total population growth rate,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.650
divided by the population,

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.040
divided by the number of people there are.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.570
So it's going to be our
population growth rate,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.520
growth rate, divided by,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.670
divided by our population.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.503
Population.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.850
Now, let's say that we have
a population of 300 bunnies.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.350
Actually, let's make the
math a little bit simpler.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.660
Let's say we have a
population of 450 bunnies.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.350
So what is going to be our per capita

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.460
population growth rate?

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.490
Pause this video and
try to figure that out.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.020
Well, if we have a
population of 450 bunnies,

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.690
450 bunnies.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.350
Our population growth rate
per the number of people,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.040
or number of bunnies, I should say,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.840
is going to be equal to,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.410
our population growth rate is 45 bunnies,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.003
bunnies per year.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.690
And that's going to be

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.090
for every 450 bunnies.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.660
450 bunnies.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.860
Which will get us to,

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.750
45 divided by 450 is 0.1,

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.490
and then the units, bunnies
cancel with bunnies,

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.350
so it's 0.1 per year.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.870
Now why is per capita population
growth rate interesting?

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.480
Well, it tells us just how likely,

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.190
and in most populations,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.570
you need at least a male and a female

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.500
in order to reproduce,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.880
but there are some organisms

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.510
that can just split and
reproduce asexually.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.510
But it tells on average
per individual organism

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.370
how much are they going to grow per year?

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.900
So it gives you a sense of that.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.340
Now connecting it to the notation

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.170
that you might see on an
AP Biology formula sheet,

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.250
it would look like this,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.000
the per capita population growth rate

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.050
is usually denoted by
the lowercase letter r,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.020
and then they would say that
that is going to be equal

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.120
to our population growth rate.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.630
Which, we've already seen that notation.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.800
The rate of change of our
population with respect to time,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.990
dN dt, divided by our population,

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.870
divided by our population.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.640
Now we can algebraically
manipulate this a little bit,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.330
to get another expression.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.270
We could multiply both
sides times our uppercase N,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.330
times our population.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.860
And we're going to get dN
dt is equal to N times r,

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.660
or r times N, let me rewrite it.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.930
We can rewrite this as dN dt

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.930
is equal to our per capita
population growth rate,

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.833
times our population.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.220
Now, this once again makes sense.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.100
If you say, okay, this is how many people,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.400
how many individuals I have,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.260
and if in a given year, they
grow by this much on average,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.300
well, if you multiply the two,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.810
you'll know how much the
whole population has grown.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.940
So if we didn't know these
numbers and someone said,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.990
hey, well, actually, we
can think about this,

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.210
let's think about now a
population of 1000 bunnies.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.930
So if N was equal to 1000.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.760
And I'll say they're
the same type of bunnies

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.340
that have the same
probability of reproducing,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.310
and the same likelihood,

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.020
so we know that r is equal 0.1 per year.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.260
For this population of bunnies,

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.130
what is going to be our
population growth rate?

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.330
Pause this video and
try to figure that out.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.160
Well in this situation,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.160
dN dt is going to be our per
capita population growth rate,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.860
so it's going to 0.1 per year,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.650
times our population.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.560
Times 1000 bunnies,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.430
bunnies, I'll keep my units here, bunnies,

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.350
and so this is going to be equal to,

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.334
1000 times a tenth is 100,

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:37.360
we're in that color.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.360
It's 100 bunnies, bunnies per year.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.080
So hopefully you're
getting an appreciation

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.060
for why these types of formulas,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.130
which are fairly straightforward,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.780
they're using just a fancy
notation, are useful.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.620
Now, this is also an
interesting thing to look at.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.810
Because even though this is
in fancy calculus notation,

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.060
and they're saying that our
rate of change of population

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.910
is equal to r times our population,

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.960
this is actually a differential equation,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.520
if you were to think about
what this population,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.670
the type of population
this would describe,

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.060
this would actually be a population

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.920
that's growing exponentially.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.840
So this is often known as an
exponential growth equation,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.453
let me write that down.

00:07:18.453 --> 00:07:23.380
Exponential, exponential growth.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.460
And, in other, in your math classes,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.460
in your calculus classes,

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.490
or even in your precalculus classes,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.310
you will study exponential growth.

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.600
In a biology class, you're
really just thinking about

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.890
how to manipulate this a little bit.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.480
But just to give you a little sense

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.440
of what's going on with
exponential growth,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.400
if you have a population of bunnies

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.850
with this type of exponential growth,

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.810
what is happening here, this is time,

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.140
and this is your population,

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.700
so you're going to have some
starting population here,

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.410
and it's just going to grow exponentially.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.970
And the higher the r is,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.430
the steeper this exponential
growth curve is going to be.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.700
But this describes how
populations can grow

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.840
if they are not constrained
by the environment in any way.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.660
They have just as much
land, as much water,

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.390
and as much food as they need,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.960
eventually, the bunnies will
fill the surface of the earth,

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.670
and the universe, and now, obviously,

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.220
we know that that is not
a realistic situation,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.430
that any ecosystem has some
natural carrying capacity,

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.010
there's only so much food,
there's only so much land.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.180
At some point, there's
just going to be bunnies

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.030
falling from trees, and
it's going to be much easier

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:28.110
for predators to get them,
and all these other things.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.494
And we will discuss
that in the next video.

00:08:30.494 --> 00:08:33.670
How do we adapt the
exponential growth equation

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.250
right over here to factor
in a little bit more

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.730
of a real-world situation,

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.130
where at some population,
you're going to be hitting up

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.363
against the carrying
capacity of the environment?
