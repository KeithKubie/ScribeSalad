00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.200
Now that you know a little bit more
about both write rules and validate

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.800
rules, you might be wondering what the
exact differences are between the two.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.800
After all they are both executed when
you try to write data to a database.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.600
Part of the difference is in their use.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.960
Validation rules should be used to
ensure the correct structure and format

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.100
of data, whereas right rules deal with
who has access to write to that data.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.940
Functionally, the fact that
write rules cascade down and

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.422
validate rules do not is very important.

00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:27.390
Write rules should be used to map
out portions of the data structure

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.950
that particular users
have access to write to.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.710
Whereas validate rules should be used
to deny a user with write access

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.340
if they're trying to do
something strange to the data.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.300
Write rules therefore become
about giving access to someone.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.490
Whereas validate rules can be used to
further restrict improper data editing.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.300
For example, you could use a write rule
to say that a user could alter an item's

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.980
properties if they're the owner of
the list or shared on that list.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.200
But say you want to also verify that
there are some true things specific

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.060
to each property, to make sure that
the property is being used correctly.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.730
For example, you could validate
that they change the item

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.250
only to words that start
with capital letters.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.510
Or you could do something like check
that the user is shopping at a list

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.970
if they want to edit the bought
property of an item.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.395
And finally, another functional
difference that I've mentioned but

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:15.932
is very good to be again reminded of
is that validate rules are not executed

00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:17.828
when something is deleted or removed.

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:21.643
And basically what this means is that
if you ever need to restrict access

00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:25.668
to deleting or removing items, you'd
need to use the write rule for that.

00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:27.510
Okay, hope that clears
things up a little bit.
