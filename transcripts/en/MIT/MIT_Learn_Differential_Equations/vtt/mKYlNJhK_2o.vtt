00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.400
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.300
So this is about the
world's fastest way

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.080
to solve differential equations.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.320
And you'll like that method.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.240
First we have to
see what equations

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.310
will we be able to solve.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.440
Well, linear,
constant coefficients.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.510
I made all the coefficients
1, but no problem

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.350
to change those to A, B, C.
So the nice left-hand side.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.540
And on the right-hand side,
we also need something nice.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.300
We want a nice function.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.220
And I'll tell you which
are the nice functions.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.730
So I can say right away
that e to the exponentials

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.370
are nice functions, of course.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.960
They're are always at the
center of this course.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.840
So for example,
equal e to the st.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.290
That would be a nice function.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.410
OK.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.820
And the key is, we're looking
for a particular solution,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.160
because we know how to
find null solutions.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.940
We're looking for particular
solution for this equation.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.470
One function, some
function that solves

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.130
this equation with
right-hand side e to the st.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.330
And the point is, we
know what to look for.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.950
We just have some
coefficient to find.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.276
And we'll find that by
substituting in the equation.

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:30.650
Now, do you remember
what we look

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.700
for when the right-hand
side is e to the st?

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:43.640
Then look for y equals some
constant times e to the st,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.560
right?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.240
When f of t-- maybe I'll put
the equal sign down there.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.040
If f of t is e to the st, then I
just look for a multiple of it.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.330
That's one coefficient to be
determined by substitute this

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.500
into the equation.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.170
Do you remember the results?

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.040
So this is our best example.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.650
When I put this in the equation,
I'll get the derivative

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.980
brings an s.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.130
Second derivative
brings another s.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:22.650
So I get s squared and an s
and a 1 times y e to the st

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.490
is equal to e to the st.
We've done that before.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.830
Here we see it as a case with
undetermined coefficient y.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.870
But by plugging it
in, I've discovered

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.160
that y is 1 over that.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.910
So that's a nice function then.
e to the st is a nice function.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.400
What are the other
nice functions?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.250
So now, let me move to the other
board, next board, and ask,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.910
what other right-hand
sides could we solve?

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.570
So I'll keep this
left-hand side equal to.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.265
So e to the st was 1.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.156
What about t?

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.365
What about t?

00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:14.920
A polynomial.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.070
Well, that only has one term.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.210
So what would be a particular
solution to that equation?

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:30.210
So I really have to say, what
is the-- try y particular

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.530
equals-- now, if
I see a t there,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.820
then I'm going to
look for a t in y.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.180
And I'll also look
for a constant.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.330
So a plus bt would be the
correct form to look for.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.420
Let me just show
you how that works.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.020
So this now has two
undetermined coefficients.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.090
And we determine them by
putting that into the equation

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.530
and making it right.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.810
So try yp is a plus
bt in this equation.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.250
OK, the second derivative
of a plus bt is 0.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.370
The first derivative
of that is b.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.529
So I get a b from that.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:23.900
And y itself is a plus bt.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.580
And that's supposed to give t.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.450
You see, I plugged it in.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.850
I got to this equation.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:38.160
Now I can determine a
and b by matching t.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.750
So then b has to be 1.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.190
We get b equal to 1.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.960
So the t equals t.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.370
But if b is 1, I need a to
b minus 1 to cancel that.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.570
So a is minus 1.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.725
And my answer is
minus 1 plus 1t.

00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:02.350
t minus 1.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.010
And if I put that into the
equation, it will be correct.

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.750
So I have found a
particular solution,

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.290
and that's my goal,
because I know

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.370
how to find null solutions.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.780
And then together, that's
the complete solution.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.120
So we've learned what
to try with polynomials.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.720
With a power of t,
we want to include

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.760
that power and all lower
powers, all the way down

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.440
through the constants.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.090
OK.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.740
With exponentials, we just have
to include the exponential.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.340
What next?

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.640
How about sine t or cosine t?

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.760
Say sine t.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.190
So that case works.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.280
Now we want to try y double
prime plus y prime plus

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.920
y equals, say, sine t.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.960
OK.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.530
What form do we assume for that?

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.390
Well, I can tell you quickly.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.110
We assume a sine t in it.

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.820
And we also need to
assume a cosine t.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:15.080
The rule is that the things
we try-- so I'll try y.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.010
y particular is what
we're always finding.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:26.730
Some c1 cos t, and
some c2 sine of t.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:30.680
That will do it.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.530
In fact, if I plug that in,
and I match the two sides,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.180
I determine c1 and
c2, I'm golden.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.070
Let me just comment
on that, rather

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.700
than doing out every step.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.200
Again, the steps are
just substitute that in

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.090
and make the equation correct
by choosing a good c1 and c2.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.220
I just noticed
that, you remember

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:06.870
from Euler's great
formula that the cosine is

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.490
a combination of e to the
it and e to the minus it.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.570
So in a way, we're really
using the original example.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:22.230
We're using this example,
e to the st, with two

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.360
s's, e to the it, and
e to the minus it.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.710
So we have two
exponentials in a cosine.

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.870
So I'm not surprised that there
are two constants to find.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.820
And now, finally, I
have to say, is this

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.040
the end of nice functions?

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.830
So nice functions include
exponentials, polynomials.

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:54.280
These are really exponentials,
complex exponentials.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.780
And no, there's one
more possibility

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.930
that we can deal with
in this simple way.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.470
And that possibility
is a product

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:12.810
of-- so now I'll show you what
to do if it was t times sine t.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:18.210
Suppose we have the
right-hand side, the f of t,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.590
the forcing term,
is t times sine t.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.540
What is the form to assume?

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.060
That's really all you have to
know is what form to assume?

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.900
OK.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:34.190
Now, that t-- so we have here
a product, a polynomial times

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.190
a sine or cosine or exponential.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.740
I could have done t
e to the st there.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:46.720
But what do I have to do
when the t shows up there?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:56.010
Then I have to try something
more with that t in there.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.320
So now I have a product
of polynomial times

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.700
sine, cosine, or exponential.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:11.640
So what I try is at plus--
or rather, a plus bt.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.060
I try a product.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:27.040
Times cos t and c
plus dt times sine t.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.840
That's about as bad a case
as we're going to see.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.570
But it's still quite pleasant.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.810
So what do I see there?

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:41.450
Because of the t here, I
needed to assume polynomials up

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.930
to that same degree 1.

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.560
So a plus bt.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.310
Had to do that, just
the way I did up there

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:50.670
when there was a t.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.460
But now it multiplies sine t.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.190
So I have to allow sine
t and also cosine t.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.160
The pattern is, really,
we've sort of completed

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.000
the list of nice functions.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.140
Exponentials, polynomials, and
polynomial times exponential.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.130
That's really what
a nice function is.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.660
A polynomial times
an exponential.

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.600
Or we could have a
sum of those guys.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.330
We could have two or three
polynomial times exponential,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.560
like there and another one.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.090
And that's still
a nice function.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.460
And what's the real
key to nice functions?

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:39.850
The key point is, why is this
such a good bunch of functions?

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.690
Because, if I take
its derivative,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.200
I get a function
of the same form.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.860
If I take the derivative
of that right-hand side,

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.290
and I use the
product rule, you see

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.760
I'll get this times
the derivative of that.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.750
So I'll have something
looking with a sine in there.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:03.320
And I get this
times the derivative

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.970
of that, which is just a b.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.850
So again, it fits the same
form, polynomial times cosine,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.770
polynomial times sine.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.950
So here I have a case
where I have actually four

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:16.220
coefficients.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.700
But they'll all fall
out when you plug that

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.640
into the equation.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.010
You just match terms
and your golden.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.614
So it really is a
straightforward method.

00:11:28.614 --> 00:11:29.280
Straightforward.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.100
So the key about
nice functions is--

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.300
and they're nice for
Laplace transforms,

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.850
they're nice at every step.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:46.800
But it's the same good functions
that we keep discovering

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.680
as our best examples.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:54.210
The key about nice functions
is that the-- that's

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.770
a form of a nice function
because its derivative has

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:59.350
the same form.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:05.450
The derivative of that function
fits that pattern again.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.280
And then the second
derivative fits.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.600
All the derivatives fit.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:14.610
So when we put them in the
equation, everything fits.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:18.510
And always in the last
minute of a lecture,

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.730
there's a special case.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.640
There's a special case.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.760
And let's remember what that is.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.960
So special case when we
have to change the form.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.980
And why would we
have to do that?

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:42.580
Let me do y double prime
minus y, say, is e to the t.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.250
What is special about that?

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.200
What's special is that
this right-hand side,

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.905
this f function,
solves this equation.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.040
If I try e to the
t, it will fail.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:07.322
Try y equals some Y e to the t.

00:13:07.322 --> 00:13:09.500
Do you see how
that's going to fail?

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:14.330
If I put that into the
equation, the second derivative

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.870
will cancel the y and I'll
have 0 on the left side.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:23.290
Failure, because that's
the case called resonance.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:26.480
This is a case of
resonance, when

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.830
the form of the right-hand
side is a null solution

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:32.580
at the same time.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:36.410
It can't be a
particular solution.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.350
It won't work because
it's also a null solution.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.590
And do you remember how
to escape resonance?

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:44.570
How to deal with resonance?

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.590
What happens with resonance?

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:48.990
The solution is a
little more complicated,

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.670
but it fits everything here.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.930
We have to assume to allow a t.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.560
We have to allow a t.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.750
So instead of this multiple,
the and in this thing,

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:08.060
we have to allow-- so I'm
going to assume-- I have

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.370
to have-- I need a t in there.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.870
Oh, no.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.510
Actually, I don't.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.340
I just need a t.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.340
That would do it.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.210
When there's resonance,
take the form

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:27.060
you would normally
assume and multiply

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.750
by that extra factor t.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:34.730
Then, when I substitute that
into the differential equation,

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.050
I'll find Y's quite safely.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.910
I'll find Y entirely safely.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.790
So I do that.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:44.500
So that's the resonant case,
the sort of special situation

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:49.840
when e to the t solved this.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.960
So we need something new.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.420
And the way we get the right new
thing is to have a t in there.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.830
So when I plug that in, I take
the second derivative of that,

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.490
subtract off that
itself, match e to the t.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:07.710
And that will tell
me the number Y.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.090
Perhaps it's 1/2 or 1.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.870
I won't do it.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.760
Maybe I'll leave
that as an exercise.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:21.040
Put that into the equation and
determine the number capital

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.730
Y. OK.

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.540
Let me pull it together.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.470
So we have certain
nice functions,

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.820
which we're going to see
again, because they're nice.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.320
Every method works well
for these functions.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.800
And these functions are
exponentials, polynomials,

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.640
or polynomials
times exponentials.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.070
And within exponentials,
I include sine and cosine.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:50.830
And for those functions,
we know the form.

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.220
We plug it into the equation.

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.830
We make it match.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.260
We choose these
undetermined coefficients.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:02.090
We determine them so that
they solve the equation.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.620
And then we've got a
particular solution.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:12.030
So this is the best
equations to solve

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.800
to find particular solutions.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:19.100
Just by knowing the right form
and finding the constants,

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:24.090
it did come out of the
particular equation.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:24.860
OK.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.910
All good, thanks.
