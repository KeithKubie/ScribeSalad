Hi. I'm Magnus.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.824
&gt;&gt; And I'm Jocelyn. [SOUND] Welcome to the course Building

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:16.549
Scalable Applications on Google Infrastructure.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:20.311
&gt;&gt; Jocelyn and I work at Google with Cloud Platform, and we will teach

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:22.461
you how to build scalable systems that

00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:25.503
runs on Google infrastructure, and that can scale.

00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:26.291
&gt;&gt; And scale.

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:27.420
&gt;&gt; And scale.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.210
&gt;&gt; And scale.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.790
&gt;&gt; And scale. Because here at Google, we know how to build scalable system.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.620
&gt;&gt; That's right, and now your applications can run on Google infrastructure,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.120
as well. I will be teaching you the theory around building scalable systems.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.740
&gt;&gt; And I'll be hacking right along with you.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.050
&gt;&gt; Let's get started.
