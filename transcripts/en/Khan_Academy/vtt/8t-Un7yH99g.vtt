SALMAN KHAN: I'm here
with Professor Laurence

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.490
Baker from Stanford
Medical School,

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.690
and I'm hoping he
can at least start

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.340
to get me to understand
something that I've always

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.000
wondered about and worried
about a little bit.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.787
Let's say that I'm
some drug company.

00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:13.870
So let me write this down.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.030
So I'm some pharma
company, pharma company

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.780
A right over here,
and let's say that I

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:27.370
invest 10 years and $100
million in some drug.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.300
I get it through all
of the clinical trials,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.619
and it gets approved by the FDA.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:41.980
And let's say, just for sake of
simplicity, it cures disease x.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.830
Now once I get to
that point, I'm

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.230
feeling pretty good about
myself as a pharma company.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.580
What happens next?

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.996
I'm assuming that I'm going
to have to go to the insurance

00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:52.744
companies and maybe
Medicaid and Medicare

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:54.910
and figure out how much
they're going to pay for it,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.305
but how does that
conversation even happen?

00:00:57.305 --> 00:00:57.890
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.473
So you're going to
have a conversation

00:00:59.473 --> 00:01:00.860
with a bunch of different folks.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.110
In the US, we have lots of
different private insurance

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.610
plans.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.860
We've got government plans.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.080
And you're actually going
to have conversations

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.751
with Europe and with some of the
other systems around the world,

00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:11.000
because each system is going
to make its own decision.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.950
SALMAN KHAN: And they have
a different way of doing it.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.860
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: They may some

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.830
have similarities in the
way that they probably

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.810
want to talk to you about.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.060
SALMAN KHAN: Does there
tend to be a lead system?

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.850
Does it tend to be
either the Europeans,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.890
or does it tend to be the
private insurers in the US?

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.840
Or do you just start all of
those conversations at once

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.120
because there's so much
money on the table?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.585
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: So there

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.700
will be some strategy
your business is going

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.865
to come to because it's
very hard to have all

00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:31.930
of these conversations
exactly simultaneously.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.154
So you'll talk to the US.

00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:34.070
You'll talk to Europe.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.814
And there are some
cases in which people

00:01:35.814 --> 00:01:37.730
have viewed the regulatory
processes in Europe

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.188
as a little easier
for some things,

00:01:39.188 --> 00:01:40.752
so they may want
to start in Europe.

00:01:40.752 --> 00:01:42.710
But in other cases, if
you're looking at a drug

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.860
that maybe some of the
national systems in Europe

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.580
are less likely to
want to pay for,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.790
you might want to start
with the US, where

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.960
there's a little
more flexibility.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.710
SALMAN KHAN: But the
general rule of thumb

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.357
is all the money is in Europe
and the US mainly right now.

00:01:53.357 --> 00:01:54.940
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: A lot of it.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.759
The Asian systems, some of
them are pretty sophisticated

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.550
and using a lot of the
advanced drugs, too,

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.785
but I think the
majority of the money

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:02.380
is in the US and
Europe, North America.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.171
SALMAN KHAN: And between
Europe and the US,

00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.836
I guess I've always imagined
North America was maybe

00:02:06.836 --> 00:02:08.169
where the bulk of the money was.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.219
But is that the case?

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.510
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER:
The US, well, our health care

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.468
system spends more than
everybody in the world,

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:14.680
and it's true for drugs, too.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.040
We spend more on drugs here
than most other places.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.706
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:02:16.706 --> 00:02:19.782
So definitely if I'm
here, pharma company A,

00:02:19.782 --> 00:02:21.740
I want to make sure I
get this right in the US.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.330
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.740
Eventually you probably
care a lot about the US.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.665
SALMAN KHAN: Part
of my investment

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:26.860
that I made is based on
some understanding that,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.750
if I got all the
way through, that I

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.390
would get some type of
return within the US.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.449
Will I necessarily
immediately go to Medicare

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.240
because they're one of
the largest players,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.600
or will I go to, like we
talked about, Blue Cross Blue

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.080
Shield or Kaiser or some
of these other players?

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.625
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: So Medicare

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:45.910
is actually an interesting
one for drug prices

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.500
because, historically, Medicare
has not been a big coverer

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.310
and still isn't of a lot of
the drugs that you hear about.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.080
So Medicare does
not pay by itself

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.087
for outpatient drugs, drugs
that you might take at home.

00:02:58.087 --> 00:02:58.920
SALMAN KHAN: Really?

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.490
I always assumed
that-- they don't.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.073
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: So Medicare,

00:03:02.073 --> 00:03:04.770
in its main pieces-- Medicare,
we call Part A, Part B,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.840
Part C-- so Part A and
Part B, let's start there.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.050
They tend not to cover, or they
don't cover, outpatient drugs.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.480
If you get a drug
in the hospital

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.124
while you're hospitalized,
Medicare will pay for those.

00:03:16.124 --> 00:03:17.540
And so if you've
got a drug that's

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.991
going to be primarily
used in that setting,

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.740
you're going to talk
to Medicare about it,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.180
and that's going to
be an important piece

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.013
of the conversation.

00:03:24.013 --> 00:03:26.080
But if you're talking
about an outpatient drug,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.035
you're talking to
many [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:27.035 --> 00:03:28.520
SALMAN KHAN: Now, when
we're saying outpatient,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.880
inpatient is you're
in the hospital.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.379
You're sick.

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.360
You need, I don't know,
morphine right now.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.430
That's inpatient drug.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.870
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.890
SALMAN KHAN: Outpatient is,
hey, you're going back home.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.160
Take this three times a day.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.420
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.570
Somebody sends you
to the pharmacy

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.620
to pick up the prescription,
and you take it home with you.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.690
That's going to be an
outpatient kind of drug.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.710
So Medicare doesn't cover that
in its main Part A and Part B.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.840
There's Medicare Part D, which
is a drug plan in Medicare,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.470
and that will cover a lot
of the outpatient drugs.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.810
And so there you'd have
conversations with them.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.290
But most of the
Medicare Part D plans

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.970
are essentially
private companies

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.233
that Medicare contracts with.

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:04.170
So you're not really talking to
the government at that point.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.920
You're talking to these
private plans that

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.140
have contracted with Medicare
to provide Part D care.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.940
SALMAN KHAN: So once
again going back

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.475
to the crux of the question
of how are these drugs going

00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:12.850
to get paid for,
how are we going

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.690
to determine the price at
which these drugs get paid for,

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.540
it goes straight back
to the private plans

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.207
again because they're
going to contract.

00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:21.206
Part D is going to say,
oh, you're Medicare Part

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:22.860
D. We're going to
go to go to Aetna.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.760
We're going to go to some other
plan or whoever it might be.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.980
I don't know who it might be.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.400
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: Whoever

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.270
is offering those Part D plans.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.478
SALMAN KHAN: Whoever is
offering those Part D plans--

00:04:29.478 --> 00:04:32.439
and so it will ride off of
whatever that private party has

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.230
already negotiated with
the pharma company.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.323
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: It
would be related, probably,

00:04:35.323 --> 00:04:35.490
to that.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.156
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:04:36.156 --> 00:04:41.400
So let's say that we have
some type of insurance.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.730
I'm running out of letters now.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.650
Let's call this insurance
company Y right over here.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.060
And I go have a conversation
with insurance company Y,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.060
and I'm like, hey,
this is a big deal.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.710
Disease x, you know it's
been killing people.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.007
I want $1 million per pill.

00:04:56.007 --> 00:04:57.840
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: Yeah, and so those

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.200
have been really interesting
conversations in the US.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.095
So there's some
bargaining back and forth

00:05:02.095 --> 00:05:04.095
between the insurance
company and the drugmaker.

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.060
The drugmaker is going to
have spent a lot of money.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.440
You've got $100
million up there.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.710
SALMAN KHAN: Yes.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.440
I deserve to make at least $10
billion off-- I'm only kidding.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.730
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER:
So there's a certain amount,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.870
to a certain extent [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.060
SALMAN KHAN: It's called
anchoring in a negotiation.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.990
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Right.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.790
You start with what
you think you can get.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.120
SALMAN KHAN: Yes.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.830
Absolutely, yeah.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.836
[?

00:05:19.836 --> 00:05:20.000
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER:
Push ?] that number to get

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.100
everybody's mind around, yeah.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.550
So in reality, it costs
well over $100 million

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.040
to take a drug
through the trials,

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.166
to do the development work.

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:29.665
So they're going to be sitting
there with a number, at least

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:32.060
internally, saying, we want
to get our $800 million,

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.040
our $1.5 billion back from this.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.898
And so we're going to try
and price it accordingly.

00:05:34.898 --> 00:05:36.314
SALMAN KHAN: Because
it's not just

00:05:36.314 --> 00:05:38.590
the cost of that one
drug-- so what is the cost?

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.160
Do you know that off the top
of your head, the average drug?

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.610
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER:
It's hundreds of millions.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.151
So there's the
development costs that

00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:45.300
go in that the pharma
companies aren't typically

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.540
willing to talk a lot about.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.039
And then there's
the cost of getting

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.520
through the trials and the FDA
approvals, which people say

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.669
$500 million and up.

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:54.210
They'll say higher
numbers sometimes.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.850
SALMAN KHAN: For one given drug?

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:56.340
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.990
SALMAN KHAN: $500 million.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.910
So it can be as high
as $500 million.

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.701
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: It can be higher.

00:06:00.701 --> 00:06:03.760
SALMAN KHAN: Can be
greater than $500 million.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.300
And so that doesn't even take
into the probability-weighted

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.980
risk, that there's a
10% chance that it fails

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.320
or a 10% chance that it works.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.770
So it's really, if you're
spending $100 million per drug

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.630
and only 1 out of
10 of those drugs

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.909
are going to get
to the end zone--

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.200
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.850
You'll see along the way.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.880
You won't spend a whole
wad and then find out.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.992
You'll find out in steps.

00:06:25.992 --> 00:06:27.950
So you'll have to spend
something to get there.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.074
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:06:28.074 --> 00:06:28.140
You'll stop.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.070
So even though on one drug, it
might be $100 million or $500

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.890
million, they might have spent
another $300 million or $400

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.490
million on drugs that
didn't go anywhere.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.410
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER:
Plus their own development

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.320
costs in the background.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.236
SALMAN KHAN: Plus their
own development costs.

00:06:38.236 --> 00:06:42.025
So if you try to fully load
the cost, it's a large number.

00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:44.040
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: It's large, yeah.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.540
Right.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.920
Exactly.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.050
They're running
an operation where

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.640
they've got to put in a
lot of money in up front.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.980
When they get a
success, they have

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.580
to get enough out
of that one success

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.349
to pay for the operation,
to keep things going

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:54.640
for the next development round.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.560
So they're looking at
those kinds of numbers,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.934
and they're trying to figure
out in this negotiation what

00:06:58.934 --> 00:07:00.430
they can sell this for.

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.220
And that's a back
and forth discussion.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.290
The insurance companies
have some ability

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.470
to say what they're
willing to pay,

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.719
but a lot of these
drugs, if they're

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:12.260
doing the curing a disease that
people care about, the pharma

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.707
companies have a lot of
ability to come and say, this

00:07:14.707 --> 00:07:16.790
is what we need to get for
this and set that price

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.030
and be able to get
it for a while.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.660
SALMAN KHAN: So obviously,
the pharma company

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.150
is coming here with
all of this investment.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.440
They definitely want
it to get covered.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.640
But the insurance company,
their incentive is they

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.431
don't want to look
like, all of the sudden,

00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:30.640
this company that doesn't
provide the cure for disease x.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.370
Do insurance companies
ever walk away

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.020
and say, well,
that's just too much.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:35.853
I understand you invested
all of this money,

00:07:35.853 --> 00:07:37.150
but we just can't do that.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.075
That's just crazy.

00:07:38.075 --> 00:07:39.450
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: So it's

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.060
a little bit of a mixed bag.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.566
The US doesn't
have a lot of cases

00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:44.940
where insurance companies have
really put their foot down

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.475
and said, no, they're
not going to do anything.

00:07:46.475 --> 00:07:47.460
They're not going
to have anything

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.390
to do with some new
drug that comes out.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:52.290
And some of that's
due to the existence

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.630
of lots of different companies.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.070
So if five of the companies
say no but the next guy in line

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.667
says yes, then the dynamic of
that in a competitive market

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.000
is often that everybody else
will eventually come around

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.290
and say, OK, we're
going to [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.206
SALMAN KHAN: Someone is
going to do something.

00:08:06.206 --> 00:08:07.665
They might not pay
for it outright.

00:08:07.665 --> 00:08:09.790
The whole reason why we're
having this conversation

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.770
is because there are some drugs
that seem reasonably priced

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.186
to me, but there
are some that are

00:08:13.186 --> 00:08:15.290
like $30,000 a
pill or something.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.207
I made up that number.

00:08:16.207 --> 00:08:17.498
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:08:17.498 --> 00:08:19.490
So the cases, the
really expensive ones,

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.019
are drugs that are
unique-- tend to be unique,

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:24.810
at least to some extent--
cure disease that

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.226
gets some high profile, so
people are worried that they're

00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:29.215
going to die if they
don't get this drug.

00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:30.840
And of course, they're
still on patent.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.375
That's another
feature of all this,

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:34.750
where you get the high price
for a certain period of time

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.020
until your patents run out.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.710
SALMAN KHAN: And
then the generic--

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:37.309
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: And then generic

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:37.640
comes in and the price--

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.760
SALMAN KHAN: Can make them
for the cost of the pill,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.350
which is--

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.340
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER:
It drops dramatically.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.700
SALMAN KHAN: Pennies or dollars.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.200
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: So how you

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.430
get these things set
in a competitive market

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.767
is an interesting question.

00:08:48.767 --> 00:08:50.350
One of things that
gets the brand name

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.860
drugs to be a little cheaper is
competition within the class.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.710
So if there is two or three
drug manufacturers who

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.450
have something that will
basically do the same thing,

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:59.110
that will tend to take the edge
off the $30,000 a pill kind

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.261
of situation and get you down
to more reasonable prices.

00:09:02.261 --> 00:09:04.427
It won't get you all the
way to generic pricing, but

00:09:04.427 --> 00:09:04.565
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:04.565 --> 00:09:06.010
SALMAN KHAN: It
just seems to me--

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.385
you just mentioned that very
few insurance companies have

00:09:08.385 --> 00:09:09.540
ever walked away from this.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.479
If you ever have a negotiation--
buying a used car--

00:09:12.479 --> 00:09:14.520
where one of the two
parties is not walking away,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.630
then it doesn't seem
like there's actually

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.273
a hard, serious negotiation.

00:09:17.273 --> 00:09:18.390
Am I getting that wrong?

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.294
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: Yeah, I

00:09:20.294 --> 00:09:22.710
don't know all the ins and
outs of all these negotiations.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.340
There's lots that goes
on in these things.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.506
But I think that one of the
things that people would

00:09:26.506 --> 00:09:30.510
say about the US is that when
a drug manufacturer comes up

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.830
with fairly unique,
on-patent drug

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:37.000
that does some tangible good,
that they more or less can

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.170
set the price that they
want to get for it.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.350
And they're going to make some
calculation, because they could

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.530
set a high enough price that
everybody would say forget it.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.160
So they're going to try
and figure out something.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.070
But they're trying to
get as much as they can,

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.300
and they get some leeway for
at least a period of time

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:49.580
to name that price.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.038
SALMAN KHAN: So
they'll get leeway,

00:09:51.038 --> 00:09:53.730
and I guess there's some
range of reasonableness

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.720
where it's like, OK.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.340
Yes, you've done something
amazing for humanity.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.140
You're going to get a 35%
return on your investment,

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.432
but that shouldn't be a 300%
return on your investment.

00:10:03.432 --> 00:10:04.723
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:10:04.723 --> 00:10:06.859
I don't know at what point
the US would ever walk

00:10:06.859 --> 00:10:08.900
or the private insurers
will ever walk from this.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.950
I haven't seen it
really happen, and I

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.520
think drug companies are pretty
sophisticated about trying

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.978
to figure out what
price they think

00:10:14.978 --> 00:10:17.856
they can make work and get that
as high as they can get that.

00:10:17.856 --> 00:10:20.160
SALMAN KHAN: So
I guess I'm still

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.414
unclear to see who's making
out here really well.

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:24.830
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: This has

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:26.521
been a really
interesting debate.

00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:28.270
Pharma companies put
huge amounts of money

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:28.978
into these drugs.

00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:31.430
And once in a while, they do
some really useful things,

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.640
and they get high premiums.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.893
There are other people
who argue that some

00:10:33.893 --> 00:10:36.110
of the things that they're
getting high premiums for

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.060
aren't really valuable
enough or somehow we've

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.762
been told we need a
drug that, if we had it

00:10:41.762 --> 00:10:43.720
to our own devices, we
would never have come up

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.830
with the fact that we need it.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.080
And so what's the real
value at the end of the day?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.420
And I think that's one
of the debates we're

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.110
going to have in this
country for a little while.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.110
The industry has been
coming up with new things,

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.510
and they're going to
keep trying to do that.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.280
We want to, from a social
standpoint, from a policy

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.510
standpoint, try to make
sure that things we're doing

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.100
are really valuable to society
and not copies of other drugs

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.440
or not inventing a disease
that didn't need a solution

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.710
and then solving the problem.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.100
And sometimes we
worry that maybe we're

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:08.975
getting some of that.

00:11:08.975 --> 00:11:11.480
And I think that's the challenge
for the US health insurance

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.210
system, for the
regulatory processes

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.665
to try to guide the
innovation and guide

00:11:15.665 --> 00:11:17.700
the purchasing of these
things to really create

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.845
the most value for society.

00:11:18.845 --> 00:11:19.850
It's been a challenge.

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:20.820
It's going to be a challenge.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.645
We have the challenge, because
we have tremendous opportunity

00:11:22.645 --> 00:11:22.960
with new drugs created.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.050
SALMAN KHAN: So your gut
sense is there probably

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:32.080
are some drugs out there that
they're doing really well,

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.960
well above and beyond
the investment cost,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.834
but it's hard to say.

00:11:34.834 --> 00:11:36.665
It's really on a
case by case basis.

00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:37.280
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: Yeah, I

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.870
don't think you'd want to make
a generic statement about all

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.980
the drugs that have
been discovered.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:42.250
Some of the things that
we've put out there

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.990
in the last couple
of decades are really

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.114
important drugs that are
going to do a lot of good.

00:11:46.114 --> 00:11:48.500
And I think there are debates
about some other ones where

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.800
maybe somebody's been able
to be clever about marketing

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.885
and sell it, and we're less
sure that it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:52.885 --> 00:11:54.100
SALMAN KHAN: And that,
actually, marketing-- I

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.650
don't want to make this
conversation too long--

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.186
but some people bring up that
the drug companies, they say,

00:11:59.186 --> 00:12:00.810
look, there's a lot
of investment right

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:01.637
over here on this.

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:03.845
And so they have to get some
reasonable return on it,

00:12:03.845 --> 00:12:05.780
and that seems to make sense,
especially when you probability

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.090
weight it and all of that.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.370
But they spend a significant
amount of marketing

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.930
as well, on actual marketing.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.020
You watch the nightly
news, most of the ads,

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.780
you're going to
see a drug company.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.363
They do the physician dinners,
and they do all of their things

00:12:16.363 --> 00:12:17.317
like that.

00:12:17.317 --> 00:12:19.775
That seems to undermine that
argument that all of the money

00:12:19.775 --> 00:12:21.457
is going for R&amp;D.

00:12:21.457 --> 00:12:22.790
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Right.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.290
If you just totalled
up the dollars,

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.750
I'm not sure what the
numbers would come out like,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.956
and honestly, the
pharma companies

00:12:29.956 --> 00:12:31.830
aren't really excited
about telling everybody

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.500
all of the details of their
businesses for good reason.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.109
So absolutely,
there's a huge amount

00:12:36.109 --> 00:12:37.150
of marketing [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.770
SALMAN KHAN: You spend a ton
of money on the marketing.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.430
And then you get
the consumer here

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:42.170
to put the pressure
on the insurance

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.220
companies and the doctors to
say, hey, you better cover

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.489
that, or I'm asking for that.

00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:47.780
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.070
There was a time
within my memory

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.770
where we weren't allowed
to do direct to consumer

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:55.650
marketing, where the
laws prohibited that.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.795
And the change came around,
and now we're allowed to do it.

00:12:57.795 --> 00:12:59.100
And it's really changed the
way that drugs are marketed.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.140
SALMAN KHAN: And I
have found that weird

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.889
because, if these are
drugs that are meant

00:13:01.889 --> 00:13:04.802
to be by prescription, which
means that it should be

00:13:04.802 --> 00:13:06.343
a doctor's judgment
on whether or not

00:13:06.343 --> 00:13:08.509
you should get the drugs,
why is it being advertised

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:10.480
on the nightly news
to a general audience?

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.350
PROFESSOR LAURENCE
BAKER: Right-- a general

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.516
audience who doesn't
understand all the ins and outs

00:13:13.516 --> 00:13:15.790
of the drug and whose
doctor may or may not

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.290
want to take the time to
explain it all to them.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:17.870
SALMAN KHAN: Exactly.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.380
But then they'll go to
the doctor and say, please

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:20.170
give me this drug.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.845
And then the doctor, it's easier
for them to say, well, sure.

00:13:21.845 --> 00:13:22.015
Why not?

00:13:22.015 --> 00:13:22.670
PROFESSOR LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.050
No, I think a lot
of doctors would

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.920
express a certain amount
of frustration about that.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.690
Their patients come in.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:28.460
It's hard to have the
conversation in a short period

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.680
of time, so it's easier
just to give them the drug.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:31.967
SALMAN KHAN: Fascinating.
