00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.763
When you orbit the camera around something, the target's fixed and only the

00:00:02.763 --> 00:00:06.160
position changes. When you turn the camera to the left, you're fixed in

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.916
position and the target changes. When you're zooming in you're not doing any

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:12.930
kind of change because you're just changing the field of view. When you pan

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.844
you're moving the camera perpendicular to the way it's facing, so both the

00:00:15.844 --> 00:00:20.796
target and position change. In fact, controlling where the target location is

00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:24.920
can be a somewhat frustrating part of using various graphics modelers. If you

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.002
pan and then orbit, you're now orbiting around some different target location,

00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:32.002
which may not have been what was intended. Note that I didn't ask about the

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:36.282
effect of dulling in the target in position. Dolly certainly changes the

00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:39.920
position, but it's up to the program whether to change the target in this case.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.544
If the control also moves the target, it's likely you're walking forward and

00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:46.052
don't particularly care where the target is located. If the target doesn't

00:00:46.052 --> 00:00:48.868
change, it's like you're walking towards and object and perhaps slow down as

00:00:48.868 --> 00:00:50.430
you approach it.
