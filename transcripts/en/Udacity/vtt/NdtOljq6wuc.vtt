00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Welcome to homework 5.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In the first problem, you're going to build some intuition for what happens to a robot's path

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
when one of the these parameters, either toe p, toe d, or toe i, is set equal to 0,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so if we don't include that term in our steering angle equation.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In each of these 4 cases on the left, the black horizontal line is the intended track for the robot,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
while the pink represents its actual motion.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In each of these cases, the robot has a 10 degree positive drift

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and starts with a cross check error of 1.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For each of these 4 cases, you should go through and decide which of these radio buttons

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is the correct selection.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So for example, if you thought that this was appropriate robot motion

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and all the parameters were tuned correctly,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
you would select no problem.

00:00:52.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Keep in mind that each column should be selected exactly 1 time. Good luck!
