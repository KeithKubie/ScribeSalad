there's some pretty stark research out

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270
there's some pretty stark research out
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.200
there's some pretty stark research out
there now that oddly enough I think

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210
there now that oddly enough I think
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.950

doesn't get quite as much attention as

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
doesn't get quite as much attention as
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.499

it deserves them just talk about one

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
it deserves them just talk about one
 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.300

study this was done by a German

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
study this was done by a German
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.290
study this was done by a German
scientist look at 2500 committed couples

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
scientist look at 2500 committed couples
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.870
scientist look at 2500 committed couples
so no small number the results are

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880
so no small number the results are
 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.230
so no small number the results are
probably no fluke and he measured their

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
probably no fluke and he measured their
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.140
probably no fluke and he measured their
desire progressively over time within

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
desire progressively over time within
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.470
desire progressively over time within
their committed relationships the desire

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
their committed relationships the desire
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.470
their committed relationships the desire
starts at right about the same point for

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
starts at right about the same point for
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.150
starts at right about the same point for
the men and for the women so again

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
the men and for the women so again
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.369
the men and for the women so again
debunking this idea that somehow male

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
debunking this idea that somehow male
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.920
debunking this idea that somehow male
desire male libido is far stronger

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
desire male libido is far stronger
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.410
desire male libido is far stronger
innately than female libido but what

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
innately than female libido but what
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.900
innately than female libido but what
happens interestingly is that male

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
happens interestingly is that male
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.220

desire declines gradually over time

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230
desire declines gradually over time
 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.189
desire declines gradually over time
female desire dives much more

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
female desire dives much more
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.700
female desire dives much more
dramatically than male desire within

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710
dramatically than male desire within
 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.260
dramatically than male desire within
those committed relationships and I

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270
those committed relationships and I
 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.510
those committed relationships and I
think two things are worth saying first

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
think two things are worth saying first
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.329
think two things are worth saying first
again the very least this calls into

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
again the very least this calls into
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.600
again the very least this calls into
question this idea that somehow women

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
question this idea that somehow women
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.520
question this idea that somehow women
are comparatively better suited to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
are comparatively better suited to
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.179
are comparatively better suited to
monogamy than men are but second I think

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
monogamy than men are but second I think
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.570
monogamy than men are but second I think
the reason for the disparity showing

think what we're seeing within the

think what we're seeing within the
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.260
think what we're seeing within the
monogamous relationships is that the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270
monogamous relationships is that the

whereas women's may not be may need more

again if we're just focusing on

again if we're just focusing on
