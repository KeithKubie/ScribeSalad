MICHEL DEGRAFF: I think I was
very lucky this time around

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.550
in this course to have students
from so diverse backgrounds.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.090
But also students who,
I think most of them,

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.890
were first-generation
Americans and with ancestry,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.236
either parents or grandparents,
from actually quite

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:26.360
diverse parts of the world.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.970
From Mauritius, from
India, from Latin America.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.360
And also in terms of
ethnicity and religion,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.760
it was also quite a diverse set.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.310
There were students whose
parents were Jewish.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.010
There was an
African-American student.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.170
There were some from India.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.630
And they were
basically struggling

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.880
with these notions of who they
are in terms of their identity.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.570
And can you be
Mauritian, but yet not

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.900
speak the Mauritian language?

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.270
Can you be Indian and
not speak Bhojpuri?

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.160
Can you be Latino, but
not be fluent in Spanish?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.500
Can you be African-American,
but yet not

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.700
be fully fluent in
so-called Black English?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.465
So those were questions that
they themselves brought in

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:12.590
that I think enriched the
course, because it became

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.390
very personal in many ways.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.360
And I feel that
through this semester,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.057
they themselves matured
in the kinds of answers

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:22.890
they were bringing to
these questions, which

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.610
were deeply personal.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.796
And in fact, once I
discovered that they

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.170
had such diverse backgrounds,
and that the questions were

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.880
so personal in terms of who they
were as individuals, in terms

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.400
of identity, language,
religion, ethnicity,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.850
then what I asked them to do
as the very first exercise was

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.090
to write what I call the
linguistic biography.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.990
And actually, I am grateful
that I get this hint from a dear

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.860
friend and colleague Professor
Anne Charity Hudley who

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.960
teaches at UC Santa Barbara.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.300
And Anne Charity
actually shared with me

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.570
her own linguistic biography.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.570
And when I read that,
I realized how powerful

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.530
it was to read about
her own growing up,

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.827
in terms of language,
ethnicity, race.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.410
So I thought that I
would ask students

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:09.520
to do something similar.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.270
And that helped me
throughout the semester

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.450
to frame what kinds
of questions we

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.950
would answer throughout
the course, which

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.400
were very connected to
the essence of the issue

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.700
of language and identity.
