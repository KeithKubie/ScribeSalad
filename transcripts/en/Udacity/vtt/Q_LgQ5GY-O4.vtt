00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.670
To illustrate, an SPD entry
describes a security policy,

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.690
which decides the security parameters
which are stored in an SA in SADB.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.490
The unique index for
the SA of the receiver is

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.380
the SPI that is encoded
in IP set packet header.
