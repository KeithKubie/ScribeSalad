00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.140
Hello Internet.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.799
Thoughts compete for space in your brain:
cat photos, news stories, beliefs structures,

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.260
funny GIFs, educational videos, not-so-educational
videos and your thinking inventory is limited.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.560
A thought without a brain to think it, dies.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.090
Now we can treat thoughts as though they're
alive.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.039
Specifically alive like germs.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.289
That might sound weird but stick with me.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.460
Take jokes.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.990
Jokes are thought germs that live in your
brain -- and when you tell the joke to another

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.980
brain, you help it reproduce.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.630
Just like when you have the flu and sneeze
to help it reproduce.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.329
This germ gets into its host by snot through
the mouth and this one by words through the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.940
ear but it's reproduction either way.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.370
Logging on to your social media then, is exposing
yourself to everyone's mental sneezes.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.960
Each post a glob of snot with an thought germ
trying to get in your brain -- if not for

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.039
permanent residence then at least long enough
to get you to press the share button and sneeze

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.730
it with everyone you know.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.100
In this analogy then, a funny cat photo with
a perfect caption is a super-flu.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.670
Now just as germs exploit weak points in your
immune system, so do thought germs exploit

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.649
weak points in your brain.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.070
A.K.A. emotions.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.740
Once inside, thought germs that press emotional
buttons get their hosts to spread them more

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.110
-- measurably more.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.310
Well, except sadness, sad thought germs don't
get very far.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.700
Awe is pretty good which is why websites that
construct thought germs like biological weapons

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.820
arm them with them titles like "7 whatevers
that will blow your mind" or "The Shocking

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.740
Secret behind... this thing"

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.159
But anger is the ultimate edge for a thought
germ.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.329
Anger, bypasses your mental immune system,
and compels you to share it.

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.680
Being aware of your brain's weak spots is
necessary for good mental hygiene -- like

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.790
knowing how to wash your hands.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.760
Because even without intentional construction,
any thought germ on the Internet can, on its

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.450
own, grow more infections as it spreads.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.350
To talk about why, lets forget anger for a
moment and go back to that cat photo.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.850
Every photo ever taken is a thought germ,
and most die a quick death like the bazillion

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.100
cat photos (or baby photos) posted on The
Internet that are never shared.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.210
But a mildly funny cat photo can grow into
so much more, because just as transatlantic

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.310
flights were the best thing to happen to germ
germs, so the Internet is the best thing to

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.060
happen to thought germs.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.440
For once on-board, that cat photo is a thought
germ that can leap into other brains.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.980
And those brains might share it, and here's
the key point, occasionally, change it -- a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.630
Photoshop here, a tweaked caption there.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.330
Most changes are terrible, but some make the
thought germ even funnier, getting brains

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.330
to share it more.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.760
Which results in more changes and a shot at
super-stardom.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.690
A thus a lowly cat photo can achieve global
brain domination.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.320
At least for a few hours.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.349
The Internet, with its unparalleled ability
to share and randomly change thought germs

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.180
can't help but help make them stronger.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.290
With jokes, that's awesome -- but with angry
germs not always so awesome.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.290
No.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.590
Angry germs, the more they're shared undergo
the same process, changing and distorting

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.400
to be more aggravating.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.460
These have a better chance of spreading than
their more accurate but more boring rivals.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.130
But like plagues, thought germs can burn though
a population too quickly.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.590
Just watch your favorite meme generating machine
for a week and you'll see the life-cycle fly

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.590
by.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.530
However some thought germs have found a way
around burnout.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.000
Now, I must warn you, depending on which thought
germs live in your head and which you fight

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.790
for, the next section might sound *horrifying*.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.420
So please keep in mind, we're going to talk
about what makes some thought germs, particularly

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.379
angry ones, successful and not how good or
bad they are.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.379
OK?

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.560
Deep breath: calm.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.150
Though germs can burn out because once everyone
agrees, it's hard to keep talking and thus

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.239
thinking about them.

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.189
But if there's an opposing thought germ, an
argument, then the thinking never stops.

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.400
Disagrement doesn't have to be angry, but
again, angry helps.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.080
The more visible an argument gets the more
bystanders it draws in which makes it more

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.330
visible is why every group from the most innocuous
internet forum to The National Conversation

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.770
can turn into a double rage storm across the
sky in no time.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.610
Wait, these though germs aren't competing,
they're co-operating.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.629
Working together they reach more brains and
hold their thoughts longer than they could

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:55.629
alone.

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.819
Thought germs on opposite sides of an argument
can be symbiotic.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.579
One tool symbiotic anger germs in particular
can employ is your-with-us-or-against-us.

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.370
Whatever thought germ just leaped to the front
of your brain, push it back.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.210
This video isn't about that.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.189
We're just talking about the tool, and this
one makes it hard, for neutral brains to resist

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.180
and its diviciveness also grows its symbiotic
partner.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:24.010
This explains why, in some arguments gaining
more allies also gains more enemies.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.790
Because though the participants think they're
involved in a firey battle to the death from

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.950
the anger germs perspective one side is a
field of flowers and the other a flock of

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.950
butterflies.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.340
*Of course* planting more flowers will get
you more butterflies and getting more butterflies

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.260
will pollinate more flowers.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.650
If there is some argument that splits the
population and lasts forever that even the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.750
most neutral people find difficult to avoid,
you just might be looking at a super successful

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.530
pair of symbiotic anger germs that have reached
ecological stability

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.790
Now, one final depressing though.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:56.790
Uhhhhâ€¦

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.120
I mean one more Awe inspiring point, that
will reveal the secrets of, ahhh -- actually

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.400
no it's just depressing.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.700
When opposing groups get big they don't really
argue with each other, they *mostly* argue

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.190
with themselves about how angry the *other*
group makes them.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.370
We can actually graph fights on the Internet
to see this in action.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.780
Each becomes its own quasi isolated internet,
sharing thoughts about the other.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.530
You see where this is going, right?

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.310
Each group becomes a breeding ground for thought
germs *about* the other -- and as before the

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.020
most enraging -- but not necessarily the most
accurate -- spread fastest.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.180
A group almost can't help but construct a
totem of the other so enraging they talk about

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.030
it all the time -- which, now that you know
how though germs grow, is exactly what make

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.240
the totem always perfectly maddening.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.750
Now, all this isn't to say that there's no
point in arguing.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.210
(That's a different video).

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.740
Or that the Internet isn't amazing, or that
there aren't things worth trying to change

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.760
peoples' minds about.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.120
And thought germs of all kinds come and go.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.120
But it's useful to be aware of how thought
can use our emotions to spread and how the

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.280
more rapidly a thought is able to spread the
more chances it has to become *even better*

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.400
at spreading through random changes made to
it.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.750
Sometimes that's great, sometimes it's terrible.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.490
But if you want to maintain a healthy brain
it pays to be cautious of thoughts that have

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.310
passed through a lot of other brains and that
poke you where you are weakest.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.280
It's your brain -- be hygienic with it.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:20.610
So, of course this video is a thought germ,
one constructed very intentionally over time

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.580
to spread a thought germ about thought germs
-- exposing their secrets -- one could say.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.970
But I tried as hard as possible, not to have,
this video attack your brain through emotions,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.430
so it could use a little help spreading.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.490
Please be a good germ vector and click the
share buttons to sneeze this at your friends.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:37.520
Your coworkers.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.600
Your family.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.250
Infect them all.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.750
You shared the video, right?

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.950
Well if you're still here, you really got
infected hard.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:54.160
Only thing left is to click onscreen and sign
up to the email list which will get you exposed

00:06:54.160 --> 00:07:24.360
to many more thought germs in stick figure
video form.
