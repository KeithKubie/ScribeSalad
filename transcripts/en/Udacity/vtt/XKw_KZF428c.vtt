00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.920
Okay, so this is our first, class diagram.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.260
&gt;&gt; So, let me ask you something about.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.520
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.930
&gt;&gt; What we've done so far. I also sent, in what

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.490
I sent you, I also had some stories about how the actual

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.400
&gt;&gt; Library is used. You asked me to do

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.950
that and are we going to take, use that here?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.300
&gt;&gt; Glad you asked actually. yeah. Those are, you know, what we call use

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.940
cases, or what we will use as scenarios kind of things that we will

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.340
use to derive use cases. And they're also a very good

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.450
way of extracting requirements. We're not going to look at them right

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.890
now because now, because we're more working on kind of the static

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.860
structure of the system. But after we're done with the class diagram,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.700
you know, we will do it at a different time. But

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.410
we're going to use those to see how the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.850
libraries actually use them, and see whether we can get more

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.000
information that we can use to refine our requirements based on that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.770
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.020
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.940
So, for now, we'll just focus in on the,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.630
structure, but, just so you know, I'm,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.870
I'm glad you sent them, because they were going

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.380
very useful as well.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.840
Okay. So let's see. Well, first of all, let

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.030
me, seems like that this is already pretty crowded,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.770
right? We have a number of, classes. So let's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.580
see if there's, some class that may be superfluous and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.310
we can model in a different way. So, for

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.360
example, you, while, while thinking of this I was thinking,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.450
the library card, it doesn't really contain much

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.736
information, right? So is it basically just the number?

00:01:23.948 --> 00:01:30.760
The card has a number on it. We have a separate vendor that does that for us so.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.810
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.270
&gt;&gt; We don't need, it doesn't need to be part of this system,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450
we just have to make sure that every patron has a library card.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.670
&gt;&gt; Okay, so basically for you, in a sense, the library

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.560
card is just an ID that gets associated with a patron.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.120
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.380
&gt;&gt; So I think that the best way to represent this, I mean, unless you

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.000
need an entity because you are creating it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.160
yourself, but it seems like you are not.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.710
I would just remove this one and I would like to put this,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.020
basically to take the library card number and add it to the pattern.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.100
&gt;&gt; Okay, makes sense.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.000
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'll add it here. And as

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.160
an additional attribute. Okay, and it will eliminate this class.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:07.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.700
Oh, and, wait a second, so I guess

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.940
also the child needs a library card number, right?

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.320
&gt;&gt; Child needs a library card number, but let me ask you about that. Is,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.050
is child a separate class, or is it just another kind of patron?

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.920
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see, I see. Because, yeah, it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.490
is sort of a special patron, right? And, so

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.730
maybe we should, maybe we should represent it as

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.640
a kind of a refinement of the patron.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.730
Hm, but then that made me think. So what is

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.510
the only thing that characterizes children? Is it just the age?

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.440
&gt;&gt; Well, if they're, that they can't check out more than five books.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.890
&gt;&gt; Okay. And the, and the only difference is the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.010
fact that they are less than, you know, twelve years old.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.710
&gt;&gt; Twelve or less, right.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.090
&gt;&gt; Twelve or less. So, I guess, you know, I would probably

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.120
like to represent this by making the age explicit in the patron rather

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.730
than to represent it as a class. And I'll tell you why,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.300
because one, one of the issues, and you know, that might happen

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.070
again, is that, basically, there are patrons that are children. And they're

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.130
no longer children, when they come you know 13 or older right.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.100
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.990
&gt;&gt; And if we represent them with a separate class in a sense, then we

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.620
cannot really change the type of an instance of these classes.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.920
So we're left to kind of destroy the patron, create

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.190
a new one, so that means we also have to transfer

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.510
any history we want to keep history and so on.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.680
So I, I think I kind of like better the idea

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.560
that I represent the age exclusively in

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.700
the patron, and then I'll behave differently, based on whether the

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.910
patron is 12 years old, or younger, or 13 or,

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.600
13 or older. This, do you see any problem with that?

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.210
&gt;&gt; It makes things a little simpler.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.490
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.550
and we actually, it allows us also to eliminate

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.450
one class here. So I'm going to proceed this way.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.450
I'm going to eliminate the children class, and I'm going to

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.600
put the age in the patron. Okay, and let me

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.020
see. But in this spirit, actually, something else that jumps

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.740
at me is this idea of the bestseller, because I

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.850
kind of feel like, we might have the same

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.085
problem. So, what is the story? What is a bestseller.

00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:16.850
&gt;&gt; Well it's

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.750
an item that we want to restrict how

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.896
long people can keep, because there is such demand for it.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.880
&gt;&gt; I see, and so basically a book that's a

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.450
bestseller, like the New York Times bestseller, is a bestseller forever?

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.683
&gt;&gt; No, no, no it's hot for

00:04:32.683 --> 00:04:35.940
awhile, and then it becomes just a regular item.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.318
&gt;&gt; I see. Hm. Then I guess it's a

00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:40.349
similar situation to the one I was mentioning before, right?

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:40.980
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.800
&gt;&gt; That if we have a book,

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.530
it will kind of have to change its type if it becomes a best seller.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.218
Then we have to change its type again, if it's no longer a best seller.

00:04:47.218 --> 00:04:47.790
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:48.920
&gt;&gt; So it seems to me that a better

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.150
way to represent this, is just to eliminate this BestSeller

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.060
class and instead, I'm going to put the best seller

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.190
attribute, which would just be a Boolean in the book.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.190
&gt;&gt; Okay, what do you mean by Boolean?

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.280
&gt;&gt; Right. We don't know what Boolean is, right? The Boolean is

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.940
basically just a number. It can have two values, right? True or false.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.380
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.830
&gt;&gt; So we usually, normally use it

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.510
in this in this case. Imagine one, zero,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.970
right? Then it's just kind of the basic.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:11.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.250
&gt;&gt; You know, the bits, right?

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.590
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.730
&gt;&gt; So, this is just telling us, it's like a flag

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.672
that is telling this book is a best seller, or not.

00:05:16.672 --> 00:05:17.053
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:17.053 --> 00:05:20.920
&gt;&gt; It's very easy to change this value and make a book a best

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.880
seller or not a best seller, than

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.210
just creating and destroying instances of these classes.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.135
&gt;&gt; Okay, makes sense.

00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:32.630
&gt;&gt; Okay, so at this point, this already looks better, right? Because we have,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.590
less classes, and I think we did, yeah, we

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.775
did some serious cleanup. That's good. Okay, so now that

00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:40.975
we eliminated some of this, what I would like to

00:05:40.975 --> 00:05:42.845
do, as I said, we are going to both clean

00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:45.222
up, but also refine. I would like to go

00:05:45.222 --> 00:05:48.826
back to our, requirements and see whether we can identify

00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:52.566
additional attributes for this, class that maybe are not as

00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:55.120
obvious as the one that we saw so far, okay?
