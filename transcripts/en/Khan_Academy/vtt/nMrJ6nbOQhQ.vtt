00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.130
Let's attempt to take
the antiderivative,

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.580
or the indefinite integral,
of x to the third times

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.539
the square root of 9
minus x squared dx.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.080
And you might attempt
to do something

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.500
like use substitution,
but you'll

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.580
find that you're not
getting very far.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:17.890
And we have a big clue here.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.320
We have something
of the form-- so 9

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.190
minus x squared, that can
be viewed as the same thing

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.270
as 3 squared minus x squared.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.760
And any time you have the form
a squared minus x squared,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.910
it might be useful to
make the substitution

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.472
that x is equal to a sine theta.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.430
Now, why would that be?

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.230
Well, then a squared
minus x squared

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.300
would become a squared
minus a squared sine squared

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
theta, which is the same
thing as a squared times 1

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.644
minus sine squared theta.

00:00:53.644 --> 00:00:55.310
And I think you see
where this is going.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.200
This is a squared
times cosine squared

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.209
of theta, which might be
a useful simplification.

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:01.250
So let's do it over here.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.860
In this case, our a is 3.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.070
So let's make the
substitution that x

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.310
is going to be equal to a sine
theta, or three times sine

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.600
of theta.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.283
And then we're
going to also have

00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:17.730
to figure out what
dx is equal to.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.340
So if you take the
derivative, we will get dx.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.800
We could have dx d theta
is equal to 3 cosine theta.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.820
Or if we wanted to write
it in differential form,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.020
we could write that
dx is equal to 3 times

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.350
cosine theta d theta.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.540
This is just the derivative
of this with respect to theta.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.300
And we're ready to
substitute back.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.490
Our original expression
now becomes--

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.030
I'll write it in that
original green-- 3 sine theta

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.130
to the third power, which
is the same thing as 27

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.880
sine-- actually,
let me color code it

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.910
just so you know
what parts I'm doing.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.900
So this part right over
here, x to the third,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.500
is now going to become 27 sine
to the third power of theta,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.910
or sine theta to
the third power.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.120
And then all of
this business, this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.130
is going to be the square
root of 9 minus x squared,

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.450
so minus 9 sine squared theta.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.850
And then dx-- let me do
this in a new color-- dx

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.880
right over here is going
to be equal to-- that's

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.230
not a new color.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.980
dx is going to be equal
to all of this business,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.480
so times 3 cosine theta d theta.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.540
And now let's see
if we can simplify

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.690
this business a little bit.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.190
Let me do this over to the side.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.700
This thing right over here
can be written as 9 times 1

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.240
minus sine squared
theta, which is

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.490
equal to the square root of
9 times cosine squared theta.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.170
And we can assume that
cosine theta is positive,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.830
as we did in the last video.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:20.620
And so this is going to be equal
to 3 cosine theta in orange.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.000
So this right over
here is 3 cosine theta.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.350
And so what does
this simplify to?

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:38.810
We have a 27 times 3 is 81
times 3 is going to be 243.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.350
So this is going to
be 243-- I'll put it

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.414
out front-- times the
integral of-- let's see,

00:03:45.414 --> 00:03:46.955
we're going to have
sine cubed theta.

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.130
And then you're going to have
cosine theta times cosine

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.310
theta, or we could say
cosine squared theta.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.690
That's this term right over
here and this term right

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.450
over there, and of
course, d theta.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.477
I think I've taken
care of everything.

00:04:06.477 --> 00:04:08.310
So it might not look
like I've simplified it

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.851
a lot, because, hey,
look, this still

00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.010
doesn't seem like a trivially
easy problem to solve,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.380
but we are getting closer.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.160
Now this turns into just a
classic u substitution problem.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.730
And it's not obvious just yet.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.350
There's actually a little
bit of a layer of a technique

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.183
to figure out first.

00:04:25.183 --> 00:04:28.840
How do you do u substitution
right over here?

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.830
And the key when you have
powers of trig functions,

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.330
especially when you
have one of them

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.140
as an odd power,
what you want to do

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.280
is separate one of
those odd powers out

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.830
so you can kind of construct
a u substitution problem.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.890
So let's do that.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.800
So this is going to
be equal to 243 times

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.370
the integral of--
sine cubed theta

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.100
I can rewrite as sine
of theta-- actually,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.100
let me write it
this way-- as sine

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.210
squared theta cosine
squared theta.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.130
And then I still have 1 sine
theta right over here, d theta.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.840
And what I'm trying to do
is turn this expression

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.879
into something where I
can do u substitution,

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.420
and as you could
imagine, maybe where

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.400
the du has to deal with
sine theta d theta.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.770
And it would if I can get my
u being equal to cosine theta.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.350
Then my du is going to be
negative sine theta d theta.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.610
So let me see if I can do that.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.760
So if I say that
sine squared theta

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.110
is the same thing as 1
minus cosine squared theta,

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.580
then this whole thing becomes
243 times the integral of 1

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:46.600
minus cosine squared theta
times cosine squared theta times

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.980
sine theta d theta.

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:52.470
And I want to be very
clear what I did over here.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.060
So we used some
trig substitution

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.761
to get to this point
right over here.

00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:57.760
And at this point, I took
one of the sine thetas

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.601
out-- I separated
it right over here--

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.350
and then I converted
this to an expression

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.340
in terms of cosine theta.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.220
Now, the whole reason why I
did this is right over here I

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.770
have a function of
cosine theta, and then I

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.010
have something that's pretty
close to the derivative

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.050
of cosine theta right over here.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.500
So this is now ripe
for u substitution.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.210
So let's do u substitution.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.080
If I have a function
of something

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.990
and then I have this
derivative, maybe u

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.460
should be equal
to that something.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:31.130
So let me set u as being
equal to cosine of theta.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.360
Then du is going to be equal to
negative sine of theta d theta.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.710
Well, I have a
sine theta d theta.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.239
I can multiply that
times a negative

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:43.780
as long as I put a
negative out here.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.310
I'm multiplying by
a negative twice.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.110
I'm not changing the value.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.950
So notice, now this
right over here is du,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.970
and this right over
here is a function of u.

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.380
So let's write it that way.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.620
All of this business is going to
be equal to negative 243 times

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:09.060
the integral of 1 minus u
squared times u squared.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.730
And then this right over
here is just our du.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.201
So this is just du.

00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:21.990
Now, this is pretty
straightforward.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.250
We can just multiply
our u out, and this

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:31.240
will become negative 243.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.700
So this is all equal
to negative 243 times

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.830
the indefinite
integral of u squared

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:43.060
minus u to the fourth--
I'm just distributing

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.590
the u squared-- du.

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.125
Now, this is pretty
straightforward

00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:50.490
to take the antiderivative of.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:56.090
This is negative 243 times the
antiderivative of u squared

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.060
is u to the third over 3.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.220
Antiderivative of
u to the fourth

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.670
is u to the fifth over 5.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.239
And of course, we're going
to have a plus c out here.

00:08:08.239 --> 00:08:10.280
And just so that we can
get rid of this negative,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.180
we can swap this.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.830
We can distribute
the negative sign.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.730
So this one becomes negative.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.420
That one becomes positive.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:26.640
And we get all of this business
as being equal to 243 times u

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:32.970
to the fifth over 5 minus u
to the third over 3 plus c.

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.190
And you might say, wow,
finally, we are done.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.090
But we aren't done.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:39.320
We have everything in terms of
u while our original integral

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.250
was in terms of x.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.340
So the next video, we're going
to unwind all the substitution.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.548
We're going to try to take
this expression right over

00:08:46.548 --> 00:08:47.960
here and write it in terms of x.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.890
So we're going to have to
go from u to theta to x,

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.744
because we've done two
rounds of substitutions.
