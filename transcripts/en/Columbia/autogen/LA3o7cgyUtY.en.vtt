work is as a qualitative researcher so

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510
work is as a qualitative researcher so
 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.240
work is as a qualitative researcher so
the idea of qualitative research is that

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
the idea of qualitative research is that
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.500
the idea of qualitative research is that
is the philosophy is that at a certain

point there is going to be some
 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.250
point there is going to be some
inductive leap and you're going to

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260
inductive leap and you're going to
 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.490
inductive leap and you're going to
understand that philosophers say that

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500

the difference between deduction and
 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.780
the difference between deduction and
induction is that in deduction the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940
were six carbons but how are they were
 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.880
were six carbons but how are they were
organized he didn't know so the answer

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890
organized he didn't know so the answer
 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.620
organized he didn't know so the answer
was not in the dating add up like fine

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630
was not in the dating add up like fine
 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.300
was not in the dating add up like fine
the answer popped into his head so this

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310
the answer popped into his head so this
 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.160
the answer popped into his head so this
is a an interesting experience and as a

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170
is a an interesting experience and as a
 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.050
is a an interesting experience and as a
qualitative researcher I've had this

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060
qualitative researcher I've had this
 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.340
qualitative researcher I've had this
experience on the number of occasions

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350
experience on the number of occasions
 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.630
experience on the number of occasions
where my head went pop and so I just

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640
where my head went pop and so I just
 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.580
where my head went pop and so I just
wanted to think about how do we how do

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590
wanted to think about how do we how do
 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.350
wanted to think about how do we how do
we understand that and you know sort of

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360
we understand that and you know sort of
 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.300
we understand that and you know sort of
this is more just my musings on the

fire stations were closed so that they

fire stations were closed so that they
would burn down and the people would be

would burn down and the people would be
 

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.050
would burn down and the people would be
dispersed out of those neighborhoods and

dispersed out of those neighborhoods and

just explained that the city government

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:48.830
just explained that the city government
 

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.320
just explained that the city government
closed fire stations so that things

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.330
closed fire stations so that things
 

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.480
closed fire stations so that things
would burn down people say oh yes the

landlord's committed arson which is the
prevailing folk interpretation of what

prevailing folk interpretation of what
 

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.440
prevailing folk interpretation of what
happened what happens when you close

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:05.450
happened what happens when you close
 

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.300
happened what happens when you close
fire stations is that it takes longer to

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:07.310
fire stations is that it takes longer to
 

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.130
fire stations is that it takes longer to
get to a fire fires move through

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:09.140
get to a fire fires move through
 

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.220
get to a fire fires move through
buildings exponentially so any short

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:12.230
buildings exponentially so any short
 

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.010
buildings exponentially so any short
delay increases the damage that will

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.020
delay increases the damage that will
 

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.740
delay increases the damage that will
occur in a building and so it's opposed

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:17.750
occur in a building and so it's opposed
 

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.150
occur in a building and so it's opposed
to a fire being contained in an

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160
to a fire being contained in an
 

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.340
to a fire being contained in an
apartment and I go through several

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:21.350
apartment and I go through several
 

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.810
apartment and I go through several
floors or through a whole building

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:22.820
floors or through a whole building
 

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.240
floors or through a whole building
before the fire trucks get there so

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.250
before the fire trucks get there so
 

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.910
before the fire trucks get there so
closing fire stations is disastrous for

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920
closing fire stations is disastrous for
 

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.240
closing fire stations is disastrous for
the protection of the

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.250
the protection of the
 

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.389
the protection of the
infrastructure and poor neighborhoods

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399
infrastructure and poor neighborhoods
 

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:34.819
infrastructure and poor neighborhoods
have the worst code enforcement the most

00:09:34.819 --> 00:09:34.829
have the worst code enforcement the most
 

00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:36.800
have the worst code enforcement the most
overcrowding the oldest housing stock

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:36.810
overcrowding the oldest housing stock
 

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.689
overcrowding the oldest housing stock
therefore the most vulnerable housing

00:09:38.689 --> 00:09:38.699
therefore the most vulnerable housing
 

00:09:38.699 --> 00:09:41.329

understand the rule and we understand we
 

00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:57.479
understand the rule and we understand we
understand this long process we realize

00:36:57.479 --> 00:36:57.489

I realized this was not simply

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640
 
 

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.589
 
contagious housing destruction it is

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599
contagious housing destruction it is
 

00:37:04.599 --> 00:37:06.269
contagious housing destruction it is
contagious housing destruction it's not

00:37:06.269 --> 00:37:06.279
contagious housing destruction it's not
 

00:37:06.279 --> 00:37:10.729
contagious housing destruction it's not
simply contagious housing choice and

00:37:10.729 --> 00:37:10.739
simply contagious housing choice and
 

00:37:10.739 --> 00:37:14.249
simply contagious housing choice and
ultimately we're really forced to remain

00:37:14.249 --> 00:37:14.259
ultimately we're really forced to remain
 

00:37:14.259 --> 00:37:17.789
ultimately we're really forced to remain
what we're seeing and because there's a

00:37:17.789 --> 00:37:17.799
what we're seeing and because there's a
 

00:37:17.799 --> 00:37:20.309
what we're seeing and because there's a
series of displacements and upheavals

00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319
series of displacements and upheavals
 

00:37:20.319 --> 00:37:22.249
series of displacements and upheavals
and destructions that are going on and

00:37:22.249 --> 00:37:22.259
and destructions that are going on and
 

00:37:22.259 --> 00:37:34.550
and destructions that are going on and
we come to call that serial displacement

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560
 
 

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:40.150
 
so
