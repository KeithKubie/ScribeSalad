00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.580
The seahorse, while a fish, doesn’t exactly
look or act like one.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.900
They have a prehensile tail that can grab
vegetation, a tube-shaped mouth for sucking

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.020
up food, and when they have sex, it’s the
male that gets pregnant.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.880
While male pregnancy in seahorses is fairly
unique in the animal kingdom, their mating

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.440
ritual might sound familiar.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.820
They like to break the ice, by doing some
dancing.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.040
Seahorses will dance with each other for days,
wrapping their tails around one another,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.040
and even changing colors in the process.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.060
This allows the couple to reinforce their
bond and assess one another’s reproductive ability.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.600
It also might help synchronize their movements
for what comes next.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.040
The reproductive role-reversal is made possible
in part by the male’s brood pouch.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.980
The male will extend this pouch to impress
his dance partner.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.620
The female seahorse will then deposit her
eggs into the pouch using a protrusion from

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.860
the bottom of her torso called an ovipositor.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.340
Once the eggs are with the male, he will fertilize
them with his sperm, ensuring that he is,

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.800
in fact, the father.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.680
His work isn’t done there, however.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.520
The brood pouch is more than just a flap of
skin to hold eggs in.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.640
During pregnancy, the male seahorse keeps
blood flowing around the embryos, controls

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.120
the salinity of the environment, and provides
oxygen and nutrition to offspring.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.460
When it’s time to birth his young, the male
seahorse expels the newborn seahorses from

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.280
his pouch using muscle contractions.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:42.320
There can be as many as 2,000 offspring, known
“fry”, but many don’t make it to adulthood.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.020
Newborn seahorses are left on their own once
out of the brood pouch, and most die from

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.799
predators or being whisked away by ocean currents.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.719
Less than 5 in every thousand will survive.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.400
Meanwhile, the parents are right back to their
mating ritual.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.480
While the male seahorse has been busy being
Mr. Mom,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.060
there are female seahorses with more eggs that are ready to be deposited.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.260
Some male seahorses can give birth in the
morning and be pregnant by the end of the day.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.160
Back to the dance floor, Mr. Seahorse.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.780
Back to the dance floor.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.780
