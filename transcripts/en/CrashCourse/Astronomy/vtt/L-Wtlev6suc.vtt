00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.480
Hey, Phil Plait here. Welcome to episode 2
of Crash Course Astronomy: Naked Eye Observations.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.139
Despite the salacious title, nudity is not
required.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.199
In fact, given that a lot of astronomical observations are done at night, you may want to bundle up.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:26.780
[Theme Music]
"One giant leap for mankind"

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.840
As it relates to astronomy, “naked eye”
means no binoculars, no telescope.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.780
Just you, your eyeballs, and a nice, dark
site from which to view the heavens.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.460
After all, that’s how we did astronomy for
thousands of years,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.940
and it’s actually pretty amazing what you can figure out about the Universe just by looking at it.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.940
Imagine you’re somewhere far away from city lights, where you have an unobstructed view of the cloudless sky.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.060
The Sun sets, and for a few minutes you just
watch as the sky darkens.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.500
Then, you notice a star appear in the east,
just over a tree.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.140
Then another, and another, and within an hour or so you are standing beneath an incredible display,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.820
the sky spangled with stars.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.050
What do you notice right away?
First, there are a lot of stars.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.179
People with normal vision can see a few thousand stars at any given time, and if you want a round number,

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:17.859
there are very roughly six to ten thousand stars in total that are bright enough to detect by eye alone,

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.340
depending on how good your sight is.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.299
The next thing you’ll notice is that they’re
not all the same brightness.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.619
A handful are very bright, a few more are a
bit fainter but still pretty bright, and so on.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.439
The faintest stars you can see are the most
abundant, vastly outnumbering the bright ones.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.400
This is due to a combination of two effects.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.100
One is that stars aren’t all the same intrinsic,
physical brightness.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.000
Some are dim bulbs, while others are monsters, blasting out as much light in one second as the Sun does in a day.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.729
The second factor is that not all stars are
the same distance from us.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.530
The farther away a star is, the fainter it
is.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.920
Interestingly, of the two dozen or so brightest stars in the sky, half are bright because they’re close to Earth,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.720
and half are much farther away but incredibly
luminous, so they still appear bright to us.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.820
This is a running theme in astronomy,
and science in general.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.520
Some effects you see have more than one cause.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.800
Things aren’t always as simple as they seem.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.330
The ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus is generally credited for creating the first catalog of stars,

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.780
ranking them by brightness.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.670
He came up with a system called magnitudes,
where the brightest stars were 1st magnitude,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.210
the next brightest were 2nd magnitude, down
to 6th magnitude.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.510
We still use a variation of this system today,
thousands of years later.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.990
The faintest stars ever seen (using Hubble
Space Telescope) are about magnitude 31 –

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.250
the faintest star you can see with your eye
is about 10 billion times brighter!

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.110
The brightest star in the night sky
— called Sirius, the Dog Star —

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.780
is about 1000 times brighter than the faintest
star you can see.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.720
Let’s take a closer look at some of those
bright stars, like, say, Vega.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.020
Notice anything about it? Yeah, it looks blue.
And Betelgeuse looks red.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.560
Arcturus is orange, Capella yellow.
Those stars really are those colors.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.880
By eye, only the brightest stars seem have
color, while the fainter ones all just look white.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.720
That’s because the color receptors in your
eye aren’t very light-sensitive,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720
and only the brightest stars can trigger them.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.040
Another thing you’ll notice is that stars
aren’t scattered evenly across the sky.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.770
They form patterns, shapes.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.680
This is mostly coincidence, but humans are
pattern-recognizing animals,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.210
so it’s totally understandable that ancient
astronomers divided the skies up into constellations

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.430
(literally sets or groups of stars), and named
them after familiar objects.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.320
Orion is probably the most famous constellation;

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.550
it really does look like a person, arms raised
up, and most civilizations saw it that way.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.210
There’s also tiny Delphinus; it’s only 5 stars, but it’s easy to see it as a dolphin jumping out of the water.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.800
And Scorpius, which isn’t hard to imagine
as a venomous arthropod.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:52.080
Others, well, not so much. Pisces is a fish?
Yeah, OK. Cancer is a crab? If you say so.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.460
Although they were rather arbitrarily defined in ancient times, today we recognize 88 official constellations,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.420
and their boundaries are carefully delineated
on the sky.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.970
When we say a star is in the constellation
of Ophiuchus,

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.370
it’s because the location of the star puts
it inside that constellation’s boundaries.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.320
Think of them like states in the US:

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.160
the state lines are decided upon by mutual agreement, and a city can be in one state or the other.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.919
Mind you, not every group of stars makes a
constellation.

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.439
The Big Dipper, for example, is only one part
of the constellation of Ursa Major, the Big Bear.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.960
The bowl of the dipper is the bear’s haunches,
and the handle is its tail.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.900
But! Bears don't have tails!

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.820
So astronomers might be great at pattern recognition, but they're terrible at zoology.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.800
Most of the brightest stars have proper names,
usually Arabic.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.349
During the Dark Ages, when Europe wasn’t
so scientifically minded,

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:47.789
it was the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi who translated ancient Greek astronomy texts into Arabic,

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.820
and those names have stuck with us ever since.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.410
However there are a lot more stars than there are proper names, so astronomers use other designations for them.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.819
The stars in any constellation are given Greek
letters in order of their brightness,

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.449
so we have Alpha Orionis, the brightest star
in Orion, then Beta, and so.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.069
Of course, you run out of letters quickly,
too, so most modern catalogs just use numbers;

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:10.900
it’s a lot harder to run out of those.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.860
Of course, just seeing all those faint stars can be tough, which brings us to this week’s “Focus On.”

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.340
Light pollution is a serious problem for astronomers.

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.740
This is light from street lamps, shopping
centers, or wherever,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.699
where the light gets blasted up into the sky
instead of toward the ground.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.289
This lights the up the sky, making fainter
objects much more difficult to see.

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.919
That’s why observatories tend to be built
in remote areas, as far from cities as possible.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.870
Trying to observe faint galaxies under bright
sky conditions is like trying to listen to

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.999
someone 50 feet away whispering at you at
a rock concert.

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.800
This affects the sky you see as well.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.400
From within a big city, it's impossible to
see the Milky Way,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.340
the faint streak of across the sky that’s actually the combined light of billions of stars.

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.759
It gets washed out with even mild light pollution.

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:58.259
Your view of Orion probably looks like this:

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.900
When from a dark site it looks like this:

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.680
It’s not just people who are affected by
this, either.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.939
Light pollution affects the way nocturnal
animals hunt, how insects breed,

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.779
and more, by disrupting their normal daily
cycles.

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:15.259
Cutting back light pollution is mostly just a matter of using the right kind of light fixtures outside,

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:17.280
directing the light down to the ground.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.320
A lot of towns have worked to use better lighting,
and have met with success.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:27.979
This is due in large part to groups like the International Dark-Sky Association, GLOBE at Night, The World at Night,

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:33.370
and many more, who advocate using more intelligent
lighting, and to help preserve our night sky.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:39.000
The sky belongs to everyone, and we should do what we can to make sure it’s the best possible sky we can see.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.100
Even if you don’t have dark skies, there’s
another thing you can notice when you look up.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.610
If you look carefully, you might see that a couple of the brightest stars look different than the others.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.339
They don’t twinkle!
That’s because they aren’t stars, they’re planets.

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:54.879
Twinkling happens because the air over our
heads is turbulent,

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.689
and as it blows past, it distorts the incoming
light from stars,

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:02.789
making them appear to slightly shift position
and brightness several times per second.

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:07.660
But planets are much closer to us, and appear bigger, so the distortion doesn’t affect them as much.

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:13.620
There are five naked eye planets (not counting Earth): Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.560
Uranus is right on the edge of visibility, and people with keen eyesight might be able to spot it.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.560
Venus is actually the third brightest natural
object in the sky, after the Sun and Moon.

00:07:22.569 --> 00:07:25.639
Jupiter and Mars are frequently brighter than
the brightest stars, too.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.819
If you stay outside for an hour or two, you’ll
notice something else that’s pretty obvious:

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:35.059
the stars move, like the sky is a gigantic sphere wheeling around you over the course of the night.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.560
In fact, that’s how the ancients thought
of it.

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:42.009
If you could measure it, you’d find this
celestial sphere spins once every day.

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:46.129
Stars toward the east are rising over the
horizon, and stars in the west are setting,

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:49.659
making a big circle over the course of the
night (and presumably, day).

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:52.409
This is really just a reflection of the Earth
spinning, of course.

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:55.319
The Earth rotates once a day, and we’re
stuck to it,

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:58.689
so it looks like the sky is spinning around
us in the opposite direction.

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:01.969
There’s an interesting thing that happens
because of this. Look at a spinning globe.

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:06.300
It rotates on an axis that goes through the
poles, and halfway between them is the Equator.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.580
If you stand on the Equator, you make a big circle around the center of the Earth over a day.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.180
But if you move north or south, toward one
pole or the other, that circle gets smaller.

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:19.869
When you stand on the pole, you don’t make a circle at all; you just spin around in the same spot.

00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:21.659
It’s the same thing with the sky.

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:25.969
As the sky spins over us, just like with the
Earth, it has two poles and an Equator.

00:08:25.969 --> 00:08:31.909
A star on the celestial Equator makes a big circle around the sky, and stars to the north or south make smaller ones.

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:36.219
A star right on the celestial pole wouldn’t
appear to move at all, and would just hang there,

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:38.560
like it was nailed to that spot, all night
long.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.930
And this is just what we see! Photographic
time exposures show it best.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.589
The motions of the stars show up as streaks.

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:50.349
The longer the exposure, the longer the streaks as the stars rise and set, making their circular arcs in the sky.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.750
You can see stars near the celestial equator
making their big circles.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.089
And, by coincidence, there’s also a middling-bright star that sits very close to the north celestial pole.

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:01.750
That’s called Polaris, the north or pole
star.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.089
Because of that, it doesn’t appear to rise
or set, and is always to the north, motionless.

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:10.550
It really is coincidence; there’s no southern
pole star, unless you count Sigma Octans,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.980
a dim bulb barley visible by eye that’s not all that close to the south pole of the sky anyway.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.100
But even Polaris isn’t exactly on the pole
-- it’s offset a teeny bit.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.680
So it does make a circle in the sky, but one
so small you’d never notice.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:28.769
By eye, night after night, Polaris is the
constant in the sky, always there, never moving.

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:32.350
Remember, the sky’s motion is a reflection
of the Earth’s motion.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.880
If you were standing on the north pole of the Earth, you’d see Polaris at the sky’s zenith

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.940
— that is, straight overhead —
fixed and unmoving.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.079
Stars on the celestial equator would appear
to circle the horizon once per day.

00:09:44.079 --> 00:09:49.459
But this also means that stars south of the celestial equator can’t be seen from the Earth’s north pole!

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.639
They’re always below the horizon.

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:56.440
So this in turn means that which stars you
see depends on where you are on Earth.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.899
At the north pole, you only see stars north
of the celestial equator.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:03.499
At the Earth’s south pole, you only see
stars south of the celestial equator.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.280
From Antarctica, Polaris is forever hidden
from view.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.780
Standing on the Earth’s equator, you’d
see Polaris on the horizon to the north,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.579
and Sigma Octans on the horizon to the south,

00:10:13.579 --> 00:10:17.279
and over the course of the day the entire
celestial sphere would spin around you;

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.500
every star in the sky is eventually visible.

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:22.430
While Polaris may be constant, not everything
is.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.970
Sometimes you just have to wait a while to
notice.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.170
And to that point, you’ll have to wait a
while to find out what I mean by this,

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.620
because we’ll be covering that in next week’s
episode.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.860
Today we talked about what you can see on
a clear dark night with just your eyes:

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:40.110
thousands of stars, some brighter than others,
arranged into patterns called constellations.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:45.579
Stars have colors, even if we can’t see them with our eyes alone, and they rise and set as the Earth spins.

00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:48.470
You can see different stars depending on where
you are on Earth,

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.019
and if you’re in the northern hemisphere,
Polaris will always point you toward north.

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:55.699
Crash Course is produced in association with
PBS Digital Studios.

00:10:55.699 --> 00:10:57.839
This episode was written by me, Phil Plait.
