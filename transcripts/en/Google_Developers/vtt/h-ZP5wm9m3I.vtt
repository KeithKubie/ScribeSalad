00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:08.290
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, and welcome.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.700
We're here at Devoxx with
Ludovic Champenois.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.690
Welcome, Ludo.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.960
We're here to talk about Cloud
from Google and specifically

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.630
Google App Engine and Google
Compute Engine, which is the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.190
latest one.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.270
So, welcome, Ludo.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.940
You had a presentation
here at Devoxx.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.810
You mentioned App Engine, and
it's been around for a while.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.160
It's been kind of
the pioneer in

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.580
platform-as-a-service clouds.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.720
What have you been up to?

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.310
And by the way, you're the lead,
the Java lead for the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.490
App Engine.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.110
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: Yeah, I'm
taking care of the Java

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.530
runtime for App Engine.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.930
App Engine is a very
long story.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.130
It started in 2008, and only
last year, it came out of

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.850
preview so people could really
use the service in a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.430
professional manner.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.930
So it was out of preview last
year, November, and since

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.530
then, we have done almost 12
raises, so one per month.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.380
So you can imagine, every month,
every single month, we

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.260
keep adding services to it and
tuning the load balancer or

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.725
tuning the scalability
of the service.

00:01:14.725 --> 00:01:16.750
MALE SPEAKER: So you have
new features regularly.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.330
So can you mention a few of
those new features that have

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.620
rolled out?

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.220
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: Yeah.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.810
I mean, over the last year, we
added, I think, Python 2.7, Go

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.760
as a supported language.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.800
We rearchitectured the data
store from master slave to a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.690
high-replication data store.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.700
MALE SPEAKER: So you added
something very interesting

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.640
called data splitting or
traffic splitting?

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.650
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: We have
traffic splitting, where you

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.710
can split the traffic based
on IPs or cookies between

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.810
different versions of the
same application.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.690
So, for example, you can try
some of your traffic to a

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.235
newer version of your
application.

00:01:58.235 --> 00:01:59.010
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.820
So one of the new things I hear
is European data centers.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.530
So can you tell us
what that is?

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.590
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: So I think
it was announced at Google I/O

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.030
in July, and it's starting
ramping up.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.910
So, for example, before it
was only open to premier

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.720
customers, and I think
now we can open it to

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.760
all the build customers.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.620
So it's basically App Engine,
but running in Europe in, of

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.590
course, multiple data centers,
but with a guarantee that your

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.560
data and processing power
will stay in Europe.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.950
So customers are billed in euro,
and it's much easier to

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.690
be a customer when you
are from Europe.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.340
MALE SPEAKER: So as the
Java lead, I need to

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.710
ask you this question--

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.620
Java 7 on App Engine?

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.250
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS:
Interesting, yes.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.280
So we are yes, of course,
working on Java 7.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.930
In fact, the version of this
month is in preview mode for a

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.380
trusted tester.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.760
And we will open it to
everyone in December.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.190
So you can start testing your
application with Java 7.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.310
Even if you do not use Java 7,
the new features, not all of

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.550
them are exposed yet in App
Engine because we are still

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.790
running the security around
the Java 7 runtime.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.640
And you have seen recently some
hacks trying to enter--

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.850
break the security of the JDK
7 itself that have been

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.460
promptly fixed by Oracle.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.510
But security is a very important
feature at Google,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.040
and we want to make sure that
your application will run

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.290
securely in Java 7.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.190
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.940
So looking forward to that
before the end of

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.320
the year, Java 7.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.090
So in terms of developer
experience nowadays, people

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.890
expect integration with Maven,
with continuous integration,

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.320
and they have all
those workflows.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.840
How well do we--
does that work?

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.650
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: For Maven,
the news of this month is we

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.690
are working on the--

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.510
so first of all, we publish all
the Maven artifacts for

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.070
all the JARs and libraries
and SDK for App Engine.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.540
And what we are adding this
month is a new plug-in where

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.560
you can interact with App Engine
itself, so start the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.630
local SDK, update your
application, update your

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.190
backends, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:21.610
So all of this from
Maven POM rules.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.100
But we are also working
with two partners.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.690
One of them is eXo to
do development on

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.400
the Web in the cloud.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.280
And I don't know if you have
seen a demo of eXo IDE, but

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.610
you can open a Maven project
that you host on GitHub in the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.910
web and start editing and
deploying it either to a local

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.620
SDK running in the cloud or the
real App Engine runtime.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.320
So you don't need a
laptop anymore.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.850
You need a Chromebook.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.360
I mean, with a Chromebook, you
can effectively develop your

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.380
App Engine app if you want.

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.180
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I've
actually Cloud IDE, and it's

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.200
very impressive.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.720
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: So this
is really for developers.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.590
Now for testing and building
in a continuous manner, we

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.760
have also done a partnership
with Cloudbiz and their Dev

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.080
platform where you can run a
Jenkins build building your

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.210
App Engine app.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.610
And As a post step for this
bid, you can deploy to App

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.275
Engine as well.

00:05:32.275 --> 00:05:33.480
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.590
That's great.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.430
That, I think, helps developers
with their tasks,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.990
daily tasks.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.970
They're all used to
using Jenkins now.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.800
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: Yeah, I
mean, outside of internal

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.580
Google, the defects are
still not outside yet.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.690
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.220
So let's switch gears
a little bit.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.030
You talked about App Engine,
but you also talked about

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.820
Compute Engine.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.070
So tell us--

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.330
this is infrastructure as a
service running on Google's

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.660
infrastructure.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.310
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: Yeah.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.960
So App Engine is a big part
of the cloud offering from

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.180
Google, but we recently
introduced Compute Engine,

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.500
which is more getting from the
bottom, creating VMs and

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.950
networks, connecting those VMs
in a massive scalable manner.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:26.130
The demo at Google I/O was using
600,000 cores to run

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.220
some computation on
Google Cloud.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.940
So it's basically a Linux kernel
that you can create and

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:41.380
boot on demand and install
whatever software you want.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.110
MALE SPEAKER: And so there's a
notion of API that you use to

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.360
manage all of this, because it's
at a scale if you have

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.140
hundreds of thousands or
even hundreds of--

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.810
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: Yeah.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.370
So the way you manipulate this
Compute Engine framework is

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.780
via a REST course,
so RESTful web

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.650
services with a JSON payload.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.910
And we have a command line tool
and a nice web UI that

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.570
allows you to create your
payload seeds so you can learn

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.380
how to interact with Compute
Engine very easily.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.090
MALE SPEAKER: So if I post the
proper JSON workload, I can

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.420
actually create an instance
and have it running?

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.910
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: One
or 10,000 of them--

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.360
MALE SPEAKER: Of course.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.890
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: --depending
on your credit

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.950
card account.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.130
MALE SPEAKER: And why
would I do this?

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.990
Do I get any benefit of running
my virtual machines in

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.710
Google's data center?

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.530
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: So once you
have a VM running inside

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.500
the Google data center, then
this VM has the most powerful

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.770
network access to other
Google services--

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.560
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.580
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: --whether
it's cloud

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.370
storage or mySQL or Datastore.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.810
So all the services will run
in the same data center, so

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.250
the communication
will be optimal

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:53.960
between those services.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.800
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.150
So lots of progress on App
Engine and Compute Engine

00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:59.560
coming soon?

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.910
This is still in preview
or in trusted testers?

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.600
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: Compute
Engine is still in preview

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.360
and, yeah, selected
trusted tester.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.510
We are looking for massive
computation partners before

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.305
opening it more to
more developers.

00:08:18.305 --> 00:08:19.380
MALE SPEAKER: OK, great.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.900
Well, I guess that's all the
time we have for it.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.605
Thank you, Ludo, for--

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:22.550
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: Thank
you for having me.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:23.520
MALE SPEAKER: --spending
the time and

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.410
answering those questions.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.660
LUDOVIC CHAMPENOIS: Bye.
