00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.030
Why do rich people live longer than poor people?

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.230
Scientists have struggled to untangle the
causes for decades.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.580
Is it differing lifestyles?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.340
Access to health care?

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.840
Or does social status itself affect a person’s
health?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.610
Well, it turns out a group of monkeys may
hold the answers.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.170
Scientists recently decided to create social
groups among rhesus macaques, a social animal

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.860
that like humans form strict social hierarchies.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.210
In the experiment, 45 female monkeys were
placed into 9 groups of 5, introducing new

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.470
monkeys 1 by 1 into their new group.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.809
The first monkey in the group was always the
highest ranking with the last monkey ending

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.050
up at the bottom of the social order, experiencing
isolation and harassment.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.280
The monkeys lived like this for a year, at
which point the scientists moved them around

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.280
again.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.860
The monkeys with the same rank were were placed
in new groups, forming new social hierarchies

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.032
by again introducing monkeys one at a time.

00:01:03.032 --> 00:01:04.510
So the monkeys who had all been at the top
of their first groups were now all together,

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.100
with four of the five now experiencing a new
social class.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.460
Researchers then analyzed blood samples from
the macaques and found that immune cells taken

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.600
from the lower-ranking monkeys were more likely
to show increased inflammation, which has

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.159
been linked to a whole host of health problems.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.729
Conversely, monkeys who went up in social
class experienced the opposite.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.049
Their immune cells improved.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.819
This study suggests that it’s not just behavior
or genetics that affect the monkeys’ health,

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.539
but that social hierarchy itself is also a
factor.

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.789
And according to Professor Graham Rook, from
University College London, “the evidence

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.619
is showing the findings are terrifically applicable
to humans.”

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.919
While this study was not conducted on humans,
we do know that social class plays a dramatic

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:48.990
role on our life expectancies.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.020
For example, for men born in 1920 there was
a 5 year difference in life expectancy between

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.880
the top 10 percent and the bottom 10 percent.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.909
But as the wealth gap in the U.S. became more
extreme over the years, so did the life expectancy

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.909
gap.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.789
For men born in 1940, the difference in years
lived rose to an alarming 12 years.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.150
So what can be done?

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.170
As one researcher of the the macaque study
put it, “if we could flatten the slope so

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.370
the difference between highest and lowest
weren’t as much… we could mediate some

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.610
of those consequences.”

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.080
So, based on this study, perhaps the long-term
cure for many ailments won’t come from medicine

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.930
after all, but from economic policies that
work toward a more equal society.
