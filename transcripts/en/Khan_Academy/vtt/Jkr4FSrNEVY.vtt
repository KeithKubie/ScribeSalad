00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.410
I think we now have all the
tools we need to move forward,

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.590
so just to review a little bit
of the last video we said we

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.680
are trying to model out the
probability distribution of

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.780
how many cars might
pass in an hour.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.950
And the first thing we did is
we sat at that intersection and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.910
we found a pretty good expected
value of our random variable.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.720
And this random variable, just
to go back to the top, we

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.030
defined the random variable as
the number of cars that pass

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.790
in an hour at a certain
point on a certain road.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.410
We measure a bunch, we sat out
there a bunch of hours, and we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.540
got a pretty good estimate of
this and we say it's lambda.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.230
And we said, OK, we
wanted to model it as a

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.440
binomial distribution.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
So if this is a binomial
distribution then this lambda

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.840
would be equal to the number of
trials times the probability

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.740
of success per trial.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.120
And so, if we could view a
trial as an interval of time.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.740
This is the total number
of successes in an hour.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.430
And so this would be success
in a smaller interval.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.820
And this would be the
probability of success in

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.020
that smaller interval.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.540
And in the last video
we tried it out.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.460
We said, oh, well, what if we
make this interval a minute

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.790
and this is the probability
of success per minute?

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.280
We'd have maybe a reasonable
description of what

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.850
we're describing.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.890
But what if more than one
car passes in a minute?

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.840
And they said, oh, let's make
this per second and this

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.680
is the probability of
success per second.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.130
But then we still have the
problem, more than one

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.020
car could pass in a
second, very easily.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.020
So what we wanted to do is we
want to take the limit as this

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.530
approaches infinity and then
see what kind of formula we

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.610
get from the math gods.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.580
If we describes this as a
binomial distribution with the

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.910
limit as it approaches
infinity, we could say that the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.940
probability that x is equal to
some number-- so the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.550
probability that our random
variable is equal to 3 cars in

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.960
a particular hour, exactly 3
cars in an hour-- is equal to--

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.460
oh, we want to take the limit
as it approaches

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.430
infinity, right?

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.090
The limit as n approaches
infinity of n choose k.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.050
We're going to have k moments
in time because n approaches

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.250
infinity, these intervals
become super super duper small.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.170
So these become
moments in time.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.500
We're going to have close to an
infinite number moments and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.260
this is the number of
successful moments

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.030
where cars pass.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.815
We have 3 moments where there
was a success, where a

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:32.370
car passed, and we had
a total of 3 cars pass.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.960
Or 7 cars, 7 moments where it
was true that a car passed,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.760
and we would have total
7 cars pass in the hour.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.660
So just finishing up with our
binomial distribution, n

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.890
moments, choose k successes
times the probability

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.830
of success.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.220
What's the probability
of success?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.960
So this would be n.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.420
What's p equal to?

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.980
p is equal to lambda divided by
n, right? n times p is lambda,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.250
so let me just write that down.
p is equal to lambda

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.550
divided by n.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.530
I just rearranged this up here.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.380
So our probability of
success is lambda times n.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.650
And we're saying what's
the probability that

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.650
we have k successes?

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.990
And then, what's the
probability that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.380
we have a failure?

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.180
Well, it's 1 minus the
probability of success.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.710
And how many failures
are we going to have?

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.090
How many moments will
not have a car pass?

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.420
Well, we have total event
moments and k of them were

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.640
successes, so we'll have
n minus k failures.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.380
Let's see what we
can do with this.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.700
So this is equal to--
let me rewrite it all.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.790
And I'll change colors.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.840
The limit as n approaches
infinity-- let me write out

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.140
this binomial coefficient.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:57.370
That's n factorial over n minus
k factorial times k factorial.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.530
Normally I write these the
other way around, but

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.240
it's the same thing.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.750
Times lambda to the k.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.320
Using my exponent properties--
over n to the k.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.300
And then this expression
right here, I can actually

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.460
separate out the exponents.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.790
This is the same thing as 1
minus lambda over n to the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.380
n times 1 minus lambda
over n to the minus k.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.130
You have the same base, you
could add the exponents and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.890
you would get this up here.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.030
Let me simplify a
little bit more.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.150
Let me swap spots
with these two.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.390
You can kind of view them both
as being in the denominator.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.630
So you can change the order of
division or multiplication

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.490
depending how you view it.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.820
So this is equal to the
limit-- let me switch colors.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.050
The limit as n approaches
infinity-- I don't

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.755
like that color.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.480
Actually, let me just rewrite
what we did in the last video.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.170
What is this thing right here?

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.950
And we showed at the end of the
last video. n factorial divided

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.130
by n minus k factorial.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:04.750
It was n times n minus 1
times n minus 2, all the

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.560
way to n minus k plus 1.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.360
If this was 7 over 7 minus
2 factorial we would

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.760
have 7 times 6.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.710
And 6 is one more
than 7 minus 2.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.660
So that's where we got that.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.600
We did that in the last video
if you're getting confused.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.830
And we also said that
there's going to be

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.800
exactly k terms here.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.080
So if you counted these as 1,
2, 3-- all the way, there's

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.240
going to be k terms here.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.930
We took care of that.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.620
We just rewrote that.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.830
And I said I would switch these
two things around, so that's

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:46.240
divided by n to the k times--
I'm just switching

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.015
these-- lambda to the k
over k factorial.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.540
And then, what do we have here?

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.120
We'll I can just rewrite that.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.600
This is continuing
the same line.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.830
1 minus lambda over n to
the n times 1 minus lambda

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.620
over n to the minus k.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.450
Now we can take the limit.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.420
So what happens when
we take the limit?

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.870
If you take the limit, this
is another property so you

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.410
don't get too overwhelmed--
another property of limits.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.100
If I take the limit as x
approaches anything, a

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.320
of f of x times g of x.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.150
That's equal to the limit
as x approaches a of f of

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:35.230
x, times the limit as x
approaches a of g of x.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.460
So we could take each of these
limits in the product and then

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.040
multiply them and then
we'll be all set.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.070
So let's do that.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.220
And I want to leave
this stuff up here.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.560
So first of all,
what's this limit?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.320
Let me write this out.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.390
And let me pick a
good color-- yellow.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:56.790
So we have the limit as
n approaches infinity.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.930
So this thing up here, this n
times n minus 1 times n minus

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.200
2-- all the way down to n
minus k plus 1, what's

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.840
it going to look like?

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.020
It's going to be a
polynomial right?

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.380
We're multiplying a bunch of--
well really, we're multiplying

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.540
a bunch of binomials and
we're doing it k times.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.210
So the largest degree term
is going to be n to the k.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.390
It's going to be n to the
k plus something times

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.380
n to the k minus 1.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:21.280
It's going to be this
big polynomial-- kth

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.010
degree polynomial.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.690
And that's really all we need
to know for this derivation.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.800
So it's going to be n to the
k plus blah, blah, blah,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.610
blah, blah, blah, blah--
a bunch of other stuff.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.190
This thing when you multiply it
out, over-- we have this n to

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.310
the k, that's this part of it.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.960
Times the limit as--
well actually, we

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.540
don't have to worry.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.390
This is a constant.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.900
So we could actually
bring this out front.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.340
So we don't even have
to write a limit.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.800
So times lambda to the
k k over k factorial.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.300
There's no n here, so this is
a constant with respect to n.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:04.560
Times the limit as n approaches
infinity of 1 minus lambda

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:12.580
over n to the n times 1 minus
lambda over n to the minus k.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.220
All right, I know you
can barely read this.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.820
So first of all,
what's this limit?

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.700
The limit as n approaches
infinity of some polynomial

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.410
where it's n to the kth power
plus blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:24.080
Where all of these other
terms have a lower degree.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.460
This is the highest
degree term.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.050
So you have n to the k in the
numerator and you have n to

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.350
the k in the denominator.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.720
So the highest degrees
are the same.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.820
The coefficients are 1,
so this limit is 1.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.450
Another way you could do it,
you could divide the numerator

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:43.250
and the denominator by n to the
k and you would get-- this

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.670
would just be 1 plus 1 over n
plus 1 over-- everything else

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.460
would have a 1 over n in it,
and this would just be a 1.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.640
And if you took the limit as
you approach infinity, then all

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.910
of these other terms would be
zero and you'd be

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.250
left with 1/1.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.140
But either way, you have the
same degree in the top and the

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.340
bottom, and their coefficients
are the same, so the limit as n

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.100
approaches infinity of this is
1, which is a nice

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.320
simplification.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:12.670
So you end up with 1 times
lambda k over k factorial.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.660
Now what's the limit as n
approaches infinity of

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.300
this thing right here?

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.120
1 minus lambda over n to the n.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.350
Well, in the last video we
showed that it would be--

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:22.270
I'll write it right here.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:30.850
That the limit as n approaches
infinity of 1 plus a over n to

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.560
the n is equal to e to the a.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.320
That's exactly what we have
you here, but instead of an

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.675
a we have a minus lambda.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:46.850
So this is going to be equal
to e to the minus lambda.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.770
We have a minus lambda
instead of an a.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.070
And then finally, what's the
limit as n approaches infinity?

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.840
Let me write it a
little bit neater.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.880
I'm just rewriting this term.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:00.590
1 minus lambda over n
to the minus k power.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.980
What happens as n
approaches infinity?

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.200
Well, this term,
lambda's a constant.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.050
As this approaches infinity,
this term's going

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:08.970
to approach 0.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.430
So you have 1 to the minus k.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.240
1 to any power is 1, so
that term becomes 1.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.840
So we have another 1 there.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.930
So there you have it.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.510
We're done.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.480
The probability that our random
variable, the number of cars

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.150
that passes in an hour, is
equal to a particular number.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.880
You know, it's equal to
7 cars pass in an hour.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.470
Is equal to the limit as n
approaches infinity of n choose

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:41.660
k times-- well, we said it was
lambda over n to the k

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.600
successes times 1 minus
lambda over n to the

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.900
n minus k failures.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.070
And we just showed that this is
equal to lambda to the kth

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:57.010
power over k factorial times
e to the minus lambda.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.680
And that's pretty neat because
when you just see it in kind of

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.590
a vacuum-- if you have no
context for it, you wouldn't

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.560
guess that this is in any
way related to the

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.340
binomial theorem.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.000
I mean, it's got an e in there.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.890
It's got a factorial, but a lot
of things have factorials in

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.170
life, so not clear that
that would make it

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:12.750
a binomial theorem.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.445
But this is just the limit as
you take smaller and smaller

00:11:15.445 --> 00:11:17.730
and smaller intervals, and the
probability of success in each

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:18.680
interval becomes smaller.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.620
But as you take the limit
you end up with e.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.410
And if you think about it it
makes sense because one of our

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:25.660
derivations of e actually came
out of compound interest and we

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.190
kind of did something
similar there.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.620
We took smaller and smaller
intervals of compounding and

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.650
over each interval we
compounded by a much

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.220
smaller number.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.060
And when you took the
limit you got e again.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.330
And that's actually where
that whole formula up here

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.960
came from to begin with.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.940
But anyway, just so that you
know how to use this thing.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:46.080
So let's say that I were to go
out, I'm the traffic engineer,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.850
and I figure out that
on average, 9 cars

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.810
passed per hour.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.570
And I want to know the
probability that-- so this

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.920
is my expected value.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.910
In a given hour, on average,
9 cars are passing.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.100
So I want to know the
probability that 2 cars

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.110
pass in a given hour,
exactly 2 cars pass.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:14.290
That's going to be equal to 9
cars per hour to the 2'th power

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.850
or squared, to the 2'th power.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:23.030
Divided by 2 factorial times
e to the minus 9 power.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:31.650
So it's equal to 81 over 2
times e to the minus 9 power.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.010
And let's see, maybe I should
just get the graphing

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:35.810
calculator out.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.170
Well, I'll let you do that
exercise to figure out what

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.220
that is, but I'll see
you in the next video.
