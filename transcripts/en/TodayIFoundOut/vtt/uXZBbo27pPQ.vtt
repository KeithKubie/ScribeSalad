00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:32.640
For most of human history, ordinary people's
birthdays weren't cause for much celebration.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.149
In fact, in the ancient world if you weren't
among the elite, odds are your birthday would

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.879
have mostly just been noted for things like
astrological purposes, rather than throwing

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.969
parties in your honor annually.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.170
One of the commonly cited "first" known instances
of something like a birthday being celebrated

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.960
appeared in the book of Genesis (40:20-22),
“20 And it came to pass the third day, which

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.260
was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast
unto all his servants: and he lifted up the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.570
head of the chief butler and of the chief
baker among his servants.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.390
21 And he restored the chief butler unto his
butlership again; and he gave the cup into

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.850
Pharaoh's hand:
22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.680
had interpreted to them.”

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.031
However, according to Dr. James Hoffmeier
of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, this

00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:25.259
"birthday" party was probably not celebrating
the unnamed pharaoh's literal "birth" day,

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.509
but rather his coronation, which marked his
"birth" as a god.

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.870
Whatever the case, candles and birthday cakes
as we think of them were not a thing at this

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.070
party as far as we know... (probably wouldn’t
have worked out anyway as he had his baker

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.070
hanged...)

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.149
As for slightly better documented history,
we know from the Greek historian Herodotus

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.899
that in the 5th century BCE at least some
Persians celebrated their birthdays, possibly

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.119
even eating some form of sweetened cake due
to their practice of eating an "abundance

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.010
of dessert"-
“Of all the days in the year, the one which

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.340
they celebrate most is their birthday.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.290
It is customary to have the board furnished
on that day with an ampler supply than common.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.749
The richer Persians cause an ox, a horse,
a camel, and an ass to be baked whole and

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:11.040
so served up to them: the poorer classes use
instead the smaller kinds of cattle.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.060
They eat little solid food but abundance of
dessert, which is set on table a few dishes

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.000
at a time; this it is which makes them say
that "the Greeks, when they eat, leave off

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.170
hungry, having nothing worth mention served
up to them after the meats; whereas, if they

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.150
had more put before them, they would not stop
eating."”

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.710
As for the Ancient Greeks themselves, while
not connected to a birthday, we do know they

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.030
served some form of cake with candles to honor
Artemis, the goddess who, among other things,

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.500
had dominion over the Moon.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.330
As such, people offered cakes that were not
only shaped like said celestial object, but

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.700
decorated with lit candles, presumably to
make it glow.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.630
It has also been reported that the smoke of
the candles perhaps was thought to help the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.090
goddess hear an individual's prayers as it
ascends to the heavens.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.430
Like the Persians, the Romans (circa 2nd century
BCE – 5th century CE) are known to have

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.850
celebrated the birthdays of at least some
"commoners," although it doesn't appear that

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.340
the custom was as ubiquitous as it is today.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.550
Rather, when a wealthy person reached a major
milestone like 50, his family and friends

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.410
might throw the individual in question a party
and serve a special sweetened cake.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.790
Despite that the Romans had dipped candles
made from tallow going all the way back to

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.910
around the 5th century BCE, it does not appear
that they put candles on the birthday cakes,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.910
however.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.600
The Chinese likewise have long had birthday
celebrations, though eating cake on said day

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.000
has only been an exceptionally recent phenomenon,
adopted from the Western world.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.220
Instead, in China it is traditional to eat
longevity noodles on one's birthday.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.500
During the Middle Ages in the Western world,
beyond record keeping not exactly being a

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.310
priority of the time in this region, it appears
birthdays and birthday cakes were not too

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.820
prevalent, in no small part because of early
Catholic dogma that considered birthday celebrations

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.910
to be pagan heresy.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.520
Things began to change on this front beginning
around the 12th century, when records of common

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.300
births were again being meticulously noted.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.150
As babies were also honored with the name
of a saint to protect them, people began celebrating

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.220
their saint's day (as opposed to their own
birthday).

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.430
As for re-introducing the birthday cake, this
is seemingly thanks to German bakers starting

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.720
around the 15th century.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.100
At this point, they began marketing single-layer
cakes for birthdays, especially for one's

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.400
first birthday.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.220
By the end of the 18th century, besides the
Western world again starting to somewhat commonly

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.100
celebrate birthdays, the Germans had evolved
their birthday cake a bit, including the very

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.660
wealthy sometimes ordering elaborate, frosted
birthday cakes not that different from what

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.660
we have today.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.880
Pertinent to the topic at hand, the Germans
were also now putting candles on the birthday

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.380
cakes, as seen in their Kinderfeste (children's
festival) birthday parties.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.850
As to who came up with the idea of including
these candles and why they put them there,

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.160
this isn't clear, though it is known that
at this point they were adding candles numbering

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.780
at least the years the child had been alive
plus often more in the hope of a long life

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.780
to come.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.190
Thus, it has been speculated that the impetus
for the candles was to represent the "light

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.190
of life."

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.380
Other speculative claims state more pagan-like
origins, such as that the candles were there

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.310
to protect the child from evil spirits and
that the parties themselves were for grouping

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.980
together in hopes of fending off evil spirits,
with the anniversary of one's birth supposedly

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.590
making a person more vulnerable to said spirits.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.460
Whatever the case, the idea of putting candles
on birthday cakes seems to have quickly spread

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.560
beyond children's birthday parties.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.340
For instance, in 1746 Count Nikolaus Ludwig
von Zinzendorf had "a Cake as large as any

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.060
Oven could be found to bake it, and Holes
made in the Cake according to the Years of

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.790
the Person’s Age, every one having a Candle
stuck into it, and one in the Middle."

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.900
A half century later in 1801, Prince August
of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg was reported by Johan

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.500
Wolfgang von Goethe of having on his 52 birthday
"a generous-size torte with colorful flaming

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.190
candles - amounting to some fifty candles
- that began to melt and threatened to burn

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.950
down, instead of there being enough room for
candles indicating upcoming years, as is the

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.760
case with children's festivities of this kind."

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.050
From here this practice of ornate, candled
cakes for one's birthday spread throughout

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.650
Europe, presumably initially with the elite
of the continent copying one another and it

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.550
filtering down to those who could afford it
from there.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.430
As for the United States, primarily for religious
reasons, celebrating birthdays at all didn't

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.450
become widely popular until the early 19th
century.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.580
Notably while Protestants were coming to embrace
the idea of a birthday at this point, Catholics

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.900
in the country still largely had religious
issues with celebrating the anniversary of

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.200
one's birth.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.669
It should also be reiterated that at this
stage having sweetened cake on one's birthday,

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:44.720
particularly multi-layered, frosted ones as
we often see today, was still something of

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.080
an expensive luxury only the affluent could
afford.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.240
It wasn't until the end of the 19th century
that ordinary people had sufficient funds,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.040
and ingredients were cheap enough thanks to
the industrial revolution, that the masses

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.590
began incorporating enriched, frosted birthday
cakes as part of a birthday celebration.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.260
When this happened, the idea of a candled
cake and party on one's birthday became nearly

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.710
ubiquitous in the Western world, as it is
today, save for some who still abstain from

00:07:09.710 --> 00:08:43.199
the practice for religious reasons.

00:08:43.199 --> 00:08:47.540
Bonus Facts:
• The music to Happy Birthday to You was

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.529
written down in 1893 by Patty and Mildred
J. Hill.

00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:56.970
Originally with different lyrics and titled
Good Morning to All, it was sung at the start

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:57.970
of the school day.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.990
Despite that they likely copied the tune from
somewhere else and in turn someone else came

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:07.640
up with the modern lyrics a couple decades
later, up until 2015 the song was copyrighted,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.529
earning a couple million dollars annually
for Warner/Chappell Music who claimed they

00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:12.529
held the copyright.

00:09:12.529 --> 00:09:18.420
However, finally in 2015 a class action lawsuit
against said company was settled for $14 million

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.470
when Warner/Chappell could not show that they
actually held the copyright for the song,

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:25.809
despite that they'd been charging businesses
to use the song to the tune of about $2 million

00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:26.990
per year, as mentioned.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.160
It appears from this that the song may now
be in the public domain, though this isn't

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.670
quite clear yet, as it's technically possible
another company may come forward to claim

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.389
copyright on it, though this is probably unlikely.

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:39.769
Happy Birthday's previous copyright status
is why at certain restaurants they have their

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:43.209
own unique version of the song they sing to
customers on their birthdays.

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:45.090
The dropping of the copyright is also why
these days you’ll occasionally here some

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.070
of these restaurants starting to have their
staffs use the classic song instead of one

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.589
of their own making.

00:09:51.589 --> 00:09:55.040
• Although there are reports of even older
people, the oldest verified person ever was

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:01.829
a French woman, Jeanne Calment, who died on
August 4, 1997 at the age of 122 years, 164

00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:02.829
days.

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:06.430
This is possibly around the oldest any human
could live due to telomeres shortening.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:11.220
In a nutshell, telomeres prevent the strands
of DNA from coming undone and also prevent

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.629
them from accidentally fusing with neighboring
chromosomes.

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:18.369
The issue is that these end caps get shorter
each time the cell divides owing to the fact

00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:22.679
that the enzymes that duplicate the DNA, with
a little help from short pieces of RNA, cannot

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:24.970
do so all the way to the end of a chromosome.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.059
So something gets cut off every time a replication
occurs.

00:10:28.059 --> 00:10:31.680
Telomeres ensure that what is cutoff isn’t
critical information.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.269
But the result of this shortening each time
is that telomeres eventually become too short

00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:36.660
to provide an adequate buffer.

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.069
For reference, human cells can only be replicated
around forty to seventy times before the telomeres

00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:42.300
become too short.

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.600
This leads to the cell no longer being able
to correctly replicate and to cell death.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.360
So if you took every cell in your body at
the time you were born and accounted for all

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.600
the cells they would produce and so on, multiplied
that number by the average time it takes for

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.220
those cells to die, you get what is known
as the ultimate Hayflick limit- the maximum

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.730
number of years humans can theoretically live.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.639
That would be around 120 years, give or take!

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:08.569
