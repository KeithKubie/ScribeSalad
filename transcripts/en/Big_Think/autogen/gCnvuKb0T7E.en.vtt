00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:07.169
A few months ago the headlines were dominated
by the fact that physicists think they found

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:08.169
the Higgs boson.&nbsp;

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:13.099
Well, the media said, this is a great discovery,
but what do you mean you think you found the

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.099
Higgs boson?&nbsp;

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.840
Well, to within five standard deviations,
yes, we think we found the Higgs boson.&nbsp;

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.670
And the media said, what do you mean by that?

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.010
Well I would have answered the question differently.&nbsp;

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:33.070
I would have said, "With 99.9999% confidence,
we have bagged the Higgs boson.&nbsp;

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:41.140
If you are an odds maker in Las Vegas, and
the bets are that you are 99.9999% confident

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
that you have it, then yes, you have it."

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.120
So experimental data is not ironclad.&nbsp;

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.170
You have a bell-shaped curve of information,
a bell-shaped curve where the data indicates

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.130
that you're sitting right here on the top
of the bell-shaped curve, but as you go away

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.700
from the bell-shaped curve, you undergo one
standard deviation, two standard deviations,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.969
three standard deviations… and here we have
five standard deviations of proof.&nbsp;

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:13.740
So in physics we use that as the gold standard:
if you can say you found something within

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.380
five standard deviations, then it means that,
within 99.9999% accuracy, you have actually

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.709
found it.&nbsp;

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:25.700
Most people would say, of course you have
found it.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.959
The Higgs boson is important not just because
it gives particles mass.&nbsp;

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:37.490
That's how the media played it, and people
say, well, so what; ten billion dollars for

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.850
another god darn subatomic particle that gives
us mass; what's the big deal; why call it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.319
the God particle; why say that it's one of
the great achievements of modern science?&nbsp;

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:55.689
Well, you have to understand something: we
physicists squirm when we hear "God particle,"

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.539
but, you see, there is some truth to the name
"the God particle" because the Bible says

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.799
that God set the universe into motion.&nbsp;

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.579
That's what God did in Genesis, chapter one,
verse one.&nbsp;

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:16.360
However, we physicists say that the universe
was created in a big bang 13.7 billion years

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.360
ago.&nbsp;

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.220
But then the question is, why did it bang?&nbsp;

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.120
What set off the bang?&nbsp;

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.120
We don't know.&nbsp;

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.790
It's a big mystery.&nbsp;

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.490
Well, the answer is a Higgs-like boson set
off the Big Bang.&nbsp;

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.239
It put the bang in the Big Bang.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.150
See, the purpose of Higgs bosons—and there
is more than one—the purpose of the Higgs

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.360
boson is to break a symmetry.&nbsp;

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.989
And when you break symmetries like the symmetry
of the universe, then you get big bangs.&nbsp;

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.819
So what is the Higgs boson?&nbsp;

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.500
The Higgs boson is a fuse.&nbsp;

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.470
It's a match.&nbsp;

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.400
It's the spark that set off the Big Bang.&nbsp;

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.670
It put the bang in the Big Bang.&nbsp;&nbsp;
