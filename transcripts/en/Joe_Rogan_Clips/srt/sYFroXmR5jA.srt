1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,030
How do you, how do you deal
with people like the haters?

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,520
Because there's so many people.
I call them thumb thugs,

3
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:08,400
but how do you deal there?
There's hate in the dark.

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,250
I don't know what they're doing.
You don't read all those comments there?

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,270
I don't read shit anymore, man. A
very, very rarely go into mentioned.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,660
If I do, it's usually a mistake. I
just, I just do my best, do my best.

7
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:26,360
I post and I go, I post and ghost. You
don't even look at people's feeds, do?

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:30,780
No. I look at some people's
feeds on Instagram when I'm
bored. You know, I'm, I'll,

9
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,360
I'll read some things. You know, I
want to look at some cool pictures.

10
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:35,820
I watched some inspirational shit.
I like going to the rocks,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,460
seen him lifting weights. May
pumped up. I want to go to the gym.

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,910
Let me do the rock is,
let me tell you it Fletcher.

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,010
I interviewed the rock
the first time I met him.

14
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:48,210
I was like 11 years ago during the game
plan and we just hit it off right game

15
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:49,710
playing the game plan.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,870
That's where he played a quarterback
because he was a lot thinner.

17
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,220
It's his first breakout movie that he
did Scorpion and then the game plan.

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,090
And after that interview, uh, he
took some time and just talk to me.

19
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:03,450
He wasn't the rock then. I mean
he was, and then over the years,

20
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:06,180
every time I interviewed him,
he would pull me aside and go,

21
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,610
are you going to my acting coach? Are
you doing this? Are you doing that?

22
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,790
Is there anything I can help you
with? And I'm like, what? Like,

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,110
and then he got bigger and bigger and
the last time I saw him, same thing, Yo,

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,270
are you doing,
are you going to acting coach?

25
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,960
Are you working on your goals or your
improved like literally his Instagram but

26
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:25,230
in real life and um, and it's,
and he'll never know this,

27
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,680
but it's the thing that's
for me just average Schmo,

28
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:30,900
Michael Yo d to take the time out.

29
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,500
Every time I interview him to
ask me if I'm achieving my goals,

30
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,560
if I'm moving forward in life,
giving me positive things,

31
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:41,070
positive thoughts to take that time
like five minutes after every interview.

32
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:43,110
And this dude is booked nonstop,

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,440
but to actually take time and it's just
so inspirational in to see him be the

34
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:52,350
biggest movie star in the world.
And he knows everybody's name.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,290
He's very respected. I don't know
if he has an earpiece, but like,

36
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,850
it's like he's like the president when
he walks, he knows everybody's name.

37
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,010
He could be president. He,
oh hundred percent hundred
percent could be predators.

38
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,930
He cannot run through forum.
I went to, because he,

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,810
he's just a hard also comes
from humble beginnings. Yes.

40
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,700
You mean he's in Hawaii right now
and he's filming on his Instagram.

41
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:16,410
He's talking about all the neighborhoods
that he goes back to to check to see

42
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:20,100
where he was. Where's from when he was
poor and starving. Yeah. You know, I mean,

43
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:24,990
he really is from humble beginnings.
I mean he, he had only like, you know,

44
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:29,100
it's the story of like $5 left in as
account and then he got discovered and

45
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:32,310
wrestling and I knew him in
Miami when he was doing WWE.

46
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,230
I interviewed him a couple
of times over there and,

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,350
and he played for the University of Miami.
My favorite college football team.

48
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:40,200
So it's a thing where, you
know, the history of 11 years,

49
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:45,201
but for him that big to take
time to motivate me separately.

50
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,990
And you know, I know if he
sees me out, he knows my name,

51
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,010
but it's not like I'm texting,

52
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,240
I'm not like Kevin Hart with them and
just to be a random dude that he takes

53
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,870
time out every time he sees me to make
sure I'm hitting my goals and moving

54
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:01,300
forward with my career and not
back and then offering, hey,

55
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,330
if you ever need anything, get
in touch with me. You know,

56
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:08,350
I would never take them up on that.
But it's a thing where I'm nobody,

57
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,250
he's the rock. And to be
that inspiration, I mean it,

58
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:15,100
it just does so much man.
Like it.

59
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:20,490
Little things that big celebrities do
or somebody that really inspires you.

60
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,350
Like they don't know how much that means.
Like just that little time he spins it,

61
00:03:25,351 --> 00:03:29,430
it'd so much. I think he does
know, I think he's a genuine
leader. He is, you know,

62
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,610
100% that's why so many people like him
because what he says is it's authentic.

63
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,930
It's really who he is.
There is nothing fake about that man.

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,300
You don't have to be fake.
You just have to be successful.

65
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,090
And if you want to work as hard as
that guy, you can be successful. I,

66
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,520
I asked one day,
I was like,

67
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,540
do you just take a bunch of pictures at
the gym like in just posts throughout

68
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,930
the day because you're always at that
big from taking pictures for no man.

69
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,220
That guy's picking heavy shit up. That's
too big. But you know what? I left.

70
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,260
That's just too big Joe stuff. Too Big
for him. No, he's an action star Dude.

71
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,650
And he's the first action
start at looks like an egg.

72
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,650
Like I would want him to save my life in
real life. Wow. What does he like six,

73
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,070
seven or some shit like that.
And like he's, he's this giant,

74
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,980
he's a little bit taller than me.
I'm seeing these giant,

75
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:19,390
he's built like a fucking like legitimate
superhero. Like, will Smith was my guy,

76
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,690
but I left will Smith for the rock.
And you left him? No, no, no. I stayed.

77
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:27,160
He's still, well, no, no, no. But
like you gotta do what you gotta do.

78
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,510
Burning, building a burning
building. Who's going to save you?

79
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,810
Who's going to save you?
Will Smith let me save you two

80
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,930
aliens coming at you.
Uh, Independence Day.

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,040
Did you not see will Smith Save the
world? I dug my look. I love will Smith.

82
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,690
An earthquake. An earthquake. Well,

83
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:51,610
if you want someone to hold one hand on
the top of a building and then hold your

84
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:55,780
wrist with another and know that he's
got you according to the movie poster,

85
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:59,710
that's the rock. See, I never saw will
Smith holding the top of the building.

86
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,450
[inaudible] shoot a gun by the hand.
Will Smith can shoot a gun? Those,

87
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,320
those zombies he did. I am legend.
Oh Man. What a great fucking movie.

88
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,660
Oh my goodness. Great. Fuck moving. God.
