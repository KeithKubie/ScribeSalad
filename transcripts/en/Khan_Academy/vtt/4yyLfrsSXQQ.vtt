00:00:01.144 --> 00:00:04.360
- [Voiceover] This is a
painting of Nicole Oresme.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.610
I looked up the phonetic spelling
before making this video.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.277
I'm assuming I'm still mispronouncing it.

00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:11.654
But I apologize to all the French speakers

00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:12.978
out there ahead of time.

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:16.277
He was a famous French
philosopher mathematician,

00:00:16.277 --> 00:00:20.094
who lived in medieval France,
he lived in the 1300s.

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:22.260
And he is famous for his proof

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.719
that the harmonic series
actually diverges.

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:29.811
And just as a little bit of
review, this is a harmonic series.

00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:33.552
One plus 1/2, plus 1/3,
plus 1/4, plus 1/5.

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:35.443
And it's always been in my brain,

00:00:35.443 --> 00:00:37.212
the first time that I
saw the harmonic series,

00:00:37.212 --> 00:00:39.793
it wasn't obvious to me whether
it converged or diverged.

00:00:39.793 --> 00:00:42.500
It looks like, well, gee,
all these terms are positive,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.920
but they're going towards
zero, so I could imagine

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.943
that this thing could converge.

00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:50.277
But he proved it otherwise.

00:00:50.277 --> 00:00:52.811
He proved one of the most
famous and most elegant proofs

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:56.127
in mathematics that it
does indeed diverge.

00:00:56.127 --> 00:00:58.032
And the way that he did this,

00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:02.107
is he replaced every term
in the harmonic series

00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:06.212
with a term that is less
than or equal to that term.

00:01:06.212 --> 00:01:11.212
And then by proving that
his new series diverges

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:15.566
and it's less than or
equal to this series,

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.302
or each of the terms
are less than or equal

00:01:17.302 --> 00:01:19.819
to each of the
corresponding terms up here,

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.968
then he says, therefore,
by the comparison test,

00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:23.707
this must diverge.

00:01:23.707 --> 00:01:25.672
So, how did he construct that?

00:01:25.672 --> 00:01:29.256
One way to think about it is
he replaced each of the terms

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:34.236
in the harmonic series with
the largest power of 1/2

00:01:34.236 --> 00:01:38.861
that is less than or equal to that term.

00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:41.335
So, what's the largest power of 1/2

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:44.676
that is less than or equal to one?

00:01:44.676 --> 00:01:47.586
Well, one is a power of 1/2, so that is,

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.619
1/2 to the zero power is one.

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.848
So, one is the largest power of 1/2

00:01:51.848 --> 00:01:54.043
that is less than or equal to one.

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:56.389
I'll just write the one there.

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:58.472
And now, what's the largest power of 1/2

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:00.769
that is less than or equal to 1/2?

00:02:00.769 --> 00:02:02.264
That's just going to be 1/2,

00:02:02.264 --> 00:02:04.742
that's just 1/2 to the first power.

00:02:04.742 --> 00:02:09.223
Now, what's the largest power of 1/2

00:02:09.223 --> 00:02:12.534
that is less than or equal to 1/3?

00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:16.448
1/2 is larger than 1/3,
it's not less than 1/3.

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:21.448
We want it to be less than 1/3,
so the largest power of 1/2

00:02:24.295 --> 00:02:27.462
that is less than or equal to 1/3 is 1/4.

00:02:27.462 --> 00:02:32.462
I replace 1/3 with 1/4 and, of
course, replace 1/4 with 1/4.

00:02:33.842 --> 00:02:38.842
And then we get to 1/5.

00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:41.227
What's the largest power of 1/2

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:43.385
that is less than or equal to 1/5?

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:46.594
Once again, 1/4 is greater than 1/5.

00:02:46.594 --> 00:02:48.720
The largest power of 1/2 that is less than

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.018
or equal to 1/5 is 1/8.

00:02:52.018 --> 00:02:54.831
So, you replace that with 1/8.

00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.666
Of course, we replace for the
same reason that with 1/8.

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:01.902
You would replace that one with 1/8.

00:03:01.902 --> 00:03:03.723
And, of course, 1/8.

00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:07.607
The largest power of 1/2 that is less than

00:03:07.607 --> 00:03:10.236
or equal to 1/8 is 1/8.

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:12.508
And then what would you replace 1/9 with?

00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:16.502
You would replace 1/9 with 1/16
by the exact same argument.

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:18.804
And you would keep going all
the way until you get to 1/16,

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:23.220
so you would extensionally
have eight 1/16s in a row.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.810
What's interesting here?

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.442
Let's first verify that we can use

00:03:27.442 --> 00:03:29.349
the comparison test here.

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.018
In this first series each of
the terms are non-negative.

00:03:33.018 --> 00:03:36.407
In the second series each of
the terms are non-negative.

00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:40.095
And we also see that each
of the corresponding terms

00:03:40.095 --> 00:03:43.419
in a harmonic series is greater than

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.918
or equal to the corresponding
term in this series.

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:47.356
We constructed it this way.

00:03:47.356 --> 00:03:49.644
These are equal, this one is equal,

00:03:49.644 --> 00:03:51.957
this is greater than this,
1/3 is greater than 1/4.

00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:54.677
1/4 is equal to 1/4,
1/5 is greater than 1/8,

00:03:54.677 --> 00:03:58.046
1/6 is greater than 1/8,
1/7 is greater than 1/8.

00:03:58.046 --> 00:04:00.593
1/8 is equal to 1/8.

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:03.310
One way to think about it is,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.259
each of the corresponding terms

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.651
in this new constructed
series are smaller.

00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:10.805
Let me just call it S.

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:13.163
In this infinite sum, and, of course,

00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:14.632
we keep going on and on and on.

00:04:14.632 --> 00:04:17.143
Maybe i should do that in magenta.

00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:22.320
We see that each of the
corresponding terms here

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.640
are smaller than the
corresponding terms up here.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.670
And they are all positive.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.670
If we can prove that S, this
sum right over here, diverges,

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.910
then, by the comparison
test, the larger series,

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.018
the harmonic series here,

00:04:39.018 --> 00:04:40.932
the one where the
corresponding terms are larger,

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:43.436
that must also diverge.

00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:44.994
And how do we do that?

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:46.768
Let's just actually take these sums.

00:04:46.768 --> 00:04:49.094
This is going to be, let me write it.

00:04:49.094 --> 00:04:54.094
S is going to be equal to one plus 1/2.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:58.418
1/4 plus 1/4, what's that?

00:04:58.418 --> 00:05:01.306
That's 2/4, or 1/2.

00:05:01.306 --> 00:05:02.858
Did you see what's going on here?

00:05:02.858 --> 00:05:04.029
This is exciting.

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.030
What's 1/8 plus 1/8 plus 1/8 plus 1/8?

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.055
That's 4/8, or 1/2.

00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:13.352
What's 1/16 plus 1/16, and we
are going to go all the way

00:05:13.352 --> 00:05:15.736
until we are going to have eight of these.

00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:20.736
That's going to be 8/16, or 1/2.

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:26.193
And then you are going to
have sixteen 1/32nds, or 1/2.

00:05:26.193 --> 00:05:29.965
And so, we are essentially
just going to be adding 1/2.

00:05:29.965 --> 00:05:32.067
We start with one, we
just keep adding plus 1/2,

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:34.581
plus 1/2, plus 1/2, plus 1/2.

00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:38.939
This is clearly going to be
equal to, or this is unbounded.

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:43.924
You could say, this is equal to infinity.

00:05:43.924 --> 00:05:48.924
Or, another way to think about
this, is S clearly diverges.

00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:57.474
And since each of its terms are smaller

00:05:58.693 --> 00:06:01.261
than the corresponding terms
in the harmonic series,

00:06:01.261 --> 00:06:06.261
we can then say the
harmonic series diverges.

00:06:13.493 --> 00:06:16.449
There is no way that this
thing over here can converge.

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:19.696
If each of its corresponding
terms are smaller,

00:06:19.696 --> 00:06:22.284
you could even think of
the sum as being smaller.

00:06:22.284 --> 00:06:23.845
But this sum goes to infinity,

00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:27.701
so this one must also go to infinity.

00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:31.177
Hopefully, you found that
as interesting as I did.
