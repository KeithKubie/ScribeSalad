00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:09.356
Ani stands before a large golden scale

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:12.879
where the jackal-headed god
Anubis is weighing his heart

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.907
against a pure ostrich feather.

00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:17.696
Ani was a real person,

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:20.480
a scribe from the Egyptian city
of Thebes

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.672
who lived in the 13th century BCE.

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:27.319
And depicted here is a scene
from his Book of the Dead,

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:32.700
a 78-foot papyrus scroll
designed to help him attain immortality.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.289
Such funerary texts were originally
written only for Pharaohs,

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.891
but with time, the Egyptians came
to believe

00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:43.031
regular people could also reach
the afterlife

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:46.870
if they succeeded in the passage.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.601
Ani's epic journey begins with his death.

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:52.462
His body is mummified by a team of priests

00:00:52.462 --> 00:00:55.562
who remove every organ except the heart,

00:00:55.562 --> 00:00:59.122
the seat of emotion, memory, 
and intelligence.

00:00:59.122 --> 00:01:01.721
It's then stuffed with a salt
called natron

00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:04.901
and wrapped in resin-soaked linen.

00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:08.880
In addition, the wrappings are woven
with charms for protection

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.792
and topped with a heart scarab amulet
that will prove important later on.

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:18.931
The goal of the two-month process
is to preserve Ani's body as an ideal form

00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.294
with which his spirit 
can eventually reunite.

00:01:22.294 --> 00:01:26.973
But first, that spirit must pass
through the duat, or underworld.

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:29.032
This is a realm of vast caverns,

00:01:29.032 --> 00:01:30.122
lakes of fire,

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:31.580
and magical gates,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.680
all guarded by fearsome beasts -

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.654
snakes, crocodiles,
and half-human monstrosities

00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:40.751
with names like "he who dances in blood."

00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:44.233
To make things worse, Apep, the serpent
god of destruction,

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:48.812
lurks in the shadows waiting to swallow
Ani's soul.

00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:50.602
Fortunately, Ani is prepared

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:54.053
with the magic contained 
within his book of the dead.

00:01:54.053 --> 00:01:56.083
Like other Egyptians who could afford it,

00:01:56.083 --> 00:02:01.434
Ani customized his scroll to include
the particular spells, prayers, and codes

00:02:01.434 --> 00:02:04.994
he thought his spirit might need.

00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:06.455
Equipped with this arsenal,

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:08.564
our hero traverses the obstacles,

00:02:08.564 --> 00:02:10.536
repels the monsters' acts,

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:12.733
and stealthily avoids Apep

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:18.343
to reach the Hall of Ma'at,
goddess of truth and justice.

00:02:18.343 --> 00:02:20.763
Here, Ani faces his final challenge.

00:02:20.763 --> 00:02:23.933
He is judged by 42 assessor gods

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:27.964
who must be convinced 
that he has lived a righteous life.

00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:29.714
Ani approaches each one,

00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:31.075
addressing them by name,

00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:34.354
and declaring a sin he has not committed.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:38.835
Among these negative confessions,
or declarations of innocence,

00:02:38.835 --> 00:02:41.566
he proclaims that he has not made
anyone cry,

00:02:41.566 --> 00:02:43.245
is not an eavesdropper,

00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:45.575
and has not polluted the water.

00:02:45.575 --> 00:02:49.134
But did Ani really live 
such a perfect life?

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:53.425
Not quite, but that's where 
the heart scarab amulet comes in.

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:57.865
It's inscribed with the words,
"Do not stand as a witness against me,"

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:01.034
precisely so Ani's heart 
doesn't betray him

00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:03.754
by recalling the time he listened
to his neighbors fight

00:03:03.754 --> 00:03:07.586
or washed his feet in the Nile.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:11.774
Now, it's Ani's moment of truth,
the weighing of the heart.

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:15.956
If his heart is heavier than the feather,
weighed down by Ani's wrongdoings,

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:19.199
it'll be devoured 
by the monstrous Ammit,

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:23.285
part crocodile, part leopard, 
part hippopotamus,

00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:26.756
and Ani will cease to exist forever.

00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:28.466
But Ani is in luck.

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:30.104
His heart is judged pure.

00:03:30.104 --> 00:03:35.196
Ra, the sun god, takes him to Osiris,
god of the underworld,

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:39.197
who gives him final approval to enter
the afterlife.

00:03:39.197 --> 00:03:41.917
In the endless and lush field of reeds,

00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:44.255
Ani meets his deceased parents.

00:03:44.255 --> 00:03:49.065
Here, there is no sadness, pain, or anger,
but there is work to be done.

00:03:49.065 --> 00:03:52.315
Like everyone else, Ani must cultivate
a plot of land,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:58.046
which he does with the help of a Shabti
doll that had been placed in his tomb.

00:03:58.046 --> 00:04:01.636
Today, the Papyrus of Ani resides
in the British Museum,

00:04:01.636 --> 00:04:04.405
where it has been since 1888.

00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:08.626
Only Ani, if anyone, knows what really
happened after his death.

00:04:08.626 --> 00:04:10.408
But thanks to his Book of the Dead,

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:14.377
we can imagine him happily tending
his crops for all eternity.
