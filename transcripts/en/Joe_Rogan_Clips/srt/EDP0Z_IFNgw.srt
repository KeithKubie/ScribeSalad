1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,350
It will come home to roost.
I mean,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,410
here's what's going to happen is Facebook
and youtube are going to fall prey to

3
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:08,100
their own standards because if their
standard is that you're responsible for

4
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:11,970
your followers or I'm responsible for
my followers or Jordan or anybody else's

5
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:14,940
responsible for all the people
who view their stuff. Okay,

6
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:17,760
then why isn't Facebook responsible for
all the people posting on its platform?

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,320
If they are right,

8
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:21,990
if Facebook becomes responsible for
all the people posting on his platform,

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,600
they'll be bankrupt in a week.
They've got a problem.

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,570
They really do because they have to
decide whether they are a platform or

11
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:30,920
whether they are a do gooder
publication. Yeah, I run,

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:33,690
I run a a publication daily wire.
It's openly conservative.

13
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:37,650
We make no bones about that and we are
responsible for the content that appears

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,700
on our platform and if we say something
to flammatory, we will be sued.

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,490
If we say something that is false,
then we will be sued.

16
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:48,900
Presumably if you post something falls
on Facebook, Facebook doesn't get sued,

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,320
but now Facebook has deemed itself the
morality police and they'll band people

18
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:55,440
they don't like and we'll decide what
editorially ought to be elevated and what

19
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,310
ought not to be elevated.

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,310
Does that sound more like
the phone company to you or
does that sound more like

21
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:02,630
my website where I decide what gets
published and what doesn't? Right.

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,790
Cause Facebook's case for
exemption from these laws is,

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,280
well we're like the phone company, right?
When you're on the phone with somebody,

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,520
if that person says something criminal
at t and t isn't responsible for the

25
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:15,090
person saying something
criminal or terrible, it's
just the phone company, right?

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,800
But Facebook isn't doing that.
Facebook is,

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,000
is jumping into the middle of
conversations and then saying,

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,930
well we don't really like
this conversation so we're
just going to kind of shut

29
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:29,010
it down. Not because of legal threat,
but because we just don't like it.

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,040
So are they actually doing that?
Like say if you

31
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:36,150
put a post up on Facebook and they
don't like the way you worded things or

32
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:39,280
describe things where they actually
shut down your post, what will they,

33
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:41,690
so they've done it in the
past to some conservative.

34
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,420
Publix is pretty controversial because
they're not transparent at all. Right.

35
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:49,070
I can tell you that at the beginning of
2018 we lost about 35% of our traffic

36
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:53,120
because Facebook started cracking
down on mostly conservative sites.

37
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:54,830
They said that it was kind
of new sites generally,

38
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,050
but that's not what the statistics showed.

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,220
They're doing it more often with things
that we all sort of agree are bad. Right?

40
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,920
We all agree white supremacy is bad.
White nationalism is bad.

41
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:05,150
Now they say they're going
to censor that stuff,

42
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:06,110
but here's where I'm uncomfortable.

43
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:10,070
I think that that stuff is awful and evil
and those people are, the ones are the,

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,170
they're the reason I
have personal security,

45
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,670
but once you get into the business of
Facebook gets to decide which speech is

46
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:19,850
good and which speech is bad. They're
an editor. Yeah, they're an editor.

47
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:23,270
Even if I agree with their assessment
of what stuff is good and what is bad,

48
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,870
I am not comfortable with them in the
driver's seat there and if they are going

49
00:02:26,871 --> 00:02:28,940
to be in the driver's seat than they
should be held liable for all the stuff

50
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:32,300
that's on their platform. I
mean, why isn't the Twitter,
Twitter, same thing, right?

51
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:36,260
Why is it that Louis Farrakhan is still
on that platform but Alex Jones is not

52
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,190
like, I don't like Alex Jones
is material or I been very,

53
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:41,600
very critical of Alex Jones.

54
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,110
I didn't think you should get banned
from Twitter unless he actually violated

55
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,450
the law in, unless he was
responsible for a violent threat,

56
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,870
unless he was defamatory or
something like that. They're

57
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,860
definitely going down this road
of being the moral arbitrators.

58
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,030
They're, they're the ones who get to
decide what the conversations are and,

59
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,270
and that's an insane responsibility.

60
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,900
The responsibility of getting to dictate
what should and should not be discussed

61
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,290
and to have it to be a handful of people
and have these people almost almost

62
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:15,100
exclusively live in the Pacific Norton,
you know, north of San Francisco.

63
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,990
That whole tech community.
I mean it's all tech liberals who really,

64
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,520
if you're around those people,

65
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,700
they live in this really strange Uber
wealthy bubble of super genius spectrum

66
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:35,131
people who are coders and
super capitalists and people
that are raising money

67
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:40,390
all over the place and
designing technology and they
have an ideology and it's

68
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,890
not necessarily a bad one, just just
being honest and upfront about what it is.

69
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:49,120
It's this incredibly progressive, which
is very unusual for big business, right?

70
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,120
For big business to be just openly,

71
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:56,800
transparently progressive and pushing
social justice. It's very unusual.

72
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,520
Well, I think that there is a sort of
misunderstanding of when we say what big

73
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,260
business is,
what big businesses.

74
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:05,350
So I think that there's a wide variety
of owners of businesses and how they

75
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,930
think about politics obviously. Yeah.
Bill Gates is a progressive guy.

76
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:12,650
Warren Buffet's a progressive guy.
They are now, if it was bill gates,

77
00:04:12,651 --> 00:04:16,370
supplies of his whole life. He's
ruthless with Microsoft. Well,

78
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,220
so I think that there
are a lot of listening.

79
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,780
I think that that the vast majority,

80
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:22,330
I think mark Zuckerberg is ruthless
with Facebook and use progressive.

81
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:25,750
I think Jack Dorsey is as ruthless as
the next guy when it comes to profit.

82
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,480
I mean, he's still gotta be answerable
to the shareholders. So I think,

83
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,840
I think a lot of the
progressivism is sort of a,

84
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,710
a way to excuse your own in your own
involvement in the capitalist market.

85
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,780
Facebook took off. Don't be evil. Like
that was their thing. Don't be evil.

86
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,620
They decided to remove that Google, right?
I say Facebook, I'm sorry Google. Yeah.

87
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,530
Yeah. When Google did that, I met Google.
Just funny. When you think something,

88
00:04:48,531 --> 00:04:51,380
but you're saying another thing.
Um, when they did that, it's like,

89
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:53,900
why would you ever take off?
Don't be evil

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,540
like cheap that, but here's
my thing. Here's my thing.

91
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,750
I think that if our tech companies were
honest, they should take that stuff off.

92
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,100
Like stop pretending you're do Gooding,

93
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,920
you're not doing good and you're providing
a platform and maybe the platform is

94
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,870
the good mm. Right. In
a capitalist economy,

95
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,150
the product that you provide is the good,

96
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:11,940
I don't need additional good to
come from your product, right.

97
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:15,330
If you want to provide me a
solid morning drink, right?

98
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,420
I don't need your politics. Along
with that, I just need to drink. Well,

99
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:19,800
if I want a social media company,

100
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,190
I don't give two craps about what
Mark Zuckerberg thinks about politics.

101
00:05:23,191 --> 00:05:26,460
Dude hasn't studied it. I don't
care at all. What Jack Dorsey,

102
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,390
who vacations in Malaysia and gets
bitten by a million mosquitoes while

103
00:05:30,391 --> 00:05:32,700
meditating has to say
about the nature of life.

104
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:36,390
Like why do I care about Jack Dorsey's
political view? He has provided me a good,

105
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:39,990
the good is this basic chat
room where I'm consuming news.

106
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,490
How about that would just be enough,

107
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:44,220
but it's not enough for a lot
of these folks. It's, it's the,

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,100
the kind of Hooli from Silicon Valley.

109
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,160
We're going to pretend that we're here
to do good and it's not enough just to

110
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:53,250
acknowledge that maybe the thing
that you provided is the good,

111
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,770
like Bill Gates has done more good with
Microsoft and then has done with any of

112
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,750
the charities.
He's given a lot of money to charity,

113
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,230
but Microsoft has provided legitimately
a hundreds of thousands of jobs and

114
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:08,090
created enormously productive lines of
business and made enormous profit for a

115
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:11,780
lot of people. A lot of people have
stock in Microsoft as a general,

116
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,260
as a basic factual thing.
He has done more good doing that.

117
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:19,010
Then giving tens of millions of
dollars to, to various outside causes.

118
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:22,940
So it feels like a lot of the
progressivism in, in corporate halls, in,

119
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:27,530
in Silicon Valley is bifurcated mentally.
It's like people have, they're like,

120
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:29,660
dolphins is one side of the
brain on at a time. Here's my,

121
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,420
here's my capitalist side where
I got and make money and profit.

122
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,290
And then here's my other side where I
show people what a great person I am by

123
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,480
proclaiming that I'm for Bernie Sanders.
Well,

124
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,420
parking my money off shore to make sure
that they're, it's shielded from the,

125
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,283
from the tax man.

126
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,200
Yeah. Well that's a good assessment. Um,

127
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,530
what I'm saying is that
the don't be evil thing.

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,920
Like one of the things
that I thought was a,

129
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,930
what if that was like a legal
decision was me being cynical,

130
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:58,280
that they were pulled into some
sort of an office and said, um,

131
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,120
if we say don't be evil and you
take someone off the platform,

132
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:04,500
you're accusing them of evil.

133
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,320
That's it. I mean that we should slow that
down. Maybe, I mean again, this, this,

134
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,970
this self assessment of you are the
moral police I find really troubling and

135
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:15,650
it's so funny. I'm the, I'm the suppose
in more or less, right? Right. I'm,

136
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,130
I'm the religious guy. I'm
in the Orthodox Jew, right?

137
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:21,790
I talk about social standards and how
people should behave in their personal

138
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:22,060
life,

139
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,540
but when it comes to government and when
it comes to me imposing my views on you,

140
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,930
I am way less of a top down tyrant than
any of the people in Silicon Valley.

141
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,920
I am not here to tell you that you are
not allowed to be on a platform because

142
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:34,900
we disagree. It's one thing if
you're threatening violence,

143
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:36,400
which is an actual violation of law,

144
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:41,230
but this crap where people like me because
I believe in the social fabric built

145
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,610
on certain Judeo Christian values,

146
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,680
but I'm not forcing you to
be part of that and I'm not,

147
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,740
I don't think the government should
compel you to be a part of that or I'm the

148
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:48,370
tyrant,

149
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,910
but the person who sits at the top of
Twitter or Facebook who is saying that

150
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:55,390
they get to police what you see and
they're going to nudge you in the right

151
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,360
direction, nudge you in the right
direction without your consent,

152
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,030
without them even telling them what
you're doing right there. They're just,

153
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,970
they're going to push you a little bit
because they know better than you and

154
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:07,360
they can sort of massage you into better
views if we control your channels of

155
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,300
information. This is something the
Obama administration was very fond of.

156
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:13,720
There's a scholar named Cass Sunstein
as a legal scholar and he wrote a book

157
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:15,190
called nudge. He was very famous. It was,

158
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:18,670
it was used as sort of a handbook during
the Obama administration and the idea

159
00:08:18,671 --> 00:08:19,210
was,
well,

160
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,770
if we can just use a non forcible means
to sort of nudge people in a particular

161
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:26,170
direction without them even
knowing they're being nudged,

162
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,070
then shouldn't we do that? And I think,
no, you shouldn't. You shouldn't.

163
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,610
Because transparency is the only way I
can tell what kind of bullshit you're

164
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:35,080
trying to sell me. Well, not yet.

165
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,920
Just that like you're, you're
closing down even conversation. If,

166
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,120
if, as soon as you try to
silence this other voice, if you,

167
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,620
if you believe one thing and another
person believes a different thing,

168
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,710
you should probably talk about it.
And the way,

169
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,480
the way that I know for sure there's
something wrong with your argument is if

170
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,710
what you're to do is you're sneakily
trying to silence these voices. And again,

171
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,170
as long as we're not talking
about threats of violence,

172
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,390
and as long as we're not talking
about harassment or doxing,

173
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,100
we're just talking about conversation.

174
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,470
You're just talking about people
with differing points of view.

175
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,630
If you want to silence
differing points of view,

176
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,340
I have to wonder about your intent.

177
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,980
I have to wonder about whether you're
going into this conversation with good

178
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:14,520
faith.

179
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,570
I have to wonder whether you've really
objectively assessed whether or not you,

180
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,560
your argument does hold up against
scrutiny because this is also part of the

181
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,630
problem.
And when you're in an echo chamber,

182
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,880
you often don't formulate
these arguments very well.

183
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,180
Like when you confront people about
certain bias beliefs that they have,

184
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,990
and you have an opposing belief,
if they're part of a bubble,

185
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,170
like sometimes they might not have even
ever considered some of the things you

186
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:39,360
have to say. And I've seen that
with some of your videos. Yeah.
