Speaker 1:          00:00          Danger. Other people. So so, so my question then is when I was physically threatened on Twitter, you guys refuse to take down the tweet and I showed up in Berkeley and someone physically threatened me because they were encouraged to, when I was in Venezuela I was physically threatened by high profile individual, 10,000 people tweeting at me. You guys do nothing. Right? So I guess there's the obvious question of why does it always feel like your policies are going one direction politically? You say it's about behavior and you said several times already, but I've already, I've got a ton of examples of that not being the case

Speaker 2:          00:28          and you will always be able to find those exams.

Speaker 1:          00:30          Yeah. Examples where you guys were alerted multiple times and did nothing. Like when Antifa docs, a bunch of law enforcement agents, some of the tweets are removed, but since September this tweet is still alive with a list of private phone numbers addresses. Yet Kathy Griffin, she's fine. The guy who threatened the lives of these kids in Covington and said, lock him in school and burn it down. You did nothing. I mean he got to spend it. I take his tweets down. Was he banned for threatening the lives of kids? Absolutely not.

Speaker 2:          00:57          So again, we have an, um, I'm happy to talk about all these details. We have our policies that are meant to protect people and are meant to enable for expression as long as you're not trying to silence somebody else. Now we take a variety of different enforcement mechanisms around that. Sometimes you get warned, sometimes we were, your tweet is forced to be deleted. It's a very rare occasion where we will outright suspend someone without any sort of warning or any sort of, um, ability to understand what happened.

Speaker 1:          01:24          What did you guys do with Kathy Griffin when she was saying she wanted the names of those young kids were in the mag of hats at the Covington high school.

Speaker 2:          01:31          That's all right. That's a great example, Joe. So in that particular case, you know, our doxing policy really focuses on, uh, posting private information, which we don't consider names to be private. We consider your home address, your home phone, your home phone number, or your mobile phone number, those types of things to be private. So in that particular case we took what I think now is probably a very literal interpretation of our policy. And so that, that was not a doxing incident. Do you think that was an error? I think that it was shortsighted and given the context of what was going on there, that um, if I was doing this all over again, I would probably ask my team to look at that through the lens of what was the purpose behind that tweet. And if the purpose was in fact to identify these kids to either docs in them or abusing, harassing him, which it probably was, then we should be taking a more expansive view of, of that policy and including that type of content,

Speaker 1:          02:18          especially considering the fact they're minors. I mean, I would think that right away that would be like the approach. So this is a trial and error sort of learn and grow and move on with new information sort of. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:29          absolutely. We're gonna learn, we're gonna make a ton of mistakes. We're trying to do this, uh, with hundreds of millions of accounts all around the world, numerous languages. We're going to make mistakes. Even if we get better, there will always be mistakes, but we're hoping to learn from those and to make ourselves better and to catch cases like Tim's or others where we clearly may have made an error. And I'm open to having those discussions. I'm not, I'm sorry Tim familiar with your specific cases, but I'd love to follow up with you and

Speaker 1:          02:57          I just want to see the tweet we don't need to pull up. So it's a, B I t. Dot. L Y slash Antifa tweet, all lower case.

Speaker 3:          03:04          This is also an evolution in prioritization as well. Wondering one of the things we've come to recently is we do, we do need, we do need to prioritize these efforts both in terms of policy enforcement, um, how we're thinking about evolving them. Um, one of the things that we want to focus on as number one is physical safety. And this leads you immediately to something like doxing. And right now the only way we take action on a docksin case is if it's reported or not. Where we want to move to is to be able to recognize those in real time, at least in the English language, recognize those in real time through our machine learning algorithms and take the action before it has to report it. So we're focused purely right now on going after a Dachsund cases with our algorithms so that we can be proactive. That also requires a much more rigorous appeals process to correct us when we're wrong, but we think it's tightly scoped enough. It impacts the most important thing, which is someone's physical safety. Once we learned from that, we can really look at the, the biggest issue with our system right now is all the burden is placed upon the victim. So we only act based on reports. We don't have a lot of enforcement. Um, especially with, with more of the more, the more of the take downs that are run through machine learning and deep learning algorithm.

Speaker 1:          04:24          But if something is reported, a human does review it eventually or are there a series of reports that you never get to?

Speaker 3:          04:30          There's, there's probably reports we don't, I mean we, we prioritize the queue based on severity and the, the thing that Walmart severity is something like physical safety or private information or whatnot. So generally we try to get through everything but we have to prioritize that cute even coming in.

Speaker 1:          04:45          So if, if someone threatened the lives of someone else, you would, would you band that account? Would you tell them like, like let's say someone tweeted three times, kill these people. I want them dead three times. Is that yes. Violin. You didn't, you didn't ban him though. Let's pull that up Jamie. That's a, I don't know. I don't, I don't necessarily want to give out specific user names because then people just point the finger at me and saying I'm getting these people band. But you know, during Covington this guy said multiple times too. He wanted his followers to go and kill these kids.

Speaker 3:          05:14          Yeah. And we have to look at that, but we also have to look in the context because we also have, I think we talked about this a little bit in the last podcast, but we, we have gamers on the platform who are saying exactly that to their friends that they're going to meet at the game in the game tonight. And without the context of their relationship with, at the context of the conversation that we're having, we would take the exact same action on, on them incorrectly.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Yeah, absolutely. That I, that I understand. I think in the case of Covington though, this user was so high profile, he's a verified user. He's got something like 20,000 followers and it was highlighted by numerous conservative media outlets saying, wow, this guys, it screenshot it. It's being shared. I mean you had a Disney producer in like saying a picture of a woodchipper with a body being thrown in saying that's what he wanted to happen, you know? So I do know that some of these accounts got locked. Disney producer was doing that. Well, I'll, I'll clarify fact check me on that. But that's the, basically the conversation that was had it, there's a guy at Disney was, he posted a picture of him Fargo of someone being tossed into woodchip are and he says, I want all these Maga kids, you know, done like this. You had another guy who specifically said lock them in the school, Barnett down, set a bunch of disparaging things and then said if you see them fire on that many tweeted that more than once

Speaker 2:          06:23          and that those accounts where those streets were taken down, those were violations of our rules. That's, I'm pretty sure it's actually illegal to do that. Right. It's to, to to tell, to tell you or any individual to commit a felony is a crime like right. Incitement of violence or yeah. Yeah. So I have in many places, I just have to wonder how, how, like I understand the context issue, but this is what, this is what I talk. What were those context and scale too though, right? The Tim, those accounts were actioned. They may not have been action the way you wanted to too, but the, the tweets were forced to be deleted. And the account I can penalty for that. So I understand that. But kind of a penalty. Well, again, as I said earlier, Joe, we don't, uh, usually uh, automatically suspend accounts with one violation because we want people to learn, we want people to understand what they did wrong and give them an opportunity not to do it again.

Speaker 2:          07:10          Right? And it's a big thing to kick someone off the platform and I take that very, very seriously. So, so I want to make sure that when someone violates our rules, they understand what happened and they're given an opportunity to, you know, get back on the platform and change their behavior. And so in many of these cases, what happens is we will force someone to acknowledge that their tweet violated our rules, forced them to delete that tweet before they can get back on the platform. And in, in many cases, if they do it again, we give them a timeout, which is like seven days. When we say, look, you've done it again, the temporary suspension. If you do it again, you're a mom and the totally a mom. Exactly. And your mom too. And if you do it again, then you're done. Right? So it's kind of like, you know, three strikes. So it's Sorta like baseball. And so in some of these cases at Tim's referencing, I have to imagine because these tweets were deleted, they are violations of our rules. People are upset that the account came back again and was allowed to say other things. But we did take action on those streets. They were violations of our.
