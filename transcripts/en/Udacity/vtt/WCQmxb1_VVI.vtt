00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.040
So I've got my string awesomeThoughts and

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.560
it's saved as My name is Cameron and I am AWESOME!

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.410
I'm going to create a new variable called funThoughs and I'm going to use

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.170
the replace method to replace the word AWESOME from awesomeThoughts, with FUN.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.667
Once I've done that, I'm going to use the jQuery selector here for

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:24.620
the main id and I'll append our new funThoughts variable.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.520
Save that, come over to the browser and

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.930
hit Refresh, and we see that my name is Cameron and I am FUN
