this is this something that people want
 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.169
this is this something that people want
to use and and and the numbers were

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179
to use and and and the numbers were
 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:29.849
to use and and and the numbers were
really good but also publishers were

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859
really good but also publishers were
 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:30.899
really good but also publishers were
excited about it because they saw it as

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909
excited about it because they saw it as

try and get their content out there and
then just last week we just we announced

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090
then just last week we just we announced
 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.489
then just last week we just we announced
that we double the number of publishers

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:38.499
that we double the number of publishers
 

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:39.719

who are participating in this it's still

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729
who are participating in this it's still
 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.919
who are participating in this it's still
in labs and we're still trying to figure

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929
in labs and we're still trying to figure
 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:42.749
in labs and we're still trying to figure
out exactly what we're going to do with

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759
out exactly what we're going to do with
 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.789
out exactly what we're going to do with
this but we were really excited not only

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799
this but we were really excited not only
 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.590
this but we were really excited not only
by the reaction that we got from users

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600
by the reaction that we got from users
 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.870
by the reaction that we got from users
but also from publishers because I think

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880
but also from publishers because I think
 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.699
but also from publishers because I think
they see that we are continuing to

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:50.709
they see that we are continuing to
 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:51.779
they see that we are continuing to
innovate in this space and now we're

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789
innovate in this space and now we're
 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:52.919
innovate in this space and now we're
trying to figure out what can we do

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929
trying to figure out what can we do
 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.199
trying to figure out what can we do
together how can we experiment I think

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209
together how can we experiment I think
 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:58.199
together how can we experiment I think
one of the most one of us exciting

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209
one of the most one of us exciting
 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:59.429
one of the most one of us exciting
things with the conversations I have

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439
things with the conversations I have
 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.050
things with the conversations I have
with publishers almost all in these days

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060
with publishers almost all in these days
 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.809
with publishers almost all in these days
tend to end with some variation of the

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819
tend to end with some variation of the
 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:05.909
tend to end with some variation of the
of the statement hey when you're doing

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:05.919
of the statement hey when you're doing
 

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:06.870
of the statement hey when you're doing
something new we want to be your guinea

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880
something new we want to be your guinea
 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.449
something new we want to be your guinea
pig and for Google that's great because

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459
pig and for Google that's great because
 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.040
pig and for Google that's great because
that's just that's how we tend to

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050
that's just that's how we tend to
 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.510
that's just that's how we tend to
operate so as more and more publishers

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520
operate so as more and more publishers
 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.640
operate so as more and more publishers
kind of raise their hand and say we want

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650
kind of raise their hand and say we want
 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.839
kind of raise their hand and say we want
to figure this out to you we don't know

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849
to figure this out to you we don't know
 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.160
to figure this out to you we don't know
what the right answer is we want to try

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170
what the right answer is we want to try
 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.800
what the right answer is we want to try
something different and we figure that

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
something different and we figure that
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.729
something different and we figure that
there are ways that we can work together

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739
there are ways that we can work together
 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.520
there are ways that we can work together
to try and do

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530
to try and do
 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.020
to try and do
thatthat's I mean I think that that's

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030
thatthat's I mean I think that that's
 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.480
thatthat's I mean I think that that's
really that's that's probably one of the

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490
really that's that's probably one of the
 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.530
really that's that's probably one of the
more exciting things for me

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540
 
 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.420
 
well I think one important clarification

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430
well I think one important clarification
 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.270
well I think one important clarification
is I think that we are less concerned

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
is I think that we are less concerned
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.959
is I think that we are less concerned
about what the medium is I think what we

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969
about what the medium is I think what we
 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.910
about what the medium is I think what we
care about is making sure that that news

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
care about is making sure that that news
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.490
care about is making sure that that news
continues to survive that that you know

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
continues to survive that that you know
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.559

that Enterprise journalism that
 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.300
that Enterprise journalism that
investigative pieces these types of

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310
investigative pieces these types of
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.800
investigative pieces these types of
things that traditionally have come

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
things that traditionally have come
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.440
things that traditionally have come
through newspapers that type of content

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
through newspapers that type of content
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.630
through newspapers that type of content
can use to survive now whether or not

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640
can use to survive now whether or not
 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.069
can use to survive now whether or not
it's in the newspaper form or whether

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079
it's in the newspaper form or whether
 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.099
it's in the newspaper form or whether
it's in a you know kindle or whether

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109
it's in a you know kindle or whether
 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:02:59.899
it's in a you know kindle or whether
it's online I think we're pretty much

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909
it's online I think we're pretty much
 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:01.550
it's online I think we're pretty much
agnostic about how that's done as long

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
agnostic about how that's done as long
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.349
agnostic about how that's done as long
as that contact can use to survive and

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359
as that contact can use to survive and
 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.509
as that contact can use to survive and
so that's that's our real interest is to

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519
so that's that's our real interest is to
 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.640
so that's that's our real interest is to
try and make sure that the news online
