00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.500
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.380
Well, today's the chain rule.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.630
Very, very useful rule, and it's
kind of neat, natural.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.650
Can I explain what a chain
of functions is?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.810
There is a chain of functions.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.360
And then we want to know the
slope, the derivative.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.600
So how does the chain work?

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.250
So there x is the input.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.000
It goes into a function
g of x.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We could call that inside
function y.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.290
So the first step
is y is g of x.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.690
So we get an output
from g, call it y.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.250
That's halfway, because that y
then becomes the input to f.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.160
That completes the chain.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.850
It starts with x, produces
y, which is the inside

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.470
function g of x.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.830
And then let me call
it z is f of y.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.870
And what I want to know
is how quickly does

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.920
z change as x changes?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.740
That's what the chain
rule asks.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.260
It's the slope of that chain.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.900
Can I maybe just tell
you the chain rule?

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.970
And then we'll try it
on some examples.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.170
You'll see how it works.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.120
OK, here it is.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:44.180
The derivative, the slope of
this chain dz dx, notice I

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.830
want the change in the whole
thing when I change the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.530
original input.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.040
Then the formula is that
I take-- it's nice.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:04.800
You take dz dy times dy dx.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.539
So the derivative that we're
looking for, the slope, the

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.160
speed, is a product of two
simpler derivatives that we

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.200
probably know.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.100
And when we put the chain
together, we multiply those

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.460
derivatives.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.310
But there's one catch
that I'll explain.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.620
I can give you a hint
right away.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.710
dz dy, this first factor,
depends on y.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.170
But we're looking for the change
due to the original

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.150
change in x.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.110
When I find dz dy, I'm going
to have to get back to x.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.180
Let me just do an example
with a picture.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.480
You'll see why I
have to do it.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.350
So let the chain be cosine
of-- oh, sine.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.940
Why not?

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.520
Sine of 3x.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.500
Let me take sine of 3x.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.520
So that's my sine of 3x.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.405
I would like to know if that's
my function, and I can draw it

00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:23.700
and will draw it, what
is the slope?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.720
OK, so what's the
inside function?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.340
What's y here?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.420
Well, it's sitting there
in parentheses.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.740
Often it's in parentheses so
we identify it right away.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.790
y is 3x.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.590
That's the inside function.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.775
And then the outside function
is the sine of y.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.330
So what's the derivative
by the chain rule?

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.810
I'm ready to use the chain rule,
because these are such

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.630
simple functions, I know their
separate derivative.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.230
So if this whole thing
is z, the chain rule

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.780
says that dz dx is--

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.000
I'm using this rule.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.040
I first name dz dy, the
derivative of z with respect

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.820
to y, which is cosine of y.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.560
And then the second factor is
dy dx, and that's just a

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.820
straight line with slope
3, so dy dx is 3.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.580
Good.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.190
Good, but not finished, because
I'm getting an answer

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.530
that's still in terms of y, and
I have to get back to x,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.430
and no problem to do it.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.750
I know the link from y to x.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.630
So here's the 3.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.550
I can usually write it out here,
and then I wouldn't need

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.550
parentheses.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.250
That's just that 3.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.520
Now the part I'm caring
about: cosine of 3x.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.000
Not cosine x, even though
this was just sine.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.870
But it was sine of y, and
therefore, we need cosine 3x.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.480
Let me draw a picture of this
function, and you'll see

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.420
what's going on.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.580
If I draw a picture of--

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.570
I'll start with a picture of
sine x, maybe out to 180

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.310
degrees pi.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.140
This direction is now x.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.000
And this direction is going to
be-- well, there is the sine

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.500
of x, but that's not
my function.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.800
My function is sine of 3x, and
it's worth realizing what's

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.750
the difference.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:39.720
How does the graph change if
I have 3x instead of x?

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.420
Well, things come sooner.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.310
Things are speeded up.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.680
Here at x equal pi, 180 degrees,
is when the sine

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.360
goes back to 0.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.510
But for 3x, it'll be back to
0 already when x is 60

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.290
degrees, pi over 3.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:05.520
So 1/3 of the way along, right
there, my sine 3x is this one.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.700
It's just like the sine
curve but faster.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.940
That was pi over 3 there,
60 degrees.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:23.080
So this is my z of x curve, and
you can see that the slope

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.220
is steeper at the beginning.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.890
You can see that the slope--

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.700
things are happening
three times faster.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.200
Things are compressed by 3.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.300
This sine curve is
compressed by 3.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:44.190
That makes it speed up so the
slope is 3 at the start, and I

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.300
claim that it's 3
cosine of 3x.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.320
Oh, let's draw the slope.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.350
All right, draw the slope.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.140
All right, let me start with
the slope of sine-- so this

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.280
was just old sine x.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.400
So its slope is just
cosine x along to--

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.980
right?

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:11.850
That's the slope starts at 1.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.560
This is now cosine x.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.290
But that's going out
to pi again.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.050
That's the slope of the original
one, not the slope of

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.660
our function, of our chain.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.290
So the slope of our
chain will be--

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.160
I mean, it doesn't
go out so far.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.500
It's all between here and
pi over 3, right?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.580
Our function, the one
we're looking at, is

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.680
just on this part.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.690
And the slope starts out at 3,
and it's three times bigger,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.760
so it's going to be--
well, I'll just

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.200
about get it on there.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.450
It's going to go down.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.880
I don't know if that's great,
but it maybe makes the point

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:05.700
that I started up here at 3, and
I ended down here at minus

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:12.840
3 when x was 60 degrees
because then--

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.830
you see, this is a picture
of 3 cosine of 3x.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:27.270
I had to replace y by
3x at this point.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:32.039
OK, let me do two or three
more examples,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.929
just so you see it.

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:36.620
Let's take an easy one.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:42.510
Suppose z is x cubed squared.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.500
All right, here is the
inside function.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:54.350
y is x cubed, and z is--
do you see what z is?

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.890
z is x cubed squared.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.080
So x cubed is the
inside function.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.910
What's the outside function?

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.220
It's a function of y.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.400
I'm not going to write--

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.020
it's going to be the
squaring function.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.710
That's what we do outside.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.610
I'm not going to write
x squared.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.310
It's y squared.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.170
This is y.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.380
It's y squared that
gets squared.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:26.010
Then the derivative dz dx by
the chain rule is dz dy.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:27.640
Shall I remember
the chain rule?

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.350
dz dy, dy dx.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.810
Easy to remember because in the
mind of everybody, these

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:42.530
dy's, you see that they're
sort of canceling.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.100
So what's dz dy?

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.300
z is y squared, so this
is 2y, that factor.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.320
What's dy dx?

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.650
y is x cubed.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.740
We know the derivative
of x cubed.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.050
It's 3x squared.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:04.210
There is the answer, but it's
not final because I've got a y

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.830
here that doesn't belong.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:07.130
I've got to get it back to.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.630
X So I have all together 2 times
3 is making 6, and that

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.420
y, I have to go back and see
what was y in terms of x.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.950
It was x cubed.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.150
So I have x cubed there, and
here's an x squared,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.460
altogether x to the fifth.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.340
Now, is that the right answer?

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.110
In this example, we can
certainly check it because we

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.350
know what x cubed squared is.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:42.430
So x cubed is x times x times
x, and I'm squaring that.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.850
I'm multiplying by itself.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.820
There's another x
times x times x.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:52.360
Altogether I have x to
the sixth power.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.230
Notice I don't add those.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:59.990
When I'm squaring x cubed,
I multiply the 2 by

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.310
the 3 and get 6.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.040
So z is x to the sixth, and of
course, the derivative of x to

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.390
the sixth is 6 times x to the
fifth, one power lower.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.630
OK, I want to do two
more examples.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:23.600
Let me do one more right away
while we're on a roll.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:30.310
I'll bring down that board and
take this function, just so

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.580
you can spot the
inside function

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.070
and the outside function.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:39.760
So my function z is going to be
1 over the square root of 1

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.490
minus x squared.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.480
Such things come up pretty often
so we have to know its

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.950
derivative.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.640
We could graph it.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:55.920
That's a perfectly reasonable
function, and

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.100
it's a perfect chain.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.610
The first point is to identify
what's the inside function and

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:04.950
what's the outside.

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.370
So inside I'm seeing this
1 minus x squared.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:14.440
That's the quantity that it'll
be much simpler if I just give

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.330
that a single name y.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.150
And then what's the
outside function?

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.290
What am I doing to this y?

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:26.480
I'm taking its square root,
so I have y to the 1/2.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.870
But that square root is
in the denominator.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.520
I'm dividing, so it's
y to the minus 1/2.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:38.800
So z is y to the minus 1/2.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.150
OK, those are functions I'm
totally happy with.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.355
The derivative is what?

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.210
dz dy, I won't repeat
the chain rule.

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.090
You've got that clearly
in mind.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:54.490
It's right above.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.970
Let's just put in
the answer here.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.140
dz dy, the derivative, that's
y to some power, so I get

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.306
minus 1/2 times y
to what power?

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:10.560
I always go one power lower.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.355
Here the power is minus 1/2.

00:13:12.355 --> 00:13:17.490
If I go down by one, I'll
have minus 3/2.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.630
And then I have to have
dy dx, which is easy.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.430
dy dx, y is 1 minus x squared.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:31.030
The derivative of that
is just minus 2x.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:37.490
And now I have to assemble
these, put them together, and

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.660
get rid of the y.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.490
So the minus 2 cancels
the minus 1/2.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.600
That's nice.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:50.560
I have an x still here, and
I have y to the minus 3/2.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.310
What's that?

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:58.660
I know what y is, 1 minus x
squared, and so it's that to

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.220
the minus 3/2.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.760
I could write it that way.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.960
x times 1 minus x squared--

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.410
that's the y--

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.370
to the power minus 3/2.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.470
Maybe you like it that way.

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.870
I'm totally OK with that.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:19.250
Or maybe you want
to see it as--

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:28.310
this minus exponent
down here as 3/2.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.440
Either way, both good.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.650
OK, so that's one
more practice.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.970
and I've got one more in mind.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:42.310
But let me return to this board,
the starting board,

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:50.060
just to justify where did this
chain rule come from.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:53.160
OK, where do derivatives
come from?

00:14:53.160 --> 00:15:00.280
Derivative always start with
small finite steps, with delta

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.530
rather than d.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:09.630
So I start here, I make a change
in x, and I want to

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.660
know the change in z.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:23.320
These are small, but not
zero, not darn small.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:30.860
OK, all right, those are true
quantities, and for those, I'm

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:41.870
perfectly entitled to divide and
multiply by the change in

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.170
y because there will
be a change in y.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:49.070
When I change x, that produces
a change in g of x.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.840
You remember this was the y.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.760
So this factor--

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.310
well, first of all, that's
simply a true

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:02.840
statement for fractions.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.080
But it's the right way.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.070
It's the way we want it.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:14.190
Because now when I show it, and
in words, it says when I

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:19.130
change x a little, that produces
a change in y, and

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:22.520
the change in y produces
a change in z.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.920
And it's the ratio that we're
after, the ratio between the

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.190
original change and
the final change.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.130
So I just put the
inside change up

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.020
and divide and multiply.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.490
OK, what am I going to do?

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:41.940
What I always do, whatever body
does with derivatives at

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:44.740
an instant, at a point.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.510
Let delta x go to 0.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.270
Now as delta x goes to 0, delta
y will go to 0, delta z

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:55.650
will go to 0, and we get
a lot of zeroes over 0.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.870
That's what calculus is
prepared to live with.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.040
Because it keeps this ratio.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:13.050
It doesn't separately think
about 0 and then later 0.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.230
It's looking at the ratio
as things happen.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.619
And that ratio does
approach that.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:22.119
That was the definition
of the derivative.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:26.460
This ratio approaches that,
and we get the answer.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:31.490
This ratio approaches the
derivative we're after.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:34.370
That in a nutshell
is the thinking

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.470
behind the chain rule.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:41.390
OK, I could discuss it further,
but that's the

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.430
essence of it.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:51.730
OK, now I'm ready to do one more
example that isn't just

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.470
so made up.

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.750
It's an important one.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.090
And it's one I haven't
tackled before.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:10.960
My function is going to be e to
the minus x squared over 2.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.670
That's my function.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.670
Shall I call it z?

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.080
That's my function of x.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.790
So I want you to identify the
inside function and the

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.850
outside function in that change,
take the derivative,

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.290
and then let's look at the
graph for this one.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.430
The graph of this one is a
familiar important graph.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.770
But it's quite an interesting
function.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.140
OK, so what are you
going to take?

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:42.560
This often happens.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.550
We have e to the something,
e to some function.

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:50.760
So that's our inside
function up there.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.390
Our function y, inside function,
is going to be minus

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:01.310
x squared over 2, that quantity

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:03.060
that's sitting up there.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.980
And then z, the outside
function, is

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:11.550
just e to the y, right?

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.650
So two very, very simple
functions have gone into this

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.900
chain and produced this
e to the minus x

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.830
squared over 2 function.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:24.940
OK, I'm going to ask you for
the derivative, and you're

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.760
going to do it.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.500
No problem.

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:32.430
So dz dx, let's use
the chain rule.

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.420
Again, it's sitting
right above.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:41.450
dz dy, so I'm going to take the
slope, the derivative of

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:46.550
the outside function dz dy,
which is e to the y.

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:51.380
And that has that remarkable
property, which is why we care

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.230
about it, why we named it,
why we created it.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:56.940
The derivative of
that is itself.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.670
And the derivative of minus
x squared over 2 is--

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.920
that's a picnic, right?--

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.510
is a minus.

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.580
x squared, we'll
bring down a 2.

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.640
Cancel that 2, it'll
be minus x.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.720
That's the derivative of
minus x squared over 2.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.240
Notice the result is negative.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.390
This function is at
least out where--

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:25.460
if x is positive, the whole
slope is negative, and the

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.650
graph is going downwards.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.290
And now what's--

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:31.230
everybody knows this
final step.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.360
I can't leave the answer
like that because

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.870
it's got a y in it.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:39.890
I have to put in what
y is, and it is--

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.590
can I write the minus x first?

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:47.090
Because it's easier to write it
in front of this e to the

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:51.640
y, which is e to the minus
x squared over 2.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.360
So that's the derivative
we wanted.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.000
Now I want to think about
that function a bit.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.570
OK, notice that we started
with an e to the minus

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:10.520
something, and we ended with
an e to the minus something

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.320
with other factors.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.200
This is typical for
exponentials.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.080
Exponentials, the derivative
stays with that exponent.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.800
We could even take the
derivative of that, and we

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.660
would again have some
expression.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.470
Well, let's do it in a minute,
the derivative of that.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:36.230
OK, I'd like to graph these
functions, the original

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:42.690
function z and the slope
of the z function.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.910
OK, so let's see.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.000
x can have any sign.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.430
x can go for this--

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:54.760
now, I'm graphing this.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.420
OK, so what do I expect?

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:05.220
I can certainly figure out
the point x equals 0.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:12.030
At x equals 0, I have e
to the 0, which is 1.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.170
So at x equals 0, it's 1.

00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:20.830
OK, now at x equals to 1, it
has dropped to something.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.520
And also at x equals minus
1, notice the symmetry.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.800
This function is going to be--
this graph is going to be

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:39.650
symmetric around the y-axis
because I've got x squared.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.010
The right official name
for that is we

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.660
have an even function.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:48.950
It's even when it's same
for x and for minus x.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.830
OK, so what's happening
at x equal 1?

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:54.920
That's e to the minus 1/2.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:55.690
Whew!

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.720
I should have looked
ahead to figure out

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.460
what that number is.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:01.540
Whatever.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:05.620
It's smaller than 1, certainly,
because it's e to

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.210
the minus something.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.890
So let me put it there, and
it'll be here, too.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:16.740
And now rather than a particular
value, what's your

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.240
impression of the whole graph?

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.590
The whole graph is--It's
symmetric, so it's going to

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:28.230
start like this, and it's
going to start sinking.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.200
And then it's going to sink.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.950
Let me try to get through
that point.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.870
Look here.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:43.150
As x gets large, say x is even
just 3 or 4 or 1000, I'm

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.170
squaring it, so I'm getting
9 or 16 or 1000000.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.890
And then divide by 2.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:49.700
No problem.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.600
And then e to the minus is--

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.590
I mean, so e to the thousandth
would be off

00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.780
that board by miles.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:06.560
e to the minus 1000 is a very
small number and getting

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:11.560
smaller fast. So this is going
to get-- but never touches 0,

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.240
so it's going to--

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.550
well, let's see.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:22.490
I want to make it symmetric, and
then I want to somehow I

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:27.870
made it touch because this
darn finite chalk.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.750
I couldn't leave
a little space.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.320
But to your eye it touches.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:41.100
If we had even fine print, you
couldn't see that distance.

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:50.370
So this is that curve, which was
meant to be symmetric, is

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:55.610
the famous bell-shaped curve.

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:07.160
It's the most important curve
for gamblers, for

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.740
mathematicians who work
in probability.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:15.000
That bell-shaped curve will come
up, and you'll see in a

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.150
later lecture a connection
between how calculus enters in

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.110
probability, and it enters
for this function.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:25.790
OK, now what's this slope?

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.170
What's the slope of
that function?

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:32.650
Again, symmetric, or maybe
anti-symmetric, because I have

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:33.960
this factor x.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.290
So what's the slope?

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.660
The slope starts at 0.

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.000
So here's x again.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.270
I'm graphing now the slope,
so this was z.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:48.660
Now I'm going to graph
the slope of this.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:55.200
OK, the slope starts out at 0,
as we see from this picture.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.570
Now we can see, as I go forward
here, the slope is

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:01.540
always negative.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:03.480
The slope is going down.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:09.380
Here it starts out--

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:13.710
yeah, so the slope is 0 there.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.085
The slope is becoming more
and more negative.

00:26:19.545 --> 00:26:20.400
Let's see.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:23.260
The slope is becoming more and
more negative, maybe up to

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.660
some point.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.460
Actually, I believe it's
that point where

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.220
the slope is becoming--

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.990
then it becomes less negative.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.990
It's always negative.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:43.030
I think that the slope goes down
to that point x equals 1,

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:46.570
and that's where the slope
is as steep as it gets.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:51.110
And then the slope comes
up again, but the slope

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.740
never gets to 0.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:57.430
We're always going downhill,
but very slightly.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:02.170
Oh, well, of course, I expect
to be close to that line

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.600
because this e to the minus
x squared over 2

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.930
is getting so small.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:12.470
And then over here, I think
this will be symmetric.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.040
Here the slopes are positive.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.210
Ah!

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:17.980
Look at that!

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.890
Here we had an even function,
symmetric across 0.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.350
Here its slope turns
out to be--

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.550
and this could not
be an accident.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:32.470
Its slope turns out to
be an odd function,

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:34.660
anti-symmetric across 0.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.080
Now, it just was.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.480
This is an odd function, because
if I change x, I

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.740
change the sign of
that function.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:48.140
OK, now if you will give me
another moment, I'll ask you

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.910
about the second derivative.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.180
Maybe this is the first time
we've done the second

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:54.040
derivative.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.760
What do you think the second
derivative is?

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.990
The second derivative is the
derivative of the derivative,

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.440
the slope of the slope.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.210
My classical calculus problem
starts with function one,

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:14.130
produces function two,
height to slope.

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.910
Now when I take another
derivative, I'm starting with

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:23.440
this function one, and over here
will be a function two.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:31.910
So this was dz dx, and now here
is going to be the second

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:32.050
derivative.

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.300
Second derivative.

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:42.940
And we'll give it a nice
notation, nice symbol.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.040
It's not dz dx, all squared.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.880
That's not what I'm doing.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.530
I'm taking the derivative
of this.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.240
So I'm taking--

00:28:54.240 --> 00:29:00.050
well, the derivative
of that, I could--

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:05.090
I'm going to give a whole
return to the second

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:05.530
derivative.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.700
It's a big deal.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:14.250
I'll just say how I write
it: dz dx squared.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:15.780
That's the second derivative.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.760
It's the slope of
this function.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.110
And I guess what I want is would
you know how to take the

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.360
slope of that function?

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.000
Can we just think what
would go into that,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.540
and I'll put it here?

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.430
Let me put that function here.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:37.500
minus x e to the minus
x squared over 2.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.750
Slope of that, derivative
of that.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.990
What do I see there?

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.500
I see a product.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.760
I see that times that.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:50.580
So I'm going to use
the product rule.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.280
But then I also see that in this
factor, in this minus x

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.330
squared over 2, I see a chain.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.530
In fact, it's exactly
my original chain.

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.790
I know how to deal
with that chain.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:05.710
So I'm going to use
the product rule

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.060
and the chain rule.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:14.430
And that's the point that once
we have our list of rules,

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:19.800
these are now what we might
call four simple rules.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:25.270
We know those guys: sum,
difference, product, quotient.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:28.390
And now we're doing the chain
rule, but we have to be

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:33.070
prepared as here for a product,
and then one of these

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:34.400
factors is a chain.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.510
All right, can we do it?

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.185
So the derivative, slope.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:46.890
Well, slope of slope, because
this was the original slope.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:52.580
OK, so it's the first factor
times the derivative of the

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.100
second factor.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.990
And that's the chain,
but that's the one

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.410
we've already done.

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.530
So the derivative of that is
what we already computed, and

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.680
what was it?

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.870
It was that.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.980
So the second factor was minus
x e to the minus x

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.930
squared over 2.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.130
So this is--

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:20.030
can I just like remember
this is f dg dx

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.210
in the product rule.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:23.040
And the product, this is--

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.330
here is a product
of f times g.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:36.500
So f times dg dx, and
now I need g times--

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.850
this was g, and this is
df dx, or it will be.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:44.070
What's df dx?

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.970
Phooey on this old example.

00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:48.220
Gone.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:55.880
OK, df dx, well, f is minus
x. df dx is just minus 1.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.980
Simple.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.230
All right, put the
pieces together.

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:04.370
We have, as I expected we would,
everything has this

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:08.490
factor e to the minus
x squared over 2.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.780
That's controlling everything,
but the question is what's

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:16.330
it-- so here we have a minus
1; is that right?

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.240
And here, we have a
plus x squared.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:25.050
So I think we have x squared
minus 1 times that.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:35.504
OK, so we computed a
second derivative.

00:32:35.504 --> 00:32:36.754
Ha!

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.990
Two things I want to do,
one with this example.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:51.630
The second derivative
will switch sign.

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:56.570
If I graph the darn thing--
suppose I tried to graph that?

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.900
When x is 0, this thing
is negative.

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.530
What is that telling me?

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:03.230
So this is the second group.

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:10.990
This is telling me that
the slope is going

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:13.830
downwards at the start.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.440
I see it.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:22.140
But then at x equal 1, that
second derivative, because of

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:26.700
this x squared minus 1
factor, is up to 0.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.910
It's going to take time with
this second derivative.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.350
That's the slope of the slope.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:36.840
That's this point here.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.430
Here is the slope.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:44.350
Now, at that point,
its slope is 0.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:48.460
And after that point, its
slope is upwards.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.410
We're getting something
like this.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:59.470
The slope of the slope, and
it'll go evenly upwards, and

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:00.636
then so on.

00:34:00.636 --> 00:34:02.100
Ha!

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:07.730
You see that we've got the
derivative code, the slope,

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:11.110
but we've got a little more
thinking to do for the slope

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:16.440
of the slope, the rate of change
of the rate of change.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.870
Then you really have
calculus straight.

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:27.739
And a challenge that I don't
want to try right now would be

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:31.370
what's the chain rule for
the second derivative?

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:32.170
Ha!

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:41.750
I'll leave that as a challenge
for professors who might or

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.469
might not be able to do it.

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:49.040
OK, we've introduced the second
derivative here at the

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.179
end of a lecture.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:58.240
The key central idea of the
lecture was the chain rule to

00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.790
give us that derivative.

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:00.290
Good!

00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:02.610
Thank you.
