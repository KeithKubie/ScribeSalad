00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.790
Every big-budget blockbuster or award-winning
drama begins with a script, but no movie makes

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.610
it to the screen without making some changes
from the printed page. Sometimes, it's what

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.420
happens when actors go OFF the script that�s
most remembered. Here are ScreenRant's 10

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.200
GReatest Unscripted Movie Scenes.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.550
Raiders of the Lost Ark: Bringing a Gun to
a Sword Fight

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.550
When Indiana Jones' leading lady is kidnapped
in search of a Holy relic in Raiders of the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.800
Lost Ark, Indy finds himself seriously outmatched.
Instead of trying to actually fight a skilled

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.250
swordsman, Jones does the smart thing and
pulls out his gun and drops his opponent with

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.170
a single shot. The original script had called
for a lengthy fight sequence, but when Harrison

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.140
Ford was struck with food poisoning the night
before filming, his energy was so sapped on

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.420
set that he asked Steven Spielberg if he could
simply shoot the man instead. The director

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.649
agreed, and one of Indy's most iconic moments
was born.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.710
The Dark Knight: A Round of Applause

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.000
Heath Ledger's Joker is a comic book villain
for the ages, blending anarchy with dark humor

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.610
in nearly every one of his scenes in Christopher
Nolan's The Dark Knight. After finding himself

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.800
in police custody, he witnesses Jim Gordon's
promotion to the rank of Police Commissioner

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.250
firsthand. As the officers in the room applaud
their colleague, the mocking, expressionless

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.070
clapping from the jail cell grabs all their
attention, putting the camera squarely on

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.560
Joker � It�s a chilling moment that Ledger
completely improvised during the scene.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.390
Taxi Driver: You Talkin To Me?

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.380
Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro will always
be remembered for the chilling tale of Travis

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.590
Bickle, the insomniac star of Taxi Driver.
Bickle's unforgettable mirror monologue centered

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.509
on a single question: "You talkin' to me?"
But the script only stated that Travis should

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.570
begin speaking to himself in front of the
mirror, without any specific details on what

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.220
sort of scene to play out. The lines which
followed were improvised by DeNiro entirely

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.790
on the spot. His words, raised eyebrow, and
general attitude came to define the actor

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.120
for decades to come.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.439
Aliens: Game Over, Man

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.030
James Cameron's sequel to 'Alien' helped define
what sci-fi is today. Of the futuristic space

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.590
marines now seen in film, TV, and even video
games, not every one of those soldiers has

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.480
what it takes to bring down the franchise's
Xenomorph enemies. After the first attack

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.340
decimates the marines and their drop ship
crash lands, the script called for Private

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.950
Hudson to panic, but the actor decided to
add a bit of video game lingo to the line,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.980
giving the film one of its most beloved quotes.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.349
The Usual Suspects: The Line-up

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.620
The most iconic scene from Bryan Singer's
'The Usual Suspects' centers on a police line-up

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.910
of the film's main cast of criminals. But
writer Christopher McQuarrie came up with

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.050
just a single line of dialogue for each actor
to repeat, meaning it was up to the actors

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.810
to shape the rest of the scene. When it came
time to film, the actors tried to outdo one

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:59.230
another, turning the scene into a mess of
laughter. Even McQuarrie himself got in on

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.900
the action as the police officer on the intercom,
asking Benicio del Toro to offer the line

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.040
"In English please," and getting an unscripted
response in return.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.959
Jaws: A Bigger Boat

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.440
The underwater menace of Steven Spielberg's
'Jaws' goes unseen for most of the film. The

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.100
shark finally reveals its incredible size
as Police Chief Brody is throwing chum overboard

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.591
to attract it, leaving him (and the audience)
in shock. As Brody comes to his senses, he

00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:34.150
turns to the vessel's captain to inform him
that he�s �gonna need a bigger boat."

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.849
The warning was improvised by actor Roy Scheider
during the scene. With the success of the

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.300
film, it became one of the most famous lines
in movie history.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.319
The Empire Strikes Back: Han's Goodbye

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.220
When the heroes of Star Wars find themselves
ambushed during the final act of The Empire

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.810
Strike Back, Han Solo is captured by Boba
Fett. The bounty hunter plans to freeze Solo

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.290
in carbonite and return to Jabba the Hutt.
With his character's future uncertain, Han

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.030
and Leia were meant to say their goodbyes
in the form of matching "I Love you"s. But

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.939
director Ivan Kershner felt something was
missing, and told Harrison Ford to respond

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:18.989
the way he felt his character should before
shouting 'Action!' What Ford came up with

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.240
captured the smuggler's attitude perfectly,
and offered a line no Star Wars fan will ever

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.610
forget.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.580
The Shining: Here's Johnny!

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.590
Stanley Kubrick's tale of supernatural and
psyhological terror was an instant classic.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.690
And its success was due as much to Jack Nicholson's
crazed descent into madness as it was to the

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.970
novel The Shining is based on. When Jack turns
on his family he chases his wife and son into

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.590
a bathroom and begins chopping through the
door with a fire axe. This is where he offers

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.610
a twisted version of the phrase made famous
on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson: "Heeeeeeere's

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.000
Johnny!" The line became a shorthand for the
entire movie, even though it wasn�t in Kubrick's

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.009
original screenplay.
The Silence of the Lambs: A Nice Chianti

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:06.410
Few cinematic psychopaths have even come close
to Anthony Hopkins� Hannibal Lecter in 'The

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.950
Silence of The Lambs.' Hopkins was chilling
in every one of his scenes, but 'Hannibal

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:15.460
the Cannibal' cemented his legacy with a single
anecdote involving a dinner of "fava beans,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:24.150
and a nice Chianti." Hannibal's specific tastes
were found in the script, but Hopkins' unsettling

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.139
suckling sound effect wasn't. The actor had
started making the sound to creep out his

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.200
co-star Jodie Foster during rehearsals, and
the director decided it was too good to leave

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.200
out.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.889
Dumb &amp; Dumber: The Most Annoying Sound

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.960
Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels came up with tons
of unforgettable exchanges and physical gags

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.789
as the co-leads of 'Dumb &amp; Dumber.' But in
a scene where a hitman discovers how the pair

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:53.550
entertain themselves on long road trips, they
decided completely off script. The back and

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.950
forth wordplay, poking, and Carrey's reveal
of 'the most annoying sound in the world'

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.300
were all thought up on the spot with no warning
given to the actor between them. Check out

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.750
that genuine reaction.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:13.750
