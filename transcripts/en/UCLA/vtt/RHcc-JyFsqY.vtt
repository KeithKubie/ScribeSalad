00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.560
We usually think of cities as the
opposite of nature.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.520
But what if we started looking at them as nature of a different kind?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.320
Plants and animals already use our
buildings and bridges as habitat,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.080
and our parks and gardens attract birds,
reptiles and insects.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.180
Sometimes these are the species that used to live here long before we arrived.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.200
Often, they're species that we've brought from somewhere else.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.920
And some of them are species that are endangered in their original habitats.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.100
Red-crowned parrots were brought to
California from Mexico by the tens of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.540
thousands for the pet trade in the 1960s
and 70s.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.740
They're now endangered in their home range,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.040
but enough of them escaped that
several thousand of them now thrive in

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.330
eastern Los Angeles. It doesn't mean they're a
native species but it does mean that

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.480
they're now a permanent part of our
urban landscapes.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.380
That just happened by luck, but the Red-crowned parrots could also offer an

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.600
inspiring model for opening up our city
to other endangered species.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.140
Those that used to live here, but also species from
other places

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.900
that might find a home in Los Angeles.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.080
Spotted turtles, which are
endangered on the East Coast, might find

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.460
an ecological niche here... and so could
endangered geckos.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.400
In the future,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.000
perhaps our cities could serve as urban arks
that offer sanctuary to humans and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.620
non-humans, natives and non-natives alike.
