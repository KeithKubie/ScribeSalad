(twangy country music)

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:09.743
(boat motor)
- Woah-hoo-hoo.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:12.645 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Day five. Everyone's
in a great mood.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.783
Well, not everyone, but most
of us are in a great mood.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:20.253 line:0%
A couple people are
in a really bad mood.

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.455 line:0%
I guess you could say a
majority of the people

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:26.326
are in a bad mood but a few
of us are in a great mood.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.028 align:start size:81% position:19%
I'm not feelin'
so great myself so

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:31.364 align:start size:97% position:3%
a couple people feel
great, a majority feel bad.

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:35.001 align:start size:88% position:13%
Overall, not a good
day. Things can change.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.837
That's the thing
about a day, man.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:40.507
It'll getcha.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:44.077
(upbeat synthesized music)

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:49.049

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.151
(Instrumental country music)

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.752
- We're in Kentucky and
this show is all about

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:54.788 align:start size:97% position:3%
what's the dumbest way to
make the world a better place.

00:00:54.788 --> 00:00:56.990 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I tweet out, "Does
anybody want to get married

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.258
on a jet ski?"

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:01.461
and within 24 hours a
couple responds, "Yes".

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.863
They fly themselves
out from Seattle.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:07.333
Like, just ready for a real
hot, wet, American marriage.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.201
It's gonna be fuckin' awesome.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.436

a wedding, in fact.

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:18.111 line:0%
The couple flew in from Seattle,

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.080 line:0%
just to have the
comedian marry them

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.848
and good luck to 'em.

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.250
- So you're getting
married on a jet ski.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.252
Did you get engaged
anywhere exciting?

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.487
Like on a hang glider?

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.889
- It was actually,
like, at a bus stop.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.591
- Oh, that's so romantic.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.759
- Um-Hmm. (laughs)

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.027 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So it kind of combines
everyone's loves,

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:36.563
public transit, and a romance.

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:37.764
- Um-Hmm.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:39.566 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And I have one last
question for you.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.634 align:start size:81% position:19%
So I was wondering
if Li'l Minnow

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.303
could be your Maid of Honor?

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.371
- Sure. (laughs)

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.239
- You alright with
that Li'l Minnow?

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.474
- Love it.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.575 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Alright. Great.
- Can't wait.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:49.843
- [Comedian] Hey Johnny.

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.578
Have you ever been
on a jet ski before?

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:52.846
- (Johnny) First and last.

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.614 align:start size:94% position:6%
- (laughs) First and last.
- Yeah.

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.049
- You don't plan on going
back on a jet ski ever?

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:56.883
- Nah.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.418
(laughing)

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:00.220 align:start size:97% position:3%
- A lot of your friends and
family couldn't be here today.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.721
- Um-Hmm.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:02.922
- And I was wondering if
you would take Li'l Minnow

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.424
as your Best Man?

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:06.259 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I would definitely take
Li'l Minnow for my best man.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.128
(romantic music)

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:09.262
(boat motor)

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:11.798
- Little Minnow, make it rain.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.300
(music fades)

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.674
- You may now be seated.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:24.077
(light wedding music)

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:28.548
Johnny, do you promise
to love and cherish Ola?

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:29.816
- I do.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.252
- Ola, do you promise to
love and cherish Johnny

00:02:32.252 --> 00:02:34.287
for the rest of your days?

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:35.555
- I do.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.158
- I now pronounce
you man and wife.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:39.392
(trumpets)

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.994
You may kiss each other now.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:42.228
(audience clapping)

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.730
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I present to you

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.499
for the very first time,
a married Johnny and Ola.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.434
(audience clapping)

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:50.403
(cheering)

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:52.972
(wedding song)

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.011
(jet ski engine)

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.252
(music finale and fades)

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.154
- [Male] Get in there.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.924
(dramatic music)

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.362
- [Male] Get in there.

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:21.601
(splash)

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:23.336
(music ends)

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:26.105 align:start size:94% position:6%
- They take off, and then
immediately capsized.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.373
(laughing)

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.243
Immediately, just
slowly flip over.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.878
He lost his wedding ring.

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.147
It just came off and went
to the bottom of the lake.

00:03:34.147 --> 00:03:36.716
It was very surprising.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.650
(audience laughing)

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.285
You know the thing about this,

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:40.753
the happiest time of their life,

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.222
immediately ruined.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.991 align:start size:97% position:3%
- One good thing about
capsizing on your wedding day,

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.760 align:start size:97% position:3%
cuz now you've both held each
other while almost dying,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.096 align:start size:84% position:16%
that's a bond stronger
than anything.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:50.930
Roustabout.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.865
(jet ski engine)

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.101
(upbeat country western music)

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:59.272
Now gotta get back on that
great old Mississippi River.

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.573
M-I-s-s-I-p-p-I.

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.576
Roustabout.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.578
(waves)

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:21.261
- So now, we have to make 150
miles on the Mississippi River

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.696
which is, 150 miles
in a car is nothing.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:27.834 align:start size:94% position:6%
On a jet ski, it's like
doing squats for six hours

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
while a weirdo tries
to rip your arms

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:30.937
out of their sockets.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:33.106
And that weirdo is you.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.474
(laughter)

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.342
So the majority of this
is just multiple hours

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:39.078
of me just jet skiing by myself

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:41.180
with no one to talk to.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.815
Except I have a mic on,
so I can talk to no one

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:44.984
but have it be recorded.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:46.419
(laughing)

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I'm just talking to
myself for about eight hours

00:04:49.022 --> 00:04:51.291
of grueling exercise.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.792
(upbeat music)

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:56.129 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Interesting fact, Eddie
Vedder owns most of the eddies

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.998
in the Mississippi River.

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:01.934
Along the river's edge
where trees are growing,

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:05.271
is actually crumbled
up graham crackers.

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:06.439
Teddy Grahams.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.980
I'm gonna catch this duck.
I'm gonna catch this duck.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.283
Fuck. Who knew that a duck
could fly 60 miles per hour

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.719
but did you also know that
a duck has a corkscrew-like

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.388 align:start size:97% position:3%
penis so once it's
inserted into a female duck

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:24.090
she can't get away.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.392
And then he holds her under
the water for up to five

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:27.794
minutes while he
has sex with her.

00:05:27.794 --> 00:05:29.362
You think ducks are nice.

00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.464
They're fuckin' assholes.

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:37.470
All of this is broccoli farms.

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:41.107 align:start size:81% position:19%
The catfish in
this lake are said

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:43.343
to have a rejuvenating property.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:46.145 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's a lot of the
locals crush 'em up wet

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.147 align:start size:84% position:16%
and rub them all
over their genitals.

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:52.318
That's why this town got
the name "Old Stinky Dick."

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.722 line:0%
Not a lot of people
know that Mark Twain

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:58.624 line:0%
was a real piece of shit.

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.660
(splash)

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.061 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
One of the advantages
of being on the river is

00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:06.432 align:start size:88% position:13%
you can just take a
shit wherever you want.

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:09.235
Can everybody turn around?

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:11.804
(upbeat music)

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.030
It's gettin' windy.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.232
(thunder)

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.834
You can see from
these storm clouds,

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:43.703
that we're probably
gonna get a dousin'.

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:46.272
(threatening music)

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:48.141 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then finally we're
only 30 miles away

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.209
from our destination
and a storm starts

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.644
comin' up the river

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:54.046
and now things come to
a head at this point.

00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.048 align:start size:88% position:13%
There's been a constant
battle between me

00:06:56.048 --> 00:06:57.717
and the marine crew.

00:06:57.717 --> 00:06:59.485 align:start size:84% position:16%
And the marine crew
are like safety first,

00:06:59.485 --> 00:07:00.953
as they should be.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:02.388 align:start size:97% position:3%
They're like, "Just get
the boats out of the river.

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:03.689
You can fake it,

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:05.324
you can just pretend
like ya did all this."

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:07.427
And I'm like, "No, I'm the
weirdo who wanted to do this

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.228
in the first place."

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:10.763
(laughing)

00:07:10.763 --> 00:07:12.765
So I kinda forced the marine
team to head into the storm

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:15.902
which was probably
not a great idea.

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:17.003
(laughing)

00:07:17.003 --> 00:07:20.807
(upbeat suspenseful drums)

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:23.810
Don't let the rain
cramp your style.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:33.386
The rain hurts your
face a lot. Wooh!

00:07:33.386 --> 00:07:34.854
Some people run away

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:39.258 align:start size:97% position:3%
when rains pelting them in
the face at 35 miles per hour.

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:41.494
I like to think of
it as really painful

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:42.662
taps from God.

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:46.399
Bring it hard, God! Bring it on!

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:51.404
(suspenseful music)

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.011
Is this normal rain?

00:07:59.011 --> 00:07:59.946
(jet ski motor)

00:07:59.946 --> 00:08:02.281
Why is the rain still hurting?

00:08:03.716 --> 00:08:06.252 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Voiceover] And after
needle-like rain for hours

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:08.521 align:start size:84% position:16%
and temperatures
that drop 20 degrees,

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:11.023
we finally make it
to our destination.

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.959
(thunder)

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:15.595 align:start size:84% position:16%
And everybody's
fuckin' furious at me.

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:16.796
(Laughing)

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:18.464 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, everybody's pissed
off. Nobody's happy.

00:08:18.464 --> 00:08:20.066
But you know, we
fuckin' made it.

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.234
We made it. And you know what?

00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:23.169 align:start size:84% position:16%
Fuck that marine
team, they're pussies.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:25.104
(audience laughing)
(audience claps)

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.806 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm just kidding,
they're all ex-military

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:28.107
so they will kill me.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.342
(laughing)

- [Male] Hold it right
there for a second.

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:31.911
Hold the trailer there.

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:33.045
- [Male] Hey.

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:33.980
- [Male] Good.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.282
- And once again on dry land.

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.050
I am very cold.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.519
- [Male] Cold?

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:40.353
- Yeah.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.988
(camera falls)

00:08:41.988 --> 00:08:43.322
Oh. You alright?

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:45.491
Good save.

00:08:46.392 --> 00:08:49.962
(upbeat synthesized music)

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.872
(synthesizer)

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:06.612
- I made it 150 miles.

00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:08.214
Now it's time to make
the world a little bit

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.682
of a better place.
