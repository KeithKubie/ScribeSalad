00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:08.549
Docu Series: Why Acting Is Be An Insanely
Dangerous Job

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:09.549
Intro

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.360
It’s easy to look at the red carpets, the
awards, the celebrity friendships and million-dollar

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.449
paychecks and assume that being an actor is
one of the cushiest jobs around – as long

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.510
as you can make it big.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.550
With stunt doubles and special effects teams
on hand to keep everything safe, and the director

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.659
and audience asking you to just pretend for
a few weeks, what job could be easier, right?

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.699
Well, that’s not the whole story.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.840
Sometimes, the actors who truly make a name
for themselves have to risk more than most

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.840
people to get there.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.220
If you value your health, your safety, or
your sanity, then no amount of money is going

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.920
to make it worth the risk.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.100
We’re focusing in on the less glamorous
side of the film industry in our latest Docu

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:54.520
Series: Why Acting Is An Insanely Dangerous
Job.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.520
Risking Your Neck

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.940
Sure, actors may just have to pretend to be
daring adventurers, soldiers, or fictional

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.449
heroes, but they’re specifically being asked
to pretend they’re doing the most daring,

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.010
risky things those characters have ever done
in their lives.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.470
And even though there are stunt doubles ready
to handle the major jobs, even small scenes

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.430
can put stars in harm’s way.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.430
The world of Star Wars may be fueled by CG,
but when sets are constructed from scratch,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.720
accidents happen – like when a hydraulic
door closed on Harrison Ford while filming

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.010
The Force Awakens.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.220
As if it wasn’t bad enough, director J.J.
Abrams learned his lesson coming to Ford’s

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.460
rescue - injuring his back trying to raise
the door.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.340
The stories of Hollywood injuries on set are
delivered every day, from Brad Pitt actually

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.310
tearing his Achilles heel while playing Achilles,
or Michael J. Fox really selling being hanged

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.820
in Back to the Future 3… by actually being
choked.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.360
But sometimes, the injuries can be a bit more
serious.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.380
Charlize Theron has made a name for herself
as a star who can throw some punches, but

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.460
when a backflip while filming Aeon (“Eon”)
Flux almost paralyzed her, she promised then

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.670
and there that she would never do anything
dangerous enough for a stunt double to be

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.750
called in – a decision that worked in her
favor for Mad Max: Fury Road.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.250
Risking Your Life

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.480
Sprained ankles and cracked ribs are one thing,
but it seems like acting is a deadlier profession

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.100
than most realize – or, at least, it can
be.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.981
It’s hard to believe that even action star
Jason Statham could have kept his cool when

00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:27.140
filming Expendables 3, driving a truck with
fault brakes off a pier, crashing into the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.780
water and sinking instantly.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.950
He could have drowned, but at least it would
have been quick, which is more than you can

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.730
say for some other A-list actors who have
come close to death.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.120
Statham’s Expendables co-star Sylvester
Stallone learned that fiction and fact can

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.160
blur together when filming fight scenes with
Dolph Lundgren for Rocky 4.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.040
Asking the actor not to hold back, Lundgren
delivered a shot straight to Stallone’s

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.290
chest.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.690
He knew something was wrong immediately, and
rushed to the hospital to learn his heart

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.840
had started to swell from the blow.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.400
It could have proven fatal, but weeks of bed
rest kept the slugger in the fight.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.620
So much for movie magic.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.270
Still, it’s probably George Clooney who
puts the idea that acting is easy to bed.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.040
While other leading men risk their lives in
stunts, like Tom Cruise dangling from the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.570
real Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Mission Impossible,
Clooney had his brush with death after filming

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.860
the 2005 drama Syriana.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.020
After seriously injuring his back during an
interrogation scene, weeks of headaches followed

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.150
– including a serious panic when spinal
fluid began leaking from his nose.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.020
Clooney has admitted that in the weeks spent
in a hospital bed unable to move, and crippled

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.150
by headaches, he seriously considered taking
his own life.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.130
So playing pretend isn’t always fun and
games.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.130
Risking Your Health

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.050
The stories of actors dropping weight, or
gaining muscle for a role are well-known by

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.349
all movie fans, but it’s still hard to believe
the limits that some actors pushed their bodies

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.570
to in preparation for a role.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.550
Robert De Niro set a high bar with Raging
Bull, training to become a completely real

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.430
boxer to play Jake LaMotta – before gaining
60 POUNDS to play him in his later years.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.870
That’s a number beaten by one famous method
actor, Jared Leto, who gained a whopping 67

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.060
pounds to play John Lennon’s killer in Chapter
27.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.500
He put on the pounds by sticking to a diet
of microwaved ice cream mixed with olive oil,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.549
among other foods, and developed gout in the
process, saying he’ll never again put his

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.709
body through the trauma.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.309
It’s not all about weight loss, of course,
but the extra measures taken to deliver the

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:28.340
best performance – sacrificing your health
to do it (and hoping that the audience will

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.900
even notice the difference).

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.900
Ashton Kutcher learned that copying Apple
founder Steve Jobs’ all-fruit diet was a

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.039
bad way to get into character, when he wound
up hospitalized just days before filming was

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.319
set to begin.

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.120
On the superhero side of things, Hugh Jackman
has turned heads and stunned audiences with

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.800
his ripped physique as the X-Man Wolverine,
but even that’s not all workouts and dieting.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.749
To get the shredded, veiny look he wanted,
Jackman had to go days without water to thin

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:00.080
out his skin, suffering through crippling
headaches as a result.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.539
Was it really worth it?

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.090
On the far end of the spectrum of actors putting
their health at risk for method acting is,

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.589
as always, Oscar winner Daniel Day-Lewis.

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:12.349
Staying in character may be better for the
movie, but when Lewis refused a winter coat

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.910
in Gangs of New York, he was struck with pneumonia.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.120
When playing a man suffering from Cerebral
Palsy in My Left Foot, he stayed hunched over

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.080
throughout the entire production, even having
crew members feed him so as not to break character.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.979
What he did break, was two ribs, from the
unnatural posture.

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.749
It won him an Oscar, though, so it might have
been worth it.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.229
Risking Your Sanity

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.909
Putting your body on the line for a role is
one thing, or even refusing to break out of

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.340
a character since getting into the mindspace
of the role is seriously taxing.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.640
But what happens when an actor or actress
starts to literally lose themselves in the

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.099
role they’re playing?

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.129
Ask Anne Hathaway, who went even farther than
the director asked for her descent into poverty

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.789
in Les Miserables, cutting off her hair, losing
weight, and delivering an Oscar-winning performance

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:58.809
in the process.

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:02.289
But she admitted that the character was such
a broken, desperate soul, it took her weeks

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.099
after filming to break herself out the same
mental troubles, and start to feel like a

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.379
normal person.

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:08.379
Yikes.

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.219
Taking things even farther, Adrien Brody knew
that his role in The Pianist could be a break

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.119
out one – and committed to walking in the
footsteps of a Holocaust survivor the best

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:17.119
way he could.

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:21.129
Leaving behind, his belongings, his home,
and even his girlfriend, and headed to Europe

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:22.550
with a bag and a keyboard.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.479
It’s hard to say if it was his acting chops,
or this method research that won him his Oscar,

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.339
but for his sake, we hope it was all totally
necessary.

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:33.949
Shia LaBeouf became more famous than most
young actors for his weird commitment to a

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.520
role, and the World War 2-era Fury showcased
the fact that he really is one of a kind.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.339
When the makeup team’s work at applying
a cut to his cheek didn’t seem real enough,

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:49.249
his co-stars say, he simply grabbed a knife,
and cut his cheek open – making sure to

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:53.159
re-open the cut throughout the shoot, and
giving himself a scar for life.

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:58.570
To go with the tooth he had pulled as evidence
of his time in the war (which is never mentioned,

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.009
and hardly ever seen on screen).

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.210
At that point, the fact that he decided not
to bathe for over a month was probably the

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.180
least of his co-stars’ concerns.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.310
And as proof that the most psychotic, unbalanced
villains can’t help but bring something

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.099
weird to the lives of those playing them,
both Jared Leto and the late Heath Ledger

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:18.669
seemed to truly lose themselves in the role
of The Joker, Batman’s nemesis.

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.699
For Ledger, it meant secluding himself in
a London hotel room for over a month, exploring

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:27.620
the insanity of the character, finding his
voice and laughter.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.749
The reports of his drug use and mental conditions
are almost impossible to decipher by now,

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:36.979
but the fact that such a dark, twisted role
was his last will always be the fact of the

00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:37.979
matter.

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.599
Maybe it’s lucky, then, that Leto has some
co-workers to let his crazy loose on, in the

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:47.110
form of bullets, live rats, dead pigs, and
apparently even used condoms to his Suicide

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.169
Squad castmates.

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.520
You can’t say that he isn’t embracing
the role of the Joker wholeheartedly, but

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.090
even if he walks away unscathed, it looks
like this is one time where it’s actually

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.159
more dangerous to be working with him, not
as him.

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:04.749
Seriously, what are the odds of someone delivering
a dead pig full of bullets to your office?

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:06.129
We rest our case.

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:07.849
So what do you think?

00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:12.119
Are these twisted character studies and death-defying
stunts and injuries proof that being an actor

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:13.710
isn’t all it’s cracked up to be?

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.059
Or would you be willing to have a brush with
death or two if it meant appearing on the

00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:18.059
big screen?

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:21.929
We expect most movie fans would say it’s
worth it, but… some of these actors might

00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:22.929
disagree.
