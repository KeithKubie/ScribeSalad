the only way you're going to find your
 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.000
the only way you're going to find your
way to an original voice that isn't full

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.009
way to an original voice that isn't full
of cliches and it isn't just trying to

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019
of cliches and it isn't just trying to
 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.280
of cliches and it isn't just trying to
do what other people do but by following

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290
do what other people do but by following
 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.860
do what other people do but by following
your own instincts using your own

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870
your own instincts using your own
 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.220
your own instincts using your own
autobiography as a kind of a guide to

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230
autobiography as a kind of a guide to
 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.800
autobiography as a kind of a guide to
what things might be interesting for you

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810
what things might be interesting for you
 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.360
what things might be interesting for you
to photograph things in your life that

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370
to photograph things in your life that
 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.009
to photograph things in your life that
you've seen that you might want to then

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019
you've seen that you might want to then
 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.190
you've seen that you might want to then
go back and visually try and put a story

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200
go back and visually try and put a story
 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.550
go back and visually try and put a story
around it is it I think it's a good

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560
around it is it I think it's a good
 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.619
around it is it I think it's a good
place to start but not to think in the

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629
place to start but not to think in the
 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.270
place to start but not to think in the
world as a singular oh I got a great

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280
world as a singular oh I got a great
 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.150
world as a singular oh I got a great
shot but it's like how do I make a group

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160
shot but it's like how do I make a group
 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.640
shot but it's like how do I make a group
of images that together are more

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650
of images that together are more
 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.460
of images that together are more
meaningful than any one of them

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470
meaningful than any one of them
 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.420
meaningful than any one of them
separated and even when they're

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430
separated and even when they're
 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.100
separated and even when they're
separated they're still strong images

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110
separated they're still strong images
 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.589
separated they're still strong images
each and they're in their own right but

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599
each and they're in their own right but
 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.720
each and they're in their own right but
as a group that you can become stronger

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
as a group that you can become stronger
 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.890
as a group that you can become stronger
so I think thinking in terms of larger

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900
so I think thinking in terms of larger
 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.720
so I think thinking in terms of larger
groupings of images then and then your

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730
groupings of images then and then your
 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.630
groupings of images then and then your
intentions are not no longer a question

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640
intentions are not no longer a question
 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.580
intentions are not no longer a question
you're you're now working and thinking

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590
you're you're now working and thinking
 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.740
you're you're now working and thinking
so it's it's kind of like being a writer

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750
so it's it's kind of like being a writer
 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.809
so it's it's kind of like being a writer
you can you know come away with a good

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819
you can you know come away with a good
 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.520
you can you know come away with a good
paragraph or a couple of good lines but

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530
paragraph or a couple of good lines but
 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.890
paragraph or a couple of good lines but
you want to create the story you want to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900
you want to create the story you want to
 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.069
you want to create the story you want to
have a little bit more meat to the to

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079
have a little bit more meat to the to
 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.140
have a little bit more meat to the to
the narrative and that only happens when

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150
the narrative and that only happens when
 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.920
the narrative and that only happens when
you keep plugging away at an idea
