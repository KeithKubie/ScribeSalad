in a sunny spot like that so we're gonna

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680
in a sunny spot like that so we're gonna
 

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.710
in a sunny spot like that so we're gonna
just try and check more the shady areas

trees will be probably a good place to

00:43:58.099 --> 00:43:58.109
trees will be probably a good place to
 

00:43:58.109 --> 00:44:01.059

what the base plan is now is maybe just

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:46.890
what the base plan is now is maybe just
 

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:48.740
what the base plan is now is maybe just
to go back onto the roads and just check

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:48.750
to go back onto the roads and just check
 

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.150

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.280
she hasn't come out of here she hasn't
come out of here well then the next base

00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:52.290
come out of here well then the next base
 

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:54.079
