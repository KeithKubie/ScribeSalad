00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.030
John is making pasta dough.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.500
To make the dough, he
mixed 3/2 cups wheat flour

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.550
with 3/4 cups regular
flour in some water.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.960
Write an inequality to
express the relationship

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.040
between the wheat flour
and the regular flour.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.570
He mixed 3/2 cups
of wheat flour.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.962
3/2 is the exact same
thing as 1 and 1/2,

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:25.670
if we were to write
it as a mixed number.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.030
So it's more than 1
cup of wheat flour.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.790
And he mixes his that with
3/4 cups of regular flour.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.880
Well, 3/4 is less than 1, so 3/2
is definitely greater than 3/4.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.080
And we can just pick greater
than right over there.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.600
3/2 is greater than 3/4.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.390
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.010
One of the deepest points
in the Indian Ocean,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.870
the Diamantina trench, is
at negative 8 kilometers.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.720
We say it is
negative 8 kilometers

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.370
because it is 8 kilometers
below sea level.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.850
The deepest part of the Bering
Strait is at negative 5 and 4/9

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.370
kilometers.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.290
Write an inequality to show the
relationship between these two

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.550
points, and determine
which point is deeper.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.050
Let's see.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.030
We have a greater
than sign here.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.050
So we want to write
whichever quantity

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.090
is greater on the
left-hand side.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.240
We look right over here.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.359
This number, negative 5 and
4/9, it is less negative.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:32.150
So it's actually going
to be greater value.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.640
It's not as deep.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.300
We can write negative
5 and 4/9 kilometers

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.420
is greater than
negative 8 kilometers.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.680
And so if we're thinking
about which point is deeper,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.138
it's going to be the one that's
more negative, because that

00:01:49.138 --> 00:01:52.090
tells us how far below
sea level we are.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.990
So the negative
8 kilometer point

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.570
is further below sea level.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.110
Let's see.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.280
Negative 8 kilometers.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.120
The Diamantina trench
at negative 8 kilometers

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.460
is the deeper point.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.840
This is fun, because in
some of these questions

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.923
you actually learn things.

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:13.100
I always thought that the
deepest part of the Bering

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.030
Sea-- well, anyway.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.430
We can talk about
that another time.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.185
Negative 8 kilometers, so the
Diamantina trench is deeper.

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:25.820
Let's do one more.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.580
John is making noodles.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.130
To make the batter, he mixes
11/16 cups tapioca flour

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.170
with 3/8 rice flour
and some water.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.960
Write an inequality to
express the relationship

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.790
between the tapioca
flour and rice flour.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.180
So we're really comparing
11/16 cups of tapioca

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.990
to 3/8 cups rice flour.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.370
So we're really comparing
these two fractions.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.180
And at first it might
seem hard to compare.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.980
You have different denominators.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.310
But 3/8 could easily be
converted to a fraction with 16

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.170
as the denominator.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.300
What would you do?

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.474
Well, if you doubled
both the 3 and the 8--

00:03:00.474 --> 00:03:02.390
you have to do the same
thing to the numerator

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.460
and the denominator--
this fraction

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.975
3/8 is equivalent to 6/16.

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:09.850
And then you would have
the same denominator.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.737
You could compare 11/16 to 6/16.

00:03:12.737 --> 00:03:14.320
Well, if you have
the same denominator

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.926
and this numerator is
greater, 11 is greater than 6,

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:22.720
11/16 is going to be
greater than 6/16,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.460
which is the same thing as 3/8.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.450
And we got it right.
