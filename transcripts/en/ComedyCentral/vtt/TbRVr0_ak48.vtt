00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:03.270
  (people murmuring)

00:00:04.938 --> 00:00:06.974
 - It's so confusing
 that hipsters

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:09.610
 have started co-opting
 southern culture.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.912
 I feel like we're in a
 Cracker Barrel cosplay party.

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:13.447
  - Drew, don't say
  co-opt too loud.

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:16.083
 They're gonna think we wanna
 start a beet farm coalition.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.018
  I really need some
  fried okra, man,

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.887
 so can we please
 just make this work?

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:21.088
  - Corey, everyone
  in here's dressed

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.357
 like a barista at Talladega.

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:24.424
  - Are you ready to order?

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.893
 - Yes, ma'am, I'll--

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:27.828
 - We don't use gendered
 pronouns in this restaurant.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:29.863
- Okay, well I heard that y'all

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:32.566
 have the best fried chicken,

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:34.768
so I'll take a two piece, dark,

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.403
 with some mashed
 potatoes and gravy.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.972
 - Okay, we don't have gravy
 and we only serve white meat.

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.208
 - That's why it's all
 white people in here.

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.709
 - Excuse me?
 - 'Cause of the blandness--

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.611
 - White is fine, and I'll just

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.880
 take the cheese grits instead.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.783
 - Okay, would you
 like regular or vegan?

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:50.617
  - Regular?

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:51.451
 What?

00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:52.419
 Vegan grits?

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:53.553
  That's just dry ass corn.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.821
  Who would wanna eat that?

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.223
  - People dressed
  like an Americana

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:57.858
 album about soybean subsidies.

00:00:57.858 --> 00:00:59.393
  - (chuckles) Yeah.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.028
  Track one, white meat got
  me dryer than white men.

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:01.862
 Am I right?

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:02.696
 - Hilarious.

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:03.563
Is that one SoundCloud?

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.132
 - This is ridiculous.

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:07.434
  You guys have vegan
  options all over the menu.

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.002
There's a deer head on the wall.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:10.203
 - His name is William.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:11.271
 We're honoring him.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.639
  - I like your trucker hat.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:13.740
  What do you haul?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.375
 - Apparently
 cognitive dissonance.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.910
  - This is just an outfit.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.245
 - (laughs) Look, Drew!

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.780
 Your dad's an outfit.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.848
 - And you can wear it to your
 next hillbilly hoedown party!

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:24.384
I hope y'all are diggin'
the reclaimed barn wood,

00:01:24.384 --> 00:01:25.719
 'cause there's poop in barns!

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.054
 We're eating in a poop lodge.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:27.888
  - That's not true.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.356
There's no poo in here.

00:01:29.356 --> 00:01:30.557
  - That lady has a mullet.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.259
 - Whoa, whoa, hey, hold on!

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.560
  What the hell's
  going on out here?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.162
 I'm up in my ass in
 grease that's hotter

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.230
 than a randy bobcat's
 butt hole back there.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.165
What's the deal?

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:39.399
 - These customers are upset.

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.335
 They think that light
 meat chicken is dry.

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:42.602
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:43.737
  - I'll take care of this.

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:45.372
  We got a chicken problem?

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:48.642
- And, uh, the Earnhardt
poster's crooked.

00:01:48.642 --> 00:01:49.943
- Well, by god!

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.678
 Livin', breathin' Yelp
 review comin' in here,

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:53.880
 pitchin' a fit before he's
 even had a bite to eat yet.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.416
  I swear to Conway Twitty
  you make me want (sighs).

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.019
  When you're hotter than
  grease, say yes to peace.

00:01:59.019 --> 00:01:59.987
When you're hotter than grease--

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:00.854
 - Buddy, where are you from?

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.522
  - Boone, North Cackalacky.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:03.690
- Boone, North Carolina?

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.325
 You mean your parents
 had a vacation

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.160
  house outside of
  Asheville, right?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.895
  - No, I mean like
  my uncle's still

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:11.064
on the run from breeding
illegal reptiles.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:14.067
- You're from Boone, North
Carolina and you made this menu?

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.102
 - Yes.

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:17.304
- What year did Doc Watson die?

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:18.572
- What?

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:19.606
  - What percentage
  Cherokee are you?

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.141
 - 1/16th on my mama's side.

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.275
  1/8th on my daddy's side.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:24.411
- Vinegar or
ketchup-based barbecue?

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:25.645
- Both.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:26.446
 - When greeting a
 fellow southerner--

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.681
- Scoot, scoot, goddamn!

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:29.116
  - How much sugar
  goes in sweet tea?

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:30.217
- Til it's sweet enough.

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:32.152
 - Dolly Parton or--
 - Dolly!

00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:34.421
You know, unless the
preacher's comin' over.

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:37.157
 Then we gotta pretend like
 it's Jesus for a minute, but.

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:38.091
 - All right.

00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.826
When you were punished as a kid,

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.828
where would you parents hit you?

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.363
- Home, school, church.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:45.065
 Anywhere with sticks, really.

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:47.000
 - That's a phenomenal answer.
 - Mm-hmm.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.468
  Just a few more questions.

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:50.570
 - Willie gets all the credit
 because he started it,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.139
 but Waylon's the best outlaw.

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.441
  Skynyrd's plane went down
  in Gillsburg, Mississippi.

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:56.476
  You can fry anything if
  the grease is hot enough.

00:02:56.476 --> 00:03:00.147
 And Doc Watson died
 on May 29th, 2012.

00:03:00.147 --> 00:03:01.415
  Smart ass.

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:04.484
 - Dude, why are you
 making vegan grits?

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.485
 - 'Cause they sell.

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.287
And they ain't that bad!

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:11.558
And doctor told me I
got the prediabetes, so.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.460
 - [Both] Oh!

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.394
 - Hell, man.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.195
 Why didn't you say something?

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.430
- I'll have the catfish.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.164
  Tell your mama and
  them I said hey.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:18.665
 - Okay then.

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:19.866
 That's a sweet mullet.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.134
  Somebody fix Dale.

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:22.502
 - I like this place.
