00:00:07.294 --> 00:00:09.983
Consider the classic white t-shirt.

00:00:09.983 --> 00:00:14.194
Annually, we sell and buy
two billion t-shirts globally,

00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:17.483
making it one of the most common
garments in the world.

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:20.874
But how and where is the average
t-shirt made,

00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:24.516
and what's its environmental impact?

00:00:24.516 --> 00:00:26.405
Clothing items can vary a lot,

00:00:26.405 --> 00:00:31.605
but a typical t-shirt begins its life
on a farm in America, China, or India

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:38.901
where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and
grown for the fluffy bolls they produce.

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.740
Self-driving machines carefully harvest
these puffs,

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.425
an industrial cotton gin mechanically
separates the fluffy bolls from the seeds,

00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:52.145
and the cotton lint is pressed 
into 225-kilogram bales.

00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:56.857
The cotton plants require a huge quantity
of water and pesticides.

00:00:56.857 --> 00:01:01.596
2,700 liters of water are needed to produce
the average t-shirt,

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:05.166
enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs.

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:08.487
Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides
and pesticides

00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:11.407
than any other crop in the world.

00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:13.646
These pollutants can be carcinogenic,

00:01:13.646 --> 00:01:15.890
harm the health of field workers,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.487
and damage surrounding ecosystems.

00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:24.356
Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton
grown without pesticides and insecticides,

00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:27.577
but organic cotton makes up less than 1%

00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:33.947
of the 22.7 million metric tons 
of cotton produced worldwide.

00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:36.029
Once the cotton bales leave the farm,

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.078
textile mills ship them
to a spinning facility,

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:41.689
usually in China or India,

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.417
where high-tech machines blend,

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:45.739
card,

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:47.088
comb,

00:01:47.088 --> 00:01:48.459
pull,

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:49.979
stretch,

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.838
and, finally, twist the cotton into
snowy ropes of yarn called slivers.

00:01:55.838 --> 00:01:57.630
Then, yarns are sent to the mill,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.799
where huge circular knitting machines

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.979
weave them into sheets 
of rough grayish fabric

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.259
treated with heat and chemicals
until they turn soft and white.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.569
Here, the fabric is dipped into
commercial bleaches and azo dyes,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.060
which make up the vivid coloring
in about 70% of textiles.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.730
Unfortunately, some of these contain
cancer-causing cadmium,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.479
lead,

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:22.300
chromium,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.211
and mercury.

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:28.211
Other harmful compounds and chemicals
can cause widespread contamination

00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:33.520
when released as toxic waste water
in rivers and oceans.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.062
Technologies are now so advanced
in some countries

00:02:36.062 --> 00:02:38.711
that the entire process of growing
and producing fabric

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:41.263
barely touches a human hand.

00:02:41.263 --> 00:02:43.974
But only up until this point.

00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:46.422
After the finished cloth 
travels to factories,

00:02:46.422 --> 00:02:50.412
often in Bangladesh, China, India,
or Turkey,

00:02:50.412 --> 00:02:55.071
human labor is still required 
to stitch them up into t-shirts,

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:58.192
intricate work that 
machines just can't do.

00:02:58.192 --> 00:03:00.841
This process has its own problems.

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:02.402
Bangladesh, for example,

00:03:02.402 --> 00:03:06.441
which has surpassed China as the world's
biggest exporter of cotton t-shirts,

00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:11.312
employs 4.5 million people
in the t-shirt industry,

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:16.152
but they typically face poor conditions
and low wages.

00:03:16.152 --> 00:03:20.672
After manufacture, all those t-shirts
travel by ship, train, and truck

00:03:20.672 --> 00:03:23.192
to be sold in high-income countries,

00:03:23.192 --> 00:03:27.303
a process that gives cotton 
an enormous carbon footprint.

00:03:27.303 --> 00:03:30.163
Some countries produce 
their own clothing domestically,

00:03:30.163 --> 00:03:32.563
which cuts out this polluting stage,

00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:38.253
but generally, apparel production accounts
for 10% of global carbon emissions.

00:03:38.253 --> 00:03:40.214
And it's escalating.

00:03:40.214 --> 00:03:43.184
Cheaper garments and the public's
willingness to buy

00:03:43.184 --> 00:03:50.474
boosted global production 
from 1994 to 2014 by 400%

00:03:50.474 --> 00:03:55.103
to around 80 billion garments each year.

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:57.154
Finally, in a consumer's home,

00:03:57.154 --> 00:04:02.664
the t-shirt goes through one of the most
resource-intensive phases of its lifetime.

00:04:02.664 --> 00:04:04.195
In America, for instance,

00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:08.675
the average household does nearly
400 loads of laundry per year

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:12.224
each using about 40 gallons of water.

00:04:12.224 --> 00:04:14.835
Washing machines and dryers 
both use energy,

00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:20.146
with dryers requiring five to six times
more than washers.

00:04:20.146 --> 00:04:23.735
This dramatic shift in clothing 
consumption over the last 20 years,

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:27.718
driven by large corporations
and the trend of fast fashion

00:04:27.718 --> 00:04:29.725
has cost the environment,

00:04:29.725 --> 00:04:31.096
the health of farmers,

00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:35.036
and driven questionable 
human labor practices.

00:04:35.036 --> 00:04:40.476
It's also turned fashion into the second
largest polluter in the world after oil.

00:04:40.476 --> 00:04:42.830
But there are things we can do.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.006
Consider shopping secondhand.

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:49.235
Try to look for textiles made from
recycled or organic fabrics.

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:53.676
Wash clothes less and line dry
to save resources.

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:55.931
Instead of throwing them away
at the end of their life,

00:04:55.931 --> 00:05:00.067
donate, recycle, or reuse them
as cleaning rags.

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:02.178
And, finally, you might ask yourself,

00:05:02.178 --> 00:05:06.257
how many t-shirts and articles of clothing
will you consume over your lifetime,

00:05:06.257 --> 00:05:09.958
and what will be their combined 
impact on the world?
