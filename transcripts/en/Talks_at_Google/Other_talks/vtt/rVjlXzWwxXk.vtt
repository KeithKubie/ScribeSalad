00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
CHRIS: Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.740
Just a quick introduction
to our veteran guru

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.940
overall finance guy, Wes Gray.

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:12.290
WESLEY GRAY:
Thanks, Chris, and I

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.120
appreciate you inviting
me here to Google.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.620
I actually have a huge
respect for the firm,

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.500
we use it both personally
and for business.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.920
And I'm the founder
of Alpha Architect,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.690
and our business is focused
on empowering investors

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.980
through education.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.680
And part of our effort is
we do a ton of research,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.350
including writing books.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.370
And one book we've written
with a couple my colleagues,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.870
Jack Bogle and David Folk, is
"The Do-It-Yourself Financial

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.280
Advisor."

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.870
And the thesis of this book is
that financial advice, as it

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.450
currently stands, is too
complex and too opaque,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.520
but you can make it
simple and transparent.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.240
And a potential thing
we should consider

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.640
is if financial advice can
be simple and transparent

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.450
and still be effective.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.580
Maybe we don't need
intermediaries and all

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.520
these expensive advisors.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.920
And so that's the
argument here, is

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.466
that do-it-yourself
is not for everyone,

00:01:14.466 --> 00:01:15.465
but it's not impossible.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.790
So what is the problem
with advice that's

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.740
too complex and too opaque?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.080
Well, you make the wolf of
Wall Street really rich.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.190
Why is advice complex?

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.600
Because complexity sells.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.190
If I'm a broker or an advisor
and I say, go buy and hold

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.130
Vanguard funds
forever, you're going

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.760
to say well, why the heck do
I need you to be my advisor?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.840
Why am I paying
you all this money?

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.490
So advice has to be complex,
even though it may not work,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.250
because it sells.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.720
So this is what
we face out there.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.550
What is the problem with that?

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.780
Let me orient it to this slide.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.190
So on the x-axis you
have Goldman Sachs,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.310
which epitomizes the
smartest people in the room.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.850
If anyone can beat the
market, Goldman Sachs

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.570
should be able to beat
the market, right?

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.300
And over here on
the right you have

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.800
Vanguard, which is the exact
opposite of Goldman Sachs.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.710
They don't even try
to beat the market,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.160
they say we're going to
deliver you the market exposure

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.280
at the lowest cost possible.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.750
On the y-axis right here, we
have the percentage of funds

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.870
by these respective
entities-- the smartest people

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.210
in the room and Vanguard.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.020
And these are the percentage
of funds that over the last 10

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.340
years-- from '04 to 2014-- that
beat their respective benchmark

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.440
indices.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.440
Goldman sits
unfortunately around 10%.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.470
So 1 out of 10 funds provided
by Goldman Sachs-- which is just

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.040
an example of the smartest
people in the room--

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.730
doesn't beat the
passive benchmark.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.880
Whereas Vanguard over here has
a hit rate of around 45% to 50%,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.780
which makes sense.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.080
If I'm not trying to
beat the benchmark,

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080
I'm going to have some
that wins some that lose,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.950
but on average I'm
going to be average.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.200
Great.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.864
What do you notice
between these two folks?

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:22.840
The key difference is the
average fee charge-- 120 basis

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.950
points or 1.2% for the
average Goldman fund,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.150
17 basis points for the
average Vanguard fund.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.040
So 1/6 the cost with
way better performance.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.860
And as Jack Bogle says here,
who's the smart money now?

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.660
So just because you are really
smart and you're an expert

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.220
and you have all
the expertise, that

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.110
doesn't mean that your
clients end up winning.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.860
You may win, but the
clients may not win.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.390
So we need to consider this.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.410
And this is the problem
with too much complexity

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:02.050
and not enough transparency,
is the wolf gets rich.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.310
We don't, as the clients.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.720
So what is the solution?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.030
Well, the reality-- just from
an evidence-based perspective--

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.940
is that financial
advice can be incredibly

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.480
simple and transparent.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.260
And the simplest
thing that we could do

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.420
is what we call the
60/40 portfolio.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.730
60% in a global stock index,
40% in a global bond Index.

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.610
You could probably manage
this in your underwear

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.190
from your dorm room for 15
to 20 basis points, right?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.510
Totally easy and actually
really effective.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.130
If you look historically,
this portfolio works.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.140
So if anyone's going to
add layers of complexity,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.680
they need to be benchmarked
against the cheapest,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.150
most liquid, and simple
porfolio that one can imagine.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.080
And I'm only going to
believe your extra complexity

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.920
if you can show me via evidence
that it actually is superior.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.610
One of the biggest
challenges to DIY the expert.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.870
Don't listen to
experts and be very

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.050
skeptical of what they have to
say for the following reasons.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.470
One, experts know that humans
suffer from behavioral bias.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.540
So at another point in my
life-- almost 10 years ago--

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.920
I actually got to hang
out with the Iraqi Army,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.860
and we have two types of people.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.390
We have the rational
people-- which

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.890
I happen to be part of this club
this time, usually I'm not--

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.630
we have irrational people.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.540
What do rational people do?

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.980
Well, we wear our Kevlars.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.940
Why?

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.230
Because if this hut back here
gets smashed with a mortar

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.070
and a piece of cement goes
blazing toward your head,

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.830
you want to have
something protecting you.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.740
So you wear Kevlar.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.740
We also bring extra ammunition.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.990
Why does that make sense?

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.270
Well if you get shot at, it'd
be nice to shoot back, right?

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.380
So we've got to bring
extra ammunition.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.600
We also need to bring a
source of water-- which

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.340
I don't know if you can see
on these two rational folks

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.410
here-- because in 125 degree
weather, if you're not drinking

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.980
and hydrating you're
going to probably die

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.000
of heatstroke before you
die of an IED or something.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.640
So rational people
in this environment

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.910
do this sort of stuff.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.300
Then we've got
exhibit B. No Kevlar

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.320
because wearing a Kevlar--
it's heavy, it's hot,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.720
why would I want to wear that?

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.110
I'm going to hold it.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.610
Ammunition?

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.400
We don't need ammunition.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.680
It's heavy, it's hot, I
don't want to carry it.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.670
Leave that back at the barracks.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.650
And of course, don't
bring a source of water

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.910
because in Arab culture
over there-- especially

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.160
within the military ranks-- it's
kind of weak to drink water.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.940
So we're not going
to do that, right?

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.730
What's the point?

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.590
The point is when we're
in distressed, emotional

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.070
situations, we sometimes
do irrational things.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.950
And that's not to say
that in a financial market

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.110
it's like being in a combat
zone, but in many respects

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.860
it is.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.190
Because it's emotionally
charged, people on CNBC

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.320
are saying the world's
going to blow up,

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.320
and this is going to
inspire bad decision-making.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.050
So remember this, we're
influenced by bias.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:31.520
Even smart people that work
at Google suffer from bias.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.560
The other thing we've
got to recognize

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.490
is that humans love stories
at the expense of evidence.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.180
So we've got the
fancy-schmancy hedge fund

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.704
manager who's got his yacht and
his house in Martha's Vineyard.

00:07:47.704 --> 00:07:49.120
He's like hey, all
you've gotta do

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.390
is do what I do and
you can have this, too.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:55.510
It's a great story-- good enough
for him, good enough for me.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.580
Even though the evidence
says time and time again

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.670
when we buy expensive,
overpriced products,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.600
we allow the hedge
fund manager to afford

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.520
the yacht and the Martha's
Vineyard location.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.050
But we don't get afforded
that location because we're

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:14.100
paying him all the fees.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.240
It's a great story.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.110
People have studied the
human belief in stories

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:24.180
at the expense of
evidence in great detail.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.120
BF Skinner almost
60, 70 years ago

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.150
said why do human beings
believe in crazy stories

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:34.580
even though there's so
much evidence to suggest

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.730
that their beliefs are insane?

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.280
Why do they have
these superstitions?

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.770
So they look at the pigeon,
because the pigeon's

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.840
about as basic an animal
as you can get, right?

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.530
So what they do with these
pigeons, they say OK pigeons,

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.400
we're going to make you hungry.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.580
And then we're going
to put you in a cage,

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.275
and every five seconds a piece
a bird seed's going to pop out.

00:08:54.275 --> 00:08:55.720
And what do pigeons do?

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.110
Pigeons are random, so they'll
bee-bop around their cage.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.662
And one will kick left, a piece
of bird seed will pop out.

00:09:03.662 --> 00:09:07.010
All right, nice,
eat my bird seed.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:08.810
Be-bopping around,
just by randomness

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.070
they may kick again to the left.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.080
Bird seed popped out.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.770
Pigeons start thinking
if I kick to the left,

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.420
bird seed comes out, right?

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.790
And they start
developing this story,

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.860
and they get this superstition.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.030
And then the researchers say
OK, now that we've established

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.750
this story and this
superstition-- which is just

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.770
based on noise-- can
we untrain this pigeon

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.560
to stop believing that if
we give it enough evidence?

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.130
So start tweaking it
around where it actually,

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.060
systematically when it kicks
left, it doesn't get food.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.550
And what they find is
that once an animal--

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.610
even a pigeon, and this
applies to humans--

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.290
gets stuck in a story, trying
to give them a lot of evidence

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.040
to convince them they're
wrong is actually

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.690
incredibly difficult.
Because stories sell.

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:00.480
Why is this important?

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.400
Well, consumer
beware-- experts are

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.830
very well-trained at
exploiting your bias

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:12.560
and very well-trained at
telling you great stories.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.700
And the irony here is
that, in many respects,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.980
I should be
considered an expert.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.240
I don't know why, but
I was on the cover

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.970
of Barron's last week,
I got a PhD in finance,

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.450
I've written four books,
I'm doing all this research.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.400
So I'm the expert telling you
to not listen to the expert.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.790
Which is actually the best
advice you could possibly

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.190
get from this discussion here.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.050
So everything I say, make
sure it goes in one ear

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.580
and out the other, right?

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:43.490
So with that disclaimer up
front, let's analyze how

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.440
can we potentially add
evidence-based solutions

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.690
that can improve this
so-called 60/40 porfolio?

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.900
And there's a lot of
metrics we can look at

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.720
to try to improve
this thing, but we're

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.060
going to focus on two here just
because of time constraints.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.470
And one is asset allocation.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.890
So trying to determine
how much stocks do we own?

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.550
How much bond, how much
commodity, how much whatever?

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.840
And the other one
is stock selection.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.670
Do we just go buy
a Vanguard fund

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.060
or do we try to
become Warren Buffett

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.560
and pick value
stocks or whatever?

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.950
So we're going to walk through
both of these in detail

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.720
and discuss how and why we
may want to add complexity,

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.070
or maybe we don't want
to add complexity.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.700
So first, asset allocation.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.780
So before I tell you
what's going on here,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.150
this paper is a 2009
paper in the "Review

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:36.310
of Financial Studies."

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.742
Which if you don't read
geeky finance research,

00:11:38.742 --> 00:11:40.200
you probably don't
know what it is.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.160
But it's a top
tier, A publication

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.260
that all the finance
professors have to be aware of.

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.360
And what this paper shows--
or what these authors attempt

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.670
to do-- is they
say listen, people

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:57.760
who've won Nobel Prizes for
these ideas of mean variance

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.640
analysis and modern
portfolio theory-- which

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.660
are rampant throughout society.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.690
I teach it in all of
my classes, everyone

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.500
has to teach modern
portfolio theory.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.570
But they asked a
simple question,

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:14.540
does this crap actually
work in a practical sense?

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.860
And they say, you know
what we're going to do?

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:21.170
We're going to look at the 1
over N rule-- equal weighting

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.850
of portfolios.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.820
So if we have 10 assets-- i.e.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.730
N equals 10-- let's just
put 10% in each asset

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.619
and use that as our
asset allocation scheme.

00:12:32.619 --> 00:12:34.410
And we're going to
compare that against all

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.660
the whiz-bang fancy models
that have been published

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.640
in academic research,
with tons of math

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.270
and nice closed-form solutions,
all these good things.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.590
And I'm just showing you
an example right here,

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.590
and I'll just read
what the authors say.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:53.320
Of the 14 models we evaluate,
none is consistently

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.840
better than 1 over N rule.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.210
That is remarkable.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.810
All that brain
damage and power that

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.280
went into solving this stuff
that wins Nobel Prizes gets

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:12.910
published, but has absolutely
limited practical benefit.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.270
That's remarkable.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.914
They're basically saying
this stuff doesn't work.

00:13:17.914 --> 00:13:20.330
Here's some of the evidence,
just to give you one example.

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:23.030
They do this across
multiple asset classes.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.670
It's an academic
journal, so they've

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.570
got to do robustness tests
until they're blue in the face.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.600
But since you're
on the x-axis here,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.455
you have the Sharpe
ratio-- which

00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:32.830
if you're not
familiar with that,

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.710
it's just a risk-adjusted
benefit, higher is better--

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:41.130
and they compare fancy
models against 1 over N

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.060
when they're looking to
allocate across S&amp;P sectors.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.700
So you have utilities,
financials, whatever, energy.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.830
We could use a fancy
optimization model

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.880
to try to pick and
choose the weights,

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.830
or we could just do 1 over N.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.860
And remarkably 1 over N-- which
is insanely easy and robust--

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.630
has the highest Sharpe ratio.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.250
So not only does it
equal their perform,

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.140
it's actually beats
most of these things.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.790
What's the bottom line?

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:17.430
When it comes asset allocation,
complexity does not work.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.670
It's just the evidence.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.210
So if someone tries
to sell you something

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.530
that sounds really cool,
it probably is really cool.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.260
Remember, the evidence
doesn't back or support

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.955
that it probably
works out of sample.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.230
So what could be the
implication of that?

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.334
And this is just an example,
and these are all frameworks.

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:39.500
I'm not saying you should
do this or your shouldn't.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:43.370
But we have our
baseline 60/40 up here,

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:47.000
and we know that doing
things that are crazy complex

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.710
don't really add much value.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:51.710
But maybe we can add
one degree of complexity

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:55.290
to build a little bit
more robust portfolio.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.400
So one idea out
there is presented

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.960
by Meb Faber and Eric
Richardson in a great book

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.870
called "The Ivy Portfolio."

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.140
I think Meb's actually
spoke here before.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.070
And what he shows is
something really compelling.

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:12.060
You can capture 90% to 95%
of the returns of endowments

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.300
and very sophisticated
people by simply

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.380
allocating-- in an
equal weight fashion--

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.960
to five asset classes.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.030
Domestic equity,
international equity,

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.290
real estate,
commodities, and bonds--

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.320
which you could buy some
ETFs for next-to-nothing

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.750
and capture the world's
risk premiums simply.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:40.540
What I do here is just map
that concept into this 60/40,

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.250
and tell you why this might
make a little bit more sense

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.820
at the margin than
a generic 60/40.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.030
You still have
your 60 over here,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.830
divvy it up-- domestic,
international--

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.720
why does that make rough sense?

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:57.660
Well, that about approximates
the market capitalization

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.000
of US securities and
international securities.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.430
So you're kind of passively
capturing those risks.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:09.730
And instead of doing 40%
all in on a fixed income

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:14.025
instrument, what happens
if we turn into Zimbabwe?

00:16:14.025 --> 00:16:15.400
I'm not saying
that would happen,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.580
but there's a risk that we could
have a hyperinflation element.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.360
Maybe for our diversifier
bucket here and that 40%,

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:28.240
we just break it in half--
20% real, 20% fixed.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.480
So instead of 40% fixed
income, maybe some real estate,

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.640
commodities, kind of capture
in real hyperinflation hedges,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.790
and then stick with
that fixed income.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.910
So a small tweak that
might make this portfolio's

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:46.150
overall architecture a little
bit more robust than 60/40.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.760
Not to say that
60/40's bad, but this

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:54.270
may be one tweak you could use
to enhance it if you chose to.

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.620
So real simple.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.110
I'm not even showing
results here,

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.930
but this is also effective.

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.100
All these things are
actually effective even

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.689
though they're insanely easy.

00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:04.730
And they're also really
effective because they're

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.280
really cheap, too.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.690
OK, that's asset allocation.

00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.450
Next is stock selection.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:16.369
And there's huge debates about
this, because the evidence is

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.869
very clear that
over time-- if you

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.180
look at the sample
of mutual funds,

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.190
they bascially deliver the
S&amp;P minus a bunch of fees.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.890
That's not a good
idea, so that's

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.310
why Jack Bogle says
well, let's just

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:33.370
buy the Vanguard
fund for five BPs

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.150
and you're going
to be better off.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.970
Why in the heck
would anyone want

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.570
to try to be Warren Buffett?

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.170
And that's a really
good question

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.370
because as you'll find
out here, it's really hard

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.710
to be Warren Buffett.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.100
And we also know that
for every active winner,

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.720
there's got to be
an active loser.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.520
So when you get
down to active game,

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.367
it's not like there's
just free money,

00:17:56.367 --> 00:17:58.950
just because you're smarter than
everyone you're going to win.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.990
You're always
systematically having

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.020
to take from someone else.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.330
Because in the end, it
basically is a zero sum game,

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.538
for all intents and purposes.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.770
I happen to be a believer
in active stock selection,

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.820
and I'll tell you
my story of why.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.250
So I used to hang
out with this guy.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.370
His name is Eugene Fama.

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.650
He's now a famous Nobel
Prize winner, right?

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.870
I'm doing my dissertation at
the you University of Chicago.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.790
I came back from
the Marines and I

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.340
was feeling happy about myself.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.220
I was like, what
could I do that would

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.260
be so ridiculous at
the school that it just

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.370
would be interesting.

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:42.300
I'm going to try to show Eugene
Fama, the guy who basically won

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.130
the Nobel Prize for the
Effecient Market Hypothesis,

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:48.120
that this value
investing stuff works.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.890
Because I've been reading
Warren Buffett, reading Ben

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.300
Graham my whole life-- I
think this is compelling.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.170
I'm going to figure
out how to study

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.750
this in a nice, robust way.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.250
So I go read 4000
reports submitted

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.810
through this organization called
valueinvestorsclub.com, which

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.050
is started by a guy named
Joel Greenblatt-- he was

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.430
a famous hedge fund manager,
famous value investor--

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.920
and I tabulate all
these results up.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.330
And I have right in my one
chapter of my dissertation,

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.250
value investors have
stock picking skills.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.340
Send it to our friend
here who's probably

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.960
the hardest working
man in finance.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.510
And of course, he immediately
responds in email,

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.170
your conclusion has to be false.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:36.330
I'm like, oh crap, that just
wasted a year of my life.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.460
So I run down to Professor
Fama's office, I'm like,

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.100
what do we mean it's false.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.390
Did I screw up in my
statistics or the study.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.370
He's like Wes, calm down.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.110
He's like, your
analysis is fine.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.880
But you can't say that value
investors have stock picking

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.830
skills.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.180
You have to say the
sample of value investors

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.380
you analyzed have
stock picking skills.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.850
I was like, all right, so I
just got to change some words.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.030
He's like, yeah, words matter.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.170
I was like, roger that,
I'm out of this place.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.460
Sign the diploma, I'm
out of the pain train

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.810
that you call the Chicago
Finance Ph.D. Program.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.510
And I walk out of
that place thinking,

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.820
OK markets are not
perfectly efficient

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.830
because there is evidence that
some people have this ability.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.230
And it seems to be compelling.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.570
More studies that have come out.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.080
So this is a study from Cliff
Asness and some of his friends.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.330
Very compelling paper published
in the Journal of Finance.

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.590
Value and Momentum everywhere.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:42.850
And they highlight
that value, which

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:48.510
is classified by just buying
cheap stuff everyone hates,

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.860
and momentum, which
is buying securities

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.300
that have strong relative
performance are everywhere.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.880
They're in every asset
class you could imagine.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.540
It's super compelling.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.830
And I've written books
dedicate each of this.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.620
So Quantitative Value is
a whole book dedicated

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.135
to systematic value investing.

00:21:07.135 --> 00:21:10.680
We're interested in a manuscript
on another one on momentum.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.740
This stuff is baked in the cake.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:15.640
It has worked.

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.000
So the natural question
is valuable momentum

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.300
are open secrets.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.220
They've been working
for over 100 years.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.074
Why isn't everyone doing this.

00:21:28.074 --> 00:21:29.490
And this gets to
the understanding

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.820
of how and why active
investments actually

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.039
work and are sustainable.

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:36.580
And we have to have
a whole framework

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.344
for this, called the sustainable
active investing framework.

00:21:40.344 --> 00:21:41.760
And the best way
to think about it

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.590
it's like playing
at a poker game

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:45.550
when you're in
the stock markets.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.756
We need to know at the
table who is the worst poker

00:21:48.756 --> 00:21:49.880
player at the table, right?

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.350
Because we're going to need
to take from someone else

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:56.020
because it's a zero sum game.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.700
But simultaneously,
you can't just

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:01.130
know who the worst poker
player is at a poker table

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.970
because if they're someone
way smarter than you,

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.980
you're also the fish, right?

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.520
So we need to know who are the
best poker players at the stock

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.580
market investing table and
what are their capabilities

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.260
and limitations.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:20.220
Only when we can identify
the bad poker player, which

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.550
is usually represented
by investors that

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.790
suffer from some sort of
systematic behavioral bias

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.430
that actually can
influence stock prices,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.530
and simultaneously we
understand the capabilities

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:34.140
and limitations of these
good poker players--

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.590
either people with billions or
dollars or resources and access

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.410
to all information in the world.

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:44.170
Only then can we identify
a sustainable active

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.070
opportunities.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.400
And the bottom
line is real active

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.160
investing that works can't
be easy because it'll

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.780
get arbitraged out immediately.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.890
Value investing is
a classic example

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:03.110
of how we can take all
that mumbo jumbo theory

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.110
and put a little meat
on the bones here.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.220
So what is value investing, what
is the so-called value anomaly,

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.770
just to give you a reference.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:14.050
So this is some results from a
paper we published a while ago.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.140
Essentially, value
investing and the value

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.040
anomaly is this idea
that if you just

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.900
buy cheap stocks, like this
sort, 1,000 securities on PE

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.350
ratio, and you just
systematically every year buy

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.750
the cheapest ones and you
create portfolios where you also

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.870
buy the most expensive
ones, represented here

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:36.710
by Glamor-- top
20% most expensive,

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:41.560
top 20% cheapest-- over time
no matter how you figure out

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:45.650
how we're going to measure
value, you get this spread.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.390
Of anywhere from 4%
to 7% in this sample.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:50.840
That's each year.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.750
If you compound 47%
for 40 years, that's

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.150
the difference between being
Warren Buffett and being me,

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:56.650
right?

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.980
You're going to be
rich if you did this.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.100
So this is the anomaly.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.380
You just buy cheap stuff.

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.690
So what is going on here.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:11.840
So back in the literature,
value investing and this anomaly

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.610
can be explained by
one of two things.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.789
Extra risk or maybe
it's mis-pricing.

00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:19.080
How are we going to study this.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.146
Well Lakonishok,
Shleifer, and Vishny,

00:24:21.146 --> 00:24:24.825
in a Journal of Finance
1994 paper, do exactly this.

00:24:24.825 --> 00:24:27.860
This was over 20 years ago.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.690
They say, how are we
going to determine

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:34.240
whether this is because of
extra risk or due to mispricing.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.200
So what they did is
they sourced securities

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.420
on book to market in this case.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.830
Expensive to cheap.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:47.040
On our y-axis here is the past
five years earnings growth

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.940
rates.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:52.860
And you notice is a monotonic
relationship between price

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.070
and past fundamentals.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.710
What is the implied
market expectation

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.270
embedded in these prices.

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:04.620
Well, these securities
are expensive because it

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.540
is necessarily implied
that that will continue.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.050
Why else would you pay a lot
of money for a stock, right?

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.260
Why would you want
to buy Facebook

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.750
at whatever PE it is right
now, unless you thought

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.250
Facebook was going
to continue to have

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:19.770
this amazing growth, right?

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.440
So it's extrapolated
out into the future.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.210
That's why these are expensive.

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:28.310
Similarly, down here in the
trash can, amongst the cheapest

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.420
securities that no
one really likes,

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.310
these are the dead
dinosaur companies

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:37.510
or whatever it might be,
they're dead and dinosaured out

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:41.940
and cheap because they've
done poorly recently.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.020
And the implied
market expectation

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.890
is they're probably going to
do poorly in the future, right?

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.309
That's why they're cheap.

00:25:48.309 --> 00:25:50.850
If everyone thought they were
going to do well in the future,

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.800
they would be over here.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.220
They're not.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.150
So we know the expectation
that's baked in the cake.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.040
This is going to continue.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.290
And this is going to continue.

00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:06.940
Well what actually happens in
the future-- systematic, meaner

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:10.070
version in results.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.760
The gross stocks never
achieve, on average,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.390
what the market thought
they were going to achieve.

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.040
What was baked in the cake.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:23.050
Similarly, cheap trash stocks
were expected to basically

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:27.410
all go bankrupt and on average
they never go all bankrupt,

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:29.380
the world gets a
little bit better,

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.020
and there's [INAUDIBLE] version.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:34.340
So why does value work.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.440
And why does growth
or expensive not work.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.210
Because the price
valuation is essentially

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.130
proxying for a bad
market expectation.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.970
So when you own
the cheap stocks,

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.900
and it turns out it's
not as bad as thought,

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.160
you essentially front
run a market expectation.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.770
When the expectation changes you
make money and beat the market.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:03.290
Similarly, these gross
securities here-- they're

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.610
expected to do Groupon example.

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.870
Go forever, oh,
you're only making 20%

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:11.650
you know returns on
your revenue, not 50%.

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:12.860
Chop you in half.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.400
That expectation changed, you
underperformed the market.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.110
So this is baked in the cake.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.800
Mispricing explains
some component

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.240
of the value known, right?

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.120
Clearly there might
be some risk as well.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.090
But you can't deny that
mispricing is in there.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.060
So why the heck
don't we all just

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.260
go buy a bunch of cheap stocks.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.580
Here's why.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.730
It is painful and the best
poker players in the room

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:41.880
don't like pain.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.370
So from '94 to
'99-- this is just

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:49.380
a performance of a generic value
strategy versus the broad index

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.230
when internet's going
crazz-- six years of getting

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.470
your face ripped off.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.900
Do you think anyone
managing money,

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.830
either in a delegated
sense or on their own,

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:06.830
could stick to a program where
even on the cover of Barron's

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:11.440
they say Warren Buffett has
lost his magic touch, right?

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.290
Value investing in
particular in strategies

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:20.560
that actually have staying
power have to be painful.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.630
Why is that.

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.900
Well a lot of this has
to do with the agency

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.110
conflict and the problem with
delegated asset management,

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.730
right.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.370
Because if you give money
to an asset manager,

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.040
you gave him two options.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.290
So you're giving this
money to this expert.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.450
Option one, you
tell asset manager

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.200
I'm going to deliver
you a strategy that's

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.650
going to be the market
by 25 basis points a year

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.020
for the next ten years and every
year you have a little hedge.

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:49.400
They're like oh, that
sounds amazing, right?

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.880
Or you give option two.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.610
I got a strategy
or system that can

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.820
beat the market by 5% a
year over the next 10 years

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.110
but I guarantee there's
going to be a three year

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:06.090
period where you lose to
this thing by 10% each year.

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.940
A delegated asset
manager who knows

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:13.870
his clients could be crazy and
focus on short term performance

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:17.320
may punt on this long
duration arbitrage

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.990
because there's too
much career risk.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:23.020
And these career
risk-minded folks

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.720
tend to be the best poker
players in the room.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.530
Because good poker players
get allocated upon a capital.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.520
But we know they have
this agency conflict.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.260
So certain strategies go right
to the heart of that conflict.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.830
Where they know they
work but they're not

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:41.960
going to do because they want
to clip a coupon on basically

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.140
a closet indexing
strategy, right?

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.980
So good strategies that are
sustainable have to be painful

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.370
or everyone would do it
and the smart poker players

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.470
have already arbitraged it out.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.060
So we mapped value-- and you
can do this with any strategy

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.870
if it's active-- into the
sustainable active framework.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.940
Worst poker players
are basically

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.080
those that overreact to bad
fundamentals-- this company is

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.930
dead, blah blah blah-- that we
know on average fundamentals

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.500
never are as bad as
people think in extremes.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.885
And people aren't going to
do this stuff, especially

00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:20.590
in concentrated, heavy
careerists-laden format

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.310
because you get fired.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:24.790
And people like to
keep their jobs.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.440
So this is a place where
presumably, we know the edge.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.790
And we know why others
aren't doing it.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.720
But we need to have the
capital and the discipline

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.140
to actually stick
with this opportunity.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:39.420
Because it systematically
got to be hard, right?

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.730
So active investing is
something that can work.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.460
But clearly it's
not for everyone

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.130
and you really gotta think
hard about how and why it

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.880
can work out of sample.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.730
So I hope everyone's
ready to DIY

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.240
because you've got your
[INAUDIBLE] allocation.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:01.480
And you know stick simple, keep
robust, diversified, low costs

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.300
on stock selection.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.637
Best solution for probably
90%, 95% of people

00:31:06.637 --> 00:31:08.970
stick with the Vanguard Fund
because you're probably not

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.090
wired to be weird and crazy.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.340
If you do want to do active,
know the sustainable active

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.360
framework.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:21.350
Be wired to not be cool at
a cocktail party sometime.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.340
And that's all I got to do.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:28.330
But let's take a test
now, which will identify

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.680
whether you actually have the
capability to be a DIY investor

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.660
or not.

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.566
This involves a little bit of
interaction, which is good,

00:31:37.566 --> 00:31:38.690
so we can wake you guys up.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:42.300
So I'm going to ask you guys
to all stand up right now.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.902
So everyone get
out of their seat.

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:46.110
And I'm going to tell you
what the situation here is.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:50.040
So this is a time back in
2008 during a financial market

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.417
crisis.

00:31:51.417 --> 00:31:53.000
I'm not going to
tell you when but you

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.680
all know that the
market blew up.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.840
And if you think-- and this
is going to be monthly time

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.490
series popping out here.

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:05.810
So if you think that the next
return is going to be positive,

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.040
raise your hand.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.420
If you think it's going
to be a bearish market,

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.700
keep your hands by your side.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.520
So think about your
history, we're 2008 here.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.982
Think about it and you could
Google it probably-- cheat.

00:32:18.982 --> 00:32:19.940
What do you guys think?

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.043
So everyone everyone's
bearish here.

00:32:23.043 --> 00:32:24.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.150
WESLEY GRAY: All
right, so you're

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:26.360
a bull you got to sit down.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.340
So it was actually bearish,
It was actually bearish.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:30.720
OK, next period.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.430
Think hard about
this, It's in 2008.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:34.710
You don't know when.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.270
So if you think It's going to
be bullish, keep your hand up.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.570
If you think it was
bearish, keep it down.

00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.200
A lot of bears in the room.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.190
Bears got it, all right.

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.590
Next one-- I told
you momentum works,

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.510
we're standing here, right?

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:52.900
Just in the opposite way.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.220
Bullish or bearish.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.740
Raise your hand if you're
bullish, if you're bearish

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:00.020
keep it by your side.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.070
A lot of bulls around here.

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.250
All right, all the bears
you got to sit down.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.229
If you're bullish,
you're going to stand up.

00:33:06.229 --> 00:33:08.770
We're starting to identify the
real stock pickers in the room

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:09.540
here.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.230
All right.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.150
Next one.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.560
This is pretty good,
Google's got a smart crowd.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.440
This is a lot higher
percentage than normal.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.355
Bullish or bearish.

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.370
A lot of bulls.

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:24.080
Sit down.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.010
So who's out geniuses
in the room here.

00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:29.130
All right guys, are ready?

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.790
What did I just do to you.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:36.920
I just manipulated
everyone in the room

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:40.220
with framing,
anchoring, availability,

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.080
and hopefully you
got to experience

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.170
that the human mind
is so good at trying

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:51.570
to interpret total noise
as actual signal, right?

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.940
And hopefully you just
experienced this where you

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:57.710
really felt like, oh yeah, '08,
it looks kind of like September

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:59.070
or what have you.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:04.660
And that's why you got to
ask yourself, before you DIY,

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.000
you might need a
psychology coach.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.050
Because unless you're
wired to follow a process

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:14.000
and hang on to it
like grim death,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.960
there is a benefit to
having an advisory component

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.719
or someone that helps you
as a psychology benefit.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.770
Which seems crazy that
you'd pay money for someone

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:27.949
to like keep you in line, but
that could be a huge value

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:28.800
proposition, right?

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:34.120
In 2008, if your advisor tells
you don't jump off the cliff,

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.110
even if they charge
a ton of money,

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:37.780
there's a huge benefit to that.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.790
So really when it comes down
to determining, should I

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.550
do this myself and
save all these fees

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.270
and not deal with all these
idiotic expert people that

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.239
are just trying to sell me on
stuff, you've got to remember,

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:52.480
am I wired to actually
be able to do this.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.770
And if you're not,
unfortunately, you probably

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.290
should go essentially hire
a psychology coach, right?

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.000
If you get real
rich or famous maybe

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.840
got to burn some money
on state and tax lawyers.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.180
But that's really
your decision point

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.170
and hopefully this
made that clear.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:13.850
So in the end our mission is
to empower investor education.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.280
We facilitate this,
we offer free tools.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.470
You want to do
some back testing,

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:23.080
you want to do your own
trading, go buckwild.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.630
We kind of have a Google
mission on our blog

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.480
where Google's mission
is to essentially capture

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.440
all the world's data and make
it organized and understandable

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.250
for people.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.230
We do that in the
finance context.

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:38.570
Where we read source journals,
decipher all the mathematics,

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.720
and try to see what is
the bottom line here.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.920
So we're trying to
organize finance knowledge

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.560
so it's digestible and
understandable for people

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.240
so they make better decisions.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.955
And then of course,
you know we're

00:35:49.955 --> 00:35:51.600
a for-profit just like here.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.360
If you get bored and you're like
this is a waste of our time,

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.650
we offer services
that actually help

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:58.360
implement some of these things.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.670
But in the end we
don't really care

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.510
if you work for us or you do
yourself, our mission again, is

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.470
to empower investor education
and help the financial service

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.680
sector essentially be better
and serve clients better.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.690
And we think that's done via
education and essentially

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:17.880
radical transparency about just
what works and what doesn't.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.210
Because it's got to
change where it can't just

00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:23.060
be opaque and complex.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.820
To just get extra fees where you
win but none of the clients do.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.650
We think the financial
industry needs

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:33.460
to be simple and transparent
and focused on educating people

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.770
so they make better decisions.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:36.950
So thank you very
much for your time.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:40.034
And I'll take any questions if
there are any in the audience

00:36:40.034 --> 00:36:40.533
here.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.496
Yes ma'am.

00:36:48.496 --> 00:36:50.662
AUDIENCE: I think I missed
the point of [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.736
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:36:57.736 --> 00:37:01.450
I kind of missed the
point of the exercise

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.650
to determine whether or not
you're a do-it-yourselfer.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.000
Isn't like the biggest
factor whether you're

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.500
OK with losing money for
long periods of time?

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.170
WESLEY GRAY: Not really.

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.670
It's really about how much
you can control, look yourself

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:21.270
in the mirror, and say yes, I
can control my own innate bias.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:24.300
If you can do that,
do-it-yourself

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:25.330
is a great approach.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:27.260
Because what we
see all the time is

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.930
an engineer is actually
a perfect DIY people.

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:33.110
Because they're kind of, in
general, focused on process,

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.720
robustness, and you
just stick to systems.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.960
The issue is a lot of times
people build a system,

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.890
they're like, wow, this works.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.390
And usually it
works because it's

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.000
in a sustainable,
active situation where

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.740
it works because it
sometimes doesn't work.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:51.110
So we could do the back
testing, do the research,

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.250
we're like, oh yeah,
this is money good.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.230
And you're like we're
going to do it forever.

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.960
And then of course, it
can't work all the time.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.600
So the minute the quarter
comes out, the year comes out,

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.320
and you're like I should have
just bought the Vanguard fund,

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.130
should have just done this
or that-- if you don't

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.780
have that ability to
stick to that program

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.820
because you're letting your
innate bias start to move you

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.280
away from like doing the process
that initially actually added

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.100
value, that that's
why you sometimes

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.884
need an outside source
to help you do that.

00:38:22.884 --> 00:38:25.050
And that's why there's a
lot of interesting business

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:27.810
models like Wealthfront
right now for example, right?

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:29.460
Those are great
solutions because there

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:35.000
are systematic, process-driven,
transparent, and cheap.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.230
And that's great for a huge
segment of the population,

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.470
awesome.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:42.330
The issue is, are
you the person that

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.240
can actually do that
or do you actually

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.110
need the psychology coach.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.780
And as far as I know
right now, humans

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.500
are still the best psychology
coach for other humans

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.720
because when the machine says,
oh, stick to the program,

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.667
don't worry about it,
we're like, stupid computer

00:38:58.667 --> 00:38:59.750
I'm going to throw it out.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.090
I'm just going to sell.

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.380
And so that's a challenge
for like automated players

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.450
out there that are basically
delivering great solutions

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:11.710
but that's not the skill
of being a good investor.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.160
We can all generate great
processes and great systems.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.530
The skill is having
the discipline

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.480
to actually stick to the thing.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.160
And some people
just need a human

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.910
to kind of be like, yo,
calm down, chill out,

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:26.820
and stick with it.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.510
So that's why I'm
highlighting here.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.170
Like, we all have this
weird bias and wiring that

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:33.780
can potentially run us astray.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.030
And DIY is really
good for people

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.130
that can stick to the program.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.350
But if you feel like
maybe you can't, that's

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:44.750
where you might need some help.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:48.130
Or you could just go put your
money under a pillow too.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.200
That's another way
to DIY but then

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.250
you're losing out
on the opportunity

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:54.490
to grow your wealth.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.010
Yes ma'am?

00:39:59.585 --> 00:40:02.170
AUDIENCE: I've recently
been thinking about things

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:06.030
like Wealthfront and
what's the other--

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.000
WESLEY GRAY: Betterment,
there's lots of them.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
so they basically

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.970
do like they rebalance
your portfolio [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:19.010
I heard every month
or two or something.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:20.390
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah.

00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:22.640
AUDIENCE: And I'm wondering
what the advantage of that

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.440
versus just like, every
year, like you were saying,

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.120
just get like get those same
stocks or those same index

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.320
funds that they offer?

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.070
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.180
AUDIENCE: And just
leave them for a year.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.990
What is the advantage of
doing that so frequently,

00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:45.140
given that there might be
taxes associated with the sale?

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:49.360
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah so the reason
they do a lot of the trading

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.040
is probably related to like
tax loss harvesting, where

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.240
the idea is if you
have a loser and you

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.480
can realize that and
distribute that loss,

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.680
it can save you on taxes.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.430
So it may be beneficial to
let winners kind of ride

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.600
and systematically
harvest losses

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.770
because you can use
those losses to offset

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:07.890
taxable gains in the future.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.540
There's a fee you
got to pay for that

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.530
and there's frictional cost.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.410
And you pay 25 basis
points for that.

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.500
And it could be nice because
you can distribute losses.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.880
You can also pay
five basis points

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:22.530
and go buy the
Vanguard ETF, which

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.580
has 100% tax deferral
on it because it's

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.310
within an ETF structure.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.560
You don't get short term tax
loss harvesting benefits.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.420
So you can't distribute losses.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.050
But it's deferred
capital gain forever

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:36.850
and only costs you
five basis points.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:40.400
So I think you got
to figure out, OK,

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.510
25 BIPs, plus the underlying
fees of the thing,

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.740
let's say it's 35, 40 BIPS.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.640
Versus DIY, maybe
I can do it myself

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.630
for 10 to 15 basis
points with ETFs.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.720
And if that 15, 20 BIP
differential there.

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.450
And if you just
don't want to deal

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.660
with it because it's a pain
in your butt, fine, you know.

00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.860
But if you do, you can make
an argument either way.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:04.370
It's really about what's
the value of your time

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:05.870
and do you want to
do this yourself.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:07.494
Or you want to do an
automated solution

00:42:07.494 --> 00:42:11.230
and does that price
differential make sense.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.690
I think if you're wired to
actually want to do this,

00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.720
we always recommend people take
control of their own capital

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.100
because you care about
your money what else does.

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:23.476
You can basically do what
they do very cheaply.

00:42:23.476 --> 00:42:25.850
But a lot of automated--
they're just not that expensive.

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:29.450
So it's more about a question of
what's the value of your time.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.320
What you probably
don't want to do

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.710
is pay someone a
huge fee to do that.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.740
Like maybe for 25
basis points you

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:39.040
can invest in low cost funds.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.750
But I don't want to
maybe pay someone

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.050
100 basis points to do that.

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.970
That differential is too high.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.370
And if you're really
cheap, you don't even

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.020
need to pay the 25
BIPs, you can just

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:52.600
buy them direct and totally
dis-intermediate everything.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:55.180
And people should do
that if they want to.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:55.680
Why not?

00:42:58.015 --> 00:43:01.116
AUDIENCE: Can you explain how
value investing and momentum

00:43:01.116 --> 00:43:03.600
investing are in contradiction.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.802
Because momentum
investing you would

00:43:05.802 --> 00:43:08.856
have picked those top
stocks but [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:08.856 --> 00:43:11.660
And with value investing, how
you account for account loss--

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.776
I mean selection bias where
companies have disappeared

00:43:14.776 --> 00:43:16.110
from the data [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:18.260
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah
sure, so to the data

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.900
question-- most
researchers enact--

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.960
they use crisp
data, which is they

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.750
have whole teams that try their
best to eliminate this problem.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.049
Where they get backfill
delisted the data.

00:43:30.049 --> 00:43:32.340
They have someone go hunt
down like was that because it

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.630
was a merger acquisition,
was that because they

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.240
went bankrupt, what have you.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.970
So that is kind of the gold
standard for doing research

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:42.210
because we got to account for
this delisting bias, right?

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:45.256
And I think that's pretty well
fleshed out at this point.

00:43:45.256 --> 00:43:46.630
That it's pretty
good, it doesn't

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.910
have survivor bias in it.

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.840
So the next question is
how can you simultaneously

00:43:51.840 --> 00:44:00.850
have value, which is essentially
an overreaction to-- we spend

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:02.500
like a whole book
explaining this

00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.490
so I'll try to do this as simple
as possible here give me a sec.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.560
All right, so value
essentially seems

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.540
to be driven by an
overreaction to crappy news

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.540
in the short run, right?

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.300
That systematically
mean reverse.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.740
And in theory we
make money on this

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.200
because of mispricing because
that cheapness is essentially

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.310
a proxy for market-wide
expectation errors.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:29.270
That we can use to use
that proxy as a signal

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.210
to front run future market
expectations, right?

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.080
Where people are
like, oh wow, you

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.200
know IBM is not going bankrupt.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.990
It's obviously not
going to become Google

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:40.960
but it's not as bad as
expected and you make money

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.090
on the expectations
change, right?

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:47.332
Momentum it turns out
it's a lot more complex.

00:44:47.332 --> 00:44:49.040
I think in the psychology
people are even

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.970
a researcher are trying to
figure out the vast proportion

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:55.485
of the empirical evidence.

00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:57.590
And I literally just
got done doing this

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:59.230
because I just
wrote a book on it,

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.950
is actually a
momentum, ironically,

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:03.840
is actually the opposite.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.230
It's an under-reaction
to good news.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.960
So this price signal comes out.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.570
And you see this
price signal keep

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:14.570
doing really well relative to
other securities out there.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:18.320
And prices tell you a lot about
information in the future.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.620
It's saying hey, this
thing is really good

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.130
and it keeps going up.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:26.180
But for some reason, it
should be worth here,

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.420
and the thing is moving up.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.390
But it doesn't immediately
go to fundamental value.

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:33.130
There's like this
systematic under-reaction

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:34.960
to this good news
that's coming out.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.610
And you can map that back
to like unexpected earnings

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:38.850
releases and everything.

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:42.170
So they're actually
kind of the same idea.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.740
One is just an overreaction
to crappy news.

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:49.380
The other one is essentially an
under-reaction to positive news

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.260
that's associated
with prices only.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.460
The value anomaly
right here, remember

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:58.430
this is a price relative
to a fundamental.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:00.370
So that's why this is growth.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:01.580
And this is value.

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:05.300
Momentum has nothing to
do with fundamentals.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:06.572
Only price.

00:46:06.572 --> 00:46:09.280
And if you actually look at
the overlaps of portfolios

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.320
between growth securities
and high momentum

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.100
securities-- the name-
they're actually really low.

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.120
And you also see it in the data.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:24.570
Growth portfolios under-perform
the market by a wide margin.

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:28.250
Momentum portfolios
kicks the markets butt.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:30.800
It's volatile as
heck, and it's crazy,

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.820
but that growth in
momentum, even though they

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.010
sound the same-- and most
people even in industry

00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:38.510
don't understand
this difference--

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:40.280
they're totally different.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.080
Growth is about price
to the fundamental,

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.790
which is a quotient.

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:49.160
Momentum is all
about price only.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:54.571
And you can sometimes have
value stocks be momentum stocks,

00:46:54.571 --> 00:46:55.070
right?

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.440
Similarly, you can have
expensive stocks be high

00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.800
momentum stocks.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:05.690
But momentum and value are kind
of different ideas out there.

00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:08.052
But it's very nuanced.

00:47:08.052 --> 00:47:12.290
And unless you geek out
and do source journal

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:15.870
literature-- a lot of people are
like momentum is just growth.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.380
That's not true.

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:19.520
Especially when you define
momentum as actually

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.930
it's defined in
the literature that

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:26.310
captures the actual anomaly
that everyone's talking about.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.265
I don't know if that
answers your question, but--

00:47:29.265 --> 00:47:30.640
AUDIENCE: I mean
it's like you're

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.910
using price too, its PE--

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:35.100
WESLEY GRAY: For this, yes.

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.080
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.670
AUDIENCE: It's
surprising that that

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:42.510
correlates so well with the past
five years earning potential.

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:45.991
It seems highly unlikely
that just doing that ratio

00:47:45.991 --> 00:47:47.490
can give you such a nice graph.

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:48.240
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah.

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.046
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] to
relate to growth, which

00:47:51.046 --> 00:47:53.002
is just based on price, right?

00:47:53.002 --> 00:47:54.460
WESLEY GRAY: Well,
priced earnings.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.260
Yeah.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:59.040
So this is a price
to fundamental ratio.

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.760
And like I said, that's
one of the arguments

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.570
of why this works.

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:05.120
It's because price
to fundamentals

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.660
basically proxy for an
expectation problem, right?

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.480
On the growth side,
people think it's

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.240
way better than
it ends up always

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.900
being on average yet in value.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.209
But then again, momentum,
and this is a very new--

00:48:18.209 --> 00:48:20.000
and if I had a white
board I could actually

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.620
like write this up or little
better-- it's only about price.

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:26.940
And there's a lot of
really interesting theories

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.589
because one of the
things-- and this

00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:30.380
is something even I
don't fully understand,

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.050
I don't think anyone
does, I'm just

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.580
trying my best to finally
get it-- in general,

00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.120
values sink in
about fundamentals

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.310
and prices move around
a fundamental, right?

00:48:40.310 --> 00:48:42.620
That's kind of at
the core theory

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:44.810
of how this whole game works.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:46.300
But you know, George
Soros and some

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.450
these guys they had this
idea of reflexivity.

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:51.550
And I think you can see
it in Palo Alto, where

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:57.640
prices might actually reverse
influence fundamentals, right?

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:02.230
For example, LinkedIn, just a
while ago before they blew up,

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:04.210
the price was way high.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.550
You could have your
options to your employees

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:08.150
and that's fundamentally good.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:10.390
Price goes down
50%, let's just say

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:12.160
that wasn't even
fundamental-related,

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.870
how are you going
to attract talent.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.740
You know you've got all this bad
PR out there like, ah, LinkedIn

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:17.640
is dying.

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.530
And now just the
price movement itself,

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:22.900
even if it was
non-fundamental-related

00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:26.080
can actually fundamentally
affect the firm, right?

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.960
So there's one cause going from
fundamentals to price action.

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.660
But I think more
and more-- and this

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:36.250
is where it gets confusing-- you
can argue, I think justifiably,

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:40.870
that prices themselves can
influence fundamentals, right?

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.760
If you have a high
flying stock and you

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.160
go sell stock equity
for way overvalued,

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.465
you can fundamentally
create value for this firm.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:53.550
Because I used to
be like totally

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.135
in the religion of
value investing.

00:49:55.135 --> 00:49:57.370
And it's has taken me
a while to come around

00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:58.780
to this whole momentum thing.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.800
But now I'm thinking, OK,
it's not just fundamentals

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.820
and then prices move around you.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:08.570
Its prices can actually
influence the fundamentals.

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:11.220
And if prices are moving up
and let's say fundamentally

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.990
that's just the price signals
making the fundamentals change,

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:17.830
this can be a proxy for
maybe non-linear benefits

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.950
that the market doesn't
really appreciate yet.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:23.410
Because stocks moving up,
oh wow, our cost of capital

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.037
is way lower than it used to be.

00:50:25.037 --> 00:50:26.620
Because everyone
just loves our stock,

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:28.240
even if they overvalue it.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.990
That's great because
I can do acquisitions

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.270
cheaper than the other guy
who has crappy price action.

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:35.160
Because his cost of
capital is higher.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.120
So that momentum could
actually indirectly

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.650
be affecting the fundamentals
but the market's not really

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:42.170
appreciating that yet.

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.360
And so I think momentum
is way more complex.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.510
That's why I think it
also works a lot better.

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.300
It actually works way
better than value.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:51.460
Because it's totally
counter-intuitive.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:55.380
Who wants to be the bag holder
on a 52 week high stock, right?

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.700
There's disposition effects.

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:59.020
Most people, when
it's moving up,

00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:00.670
they want to book
the market, right?

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:04.949
So you have supply shocks coming
on when things are moving up.

00:51:04.949 --> 00:51:06.740
Wheras when they're
moving down, everyone's

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:07.800
like they want to hold it.

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.008
They're like, oh, we don't
want to realize that loss.

00:51:10.008 --> 00:51:10.910
It's too painful.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.940
So there's a lot of weird
psychological things

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:16.730
that they are involved
with momentum.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:19.250
And like I said, I don't
think anyone understands it

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.170
as explicitly as value,
which is a little bit easier

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:23.120
to understand.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.590
Momentum is somewhat
interesting.

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:29.870
And it's certainly
one part behavioral

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:32.330
driven, certainly
one part risk driven,

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:34.840
because it's way more volatile.

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.880
It's really interesting.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:37.599
And the value-momentum
combination

00:51:37.599 --> 00:51:39.140
is really interesting
because they're

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.740
unrelated to each other.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.980
That's another
anomaly in itself.

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.390
Value is kind of anomalous.

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:45.909
Momentum is kind of anomalous.

00:51:45.909 --> 00:51:47.700
When you put them
together, because they're

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:51.250
like yin and yang, you get all
these weird portfolio benefits.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:52.940
And no one can explain that.

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:58.300
That's totally like a puzzle
in research right now.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.870
Sir?

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:03.060
AUDIENCE: You, with the sort of
burgeoning momentum strategies

00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:07.400
[INAUDIBLE], do you
think that momentum

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.992
will be [INAUDIBLE] away?

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:10.700
WESLEY GRAY: No,
because I think momentum

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.150
sits in that sustainable
active framework.

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:17.360
And this is really how
all these things work.

00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:20.460
So momentum-- it
seems pretty clear

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:24.460
that there's some behavioral
mispricing component.

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:26.930
It is so painful to write.

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:28.970
Like value is kind of painful.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:32.180
Momentum you will
die sometimes, right?

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:34.020
And that's what you want.

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:37.530
You want strategies
where you've got

00:52:37.530 --> 00:52:41.000
to be the last bag holder
that's willing to be like, no, I

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.200
understand how and
why this works.

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.600
And I want to see it
be horrific sometimes.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.440
Because now I know
it's sustainable.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.990
Whereas if I have
a strategy where

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:51.640
like I do all this
research and it just

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.490
makes money like a
Maddoff return stream,

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:55.740
I don't want to do that.

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.280
Because there's
tons of physics PhDs

00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:00.020
that are going to figure that
out and arbitrage that away.

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:04.620
So we want systems that
are mechanically exploiting

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:09.440
some behavioral issue but also
really painful for basically

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:11.670
delegated asset managers
to really follow

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.891
in their purest form
because they lose their job.

00:53:13.891 --> 00:53:16.140
But that's good because you
don't have all the capital

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:17.790
competing in a way.

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:20.810
And momentum is
totally hair-raising.

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:24.010
Like, if you're a concentrated
momentum player that's

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.270
trying to exploit
this anomaly, you

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.440
are going to get fired a lot.

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.400
Same thing with value.

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.280
If you're a like a Warren
Buffet-- Warren Buffet

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.610
is unique because he has
kind of captured capital.

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:40.030
But if you do strategies like
him, people every few years

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:42.410
are going to think, oh,
Warren Buffett such an idiot.

00:53:42.410 --> 00:53:44.360
What a dope, you know.

00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:47.790
Like he's under-performing for
five years or whatever it is.

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:50.190
That's actually the
greatest signal ever.

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.560
When you see redemptions coming
out on strategies that you know

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:58.190
work because they exploit
the systematic bias problem.

00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:59.980
Because that's why they work.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:03.020
Because the people that
used to believe in them

00:54:03.020 --> 00:54:05.590
and went on the
active side, give up,

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:07.620
and then they contribute
to the very anomaly

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.290
they're trying to exploit
because they're selling out

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.820
at the worst possible time.

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.840
And you've got to be that weird
person that's the bag holder.

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.370
And that's why active
investing is insanely hard.

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:20.820
Because you've got
to be a weird person.

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:24.580
And that's why most people
should go buy Vanguard funds.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.510
And most active
products you buy are not

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:29.120
going to be the
active products that

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.480
work because they're basically
closet index funds that

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.480
essentially just do what
the Vanguard funds do

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.880
but more expensive.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.670
You want active
things to be insane.

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:42.190
Where you just feel painful
sometimes to be in this thing.

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:43.750
Because then they're
going to work.

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.580
Because they're sustainable.

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:48.179
And so it's like a
weird dynamic game

00:54:48.179 --> 00:54:49.470
that you have to think through.

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:51.590
So it's not easy.

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:52.826
Sir.

00:54:52.826 --> 00:54:56.075
AUDIENCE: Is it possible the
value anomaly now is gone?

00:54:56.075 --> 00:54:59.500
Because it's under-performing
for a long time now.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.000
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.500
AUDIENCE: And even
Eugene Fama himself

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.630
said that the pace
of communication

00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:08.606
is a lot greater now
because of the internet.

00:55:08.606 --> 00:55:10.218
When the [INAUDIBLE]
were done, there

00:55:10.218 --> 00:55:12.080
was no internet in most
of the time period.

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:12.996
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah.

00:55:12.996 --> 00:55:14.370
AUDIENCE: You think that
fundamentally, things might

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:15.710
have actually changed now?

00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:18.310
WESLEY GRAY: Well I think
the actual evidence right now

00:55:18.310 --> 00:55:19.530
is the exact reason.

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:21.720
It's like the exception
that proves the rule.

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.730
Values underperformed and
so if all of a sudden I

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:28.560
saw a massive capital inflows
to value funds right now,

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.580
I would be afraid it was
getting arbitraged away.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.430
You see the exact opposite.

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.890
Values dead, what
a dumb strategy,

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:37.960
you see redemptions coming out.

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.890
Which is exactly in line
with why the thing works.

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:43.900
And to the information
thing, I actually think

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:46.600
all the information, the
ability to like go on Robinhood

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.980
and buy a stock
like on your phone,

00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:52.500
watching CNBC, tons of
info, all it's doing

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.920
is giving people
availability bias.

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:58.000
Because true, active
opportunities--

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.260
they're basically
long-duration arbitrages

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:02.600
that have a lot of
noise in the short run.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:05.760
And if you match
short-duration capital

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.990
with a long-duration
opportunity,

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:10.000
they end up contributing
to the anomaly.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.960
And the more information
is available,

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.610
the more people can buy
and sell at their whims

00:56:14.610 --> 00:56:17.450
and their emotions,
in my thoughts,

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:19.320
it's actually making
these things worse.

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:23.850
Like the more you have
availability and access to edge

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:26.360
that will give you
overconfidence in whatever idea

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.010
or story you're
believing in, I think

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:31.150
it's going to make these
things even better, frankly.

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:35.880
Because now anyone can go buy a
stock they like in an instant.

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.490
They can go do
their own backtest.

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:40.050
And if people just go
backtest willy-nilly,

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:43.740
without understanding
robustness, frameworks,

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:46.270
like competitive dynamics
of market places,

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:48.150
they're going to just
backtest-- oh wow,

00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:50.360
this is like easy
money, start doing

00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:55.360
that-- it's just contributing
more and more to the problems.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:59.760
So I think they're actually
more sustainable now.

00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:04.450
I think information just forces
people to make worse decisions.

00:57:04.450 --> 00:57:05.930
Because it's more available.

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:09.290
It's more in their face
they've got more saliency

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:12.570
and they just make
worse decisions.

00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:15.540
And empirically, we
could investigate

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.230
how and why these anomalies
would get arbitraged away

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:21.510
because at the exact worst
time when they stop working,

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:24.070
if you saw tons of
capital coming in,

00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.290
I would be really worried.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:28.250
Because that means the
people are being smart.

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:30.380
But you see the exact opposite.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:34.200
Fun flows away from the
short-term losers all the time.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.607
And that just contributes
to this thing.

00:57:37.607 --> 00:57:39.440
And it also attributes
to why the best poker

00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.606
players don't want to do it.

00:57:40.606 --> 00:57:44.656
Because they're losing
assets and losing their jobs.

00:57:44.656 --> 00:57:45.156
Sir.

00:57:47.699 --> 00:57:49.740
AUDIENCE: I got a question
about active investing

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:52.180
in terms of how
to read momentum.

00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.180
I mean, for value it seems
like you could fairly

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:55.970
straightforward price
the fundamentals

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:58.010
and determine what's
cheap and expensive.

00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:00.750
But I mean momentum, do you
read technical indicators

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:03.030
to get a sense of
what is that or are

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:05.842
you looking at momentum against
the actual fundamentals?

00:58:05.842 --> 00:58:08.050
You said it's just based on
price, so I assume mostly

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:08.550
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:11.330
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah, yeah, so
it's just pure price-based.

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:14.690
So the classic academic
anomaly that's momentum

00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:16.880
is essential what you
do is, every month,

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:19.480
say you have 1,000
securities, you just sort them

00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:22.930
on their past 12 month return--
just to keep this really easy.

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:27.170
And it turns out that those
that are in the top say, 100,

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.380
tend to outperform
the next month, right?

00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:33.050
And those in the bottom 100--
they were relatively weak

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:35.450
and tend to continue to
under-perform, right?

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:37.210
And you keep doing
this every month,

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:39.180
you get this huge
momentum spread.

00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:43.890
Very simple, just 12 month look
back, sort, you get the spread.

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:47.330
That's the most generic
version and that itself

00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:48.250
is really effective.

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:50.070
But it's also painful as heck.

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:52.330
Now I have a whole
book about this

00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:55.590
but, if you believe in
the behavioral theory,

00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:59.817
and you think it's an
under-reaction to fundamental

00:58:59.817 --> 00:59:01.400
news or fundamental
information that's

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.110
going to impound those prices.

00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:04.490
And it's just empirical facts.

00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:06.770
You can Google it, it's
called Frog in the Pan.

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:09.120
It's the name of the algorithm.

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:13.490
The idea is that if the frog
is in the hot boiling water,

00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:16.270
they immediately know
and they jump out, right?

00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:19.910
You can also put a frog in
water and slowly heat it up

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:21.889
and then they get killed
in the end, right?

00:59:21.889 --> 00:59:24.180
Because they have limited
attention to what's going on.

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.200
They don't feel it.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:26.400
So same thing with momentum.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:29.380
If you tweak the algorithm where
instead of just generically

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:31.890
buying all the best
relative performers,

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:35.620
those top 100, what happens if
you have a biotech in there.

00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:38.910
It's up 100% because
yesterday it got FDA approval.

00:59:38.910 --> 00:59:40.740
That's like the
frog feels the heat.

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.910
It jumps out.

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:45.410
Everyone knows about, it's
on CNBC, it's all great.

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:47.810
But what about these
momentum stocks.

00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:49.850
They're in the high
momentum bucket

00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:51.790
but they're just
slowly grinding there.

00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:54.050
It's like more of
a stable momentum.

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:56.550
It's just like you see this
price movement, like 50

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:58.850
BIPs over 200, 300 days.

00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:01.440
Versus like the ones
that just go up in a day.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.690
Well it turns out that
the momentum anomaly

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:08.590
is almost exclusively driven
by those securities that

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.850
are in that high momentum bucket
that had that slow grinding

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:12.540
momentum.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.790
Because if you get like the
biotech that shoots up 100%,

01:00:15.790 --> 01:00:17.490
those are efficient
market price.

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:19.930
They're just high risk,
high reward deals.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.900
And that goes back to
the behavioral bias.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.540
It's an under-reaction to news.

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:28.760
Where when you see the FDA
approval, it goes up 100%--

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.210
everyone sees it,
everyone reacts to it.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.990
Whereas this small grinding
kind of information

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:36.440
that's being released
over time that's more

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:38.230
likely to be under-reacted to.

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:40.240
And that's exactly what
we've seen in the data.

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.664
It's still painful.

01:00:41.664 --> 01:00:42.580
But that's all you do.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.700
You don't need to
make it that complex.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:47.320
And there's some seasonality
things and what have you,

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.430
but you just e-mail me
when the book comes out,

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:52.360
[INAUDIBLE] there's a
whole book dedicated to it.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.980
But the summary is a
slow moving momentum

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.951
is better than wacky moment.

01:00:58.951 --> 01:00:59.450
Question?

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:00.618
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:01:00.618 --> 01:01:01.368
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah.

01:01:01.368 --> 01:01:03.280
AUDIENCE: If you have
the opportunity of time

01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:06.873
on the other axis, mean
time of investment,

01:01:06.873 --> 01:01:09.831
and suppose for our
401k type thing,

01:01:09.831 --> 01:01:14.061
[INAUDIBLE] type of investment,
will you go to 100% stock,

01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:16.210
rather than 60%-40%?

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:16.960
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.330
So this is just a generic
endowment portfolio.

01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:24.890
But you're going to always
get the most tax efficient,

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:27.880
highest risk-free
associated with equity.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.240
And you can really juice
that with valuable momentum,

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.960
especially working in a system.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.280
This bucket over here is
the diversifier bucket.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.810
So if you really
have 30 year horizon,

01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:41.420
and you can really
stick to that,

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:45.137
then no, it doesn't make
sense to have diversifiers

01:01:45.137 --> 01:01:47.220
because you only have
diversifiers because you may

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.800
have a liquidity need, right?

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.346
And the reason that matters if
you have a lot of volatility,

01:01:51.346 --> 01:01:54.340
but you might need
to take liquidity.

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.090
Well, the thing blew up and
I need to take liquidity,

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:59.160
I'm screwed because we
do it at the bottom.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.100
But if you generally
don't need to touch

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.780
this thing for a long time
and you have the discipline

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:07.590
to deal with the fact it's
going to go all over the place,

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:10.250
you should have
less diversifiers

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:13.680
and exploit your long
duration capability.

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.510
But you've got to make sure
you're mentally wired to know

01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:17.980
what you're about to get into.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.910
But yeah, you wouldn't
want to do this.

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:22.910
It's like a young person that
doesn't need that capital

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:25.450
for 30 or 40 years.

01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:27.653
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:27.653 --> 01:02:31.170
So some of us who have investing
by buying Berkshire Hathaway

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:31.670
stocks?

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:33.380
WESLEY GRAY: By buying what?

01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.881
AUDIENCE: Berkshire
Hathaway stocks.

01:02:34.881 --> 01:02:35.880
WESLEY GRAY: What is it?

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.850
AUDIENCE: Berkshire.

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:37.975
WESLEY GRAY: Oh, Berkshire.

01:02:37.975 --> 01:02:39.158
Yeah, yeah, got it.

01:02:39.158 --> 01:02:40.658
AUDIENCE: And then
they see the news

01:02:40.658 --> 01:02:45.580
that Warren Buffet himself says
that OK, for my [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.620
I leave some and I will
leave it in [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.370
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah.

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:52.120
AUDIENCE: Then [INAUDIBLE]
or are they simply buying

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.370
a simplified [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.380
So out of these two
models which one

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.872
do you think more-- [INAUDIBLE]
passive value investment?

01:02:59.872 --> 01:03:05.180
WESLEY GRAY: Well, it
all comes down to this.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:08.970
Because if you're
going to be active,

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:12.390
if you're not wired
to deal with pain,

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:14.520
you're going to be the
worst active investor ever.

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:18.880
So the vast majority of
people should just not

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.830
pay all these extra fees for all
these crazy marketed products.

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:23.890
It's all crap.

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:27.826
You can buy it way cheaper, more
effectively at Vanguard, right?

01:03:27.826 --> 01:03:29.450
And you don't have
a psychology problem

01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:31.324
because the market's
down 30, you're down 30,

01:03:31.324 --> 01:03:34.350
you're just like, well whatever,
I'm relatively good to go.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:37.630
The minute go on
active angle, you

01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:41.830
take on a whole new level
of psychology problems.

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:43.179
And that's why it works.

01:03:43.179 --> 01:03:44.970
Because now you're in
this competitive game

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:48.650
where you've got to be that
weird, wired person that

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:50.330
does crazy stuff.

01:03:50.330 --> 01:03:53.910
And be willing to be the
bag holder at maximum pain.

01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:56.490
Because then you'll capture
all the rents of this active

01:03:56.490 --> 01:03:59.780
strategy where all the people
that don't have that discipline

01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:00.600
can't.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.740
It's all about that
relativeness which seems

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:04.510
to drive this risk premium.

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:08.610
So Warren Buffett says this
because he understands this.

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:10.900
And he knows that
unless you're wired

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:14.530
to deal with years of just
looking like an idiot,

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:17.730
you're way better off
being a passive person.

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:19.500
Because otherwise
you are going to sell

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.450
at the worst possible time.

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:23.710
So that's why he makes
that recommendation.

01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:25.760
That's why I make
that recommendation.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.150
This is not for everyone.

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:28.250
It's the worst.

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:32.470
It gives you like balding
gray hair like I got, right?

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:34.760
If you want to be
chilling out on the beach

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.890
and not worry about life, just
go buy your Vanguard funds

01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:40.240
and chill out and you
keep your hair nice.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.580
It'll stay brown and you
don't have to worry about it.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.430
Active investing is going
to make you go insane.

01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:47.430
And that's probably why
you get a risk premium--

01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:48.710
because it sucks.

01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:51.370
You know it's terrible.

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.430
But that's life.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.672
Markets are not
efficient in the sense

01:04:54.672 --> 01:04:56.820
that prices always
reflect fundamentals.

01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:58.830
But they're insanely
competitive.

01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:00.690
So it's not like
money grows on trees.

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:03.544
There's always a
premium and a cost.

01:05:03.544 --> 01:05:04.960
And it's just a
matter of like, am

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.860
I suited to take this cost
better than the person offering

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.510
that risk premium to me.

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:13.310
And value people earn that
because they're usually weird.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:16.990
They can feel like an idiot at
the cocktail party and be like,

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:18.270
I don't care.

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:22.220
A lot of people
can't do that, so.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:23.340
We'll go over here.

01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.286
Sir?

01:05:24.286 --> 01:05:25.910
AUDIENCE: So I have
a couple questions.

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:27.210
Number one is are
there any funds

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:28.959
out there that are
capturing that momentum

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.360
premium you were talking about?

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.370
WESLEY GRAY: There are.

01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:38.220
I don't want to talk my book
here but here's the thing.

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.230
Another thing to understand
about active management

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:44.460
is there's the business
of active manager, right?

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:47.240
And if I'm a large
institutional firm--

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:50.630
and really I get paid
on just assets-- when

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:54.380
I'm designing a product,
most products that work

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.430
are going to have some
scalability issue.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:58.600
Momentum is a perfect
example where momentum,

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.590
to get it to be
effective, it has

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.850
to have relatively
high turnover, right?

01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:04.990
That's how that system works.

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:07.140
But the problem with the
relatively high turnover

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.480
is its relatively
high frictional costs.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:13.420
So if I try to jam a billion
dollars into this thing,

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:16.200
I can design the
program one way.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.920
If I need to jam $20
billion in this program,

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:23.090
I need to maybe need to
diversify and dilute this thing

01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:25.600
out so it can take on capacity.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:28.020
Which is now a
business decision,

01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.620
not necessarily
like an optimize,

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:33.610
capture the premium
over time decision.

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:36.282
And so just when
you buy products,

01:06:36.282 --> 01:06:38.240
think through the economics
of the manufacturer

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.570
of that product.

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:41.940
Are they building
this for performance.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.770
Or are they building
this for scalability

01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:47.040
and to try to jam as many
assets into it as possible.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.770
And because markets at the
margin are insanely efficient,

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:52.780
the meaning is
like Buffett says,

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:57.170
if you gave us $20, $30 billion,
you'd want to fire us, right?

01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:00.150
Because we can't do
active, weird things

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:02.650
anymore because you've
got to jam too much money

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:03.960
through the same door.

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.890
And so yeah, that's the problem.

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:09.700
When you're looking
at products, like

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:14.504
understand the situation of that
manufacturer of this product.

01:07:14.504 --> 01:07:15.920
Are they trying
to build something

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.230
that works in
expectation or are they

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:20.530
trying to form a
portfolio where they just

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:23.510
go and have a bunch of salesman
jam it down your throat,

01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:26.830
but it can take on like
$20 billion, right?

01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:30.070
And maybe you, as the buyer
of that product-- everything's

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:32.930
called momentum,
everything's called value,

01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:36.070
but the construction of
these things matters a lot.

01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:37.770
Because the name
doesn't mean anything.

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:41.860
It's really about what's the
engineering of the product.

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.430
Yeah so there's definitely
momentum things out there

01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:45.130
and we do that.

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:47.810
But I don't want to-- I mean
you we're all about education,

01:07:47.810 --> 01:07:50.640
go learn on your own
and we can talk offline.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:54.160
But there are some
people-- Alpha Architect--

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.460
that is trying to build like,
generally intellectually

01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.180
honest products that
have limited scalability.

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.110
And we're trying to do them like
the intellectually honest way.

01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:05.840
And we just tell
people like, this

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.620
is going to suck sometimes.

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:09.380
But if you have a
horizon duration,

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:11.870
this is at least the honest
way to go about this.

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:14.924
But unless you're wired to do
that, you shouldn't to do that.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.090
But not many people do it
because they'd rather just

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:20.560
raise like 100 billion assets
and charge a lot of money

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.549
for it.

01:08:21.549 --> 01:08:22.229
So.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:24.770
AUDIENCE: All right, so the next
question is related to that.

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:27.149
Which is that some
strategies just suck.

01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:28.840
Other strategies
are good, but they

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.069
are going to suck at times.

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:31.110
How do you differentiate?

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:36.153
WESLEY GRAY: Well let me
step back here, actually.

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.550
There's two worlds
out there, right?

01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:45.649
There's the investment
horizon game, which

01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:47.310
is what I'm talking about here.

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:49.970
There actually is
another game out there

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:52.040
of the best poker player game.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.279
This is a real game.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:55.930
It's like proprietary
trading hedge funds

01:08:55.930 --> 01:09:00.960
where there are strategies you
can devise with a ton of work.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.130
Where you get some
competitive information edge

01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:05.260
where in the short
term, it's actually

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:07.580
like a true edge, right?

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.910
They always have
capacity constraints.

01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:11.930
And they may not
even be that painful.

01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:14.460
But the issue there is
that's the trading business.

01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.293
You're always having
to adapt because you're

01:09:16.293 --> 01:09:18.630
competing against all
the Google people, right?

01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:21.620
And all the physics PhDs--
where you find a system,

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.119
it works for a while,
all of a sudden

01:09:24.119 --> 01:09:26.410
it's actually not even painful
because you can leverage

01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:27.700
out and make a lot of money.

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.040
But it starts to decay.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.359
And you can always be on the R&amp;D
game of inventing the next best

01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:33.470
trading strategy.

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:36.450
Those aren't sustainable
opportunities.

01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:38.760
They're not painful
and they work,

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.010
but that's different business.

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.220
That's the trading business.

01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:45.630
Back to here, basically
the way to look at it--

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:51.050
the more pain and the more
delegated asset managers

01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:54.189
would not want to do
this, in expectation

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.790
that's probably going to
work better at the margin.

01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:59.350
So whatever strategy
to do, if it's

01:09:59.350 --> 01:10:02.340
less full on a
relative tracking--

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.840
like it attracts
index with less pain--

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:07.660
it's going to generally
work less well.

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.550
It's just a general rule
because of competition.

01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:13.240
If it's less painful and
there's less likelihood

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.710
of getting fired,
it's probably not

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:18.890
going to have as much kind
of career risk premium built

01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:19.660
into it.

01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.140
Where if it's more painful,
and it's more likely

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:26.560
the delegated asset
manager gets fired,

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.240
you're going to capture a
bigger career risk premium.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.400
And so it's not that
ones good or bad.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.280
It's really about pick
your poison essentially--

01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.970
is what I would say.

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:40.960
So it just depends how much
bang you want for your book.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.380
And if you're better suited to
take careers pain than maybe

01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:46.140
other people are.

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:48.900
And DIY people are very
well-suited to take career risk

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.510
pain because you can't
fire yourself, right?

01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:55.710
So that's why disintermediation
is a beautiful thing.

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:58.350
Because if you're Google
engineer and you sit here,

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:01.815
like learn about all this stuff,
and you have the real horizon,

01:11:01.815 --> 01:11:03.190
and you understand
how and why it

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:08.160
m you're in the perfect
position to take on career risk.

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.100
Because it's not priced for you.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:14.170
It's priced for delegated asset
managers, not as an individual.

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:15.490
You can just eat it.

01:11:15.490 --> 01:11:18.270
Because what are you going
to do, fire yourself?

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:21.065
You can capture that
premium better than anyone

01:11:21.065 --> 01:11:22.690
but the problem is
you've got to invest

01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:24.430
a lot of time and
knowledge and education

01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:28.630
and figure out how it works, so.

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:30.358
Sir?

01:11:30.358 --> 01:11:33.921
AUDIENCE: Regarding
individual investors,

01:11:33.921 --> 01:11:35.546
it seems like the
general strategy here

01:11:35.546 --> 01:11:37.416
is that because a lot
of people [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.205
But given the size of the
institutional [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:43.205 --> 01:11:45.990
component of [INAUDIBLE] is
it a reasonable expectation

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:50.395
that a smart person could
outsmart that on average?

01:11:50.395 --> 01:11:52.174
Like the distribution
of investors

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:53.882
seems like it'd be a
wide range of people

01:11:53.882 --> 01:11:56.010
losing money and making
money in that process.

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:58.150
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah, there
is a huge wide range.

01:11:58.150 --> 01:12:01.530
But again, it goes
back to-- I believe

01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:04.190
there's supposed to be,
in theory, like risk

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:06.880
premiums associated with
taking on risk, right?

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.390
Equity risk premium, you don't
know what's going to happen.

01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:12.540
I think embedded in a lot
of strategies and algorithms

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:14.190
is career risk premium.

01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:17.170
Because the people that manage
the billions and hundreds

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:21.030
of billions of dollars, they
need to maintain that business.

01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:22.810
And they know that
if you deviate

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:26.020
a small amount from an index,
you're not going to get fired.

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.800
So you can earn a
little marginal spread

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.270
over the Vanguard
guys because you

01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:32.100
can charge higher for
effectively what they're doing.

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.230
And that's a great
business decision.

01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:36.280
Take minimal career
risk, make it

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.800
a little bit different but
never too much different,

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.470
because you can lose your AUN
and lose your whole business

01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:42.820
model.

01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:45.220
But as you get strategies
that get further and further

01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:48.890
away where they can go 10%
under the index, 10% over

01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:52.500
and go crazy, there's going
to be a premium there.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.790
Because the marginal
price setter

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.680
is these institutions that
are the smart poker players.

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.260
And they all know this
too they just won't do it

01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:01.850
because it's too risky.

01:13:01.850 --> 01:13:05.480
And their client base
is not hyper educated

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.110
and they're not Warren Buffet's,
they're like mom and pops

01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:10.180
who look at their
statement are like,

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:13.580
what, three years down, like
this guys out here and sell it.

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:16.280
So there's a premium
I think that's priced

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:20.040
in systems and strategies that
basically eat career risk.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.790
Because the marginal
price setters

01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:23.849
are the smart poker
players in the world.

01:13:23.849 --> 01:13:25.390
And they don't want
to eat that risk.

01:13:25.390 --> 01:13:28.031
Because that's painful and they
like to keep their business,

01:13:28.031 --> 01:13:28.530
right?

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:31.570
And that's just I think
the equilibrium that

01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:32.487
actually has happened.

01:13:32.487 --> 01:13:34.653
AUDIENCE: Since there is a
model like, because we're

01:13:34.653 --> 01:13:37.061
an individual that won't
lose their job over this

01:13:37.061 --> 01:13:38.686
necessarily, you can
take greater risks

01:13:38.686 --> 01:13:40.480
than an institutional investor--

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:43.460
WESLEY GRAY: You can
take greater career risk.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:47.540
Because remember, there's real
risk, which in theory, like

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.740
in economics, is how like
the risk is correlated

01:13:50.740 --> 01:13:52.530
with like your
consumption over time

01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:55.700
or whatever wacky
macroeconomic model.

01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.950
But you're a position
to take the career

01:13:57.950 --> 01:14:00.100
risk, which is relative risk.

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:02.540
So I always tell people,
imagine you're an alien.

01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:05.880
And you land on
the world in 1927.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.200
And the alien's like,
I got two options.

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:11.020
I can buy this S&amp;P
thing that makes

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.640
9% a year with an 80% drawdown
or whatever it is, right?

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.120
You can buy this other thing
called value and it makes,

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.570
let's say 12% a year
at 80% drawdowns.

01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:24.950
The alien, who doesn't care
about what S&amp;P because he's not

01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:27.380
benchmarking or whatever,
he's like, well yeah,

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.250
do this other one, of course.

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:33.220
But if the alien is now
a delegated agent working

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:37.130
on behalf of others and he's
benchmarked against that S&amp;P

01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:40.340
products, and he has
now a business reason

01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:43.460
to like kind of not deviate
too much from that, in theory,

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:45.960
he would be all in on
this value strategy.

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:48.300
But because there's
this pricing,

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.510
he's always benchmarked
against S&amp;P,

01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:53.810
he's going to price
that at some level.

01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:57.050
Because that's painful if
he deviates too far away.

01:14:57.050 --> 01:14:59.590
So it's all about
the relativeness that

01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:04.140
build the relative tracking
error in this career

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:07.400
risk associated with being
a delegated asset manager.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.990
That gets priced because the
marginal price setter embeds

01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:14.280
a career risk premium that
shouldn't be priced in theory

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.720
like in an economic model.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.140
But it is priced because
there's so much delegated

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:19.320
asset management.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:23.030
And you don't want to be
the weirdo that gets fired.

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:25.910
And an individual doesn't
care about that risk premium

01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:27.380
because who cares.

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:30.440
Like I don't care
about relativeness.

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.324
Or you shouldn't.

01:15:31.324 --> 01:15:33.240
You should just care
about absolute after tax,

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:36.690
after fee risk adjusted returns.

01:15:36.690 --> 01:15:38.590
So you're just in
a position to be

01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:42.020
able to exploit that basically.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.034
Yeah?

01:15:43.034 --> 01:15:44.450
AUDIENCE: So on
the 60-40 question

01:15:44.450 --> 01:15:46.880
that was asked earlier,
every once in awhile,

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.670
although rarely,
but every once in

01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:50.514
a while I see an
article or graph that

01:15:50.514 --> 01:15:52.430
intends to prove that
some kind of rebalancing

01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:54.372
like yearly or
quarterly or whatever

01:15:54.372 --> 01:15:59.360
actually ends up better than the
60-40 model than [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.844
Is that unlucky?

01:16:00.844 --> 01:16:03.826
Lucky for them, unlucky
for us data points?

01:16:03.826 --> 01:16:05.492
Or is there any
sustainable [INAUDIBLE]?

01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:12.280
WESLEY GRAY: I think
again, this is where

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.192
the danger zone is of DIY.

01:16:15.192 --> 01:16:17.990
The answer is yes,
there could be.

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:21.910
The problem is the minute
you start adding complexity,

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:24.060
assuming you're not
going to do it yourself,

01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:26.400
there's a huge
risk that you start

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:30.190
adding one layer of complexity
that maybe adds value.

01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:32.435
But then people
need to spin that

01:16:32.435 --> 01:16:33.980
and make that insanely complex.

01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:37.410
And you pay a lot of money
in it, eat a lot of taxes,

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:39.920
and on net it
wasn't a good idea.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.320
So can you add things like
this, like smarter rebalances

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.350
are more complex
programs where you

01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:51.480
could find a robust genuine
effect that works better.

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.700
Yes.

01:16:52.700 --> 01:16:56.900
The problem is how do you
identify what is the signal

01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:59.140
and what was the
noise, especially

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:01.430
after all the fees and
additional things that

01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:04.560
usually will come with
a whiz-bang mouse trap.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.490
So yeah, maybe it adds 50
basis points a year, let's say.

01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:10.240
Or let's say you have a cooler
rebalance program that's

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.070
more systematic and exploits
some sort of anomaly

01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:15.040
or whatever and it works.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.650
The problem is it may
have a real genuine edge,

01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:20.000
but after the taxes,
the frictional,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.050
and the cost of
accessing it because you

01:17:22.050 --> 01:17:26.430
have to pay the whiz-bang
smart PhD person on net,

01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:28.870
you would have probably
been better off just doing

01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:30.810
some plain vanilla thing.

01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:34.530
So it's more like an
optimization accounting

01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:37.480
for fees, brain damage, taxes.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.434
Whereas if you
operate in a vacuum,

01:17:39.434 --> 01:17:40.850
sure there's a lot
of great things

01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:43.310
you can do that have
insane complexity,

01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:47.830
but then you get into that
risk curve of-- because

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:51.040
of the salesmen, expert, they're
good at exploiting your bias

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.940
or good at telling you
great stories-- it's really

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.630
hard to start to differentiate.

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:59.630
Like, is this complexity
actually doing something for me

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:01.770
or is this just a
great sales pitch.

01:18:01.770 --> 01:18:04.370
And most of the time,
you end up paying

01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:06.170
a lot for the sales pitch.

01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:09.620
But the complexity didn't
actually add any value for it.

01:18:09.620 --> 01:18:12.740
But yes, certainly there's ways
to do better than everything

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:13.710
I've told you here.

01:18:13.710 --> 01:18:18.100
But the intent here is to
help a DIY person facilitate

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:21.580
a good after tax, after
fee outcome, if they

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:24.940
wanted to go down that path.

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:26.060
Sir?

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.207
AUDIENCE: To follow up
on that and clarify.

01:18:28.207 --> 01:18:32.650
If you have an immersification
[INAUDIBLE] diversifier

01:18:32.650 --> 01:18:33.150
[INAUDIBLE].

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.050
As you rebalance, you can
do like tax harvesting

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:42.840
[INAUDIBLE].

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:44.975
But if you're 100% equity
like a young person who

01:18:44.975 --> 01:18:46.350
doesn't care about
a diversifier,

01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:47.975
you lose that advantage.

01:18:47.975 --> 01:18:51.290
So what's the trade-off
there between [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.290
WESLEY GRAY: Well you
could still be 100% equity

01:18:53.290 --> 01:18:55.280
and still do tax loss
harvesting, right?

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.590
Why couldn't you do that?

01:18:57.590 --> 01:19:02.944
Because let's say you own
S&amp;P and it bombs out, sell

01:19:02.944 --> 01:19:05.110
it and buy it like at
something like 99% correlated,

01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:08.570
you still own S&amp;P but you
still booked your tax loss

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:09.786
harvesting error.

01:19:09.786 --> 01:19:12.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:17.160
WESLEY GRAY: Yeah but I
mean it's pretty obvious.

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:21.310
Like Russell 1000, S&amp;P
500, S&amp;P 450, and just

01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:23.510
go on Yahoo Finance
or Google Finance

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:26.690
and they have the
same chart path.

01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:28.840
So you can always
use Bloomberg or we

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:32.020
do like formally
but as a DIY person,

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.600
you know it's correlated because
you just map the charts over

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.330
and they look exactly the same,
that's probably a good tax

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:42.200
loss harvesting candidate.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.010
But you could do that
with an all equity.

01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:46.380
Just in general, think about it.

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:50.040
If I'm 60-40 in a vacuum,
and maybe an annual rebalance

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.600
to keep like the things in line.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:57.200
Bonds, like a 10 year bond,
the yield is whatever, 2%.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.880
That's what it's
going to earn if held

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.850
to maturity, effectively 2%.

01:20:00.850 --> 01:20:03.900
Whereas equities
usually have a component

01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:06.080
of what you can get for
free, which is the 10 year

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.180
bond, plus an equity risk
premium, which is usually

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:11.330
say 3% to 4% over time, right?

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:16.110
So just mechanically, equities,
if you're a long term holder,

01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:18.260
you're going to get
paid that risk premium.

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:19.780
Where if you add
the diversifiers,

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.034
which have low
expectations, they're

01:20:22.034 --> 01:20:23.575
great because they
help you diversify

01:20:23.575 --> 01:20:26.250
and that's why you're
taking a lower expectation.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:28.990
But you just want to rip it
and get the highest [INAUDIBLE]

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:29.510
possible.

01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:31.920
You don't care about risk
because you've literally

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:33.940
got a 30 year horizon.

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:35.920
The argument is
why would you have

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.600
more diversifiers
which lower expectation

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:40.307
if you don't need to pay up.

01:20:40.307 --> 01:20:41.390
Because you want the risk.

01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:44.520
Because you want to just
bang it out of the park.

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:47.240
So you may want to tilt
out on the risk curve.

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:49.720
But it just depends though.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.570
If you can't handle
that, then you

01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:53.620
might need diversifiers
just to make sure

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:56.170
you stay with some equity.

01:20:56.170 --> 01:20:58.900
Because some people go
into equity, it blows up,

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:02.110
they sell all of it and
of course it bounces back.

01:21:02.110 --> 01:21:05.560
So it's all about the psychology
of investing and doing

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.240
things that help you
stick to a process.

01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:13.427
AUDIENCE: So it says right
there, active is simple

01:21:13.427 --> 01:21:14.302
but it can't be easy.

01:21:14.302 --> 01:21:16.438
And I think you
mentioned that you have

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:19.730
to be ready to take some pain.

01:21:19.730 --> 01:21:21.930
WESLEY GRAY: Relative pain.

01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:24.645
AUDIENCE: If you look at
the equity curves instead

01:21:24.645 --> 01:21:27.696
of the RAA system and
[INAUDIBLE] TAA system

01:21:27.696 --> 01:21:29.680
and dual equity
and dual momentum,

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.982
they are like beautiful
equity curves.

01:21:31.982 --> 01:21:34.010
Like low drawback.

01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:36.014
How do those kind of--

01:21:36.014 --> 01:21:38.430
WESLEY GRAY: So when you start
in like the trend following

01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:40.142
world-- I didn't
talk about the here

01:21:40.142 --> 01:21:41.600
because it's a
whole other-- we can

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.110
talk for a whole day on that.

01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:46.990
Trend following, this
is another thing.

01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:49.095
Coming out of Chicago,
I was like, what

01:21:49.095 --> 01:21:50.220
are you guys talking about.

01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:53.210
Technical-- this is
the dumbest idea ever.

01:21:53.210 --> 01:21:55.950
But at some point, you've
got to break from religion

01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:59.610
and start getting back to
evidence-based decision making.

01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:01.960
And long-term trend
following is very

01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.407
clear over a long horizons.

01:22:04.407 --> 01:22:06.740
And we could give you a whole
lecture about the behavior

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:07.980
of it, why it works.

01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:10.780
And I agree, those charts
look kind of smooth.

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:13.870
But that's because you're seeing
the chart over a long horizon.

01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:17.419
When you start zooming in,
there's a lot of whipsaws.

01:22:17.419 --> 01:22:19.460
So there's a lot of
opportunities where the trend

01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.240
rule says, hey go to cash.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.450
And the market goes
ripping higher you're like,

01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:25.660
wow I'm an idiot and you
want to give up on it.

01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:28.510
And also,
trend-following rules are

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:30.900
great because they do
protect that drawdown.

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:34.190
But again, going back to
the relative risk premium,

01:22:34.190 --> 01:22:36.830
that I think is
price and securities,

01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:38.510
in an absolute sense,
if you could say,

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:41.390
hey I'm going to deliver you
S&amp;P with half the drawdown,

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:44.500
they'll be like well yeah,
why wouldn't you do that.

01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:46.890
But then you go to
the real marketplace

01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:49.570
and sometimes, even though
you're delivering that S&amp;P

01:22:49.570 --> 01:22:52.450
with half the drawdown,
you may be in cash

01:22:52.450 --> 01:22:54.850
when S&amp;P goes up 30%.

01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:57.210
And you're going to feel
like a big idiot and think,

01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:59.010
this trend-following
stuff doesn't

01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:00.900
work, why would I ever do this.

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.880
And a lot of delegate asset
managers think that too.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:06.260
Because it's all
about staying power

01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:09.360
to a process in the system that
where you do your research,

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:13.680
you try to understand like
why does trend following work.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.000
And I can tell you I think
it's dynamic risk aversion.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.360
And we could do a
whole lecture on that.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.400
So there's reasons why I
think long-term trend works.

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.220
And there's definitely reasons
why other people don't do it.

01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:29.350
Imagine a mutual fund
manager or a delegate asset

01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:34.130
manager or even yourself where
you sit in cash sometimes.

01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:37.060
Meanwhile, the market
goes on a ripping run,

01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:39.796
you're going to lose
your entire business.

01:23:39.796 --> 01:23:40.920
So that doesn't make sense.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:43.700
It's much better just
to go with the crowd

01:23:43.700 --> 01:23:44.700
and follow the lemmings.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:49.090
Because when you're down
30, maybe you're down 29,

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.470
you're not going to get fired.

01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:55.000
Whereas if you're just flat
and the markets on a 30% rager,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.570
and they're like, you
you're in cash and bonds.

01:23:57.570 --> 01:23:59.240
You're gone you're out of here.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.200
And then of course, people
have short memories.

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:05.120
So trend-following is real hot
in '08 and those guys raised

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.240
a ton of money because it
saved them from the draw down.

01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:09.900
But now they've
all underperformed

01:24:09.900 --> 01:24:13.230
because we haven't had a big
face-ripping draw down yet.

01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:16.500
But guess what, everyone hates
trend following right now.

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.070
They're like, oh this is stupid.

01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:20.900
It whipsaws all the
time, doesn't work.

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:23.660
Bunch of idiots data mining.

01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:26.570
What will happen when we
have another 50% drawdown

01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:29.010
and the thing protects
you from half of it.

01:24:29.010 --> 01:24:31.680
Everyone's going to
love trend-following,

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:33.420
it's just the cycle of life.

01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:37.690
It's just investing,
it's how it works.

01:24:37.690 --> 01:24:39.830
And It's all about the backtest.

01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:41.510
See if they value momentum.

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:44.250
If you look at the chart, you're
like, who wouldn't do that.

01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:47.780
But you start zooming in and you
look at these relative periods

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:49.900
where real time
you underperformed

01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:54.290
by two or three years,
like who can stick to that.

01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:57.115
And all these programs
are like that.
