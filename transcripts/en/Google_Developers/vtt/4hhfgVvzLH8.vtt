VACHARA: Hi, my name is Vachara from Computerology.

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.000
I develop applications using Google Maps API.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.500
[TRANSLATED FROM THAI] We developed many applications that connect to various platforms.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Google Maps API is one of our favorites.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.200
I would like to show you an application where we use the Google Maps API

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.500
Service Point System for Siam Commercial Bank.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.500
Siam Commercial Bank is one of the biggest banks in Thailand.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.800
There are approximately 7,000 ATM service points all over in Thailand.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:45.400
We developed this application to display information about branches, ATMs, and money exchange service points.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Users can search by specifying by province district, operation time, or zip code.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Moreover, for the organization's look and feel, we used Styled Maps to change the color of the map.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
One of our interesting applications is "Check Elevation".

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Last year, Thailand had trouble with a flooding crisis in all regions of central Thailand, including Bangkok.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.500
To help people in flood areas, we developed a system based on Google Maps and the Elevation API.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Users of the application can check the elevation of an area.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
For example, flooding in Sutthisan.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
When we check the Sutthisan area, Sutthisan is 3.86m high.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But if your home is located on Intamara Street, that has an elevation of 3.33m.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
When compared to the area, which is almost the same height,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
this means you have a chance to get affected by flood.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.500
You can share information to Twitter or Facebook if you are in danger.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.000
[ENGLISH] What I like about working with Google Maps API is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.800
being able to bring the world's information into my application.
