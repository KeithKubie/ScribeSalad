00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.740
Welcome back guys!

00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.580
Thanks for joining me today here on the king of random

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.180
Today's the big one we're finally going to be firing off

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.580
our flamethrower

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.099
We have two videos showing you how we built this flamethrower using a tank, some Co2,

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.549
a pressure washer handle and a propane torch to turn it into a flamethrower. Today we're gonna fuel it up and fire it off

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.270
For anyone who missed the build videos we'll review really quickly how this works

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.520
The Co2 cannister attaches to this nozzle here and when we open both valves our tank can fill with pressure

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.260
This tank will be holding our fuel mixture of 80% gasoline and 20% diesel.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.780
The pressure from the Co2 will drive the fuel out the bottom of the tank

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.600
through the hose and into our power washer handle. Blowing the trigger on the handle lets the pressurized fuel fly through the power washer out

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.910
The nozzle we've added and then we'll ignite it using this propane torch we have several of these Co2

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.709
canisters which are usually used for powering paintball guns but they will work great for this as well

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.739
we're using carbon dioxide instead of compressed air

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.759
because it's extremely non flammable, it actually puts out flames this is just a safety precaution in case the flames try to travel up the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.269
fuel and into our nozzle

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:04.989
There will be

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.308
CO2 spraying out with the fuel putting out any flames they get too close to the nozzle (sigh) the red cans have gasoline, the yellow can

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.799
Has diesel and we're going to make a mixture of 80% gas

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.860
20% diesel and that's gonna be our fuel for the flamethrower as an added safety measure we have a large co2 fire

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.049
extinguisher and i'm wearing a genuine

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.299
fireman's coat just to protect myself from the heat as you can see i'm mostly surrounded by dead and dry plants and i don't want

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.569
To accidentally light stuff on fire so we've got a concrete bunker( that might explain why he is demonstrating the flamethrower now after a loong time) that we're gonna shoot

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.369
Into and that should safely contain our fire let's fill up our tank charge it with co2 and give it a test shot

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.960
since i can't actually see inside the tank i'm really just kind of estimating how much gasoline and how much diesel to put in

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.660
*is there an ant in there?* right our tank is fueled up now let's add our co2

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.200
Opening this valve oh made a little popping noise hurt a little pressure change now we've pressured from the tank to the valve

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.409
When we open this valve it will add pressure, to the main tank

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:22.089
Funky noise alright and with that our flamethrower should be ready to go let's strap it on and try it out, oh

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.609
it's thing weighs a million pounds

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.060
Quick observation our gun appears to be leaking we have?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.169
test-fired with this nozzle before with just water and it didn't do that so

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.349
i'm a little concerned about why it is doing it now i

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.750
Don't know it's leaking it's pressurized and sleeping so that's not great but i'm still gonna try it

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.988
For you for my first shot i'm not going, to add the flame from my propane i'm going to shoot

00:02:52.988 --> 00:02:57.360
The fuel out of the nozzle but not ignite it just, to see how it travels here goes

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.380
( what daaaa...)Huh!

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.160
well it's certainly spraying i did think it was going to travel in more of an arc kind of like a squirt gun

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:12.789
But this just kind of a price is in the air i wonder if it's just cuz there's so much pressure i don't

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.969
see why that should stop us from lighting on fire let's see how it goes alright

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.819
test shot with fire

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.859
Three two one

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.849
HOLLY COW (not literally..)

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.790
fireball that's amazing oh

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.220
HOLY COW that is fantastic (*Halloween?*)

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.100
it still isn't squirting the way i thought it would when you think of a flamethrower i think most people imagine a squirt of flame

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.090
flying through the air and landing on the ground maybe soaking everything around it and fire

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.360
This isn't doing that it's also doing this i don't know what is causing this to happen i think something in our valve is not

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.990
working very well

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.169
pulsing out that's definitely not ideal

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.780
I'll keep an eye on that and in the meantime

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.729
i'm gonna shoot, the flamethrower more all right let's try this again three two one

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.510
That's amazing

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.889
My shoes have gasoline on them now i don't like that it doesn't make me feel safe

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.640
and it might be bad for them well let's just keep using it and tell them a lot of fuel then it won't trip anymore

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.260
oh *FAIL*

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.760
Doesn't matter fuel and i still have some co2

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.340
He fires i need to put out

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.979
now this tank is freezing cold your that

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.909
So when the gas inside the tank

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:05.160
expands to fill the larger tank it cools off a lot cooled off fast enough that the outside is just covered in frozen water vapor

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.329
The pressure washer handle that we had attached to our other gun began to malfunction

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.220
it would turn on when i squeeze the handle but it wouldn't turn off when i let go so it would just keep spraying all

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.300
of
the fuel and co2 in the tank i

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.760
Didn't want to be using a flamethrower that i didn't have the ability to turn off we actually have the same

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.059
Malfunctioning issue with two separate units of that particular spray handle so we do not recommend that you use it for this build or any

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.320
Other so we finished filming for the day and i went and got a new replacement handle at home depot

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.649
this one works well with all of our connections it actually even has a

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.779
quick-connect built into the back of it and the nozzle seems to be working out just fine as well i've tested this out with water

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.570
and it's spraying

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.809
beautifully you can see i've moved the propane tank to the side of handle that's because this one has more of an oblong shape and

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.789
The propane doesn't like to stay strapped on to the bottom of it the function is exactly the same it has a flame which ignites

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:52.080
the fuel it's just slightly off

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.890
To the side instead of directly underneath which our tank is ready it's fueled up it's got co2 giving you pressure let's test it out (gosh!,thought he was thomson for a moment)

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.340
that was sweet i think it went actually farther than before

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.900
and it's so warm like i can feel that on my face immediately i actually upgraded gloves to a

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:27.919
Something a little more rigid because before my hands would start getting hot just from the flame being squirted out that's amazing

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.510
The fireman's coat is doing an amazing job though i don't feel a thing

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.570
Anywhere i've got the coat now because i think it's gonna be a cool shot i'm just gonna shoot it inside the concrete bunker entirely

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:57.009
Got it

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.479
So far every time that I've used this I've opened the co2 tank and the valve into the main tank and I've just let it

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:09.008
pressurize it until i run out of fuel i'm gonna try something a little bit differently this time i'm gonna

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:09.789
Open the valve

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:14.919
To the main tank and then once the pressure has balanced i'm going to close it again i'm hoping that what happens is i get

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:19.568
more of a stream of the fuel and let's have a fine mist i've tested this exact set up with water

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:23.379
and it always comes out in a nice spray it shoots about 40 50 feet

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:27.309
water is hitting the ground and i was kind of hoping that would happen with the fuel as well

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:30.189
We'll see if changing the pressure makes any difference on that point?

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.789
Let's test this out with a different amount of pressure from the co2 tank

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:43.779
That is a lot more what i was expecting from the beginning i am afraid that the pressure is just gonna keep dropping as i'm

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:48.879
shooting and the flame will get closer and closer so once i don't feel like it's safe anymore i'm gonna turn it off i

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.180
Also might like the ground on fire now three two one?

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.620
that's definitely different

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.260
yeah, the grounds on fire we need to put that out

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.940
everything is on fire

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:29.630
That's interesting i would have thought that the pressure would have kept going down and we would have had less and less stream but as

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:34.640
I've been using it is just switched from squirting out to spraying out in a mist like it was when i had full pressure

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.780
and there goes try it again

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.439
That's the that's what you want, to see right there that's?

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.230
FYYAH!

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.520
Ha OOH! *not fighting*

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.060
That is one smoky dome a whole

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:24.119
Giant dome is basically full of smoke at this point there we go three full tank full of fuel on one tank of?

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:29.549
Carbon dioxide it's possible we could have even gotten the force but i did leave the small tank open this time just

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.039
To see how it affected things i do think that the lower pressure

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.119
helps use the fuel more efficiently it seems like it get a lot more burn time

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:41.669
when i open the tank and then close it off again for next test we're gonna actually light something on fire with a flamethrower

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:47.100
So i've stacked up a bunch of hay bales and we're gonna burn them three two one

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080
AHHHH

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.640
yeah!

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.640
those are burning pretty good and  filling the bunker with smoke way faster than the flamethrower did

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:20.780
Oh, when it collapses i'm gonna take credit for that i made it collapse as, ami

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.369
we've tested out our flamethrower and it worked great we've lit some stuff on fire and that was way fun so the last thing i

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.370
want to try

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.020
roasting a marshmallow

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.020
actually i'm gonna do three marshmallows (poor guyz)

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.570
All at once and this is a big flame

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.570
So we've got big marshmallows i do have a feeling that these marshmallows will end up a little well-done

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.680
FIRE IN THE HOLE!

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.790
*So well done* Just, the way i like them oh no starting, to sag he's gonna grip oh

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:15.380
there you have it a home-built flamethrower in all of its amazing glory we had a few different types of shots we had the fuel

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.900
aerosol eyes which made sort of a line of fireball

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:23.359
sometimes when we headed at lower pressure it squirted an in nice stream that was all on fire i really like that one because it

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.449
just
sort of lit everything on fire that it touched it was really cool

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:31.429
We used it to light some hay bales on fire and those went up in a flash and we also tried using it for cooking

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:32.430
which

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:38.630
didn't turn out so perfect i hope you've really enjoyed watching this flamethrower get used it was a ton of fun for me of course

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.200
if you go ahead and build one of these yourselves please take every possible safety

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:42.900
precaution

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.689
Fortunately i was able to get an actual fire coat which did an amazing job no matter how hot the flame was on my hands

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.910
Or my face i didn't feel a thing through the coat

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:56.030
always be aware of your surroundings don't use a flame thrower somewhere where you can light everything on fire we had a couple of times

00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:00.379
Where we lit a little bit of the grass on fire but we were carefully watching and we were able to put it out quickly

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:05.900
before it spread anywhere also be careful with your equipment our first spray handle malfunction and we weren't able to keep using it

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.950
i got another handle that worked much better

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:12.349
Even it had some problems where it would drip out of the end there are a couple of times the end of the gun actually

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.260
A little on fire

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:19.999
So just be a very aware of everything that's happening if your equipment have someone standing by that has wet towels and a fire extinguisher

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.190
to put anything out just in case there's a problem

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.810
There you have it i know a lot of you were very excited about this video (exhausted makin the captions...jk) and so was i this was

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.390
So much, fun to do and i think it looked amazing

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.650
thank you for joining us for this project today and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:48.380
Hmm don't show that make it seem like i eat it that's a lot of marshmallow

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.840
well there are some fuel left in

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.860
that right there is a little more well done than i like my marshmallow

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.260
turns out a flamethrower might not be the best tool for cooking

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.460
hey guys grant here just want to pop in with a quick update that the king of random brand is

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:16.020
expanding nate's here because you wanted more diy more variety more frequent videos and together we're all making that happen thanks for your support (And peace out from "chaoster61" ur caption guy...)
