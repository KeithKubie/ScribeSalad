00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.860
&gt;&gt; Susan Reyburn: Okay,
I'm Susan Reyburn,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.660
Curator of Baseball Americana.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.160
An exhibition currently running
here in the Jefferson Building,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.780
and continuing through
July of 2019.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.080
If you haven't had
a chance to check it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.980
out yet, I hope you will soon.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.090
Since we're talking about
Babe Ruth here today.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.390
I'll point out that the
exhibition has several items

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.950
related to The Big Fella.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.340
His playing shoes, an
incentive agreement he had

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.060
with the Yankees, a
1933 baseball card.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.150
And clips of him on
the, on the field.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.790
As well as his appearance
as himself

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.180
in the 1928 silent film classic,
Speedy, starring Harold Lloyd.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.900
Today we continue
with the second talk

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.700
in our three-part series on
New Baseball Publications.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.730
On Tuesday at noon, we'll
hear from David Rapp.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.750
Author of Tinker to Evers
to Chance: The Chicago Cubs

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.620
and the Dawn of Modern America.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.200
But this afternoon, the
library is very excited

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.010
to have with us Jane Leavy.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.930
Author of the highly-anticipated
new book, The Big Fella:

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.810
Babe Ruth and the
World He Created.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.070
It is available for sale
at the back of the room.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.200
And after the talk, Jane will
be on hand to sign copies.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.370
Then with your brand-new
book, head upstairs

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.830
and check out the exhibition.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.040
If you are a fan of baseball
and of beautifully-written

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.710
and deeply-researched
biographies,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.360
you are probably well
aware of our speaker today.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.030
Jane is the author
of highly-acclaimed,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.120
best-selling works on two other
towering baseball figures.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.130
Sammy Koufax and Mickey Mantle.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.220
And if you have not read A
Lefty's Legacy or The Last Boy,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.500
be sure to add them
to your reading list.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.390
She has also written
a novel, Squeeze Play,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.600
about a newspaper beat reporter
for the Washington Senators.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.530
Which drew on her
own experiences

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.130
as a Washington Post
sportswriter.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.450
At the Post from 1977 to 1988,
she covered baseball, tennis,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.500
the Olympics, as
well as pop culture.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.560
She is a graduate of the
Columbia University School

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.360
of Journalism and
her work has appeared

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.980
in numerous magazines
and anthologies.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.910
As for The Big Fella, Jane
spent eight years researching

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.210
and writing this book.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.270
A challenge not only
because Ruth lived large.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.000
And left behind an extensive
trail-blazing past full

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.820
of rabbit holes to explore.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.460
But if I may abruptly
jump to another metaphor.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.390
He represented a perfect storm.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.250
The coming together
of the best player

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.470
with the biggest
personality on the best team

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.480
on the largest stage in the
country's most popular sport.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.190
During an explosion of
media possibilities.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.050
No one else has ever occupied

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.390
that unique intersection
in American life.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.330
And who better than this
award-winning biographer

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.450
and lifelong fan
to tell his story?

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.870
Offering new insights just

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.350
when you thought
there was nothing more

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.940
that could be said
about Babe Ruth.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.510
So ladies and gentlemen,
Jane Leavy.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:48.870
[ Applause ]

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.690
&gt;&gt; Jane Leavy: I'm going
to steal what she just said

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.240
because it's better than I did.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.410
Wow! And I'm also
taking off my shoes.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.010
That's the next thing
that has to happen here.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.400
[Laughter] Oh!

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.130
Much better.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.430
So hi, everybody.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.160
Thanks for coming.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.640
I, she's taken a little
bit out of my speech.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.800
Hey, where's the clicker for
moving the pictures, guys?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.600
Anybody know?

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.140
[ Inaudible ]

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.750
I was going to say
some of that stuff.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.410
What you don't know
about me is this.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.530
I now hold a Major
League record.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.500
Which is for spending most
consecutive nights alone

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.800
with Babe Ruth.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.930
[Laughter] More certainly
than either of his wives

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.420
because he could leave them.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.230
And he couldn't get
away from me.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.380
And it took eight years of
intimate conversation between us

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.450
for me to figure out how
in God's name to tell a,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.020
not just a new story about him,
but to tell it in a new way.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.150
When I started out, I
had this image that's

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.820
up on the screen in mind.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.340
From the very, very beginning.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.480
It was taken by a
very famous fashion

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.040
and celebrity photographer
in 1922.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.810
At the Polo Grounds.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.140
And what enticed me about
it, aside from the fact

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.470
that by the way, the publisher
got permission to flip it.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.680
He actually was sitting
the other way.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.350
But it, they flipped it because
the big, the big box store said

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.980
if you have his face on the
right, our sticker's going

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.920
to go right in the
middle of his forehead.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.290
So they flipped the picture.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.610
Which I'm stunned the Estate
of Nickolas Muray agreed to.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.770
Nickolas Muray was a Hungarian
photographer and fencer

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.900
who would ultimately
die in a fencing match.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.720
But he was known for taking
pictures of people like Mar,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.630
Marlene Dietrich and F. Scott
Fitzgerald, and Claude Monet.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.710
And Frida Kahlo with whom
he began a ten-year affair

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.340
after taking her picture.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.420
So this was not the ordinary
guy Babe Ruth was used

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.580
to being shot by.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.080
This was a guy who
wasn't just looking

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.410
for the perfect mechanics of
his swing or his uplifted chin

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.390
as he headed down
the first base line.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.870
This was a guy who
was looking for him.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.990
And I think it took me a
while to realize it, but the,

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.440
the reason that the picture
means so much to me is

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.540
that it posed an
essential question.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.190
What is he trying to hide?

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.560
Look at how he's
holding himself in?

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.520
Now that hunch was
characteristic of him.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.190
And it became more so as he got
fatter and the belly went down.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.690
But even by then, and he's
relatively young there.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.960
Look at how much he's
protecting himself and look

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.620
at the size of his hand.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.280
Which frankly I had
to argue very forcibly

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.540
with the publisher
to show that much of.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.070
They wanted to obscure
the whole thing.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.630
And I said, "You
cannot have a picture

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.490
of The Big Fella
with The Big Fella.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.700
And not show the size
of that, that hand."

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.410
So that posed the question
from the very beginning.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.530
What's he trying to hide?

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.230
I spent a year, a whole
year, reading everything

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.530
that had been written.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.110
about him between hardcovers.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.630
And softcovers, and a lot
of the newspaper stuff too.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.140
Because I knew that the first
question was going to be,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.650
wherever I went, "Why in
God's name another biography

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.140
of Babe Ruth?"

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.660
And I was going to have to
find something new to say.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.420
And if there wasn't anything new
to say, I wasn't going to do it.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.450
So I read everything
there was about him.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.720
And what I discovered
was that there's no boy.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.710
There's no little George, the
name his parents gave him.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.730
In any of those biographies.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.390
He's a cipher.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.500
He doesn't exist.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.530
Now, I've been saying this line,

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.170
now it's really a
pleasure to say it here.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.100
If you tried to write a
biography of Winston Churchill

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.850
or God forbid, Donald Trump,
and left out his childhood,

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.950
you'd be laughed out
of this institution.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.120
You could not write what
would pass for biography

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.070
without somebody's childhood.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.150
And the formative
years that created,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.360
in this case, The Big Fella.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.600
But in sports biography, which
is sort of a weird sub-genre,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.770
what passed for biography
was really stories

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.540
about somebody's career.

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.570
Was the, was the life of a
career, not and an athlete.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.500
Not really the life of a person.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.550
So I knew that if I was going to
figure out who The Big Fella was

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.760
and how he became that person.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.670
I was going to have to
find that little boy.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.180
So, hoping this works.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.990
There he is.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.600
And what it says on
there, in his handwriting

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.450
because he autographed it
to somebody named Ethel, no,

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:10.510
Gertie, Herbie and Gertie.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.640
It says, "What a nice
little boy at age three.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.600
But now, wow."

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.830
Typical of him.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.580
Also the lack of grammar
was typical of him.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.280
He flouted expectation and
authority and governance

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.010
in every single way,
including grammatically.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:36.390
But if you look at that
little boy, look at his eyes.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.260
They're no different
than the ones

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.740
of The Big Fella you
just were looking at.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.910
And they're sad eyes.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.780
Now part of this is
just physiognomy.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.960
It's the set of his face.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.220
But it's not all physiognomy.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.380
And what's significant
about this picture

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.730
to me is that's a picture of a,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.550
a kid comes from a
fairly well-to-do family.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.300
People who were really
dead-broke

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.690
as his family has
always been described.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.260
Don't get posed like this at
age three in a frilly collar.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.570
So this, too, was a clue
to me that something

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.990
about the childhood,
the skimpy biography

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.400
of his childhood was way off.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:24.360
So there he is, and I'm walking
up and down in Baltimore.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.140
The street that he
took when he was sent

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.420
to St. Mary's Industrial
School in Baltimore

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.070
when he was just three
years older than this.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.420
That's part of the biography
that everybody knows.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.550
That he was sent off to what
is often called an orphanage.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:42.620
And that's why people
thought he was an orphan.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.920
He wasn't.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.100
Or sometimes they said
he was an incorrigible.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.100
That was a legal term
of [inaudible] meaning

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.570
that the court sent him.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.000
So he was a bad kid,
a wanton kid.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.550
A reckless, ungovernable
kid, hanging out on the,

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.880
in the foggy ar-- , areas
around the Baltimore harbor.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.150
That wasn't him either.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.260
And I figured if I'm going
to find out what it felt

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:13.600
like to be six, seven
years old and dispatched

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.350
to this reform school when
you do have two parents.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.470
I'm going to want to
know, I'm going to be able

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.170
to reproduce exactly
what he saw.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.210
As life as he knew
it disappeared.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.300
So I took pictures
from the B&amp;O Railroad

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.600
which has a great collection.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.510
Because their, their whole
installation was near that area.

00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:42.120
I took a 1902 insurance, Sanborn
map, Sanborn Insurance map.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.030
I took the cards, the index
cards that had been collected

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:51.660
by the Enoch Pratt Library in
Baltimore that describe what was

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.570
at every intersection
in Baltimore in 1902.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.890
And I walked up and down
West Lombard Street where,

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.600
according to Westbrook Pegler,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.650
his first ghost-written
biographer, autobiographer.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.160
Where he allegedly
took, with his daddy,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.700
the number nine streetcar when
his parents, hard-working,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:21.610
broke parents reluctantly,
tearfully, sent him off to live

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.450
with his Xaverian
Brothers, who ran St. Mary's.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.700
So I'm taking pictures, and
I've got this whole thing.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.770
And I go out Wilkins Avenue.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.060
And I'm getting out, and
I'm walking in places

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.880
that my kids don't want me
to walk because it's not

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.000
such a good area anymore.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.660
And I write the first
chapter of the book.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.780
I know this is the
beginning, right?

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.880
It's a formative
experience, being sent off.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.180
The trip from the home,

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.120
from home to the home is
the thing that created him.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:58.680
And then one day,
[inaudible] in August 2017,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.610
long after that chapter
was written.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.590
Up on my screen pops,
for no apparent reason,

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:09.160
a story about a Baltimore street
cop named Harry C. Birmingham.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.460
Somebody can look him up for me.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.240
I can't remember if he
was Patrolman 468 or 469,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.000
but he worked out of the
western district in Baltimore.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.530
And his area was the
bars along Camden Street

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.270
where George Herman Ruth,
Senior, ran a bar at the corner

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:30.050
of West Camden and
Packo, South Packo.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.740
Just a block away from the
train station that was the site

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:40.120
of commerce and tumult and
noise and industry in Baltimore.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.170
And I'm reading this story.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.440
This nice-looking guy
in his big, tall hat.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.560
And his Brilliantine moustache.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.860
And he looks great.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.820
And he says, You know
it was my pleasure

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.880
to take George Herman
Ruth, Junior,

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.530
out to St. Mary's
for his father.

00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:03.470
I didn't think a young boy
should be raised above a bar.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.670
Harry C was a teetotaler.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.200
He thought this was not a great
place for Babe Ruth to be.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.240
And so he volunteered because
George Herman Ruth, Senior,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.270
was an old friend of his.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:19.750
To take the boy away and
take him to St. Mary's.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.030
Well there goes the tearful
journey with daddy, right?

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:29.750
And what's more, he says, "He
was a mischievous kid, sure.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.080
But no more so than
any other boy.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.300
And he certainly never gave us,"

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.610
meaning the police,
"any trouble."

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.000
There goes the bad kid.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.100
So all the pillars on which the
biography, the accepted wisdom

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.300
about Babe Ruth was
built, disappeared.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.230
Just crumbled.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.760
So that meant I had
to start over.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.030
And I had to start doing
a whole lot more research.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.520
Because now I knew that
something had gone on in

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.630
that house and in that
childhood that I had

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.930
to get to the bottom of.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.120
Well one of the things
that's happened that people

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.980
in libraries know about.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.770
Is that the availability in
just really the last ten years,

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:19.570
I guess, of digitized
archives, newspaper archives

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.220
but also state archives.

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.660
With birth records,
death records,

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.060
divorce records, arrest records.

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:30.990
And probate wills, everything.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.670
Means that what I started
out thinking was going

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:37.140
to be a terrible
disadvantage to me

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.630
which is there was
nobody alive to talk to.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.810
Nobody presently alive, as
Casey Stengel might have put it.

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:49.450
[Laughter] Was not the
disadvantage that I had feared.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.540
Because what I had access
to that Robert Kramer,

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:59.700
Marshall Smeltzer, Robert Smith,
Cal Wagenheim, Tom Meeney,

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.740
and last but not
least, Lee Steinberg.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.040
Not Lee Steinberg,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.780
Lee what's-his-name,
Lee Montville, sorry.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.140
Couldn't get access
to was the following.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.900
Babe Ruth's parents
were divorced.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.420
Babe Ruth's father,
George Sr., found his wife,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.850
and this is a direct quote from
the deposition of the divorce.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.150
He found his wife with his
bartender, also named George,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.030
on the, quote, dinging
room floor.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.760
And he accused his
wife, and she admitted

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.500
to [door slam] oop, sorry.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:41.320
Trading sexual favors for booze.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.950
Kate Ruth apparently
had an alcohol problem.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.730
George Ruth filed for
divorce immediately,

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:52.240
two days, month after.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.040
It was advertised in
the Baltimore Sun.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.090
"I will no longer, I am
no longer responsible

00:15:58.090 --> 00:15:59.790
for Katie Ruth's debts."

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:07.390
Period. When the divorce was
finalized on May 6, 1906,

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.100
it was published in
the Baltimore Sun,

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.910
the Baltimore American.

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.960
Now what tells you
is George Ruth,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.680
Sr. was a pretty prominent guy.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.370
He wasn't this, you know,
slug of a poor bartender.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.140
He was important enough
to have his divorce be

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.060
on a page of the newspaper.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.850
So suddenly, it's like you
know, all you remember,

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.780
when we had those
kaleidoscopes, in childhood?

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.610
We're all old here, so you
know, those cardboard things?

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.940
[Laughter] With the pieces
of glass that would just sort

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.460
of tumble and fall into place?

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.720
That's what that
moment was like.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.750
It was oh my god.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:54.650
He suddenly makes sense.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.610
Also in those records
were the birth

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.200
and death records
of his siblings.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.260
Now his sister Mamie,
who was the only one

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.190
who survived to adulthood.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.280
Always said that Kate Ruth
gave birth to eight kids.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.900
I could not find
the set of twin,

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.650
twin boys she said were born.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:15.720
But I could find
these six other kids.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.780
Of those six kids, four died.

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.510
Two of starvation.

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:26.660
And little George
Ruth, that kid,

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:29.860
watched his brothers
and sisters die.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.890
One by one by one.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:37.340
And despite watching them
die, he was still sent away.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.940
So what are you going to think?

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.010
You're seven years old, not
eight, as his mother told him.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.950
Because she got his,
his birthdate wrong.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:53.350
You're going to think, what
did I do to deserve this?

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:58.970
You got two children left,
and you still don't want me?

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.620
So off he goes to St. Mary's.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:05.940
Where he is raised in
dormitories with hundreds

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.100
of boys, 130 boys on one
floor of a dormitory.

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.140
That was made for 90.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.510
They slept in wrought iron cots.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:19.560
Head to toe, with just enough
room between the rows which kind

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.470
of looked like pinstripes,
frankly.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.410
For a bentwood chair,
and to get at,

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.200
down on your hands
and knees and pray.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:33.230
There's not room for a
single personal item.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.140
There's no deviation
in any of the beds.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.990
They look exactly the same.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:42.200
These kids ate together,
slept together,

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.830
went through puberty together,

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.560
and they played baseball
together.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.330
Because baseball was not just
something to do at St. Mary's.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.260
It was an organizing
principle and a way

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.770
of channeling a whole
lot of hormones.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.440
And so what Babe Ruth knew,
and what he was comfortable

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:08.310
with was being with
crowds of boys and men.

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:15.570
This is at, in Syracuse in 1925.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:21.080
Look at them draped around
his neck and his shoulders.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.410
Like one of his wives' fur boas.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.380
They're all, there's
5000 boys that tried

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.680
to get into a single frame.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.980
There's also one
little girl there.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.570
I don't know if you can
see her over in the corner

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.310
on somebody's shoulders.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.040
She just looks just like I did.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:39.270
I had same horrible haircut.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.050
[Laughter] And but they can't
get close enough to him.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:45.330
And he doesn't care.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.790
Not only does not care that
they're draped all over him.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.770
Try that with Bryce Harper
today or Aaron Judge or.

00:19:51.770 --> 00:20:00.050
There's not a hint of
claustrophobia in that smile.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:04.210
"He chafed at every constraint,"
his daughter Julia tells me.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:08.120
Including having his feet tucked
under, in under the covers.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.760
But not at this.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:13.350
This is where he lived.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.140
This is where he was most
comfortable in his skin.

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:20.280
And this is why he
was the perfect person

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.080
to be America's first
modern celebrity.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.180
The focus of that kind
of mass adulation.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.920
Being public is what he knew.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:39.100
Being alone was unnatural to
him and uncomfortable to him.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.930
This photograph is
taken on July,

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:48.980
hold on a second, July 26, 1926.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.630
And it's taken at the same
airfield on Long Island

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:58.120
where Lucky Lindy would take
off for Paris ten months later.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:03.660
And it's a PR shot that
was organized by his agent.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.130
And among the many ways

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.720
that Babe Ruth was a
revolutionary is this.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.980
He hired the first sports agent.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.420
A guy name Christy Walsh.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:15.980
A failed newspaperman, failed
cartoonist, failed ad man.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.080
Failed PR guy who
in desperation went

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.240
to Babe Ruth's hotel
room, snuck in the window.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.470
Slapped him on the ass, and
said, "I want to represent you."

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.570
Babe was in bed with a blonde
at the time, by the way.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.070
[Laughter] Babe, and Christy
Walsh would do anything,

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.370
anything.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.520
And Babe Ruth would
agree to do it.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.020
To promote him, to
maximize his income.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.740
You can't believe what a
radical notion that is.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:52.750
That a, that a ballplayer
should be treated economically

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.520
as an entertainer.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.210
Not just for what
he did on the field.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.450
But for what he brought
to the field.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.160
What he brought to
the New York Yankees.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.880
So I happen to have here
with me an expert on that.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.920
His name is Michael Halpert.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.910
He's a Professor of
Economics at University

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.650
of Wisconsin, Lacrosse.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:23.780
Michael, only his mother
calls him Michael, I'm sorry.

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.340
Mike has been my go-to guy for,

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.620
we think it's three
years, maybe four.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.700
He when you look at the book
and you look at all the numbers

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.830
that are in there,
that makes sense

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:41.050
of this vast marketing operation
that Christy Walsh created.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.010
Mike's responsible
for all of them.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:46.660
And one of the things
Mike explained to me was

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:52.090
that when Harry Frazee,
the really stupid owner

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:58.360
of the Baltimore, of the Red
Sox, decided to sell him off

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.930
in 1919 for the 1919
World Series

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:03.230
because he was a
pain in the neck.

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:08.330
And because he wanted money
that he frankly deserved

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.490
for having helped win
all those World Series

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:14.350
for putting tushies in seats.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.280
Jake Rupert, the president,
the owner of the Yankees,

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.800
I know a lot of you
hate the Yankees.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.100
I'm sorry.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.400
He was really smart.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.060
He paid $100,000 for him
in four installments.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.180
But Frazee was so broke, tell
me if I've got this right, Mike.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.050
He was so broke that he
also borrowed $300,000

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:34.200
at seven percent interest.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:37.650
But Ruth, the purchase
of Ruth was $100 Grand

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:38.950
at six percent interest.

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.460
Don't even keep doing that.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.150
Which means that
after six years.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:44.480
Tell me, Mike, I'm
doing this right?

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.130
Okay. After six years,
Harry Frazee had paid more

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.760
than $100,000 in interest.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.510
Which means Harry Frazee paid
the Yankees to take Babe Ruth.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.320
[ Laughter ]

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.620
Mike, could you stand?

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.260
Could you stand up, Mike?

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:06.060
This guy's amazing.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.040
[ Applause ]

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:15.610
So he becomes this eco--
economic juggernaut.

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:20.820
Oops. And he becomes
this economic juggernaut

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.180
at this absolutely
unprecedented moment

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.220
in American history
and technology.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.780
This is the back page
of the Daily News,

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.730
America's first tabloid.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:37.180
The back page went,
became, became a thing

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.160
for the first time
in November 1919.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.350
A month and a half before
Jake Rupert bought Babe Ruth.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.960
And a month and a half
before Prohibition came in.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.070
So Jake Rupert, no
dummy, as we see.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:53.370
Knew that he was going to have

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:57.670
to make some money some other
way other than selling beer.

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.370
What's he, what's he
going to make money at?

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:03.580
And he had lost money in
this ball club for the free,

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.990
for the three previous years.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.380
He's going to make
money off the Yankees.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.530
And how's he going to make
money off the Yankees?

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.020
He's going to bring in Babe Ruth

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.750
and have him hit a
whole lot of home runs.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:20.340
And the new tabloid press and
the radio which was just coming

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.580
into existence in terms
of popular entertainment.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.040
First ballgame broadcast was
broadcast in August 1921.

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.170
The, from Pittsburgh.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.130
[Inaudible audience
comment] Thank you, right.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:35.430
Exactly right.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.730
That's all in the book.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.730
I got it. [Laughter] And
so this is, this is 1920,

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.840
so this is before radio.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:49.890
And before radio and before
telepics and telegraphs

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:54.660
and all the mechanisms for
disseminating news that,

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.180
that we now think
are old-fashioned.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.730
Right? Every sports
story was local.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.350
Your, your, your
fame was as wide

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.080
as the circulation
of a newspaper.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.010
In short, as far as the
newsboy could throw.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.430
And now suddenly it's
going everywhere.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.520
In 1925, the Chicago
Tribune and the,

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.020
and the Daily News invented
a system called telepics

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.770
which meant that they could
overnight a photograph.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.070
It was expensive.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.550
But they could overnight
a photograph from New York

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:33.720
to Chicago or New York to
Los Angeles which they did.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.210
When Joseph Patterson, publisher
of the Daily News decided

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:43.130
to out Babe Ruth's
mistress, Claire Hodgson.

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:48.170
They also used telepics when
he hit his sixtieth home run

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.720
in 1927.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:56.110
And by 1927, so much had
changed that two networks,

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:59.430
radio networks, two
national net, radio networks.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:04.260
NBC which went live on
New Year's Day 1927,

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:10.410
and CBS both broadcast the
World Series coast to coast.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.130
That is just six years

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.720
after this picture was
taken at the Polo Grounds.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:20.920
And that was taken because
fans on the East Side

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.260
of Manhattan had no other
way of getting updates

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.920
from the ballpark about
what was going on during a,

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:35.000
the pennant-deciding series
against the Cleveland Indians.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.460
So this guy come with his
pigeon, who's flying back

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.270
and forth from the Polo
Grounds to the East Side

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.500
of Manhattan with updates.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.430
So 1921, September 1921, a month

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.650
after the first game
was broadcast,

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:55.640
1927 national coast-to-coast
broadcast

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.850
of the, of the World Series.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:03.130
It is impossible for us, except
maybe if we remember pre-

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:09.830
and post-computer, to understand
how fast the world was changing.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:14.960
And how big that was
going to make Babe Ruth.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.260
I love the pigeon.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.080
I really had to, I tried to
find the guy's relatives.

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.400
I couldn't find it.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.700
Anyway, okay.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.000
Hold on.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.830
Now I know why people
lick their fingers.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.910
Which I always thought
was gross.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:41.630
So with the mass media came
the advent of marketing and PR.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:44.930
This was all being designed
and invented and propagated

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:47.150
by three guys in New York.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:51.120
Ivy Lee, who represented
the Pennsylvania Railroad.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.720
Edward Bernays, who sold
soap and Lucky Strikes,

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.020
and God knows what else.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:01.530
And Bruce Barton, who
sold Calvin Coolidge.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.000
[Laughter] So now
you've got mass media.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.360
And you've got a famous
guy, and you're going to put

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.550
that together with what?

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.200
Disposable income that has
suddenly become available

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.960
in the post-World War I era.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.800
And this is a picture
of Babe Ruth standing,

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.320
I think it's outside the Ansonia
where he stashed his blondes.

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.940
And that's where Cristy Walsh
found him in bed with a blonde.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:30.320
And he's reading a,
a, an endorsement

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.310
for the instruction book
from Walsh's first client.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:37.890
A, a, a racing guy, car
guy named Ray McNamara.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:41.550
So what you have here in
this fabulous picture.

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:44.320
What a great car, you know?

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:51.230
Is synergy, branding,
product placement.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:55.120
It's all starting
there, and Christy Walsh,

00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.010
who was really the original
Jerry Maguire, and a visionary.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.680
Is putting Babe Ruth together
with his other client,

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.980
one that's going to help this.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.280
One's going to help that.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.970
You know, synergy.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:11.480
Synergy actually in those days
was a medical term but it,

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.500
it's been hijacked since.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.140
And with all these broadcasts,

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.410
and with the newspapers
came mass adulation.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:24.700
One of his granddaughters
said to me, "Everyone wanted

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.040
to claim a piece of The Babe."

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.740
I told a radio station
this morning

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.680
in Alabama about this picture.

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.830
I'm not sure they
were so thrilled

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.140
with my disquisition on this.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.860
This was taken in a
bandbox in Alabama

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.130
as the Yankees made
their way north.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.960
They always barnstormed north.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.390
And one of the ways that
Babe Ruth made money was

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:52.940
that he was paid to appear
in every exhibition game.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:57.190
It's been written that actually
he would be fined if he didn't.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.490
But that's wrong.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:59.790
They did it the other way.

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.090
It was the carrot,
not the stick.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.750
And Mike, do you
remember how much he got?

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.500
&gt;&gt; Depends on the year.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, this is '25, I think.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:13.620
[ Inaudible ]

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:17.910
Yeah. Not, not chump
change then, you know?

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:22.660
So these folks are, you
know, consigned to the part

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.890
of the ballpark as there was
in every ballpark in America,

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.510
that was open to
African Americans.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.390
But look at them
reaching for him.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:37.150
And what this picture speaks
to among other things.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:41.160
And is you know the
reason it's so lovely

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.110
and significant historically is
you might know, not know this,

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.440
but it goes back
to the beginning

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.350
and not knowing about
his childhood.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.440
People thought he was passing.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.260
His mother must have
passed over.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.370
Hmm? Look at those lips.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.020
Look at that nose.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.430
There was absolutely
no scientific evidence.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.880
It is not true.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.340
One of his, his grand,
great niece contributed DNA.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:06.640
I had it tested.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:12.230
Not true. But it was based
on playground stereotyping

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.810
that caused him to have a
nickname that I'm not going

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:19.990
to repeat because it's bad,
starting with the N-word.

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:23.850
And the black community,
throughout America,

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:26.780
believed he was passing
and believe--

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.670
secretly believed
he was a brother.

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:35.110
And wanted to believe that
because that meant they could be

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.990
or were being represented

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.600
in Major League baseball years
before the color barrier was,

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.580
was broken.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.310
Okay, next one.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:52.230
This is Babe Ruth with
his first wife, Helen.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.610
And their adopted
daughter, Dorothy.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:58.740
Taken at his farm in
Sudbury, Massachusetts.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:03.450
It is quite simply a PR shot.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:08.130
Taken by Christy Walsh
who sent him there

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.820
because he'd gotten himself
in trouble and they needed

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.050
to clean up his reputation.

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:18.490
And so off to the, to the
country he went to chop wood.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.540
Which he paid other
teenagers to do.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.840
And he actually had a
car designed, a Packard,

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.930
with a 55-gallon tank so that
he could drive back and forth

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:32.220
to New York without
having to get gas.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.910
And he would spend the
weekends in New York.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:36.470
And then he would
come back to Sudbury

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.250
and pretend to be Farmer Ruth.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.900
Now I want to say
about this family,

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.630
because I think it's
actually, it's quite tragic.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.970
And my editor says I
can't tell you everything.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.260
So you have to read the
book, what happened.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:56.240
But that little boy
who had no family,

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.750
who was dispatched
by his family.

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:05.210
His first instinct when he
got out of St. Mary's was not

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:09.240
to eat everything, smoke
everything, screw everything.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.540
Forgive me.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.840
But that's how ballplayers talk.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.590
It was to marry the first
woman who was nice to him.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:17.540
A waitress at a coffee shop.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.380
Helen Woodford.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:23.460
And in that, I, I find
that incredibly touching

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.600
because what's he trying to do?

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.630
He's trying to give himself
the family he never had.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.640
And he is conforming,
not defying,

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.590
but conforming to norms.

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:40.870
That it didn't work out, that he
didn't know how to be a husband

00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.350
or a father is hardly shocking.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:46.680
It's true of many
Major Leaguers.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.760
But that was his first instinct.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.890
Not to be the reckless,
rambunctious,

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:58.510
out-of-control guy
you've all read about.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:02.370
That said, he treated
his first wife terribly.

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.100
And he didn't do very well
by his daughter, Dorothy,

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.660
who's the little one between
him and his second wife, Claire.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:13.050
Who he'd began a
relationship with in the month

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.530
after Yankee Stadium opened.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.150
And he would create
a new life with.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.190
They would adopt each
other's children.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:24.720
Julia, who's on his right,
is that right, his right?

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.280
Is still alive.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.770
She's 102 years old.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:31.690
And when I first met
her, she's the one

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:35.000
who gave me the first clue that
there was something missing

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.850
in the, in the arc
of his, of his life.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.460
She was the one who
said, "Oh, by the way.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.130
Did you know that Kate and
George were separated?"

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.400
And I went, "Oh, no."

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.200
But she also told me this.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.940
That explains some of
those appetites later.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:54.830
She said the one thing he
ever told her about his life

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:58.100
at St. Mary's was that
he never felt full.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.670
Now that's not just a
statement about the fact

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.310
that the Brothers
had all of six cents

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:11.160
to feed each child each day.

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:16.190
It's also a statement of
deprivation and the absence

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:20.940
of the love, guidance,
familial support

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.330
that you would have
wished he would have had.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:30.030
This is Babe Ruth,
probably at his happiest.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:34.910
He's out fishing at the end
of a Vaudeville tour in 1926.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:39.500
Where he was happiest
was with the guys.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.450
Doing guy things.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:44.730
And there was everywhere
he went, there were guys

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:48.170
who were happy to buy him
booze, to get him broads,

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:49.940
to take him fishing,
to take him hunting.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:53.320
Whatever he wanted,
it was there for him.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.130
And this is taken
off Coronado Beach.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:37:00.100
The two guys on the left
are fishing reporters

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.260
who both wrote stories about it.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.000
The other guy is,
was a man-about-town.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.230
Very handsome devil named
Carl Clint who, wasn't a fixer

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:11.530
so much as he was a guy

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.830
who would make sure Babe Ruth
would get whatever he wanted.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.130
He wanted a fishing charter?

00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:17.430
He was there.

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.730
He wanted a bathtub full of gin?

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.030
He was there.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.160
And they stayed friends
for quite some time.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:29.940
At the end of that barnstorming
tour, this picture was taken

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.790
and send back to New
York to show Jake Rupert

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.140
and Miller Huggins, the
manager of the Yankees.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.180
That yes, he was
taking care of himself.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.500
[Laughter] He was resting up.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.980
Now if you look really closely,
I think he's playing possum,

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.240
as my mother would have said

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.190
because the one thing
about Babe Ruth.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:53.640
That made him the
"Ultimate American,"

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.850
which is how The New York
Herald Tribune described him

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:57.230
when he died.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.600
Was that he never sat still.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:03.650
He was restless and
he had the energy

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:06.060
of the country as
it was expanding.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.920
Before the crash.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.010
And you know he, he,
anybody Yiddish know you a

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:12.310
little Yiddish?

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:13.610
He had shpilkes.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:15.040
He just could not sit still.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:19.700
And he was the epitome
of that decade.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:27.490
Hyperkinetic, ruthless, and
ineffably upwardly mobile.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.830
Before this season, on, on New
Year's Day right around when

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.790
that umbrella picture was taken,
he was called by a newspaper

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:43.540
that said, "Have you got
a New Year's resolution

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.050
for the Yankees?"

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:49.280
And he says, "Yeah, I
promised 60 home runs to Jake."

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.000
What a thing to say!

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.680
He hadn't hit more
than how many?

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.770
Fifty-- ? Fifty-nine
since, in 1921.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.640
People had thought
he was washed up.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.000
He crashed and burned in '25.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.750
And while he had a
good season in '26,

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.880
he also ended the World Series
by getting thrown out at second,

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:12.540
trying to steal second base
with two down in the ninth.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.820
So nobody really expected
much of him in 1927.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.550
And hot, damn!

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:26.040
This was a man who lived to
make promises and to keep them.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.870
So he runs around the
bases on September 20,

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.450
1927, crowing, bellowing!

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.220
"Sixty, count 'em, sixty!

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.500
Let's see some other
son of a bitch do that!"

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:45.500
[Laughter] And right after
that, he leads the Yankees

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.240
to a four-game sweep of
the Pittsburgh Pirates.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.030
He hits the only two
home runs in the series.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:57.920
And then Christy Walsh,
the, the, the, the emissary

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.670
of SWAT takes them
out on the road.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:02.800
On a barnstorming tour.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:10.820
Scheduled to go to 21 cities and
replete with lots of PR shots.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:14.050
This one says, "Appreciation
to Matt Gallagher

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:18.400
for doing the best
ballyhoo on our tour, 1927."

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.730
And I love it just because
I love the language.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.820
But Walsh, who was as
straight a dude as he looks

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.570
like in his, in his suit there.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:29.900
I think he was born
in a three-piece suit.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:34.070
Was only four years
older than Babe Ruth,

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.500
but he became his governor.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.530
He became a father figure.

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:43.090
He by this point, he had tricked
Babe Ruth into saving the money

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.140
that he otherwise
would have spent.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:49.010
All the money that he earned
on the barnstorming tours

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:53.940
and the Vaudeville tours and the
products and the appearances.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:57.450
Christy Walsh tricked
him into saving.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:03.590
On his 33rd birthday, which
would have been February 1927.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:06.240
He said, "You know, Babe, it
would be a really good trick

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:10.100
if we got all these
bankers together.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.890
And you announce
that you're going

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:16.100
to fine yourself a
thousand dollars per year.

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.860
For all your bad deeds, and say
you've reformed and you're going

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:22.410
to put it in a, in
a trust fund."

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.730
Right? So Babe says,
"Yeah, that's cool.

00:41:24.730 --> 00:41:26.030
You know, I'll do it."

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.260
Babe would do anything.

00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.350
And he signs the check.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:33.380
And when, as soon as the
cameramen go away, he says,

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.830
"Okay, I'll take my money back."

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.000
And Christy says, "It's
an irrevocable trust."

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.090
And that irrevocable
trust which Mike analyzed

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:47.250
to a penny to explain how.

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:48.980
And this is all in, in the book.

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:52.650
How it is that Babe
Ruth did not go broke.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:56.660
In 1927, this year, the
year this picture's taken.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.840
Babe Ruth is on the first
year of a three-year,

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:02.670
$70,000 contract with
the New York Yankees.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:08.390
He also makes $73,000
in outside income.

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:11.530
If you put that together,
according to my friend Mike.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:15.970
In 2016 dollars, that's
$36 million dollars.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.590
That's how much he was making.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:26.190
That's how rich he was compared
to the average American.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:29.860
And Christy Walsh, by
virtue of tricking him,

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.890
got him to save what
otherwise clearly would have

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.190
been dissipated.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.920
Because he was dead
broke in 1925.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.300
Okay, let's see.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:47.860
Now, when I say he would do
anything, I'm not kidding.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.590
He was the ultimate gamer.

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:56.010
This was a guy who
needed to please

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:58.930
and got joy out of doing so.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:03.330
So this is a photograph
taken at the AMCO plant,

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:05.160
the American Milling
Company plant

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.270
on the barnstorming
tour of 1927 in Omaha.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:14.460
And this is where we
get really modern.

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:18.050
Because they suddenly said, "Oh,

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:24.710
this chicken is the champion
chicken egg-producing layer

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:26.360
of 1927.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.910
She's laid 166 eggs straight.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:35.710
Let's change her name from
Lady Norfolk to Babe Ruth,

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:37.320
the Babe Ruth of layers!

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.670
And let's bring Babe
Ruth to the henhouse!

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.390
And let's have Babe Ruth
cradle the other Babe.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:48.210
And let's put little stories
in every newspaper in America."

00:43:48.210 --> 00:43:50.020
This was on the wire service.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.320
"Two Babes."

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.290
That's the picture
that went out.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:56.640
And it wasn't just that
he was willing to do it.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.220
He's obviously having
a really good time.

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:01.770
And I actually, believe
it or not,

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.950
was able to find
footage of this moment.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.110
Which has never been
screened before.

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:08.410
So here you go.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:10.850
It takes a little bit but,
and it tells you a little

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:14.410
about the Nebraska
egg industry first.

00:44:14.410 --> 00:44:16.390
Which is what they were
trying to shill for.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:18.690
But here it goes.

00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:23.010
And by the way, that was
not very good compared

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.310
to other egg-laying states.

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.730
Two champions.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:48.140
[ Laughter ]

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.380
And that's where the
still comes from, right?

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:54.510
And then Lou gets the 171st egg.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:59.080
[ Laughter ]

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.380
Want to see it again?

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.680
It's really cool!

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.980
[Laughter] I love-- oh.

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:04.280
Oh, well, sorry.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:08.920
We went to this is taken
just a tad later on the tour.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:13.510
With a little boy named
Jack Whitey Stewart.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.530
And Jack Whitey Stewart
was the bat boy

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:20.280
for the San Francisco Seals
of the Pacific Coast League,

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:23.550
which was basically considered
the third Major League.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.550
And he got that exalted job

00:45:25.550 --> 00:45:30.530
because his father was
a San Francisco dog cop.

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:33.440
He had the, he walked
bloodhounds

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.950
around San Francisco
looking for bodies.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:39.090
And when he wasn't doing
that, he volunteered

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.590
to do security for the Seals.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:46.630
And so young Jack here gets
to be Babe Ruth's bat boy.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:49.240
I found Jack's daughter.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:52.750
And son who contributed
this picture.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.980
So this has never
been seen either.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.300
And the reason that I wanted

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.890
to include it is
look at those hands!

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.500
Look at them.

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:09.510
I mean, the one that he's got
on his hip looks like a backhoe.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:13.040
[ Laughter ]

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:17.740
He wasn't just huge
as a marketing guy.

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:21.740
He wasn't just huge in
terms of what he made

00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:23.350
or the number of
home runs he hit.

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:25.190
Or how far he hit them.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:29.810
He was literally
bigger than the game.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.970
He was 6'2" and when
he was in trim,

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:35.150
which he wasn't exactly here.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:37.950
When he was with
the Red Sox in 1916,

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:40.200
he was probably about
195 pounds.

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.630
Here he weighed himself
that say in San Francisco

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.140
and he weighed, he weighed 235.

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.750
And he said, "That's
a lot of weight."

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:54.360
But he was so much
bigger than everyone else.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.990
Bigger than the pictures-- you
can find footage and I, I have.

00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:59.790
Where he's the, the stuff

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:01.530
that they're throwing
him is such slop.

00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:03.800
That's for you, for people
who don't know baseball,

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.860
that's junk, slow, whatever.

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:09.500
That he would have to shuffle
his feet in, in the batter's box

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.420
to try to time how slow it is.

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.150
Today that's known as
the Babe Ruth drill.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:18.120
For batting coaches
who use it for guys

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.850
who they say have
a dead lower-half.

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:24.430
When they're trying to teach
them to catch up with the ball.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:30.620
So he took pictures like this
with boys across the country.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:35.620
None of them show his enormity
better than this one does.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.100
And Jack, who for
reasons that I don't,

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.400
I still don't understand this.

00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.700
Children don't understand.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.820
Came away from that
experience a bit embittered

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.870
and didn't think he
was such a nice guy.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.730
And say that Lou Gehrig
didn't want to pose with him.

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:51.380
Because Gehrig didn't
like his morals.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.730
How an eight-year-old
was supposed

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:55.790
to know that, I don't know.

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:58.240
But by the time Jack died,

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.250
he'd come to a different
understanding

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:01.980
of his relationship.

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.620
Oh, there it goes again.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:04.920
With Babe Ruth.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.120
And when he died,
he was a member

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.980
of what's called the
San Francisco Baseball

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.920
Alumni Association?

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.800
Yes. Old-timer's
Alumni Association.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.270
And at his wake, Jack was buried

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:26.420
with the Jersey he wore the
day he was Babe Ruth's bat boy.

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:31.960
So this is Babe Ruth
as king of the world.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.310
And that's what I really
wanted to do in this book.

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.490
I wanted to give people
a feeling of what it was

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:40.440
to be Babe Ruth, at
the top of the world.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.950
And what it was like to be
with Babe Ruth when he was

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.460
at the top of the world.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:49.200
It never got any better
than this for him.

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.770
He just kept doing
the same thing.

00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:53.070
More of it.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:54.370
Yankees didn't actually win

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.030
that many more World
Series with Ruth and Gehrig.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:49:00.960
Except of course the
famous one in 1932.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.840
Where he hit the
[inaudible] at Wrigley Field.

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.140
No, I don't know.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.200
I don't know.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.480
[Laughter] So he played

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.220
until the Yankees decided
he was too old, fat,

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:17.060
and slow to be on their roster.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.760
And he went to the Boston
Braves, back to Boston.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.720
And the only team
that would have him

00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.780
for a very brief time in 1835.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:29.970
And then he quit.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:34.830
Three weeks after he quit, he
made his first public appearance

00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:38.700
at a West Chester, New
York, country club,

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.940
playing at a charity
softball game.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:46.340
He has grease paint
whiskers and,

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.950
and this ridiculous
uniform that's supposed

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:53.100
to be from the Swiss navy?

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.720
I mean, really?

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.040
[ Laughter ]

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.750
And all, all the fancy people

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:03.310
from West Chester watched
him make a fool of himself.

00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:06.000
And if you ask what his life was

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.210
like for the next 13
years, it was like this.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:12.470
That's all there was for him.

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:15.070
Baseball turned its back on him.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.280
The institution that
he had come to regard

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:22.540
as a family had no use for him.

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:25.430
And the saddest part about it,

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:28.900
and you can certainly
see sadness in that face.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:33.930
Is that it was in
many ways a re--

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.390
, a reincarnation
of the abandonment

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.790
that he experienced
as a young boy.

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:41.610
He had been abandoned
once again,

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.640
and he couldn't possibly
understand it.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.860
Any more than he could have
as a seven-year-old boy.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:53.580
So the last 13 years of his life
were a series of ridiculous,

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.870
sometimes money-paying gigs.

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:01.000
A brief half a season in a
Dodger uniform where he got

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.130
into a fight with Leo Durocher.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:07.030
And was blamed for it even
though he wasn't responsible.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.310
And then he got sick.

00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:12.460
This is his last birthday.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.710
He's 53 years old.

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:17.790
He's got nasopharyngeal
cancer, not throat cancer,

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:19.200
not esophageal cancer.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.590
Nasopharyngeal cancer.

00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:23.130
Which my friend [inaudible]
here,

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:25.470
the doctor, helped
me understand.

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:29.020
And translate all the stuff
I wouldn't have understood.

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.740
And how did he spend his
fifty-third birthday?

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:37.110
With two little boys
he didn't know.

00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:43.550
He would be dead
six months later.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:49.180
But not before he went to Yankee
Stadium for a belated farewell.

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.880
This is not Babe Ruth Day.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.480
Babe Ruth Day was the year
before and the Yankees declined

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:58.240
at that point, or forgot,
if you want to be generous.

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.850
To retire number three.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:05.150
So on the 25th Anniversary of
the 1927 team, they gather,

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.790
they gathered all the old guys
together and brought them back.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:09.340
And they said, "You know, Babe,

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.490
why don't you manage
the old-timers?"

00:52:12.490 --> 00:52:14.930
How cruel is that?

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:19.570
This man who just wanted to
be, have a place in baseball.

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.410
I mean, how much did
he want to manage?

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:22.710
I don't know.

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:25.000
I think he just wanted
to be wanted.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.720
So what do they offer him?

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.750
Manage the old-timers
in this game.

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:32.100
But it was raw, it was cold.

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:35.010
And he was too sick
to stay for the game.

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:38.440
So he never did manage
at Yankee Stadium.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.770
This is the day that Nat Fein,

00:52:41.770 --> 00:52:44.630
New York Herald Tribune
photographer took the picture

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:48.810
that won the first Pulitzer
Prize for sports photography.

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:50.460
And it's the opposite
of this one.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:52.050
It's the one that's
taken from the rear

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:53.890
where you see the number three.

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:56.270
Coming up out of the dugout.

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.330
Eddie Robinson, later a Yankee,

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.080
he's now the oldest
living Major Leaguer,

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.900
by the way, and a lovely man.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:06.840
Saw how hard it was for
him to climb up the stairs.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.350
You know those, those
steps were pretty steep.

00:53:09.350 --> 00:53:12.870
And as a young man, you'd gallop
up and down them in your spikes.

00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:17.920
As a man dying of cancer, very
weak, and in a lot of pain.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.080
Eddie said, "I think he
might need some help."

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.290
So he gave him Bob Feller's bat.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:23.650
Bob Feller was the
starting pitcher

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.780
for the Cleveland
Indians that day.

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:27.800
And Babe Ruth used it kind

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.180
of the way you would
use a, like this.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:32.510
He had his two hands like this.

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:35.860
So that he could actually push
down on the step like that.

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.490
It wasn't enough
to just one hand.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:40.530
And he got himself up.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:44.700
Took a few paltry swings
for the photographers.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:48.290
And he said his farewell.

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:50.350
He was dead two months later.

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:56.860
And a hundred thousand
people passed by his casket

00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:00.810
in the rotunda of
Yankee Stadium.

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:03.530
Where finally the
Yankees found a way

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:06.140
to greet him and bring him back.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.940
Thank you very much.

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:20.690
[ Applause ]

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:21.990

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:23.290
I went, I went long.

00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:25.090
Yes, sir?

00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:33.540
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:37.830
Well Jonathan's insight into
that came from Eleanor Gehrig.

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:42.480
So you know in, in 1927 on
this tour, they're buddies.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.230
Babe Ruth's showing Lou
Gehrig as a young guy.

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:46.530
He's probably a virgin.

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.620
He's never been west
of the Mississippi.

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:51.180
Goes to Ogden Canyon,
and he's surprised

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:53.240
that there's no cowboys
and Indians, you know?

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:56.840
He was a naive kid
from Upper Manhattan

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.700
with an overbearing mother.

00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:01.720
Babe Ruth was the
motherless boy.

00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.950
So in a way they were a perfect
pair and they were friends.

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:08.380
And if you read the book,
please read the book.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:11.970
[Laughter] Their relationship
then is amply documented.

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:17.630
The, the old trope is that what
got in the way between them was

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:21.280
that the second wife, Claire,
dressed the first child

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.000
from his first marriage,
not as nicely

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.870
as she dressed Julia,
her own daughter.

00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:30.950
Dorothy's own children
said to me, "You know what?

00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:34.310
She was so provocative and so
angry that if they said dress

00:55:34.310 --> 00:55:37.810
up for the newspaper guys,
she'd climb in a coal bin."

00:55:37.810 --> 00:55:41.870
She was a tomboy,
like me, actually.

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:45.460
What really put the kibosh
is when they went to Japan

00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:49.820
after Babe Ruth played his last
season for the Yankees in 1934.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:53.190
And they go off to
barnstorm through Japan.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:58.630
And Helen, Eleanor, excuse
me, and, and Claire run

00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:59.930
into each other on deck.

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:03.240
And they say, "You know, this,
this feud is really stupid.

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:06.140
You know, why don't you
come back to our stateroom?

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:08.940
Babe's got some caviar
and champagne."

00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:11.360
Well, Eleanor says, "That
sounds pretty good."

00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:13.950
And so she goes and she
spends the afternoon with Babe

00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.740
and Claire, drinking
champagne and eating caviar.

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:19.430
While Lou Gehrig, the
earnest bridegroom,

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:22.800
is searching the horizon
for his dead wife.

00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.850
[Laughter] And when he finally
finds out where she has been,

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.320
and she was quite
tipsy, you know.

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:31.650
He wouldn't talk to
her, to her for a week.

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.850
And he didn't talk to
Babe Ruth for five years.

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:36.010
So that's that story.

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:37.720
Okay, somebody else?

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.020
Yes, sir.

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:45.270
&gt;&gt; Yes, which actor do you
think best portrayed Babe Ruth?

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:47.070
&gt;&gt; Jane Leavy: Babe Ruth.

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:51.040
[ Laughter ]

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.060
And he played Babe Dugan in
one of his movies, you know.

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:57.570
He could play himself
better than anybody.

00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:58.870
They're all awful.

00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:01.580
[Laughter] Yeah, back there?

00:57:01.580 --> 00:57:02.880
&gt;&gt; Parenthetical question.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.560
You mentioned that his
father was more of a man

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.750
of means than people thought.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:09.910
Why did two children
die of starvation?

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:12.930
Was there some sort of
neglect or abuse of those kids?

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:18.360
Jane Leavy: Surmise is, has to
come-- I mean, the, the death,

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:23.030
cause of death listed on the
birth certificates is marasmus.

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:26.230
Which is an old word
for malnutrition.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:33.520
You know, there, there's
evidence, and I spoke to experts

00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.790
about what life was
like in Baltimore.

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:41.150
That because it was one of
the last unsewered cities

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:43.740
in the world in the
United States,

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:47.830
the rates of infant
mortality were much higher

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:49.780
than they were elsewhere
in the United States.

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:53.520
There was no refrigeration,
there was no pasteurized milk.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:58.750
But even given that, the
percentage of children

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:02.500
that they lost was way
higher than what was going

00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:05.110
on in the city in general.

00:58:05.110 --> 00:58:09.380
I don't venture a guess.

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:12.660
I mean, was it because
she was drinking?

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:17.740
Maybe. Was it because you know
there was a lot of disease?

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.570
You know, and, and
they were susceptible?

00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:24.190
I mean, there had been plenty
of epi, epidemics in Baltimore

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:29.570
in the, in the 1880s and 1890s.

00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:32.060
Death certificates
don't tell you that.

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:35.330
They just give the
cause of guess.

00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:37.130

Michael. [Inaudible
audience comment] Mike,

00:59:00.650 --> 00:59:02.360
you have to answer that for me.

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.780
&gt;&gt; Michael Halpert: Yeah,
he wrote a great book.

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:07.560
And [inaudible] because in 1919,

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:12.130
you have no idea what
Babe Ruth is going to do.

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:14.280
So when James says
that this turns

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.350
out to be the greatest
steal in history.

00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:17.650
That is [inaudible] true.

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:19.940
But in 1919, it wasn't
that obvious.

00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:23.430
That it was, it was going
to be a big deal because,

00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:25.510
because [inaudible] said
predicting is really tough.

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:28.340

the future, right?

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.030
Well the French really
hated him.

00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:57.660
And he didn't like
them back much either.

00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.000
He went back through France.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.510
Certainly he is given
fairly a lot of credit

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:08.460
for the development
of Japanese baseball.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:11.720
But at the same time,
the guy, one of the guys

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:15.300
who was responsible, newspaper
guys who was responsible

01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.690
for bringing him was stabbed
to death by a nationalist.

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.410
Shortly after Babe
Ruth left Japan.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:25.870
So the, the, the seeds of what
would take over the world,

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:29.900
you know, six years later
were already present.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:36.950
In fact, you know, the Japanese,
apparently the Samurais said,

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:39.530
well, you know, they had this
to-hell-with-Babe-Ruth cheer.

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:42.270
And the Kamikaze pilots would
go to their deaths, you know.

"To hell with Babe Ruth."

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:50.010
So the New Yorkers sent a,
a, a guy to his apartment

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:54.800
on Riverside Drive to ask Babe
how he felt about that in 1944.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.470
And Babe Ruth said,
with his aplomb,

01:00:57.470 --> 01:01:00.510
"Sounds like the
itty-bitty ones."

problems [inaudible] known today

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:12.030
to be suspended?

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:17.180
If he had one, how
serious was it?

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.480
&gt;&gt; Jane Leavy: Did you
all hear the question?

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.170
How serious was his gambling.

01:01:20.170 --> 01:01:23.620
His spending and
gambling were a big deal.

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:29.390
He was broke between fines that
were imposed by the Yankees.

01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:32.820
And you know, all, all through
the first half of the '20s.

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:39.860
And his pro-- really, truly
profligate/generous lifestyle.

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:41.210
He was dead broke.

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:44.240
And when he and his
first wife Helen agreed

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.730
to separate in August 4, 1925.

01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:51.990
He had to come up with
a hundred grand for her.

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:56.770
He was in arrears on all of the
four payments that he owed her.

01:01:56.770 --> 01:01:59.780
And he had taxes to pay.

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:03.190
And he had to go to
Christy Walsh for a loan.

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:07.370
And Christy Walsh, being the
smart guy that he is, said,

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.540
"Yeah, I'll, I'll lend you
the four grand that you need.

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:13.910
But from here on out, you're not

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:17.890
to buy any real estate
without my approval.

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:20.260
You're not to take any-- .

You're not spending a dime."

01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:24.990
And he took over as
his power of attorney

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:27.460
in complete financial control.

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:30.470
And he had the leverage
at that point to do it.

01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:35.760
And it was the best thing that
ever happened to Babe Ruth.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.530
I mean, he was dead broke.

01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:39.930
And yet he, he bet
on the ponies a lot.

01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:42.990
I've never heard or read
that he had a problem betting

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:46.210
on baseball, like

at Yankee Stadium with
my Yankee jacket slung

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.770
Ryne Duren was an early relief
pitcher for the Yankees.

01:03:20.770 --> 01:03:23.820
Threw very hard and
very fast and very wild.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.120
Because he couldn't see.

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.420
And he always made a point

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:28.560
of throwing the first pitch
all the way to the backstop

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.420
to scare the bejesus out of
whoever might step to the plate.

01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:34.440
So I, I was prepared, you know.

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.940
I, I practiced all summer.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:39.020
And by the end of August,

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.420
I actually could throw
sixty feet, six inches.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:45.770
And then I got some
advice from Sandy Koufax.

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:47.070
He said, "How far
can you throw?"

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:48.370
This was actually in June.

01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:51.350
I said, "Oh, forty,
forty-five feet."

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.000
He said, "Stand thirty."

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.660
[Laughter] By the end
of, just before I got,

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.700
I went there, my arm went dead.

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.020
I got a dead arm.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:04.820
[Laughter] So I call
up Koufax, and I say,

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.820
"Sandy, I got a dead arm."

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.080
He says, "Hmm, dead arm.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.880
There's a very good
shiraz named "Dead Arm."

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:14.180
Get a good year.

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.480
It's a really good wine."

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.820
[Laughter] I don't
remember what it was like.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.020
I was in a trance.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:22.450
[Laughter] If you
go to the videotape,

01:04:22.450 --> 01:04:23.820
it looks like I bounced it.

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:26.510
But as my daughter said,
"Mom, you threw a curve."

01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:37.500
[ Laughter and Applause ]
