first of all you should start always

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240
first of all you should start always
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.490

when I can help for example so you push

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
when I can help for example so you push
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.160
when I can help for example so you push
yourself to derive principles you then

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
yourself to derive principles you then
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260
yourself to derive principles you then
test those principles out in new cases

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
test those principles out in new cases
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.840

that are alike and unalike again that's

one way of approaching the problem the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650
one way of approaching the problem the
 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.410
one way of approaching the problem the
other is a much more top-down way which

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
other is a much more top-down way which
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.240
other is a much more top-down way which
is to start thinking about big schools

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250
is to start thinking about big schools
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.730
is to start thinking about big schools
of thinking and ethics and really the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
of thinking and ethics and really the
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.109
of thinking and ethics and really the
big schools are on the one hand

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
big schools are on the one hand

consequentialism of which utilitarianism

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
consequentialism of which utilitarianism
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.480
consequentialism of which utilitarianism
is probably the most common which says

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490
is probably the most common which says
 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.030
is probably the most common which says
that which maximizes good is the right

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040
that which maximizes good is the right
 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.780

thing to do
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.969
thing to do
so do that which maximizes good and we

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
so do that which maximizes good and we
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.740
so do that which maximizes good and we
aggregate across people we think of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
aggregate across people we think of
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.530
aggregate across people we think of
individuals as containers of utility and

famous version is probably contain ism

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
famous version is probably contain ism
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.990
famous version is probably contain ism
and here there is idea that even if

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
and here there is idea that even if
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.820

something would maximize good states of

we sometimes have obligations to do

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
we sometimes have obligations to do
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.490
we sometimes have obligations to do
something different we have constraints

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
something different we have constraints
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.160
something different we have constraints
on what we can do and for Kant it was a

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170
on what we can do and for Kant it was a
 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.900
on what we can do and for Kant it was a
question of whether the maxim behind

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910
question of whether the maxim behind
 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.300
question of whether the maxim behind
your action could result in a universal

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310
your action could result in a universal

so contents think about things like

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
so contents think about things like
 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.620
so contents think about things like
rights they think can add things like

Aristotle and these folks think that
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.140
Aristotle and these folks think that
instead of thinking about the right or

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150
instead of thinking about the right or
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.180
instead of thinking about the right or
the good instead we ought to think about

make human beings better versus worse
 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.650
make human beings better versus worse
and when we think about what to do we

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
and when we think about what to do we
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.660
and when we think about what to do we
ask ourselves what would a virtuous

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670
ask ourselves what would a virtuous
 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.970
ask ourselves what would a virtuous
agent do in this situation so that's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980
agent do in this situation so that's
 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.440
agent do in this situation so that's
another way of approaching the problem a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450
another way of approaching the problem a
 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.540
another way of approaching the problem a
little bit more abstractly and in the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550
little bit more abstractly and in the
 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.790
little bit more abstractly and in the
ideal world those two approaches kind of

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800
ideal world those two approaches kind of
