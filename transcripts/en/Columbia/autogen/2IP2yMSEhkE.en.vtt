let me talk about the centrality of

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040
let me talk about the centrality of
 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.400
let me talk about the centrality of
energy I want to talk with you about

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410
energy I want to talk with you about
 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.220
energy I want to talk with you about
energy and sustainability management and

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230
energy and sustainability management and
 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.110
energy and sustainability management and
again just as I have in the other

at first I talk about the technical
 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.070
at first I talk about the technical
technological challenges what are the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
technological challenges what are the
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.900
technological challenges what are the
technologies that we have to focus on

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
technologies that we have to focus on
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.710
technologies that we have to focus on
then there's the issue of finance and

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720
then there's the issue of finance and
 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.330
then there's the issue of finance and
all of this new technology and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340
all of this new technology and
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.759
all of this new technology and

is the issue of organizational capacity

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
is the issue of organizational capacity
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.209
is the issue of organizational capacity
if we have the technology and we have

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
if we have the technology and we have
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.160

of the students mentioned to me that's

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030
of the students mentioned to me that's
 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.180
of the students mentioned to me that's
true that there's a lot of new natural

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190
true that there's a lot of new natural
 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.800
true that there's a lot of new natural
gas coming online and it's very

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810
gas coming online and it's very
 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.960
gas coming online and it's very
inexpensive and it's it can be less

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
inexpensive and it's it can be less
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.740

polluting but it also is a hydrocarbon

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
polluting but it also is a hydrocarbon

and if we can think of and getting it

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080
and if we can think of and getting it
 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.810

out of the ground is not always
cost-free environmentally and so we need

cost-free environmentally and so we need
 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.050
cost-free environmentally and so we need
to think about another energy paths but

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060
to think about another energy paths but
 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.470
to think about another energy paths but
we need to worry about the fossil fuels

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480
we need to worry about the fossil fuels
 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.890
we need to worry about the fossil fuels
emissions we need to worry about the

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900
emissions we need to worry about the
 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.800
emissions we need to worry about the
environmental damage of extraction the

Gulf oil spill is an example of that
 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.550
Gulf oil spill is an example of that
there's lots of other examples of it

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560
there's lots of other examples of it
 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.510
there's lots of other examples of it
when you host fossil fuels out of the

require buildings vehicles and

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960
require buildings vehicles and
 

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.590
require buildings vehicles and
appliances to meet energy efficiency

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:40.600
appliances to meet energy efficiency
 

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:43.280
appliances to meet energy efficiency
standards that's government regulation

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:43.290
standards that's government regulation
 

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.049
standards that's government regulation
programs are funded by surcharges on

00:27:46.049 --> 00:27:46.059
programs are funded by surcharges on
 

00:27:46.059 --> 00:27:48.120
programs are funded by surcharges on
utility bills and they have increasingly

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.130
utility bills and they have increasingly
 

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:51.000
utility bills and they have increasingly
encouraged best management practices in

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.010
encouraged best management practices in
 

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.970
encouraged best management practices in
the case of renewable energy tax credits

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:53.980
the case of renewable energy tax credits
 

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.500
the case of renewable energy tax credits
are used to encourage development and

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:55.510
are used to encourage development and
 

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.840
are used to encourage development and
the use of renewable energy facilities

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:57.850
the use of renewable energy facilities
 

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.510
the use of renewable energy facilities
we can use the tax system to make those

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:00.520
we can use the tax system to make those
 

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.680
we can use the tax system to make those
risky investments pay off faster and

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:03.690
risky investments pay off faster and
 

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.830
risky investments pay off faster and
capital in two of those uses you can use

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840
capital in two of those uses you can use
 

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.540
capital in two of those uses you can use
things like the municipal bond market

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:09.550
things like the municipal bond market
 

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:12.450
things like the municipal bond market
where the interest is tax free to the

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:12.460
where the interest is tax free to the
 

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.299
where the interest is tax free to the
recipient who's benefiting from that to

00:28:15.299 --> 00:28:15.309
recipient who's benefiting from that to
 

00:28:15.309 --> 00:28:17.760
recipient who's benefiting from that to
encourage more investment in these kinds

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:17.770
encourage more investment in these kinds
 

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.330
encourage more investment in these kinds
of technologies accelerating the use of

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340
of technologies accelerating the use of
 

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.890
of technologies accelerating the use of
renewable energy is going to require a

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:22.900
renewable energy is going to require a
 

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.990
renewable energy is going to require a
lot of government activity government

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:25.000
lot of government activity government
 

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.669
lot of government activity government
has to fund the basic research and

00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:26.679
has to fund the basic research and
 

00:28:26.679 --> 00:28:28.560
has to fund the basic research and
development government money has to go

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:28.570
development government money has to go
 

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:33.120
development government money has to go
into that low cost solar cell that small

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.130
into that low cost solar cell that small
 

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.120
into that low cost solar cell that small
solar cell and that battery because the

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.130
solar cell and that battery because the
 

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.680
solar cell and that battery because the
private sector doesn't have the

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:37.690
private sector doesn't have the
 

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.020
private sector doesn't have the
resources and won't spend the money for

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:40.030
resources and won't spend the money for
 

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.370
resources and won't spend the money for
something with that long a turnaround

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:41.380
something with that long a turnaround
 

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.180
something with that long a turnaround
time government has to alter the cost

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:45.190
time government has to alter the cost
 

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.340
time government has to alter the cost
advantage of fossil fuels but again my

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:47.350
advantage of fossil fuels but again my
 

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:49.080
advantage of fossil fuels but again my
own view of it is not by raising the

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.090
own view of it is not by raising the
 

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:50.850
own view of it is not by raising the
cost of fossil fuels but by lowering the

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:50.860
cost of fossil fuels but by lowering the
 

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.070
cost of fossil fuels but by lowering the
cost of renewable energy now that's

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:53.080
cost of renewable energy now that's
 

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.100
cost of renewable energy now that's
not an accepted part of economic wisdom

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:56.110
not an accepted part of economic wisdom
 

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.320
not an accepted part of economic wisdom
but I think that is something that we're

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:58.330
but I think that is something that we're
 

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.390
but I think that is something that we're
going to see a change because the

00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:00.400
going to see a change because the
 

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.180
going to see a change because the
because raising the price of fossil

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:03.190
because raising the price of fossil
 

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.420
because raising the price of fossil
fuels just seems to be too hard and with

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:06.430
fuels just seems to be too hard and with
 

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.940
fuels just seems to be too hard and with
the increased natural gas availability I

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:08.950
the increased natural gas availability I
 

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.760
the increased natural gas availability I
think it's really not going to happen

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:10.770
think it's really not going to happen
 

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.920
think it's really not going to happen
organized momentum entrenched interests

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:13.930
organized momentum entrenched interests
 

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:16.290
organized momentum entrenched interests
and institutional inertia makes it

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:16.300
and institutional inertia makes it
 

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.750
and institutional inertia makes it
difficult to transition from fossil

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:18.760
difficult to transition from fossil
 

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.060
difficult to transition from fossil
fuels to renewables there's a lot of

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:21.070
fuels to renewables there's a lot of
 

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.430
fuels to renewables there's a lot of
vested interests every gasoline station

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440
vested interests every gasoline station
 

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:26.180
vested interests every gasoline station
owner in America is a vested interest

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.190
owner in America is a vested interest
 

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:29.040
owner in America is a vested interest
promoting fossil fuel use all the people

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:29.050
promoting fossil fuel use all the people
 

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.470
promoting fossil fuel use all the people
that operate and owned all that

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:31.480
that operate and owned all that
 

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.660
that operate and owned all that
infrastructure you know are going to

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:33.670
infrastructure you know are going to
 

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:37.580
infrastructure you know are going to
resist anything new coming in and so

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:37.590
resist anything new coming in and so
 

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.290
resist anything new coming in and so
there's also lots of money in fossil

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:40.300
there's also lots of money in fossil
 

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.990
there's also lots of money in fossil
fuels the you know these BP and shell

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.000
fuels the you know these BP and shell
 

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.820
fuels the you know these BP and shell
and so on ExxonMobil they make a lot of

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:44.830
and so on ExxonMobil they make a lot of
 

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.560
and so on ExxonMobil they make a lot of
money and they have a lot of political

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:46.570
money and they have a lot of political
 

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:49.860
money and they have a lot of political
power and so if there's going to be

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:49.870
power and so if there's going to be
 

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.720
power and so if there's going to be
changed here it's going to only be

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:51.730
changed here it's going to only be
 

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:54.630
changed here it's going to only be
because there's a counter force in

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640
because there's a counter force in
 

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.700
because there's a counter force in
society that pushes it through the

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:56.710
society that pushes it through the
 

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.220
society that pushes it through the
political process so government has to

00:29:59.220 --> 00:29:59.230
political process so government has to
 

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.440
political process so government has to
use the tax system to encourage

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:01.450
use the tax system to encourage
 

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.830
use the tax system to encourage
investment in renewables and to try to

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840
investment in renewables and to try to
 

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.410
investment in renewables and to try to
provide access to lower-cost capital and

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:07.420
provide access to lower-cost capital and
 

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.630
provide access to lower-cost capital and
to try to encourage entrepreneurs to put

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640
to try to encourage entrepreneurs to put
 

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.320
to try to encourage entrepreneurs to put
their capital into renewable energy so

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:13.330
their capital into renewable energy so
 

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.660
their capital into renewable energy so
let me conclude the transition from

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:15.670
let me conclude the transition from
 

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.640
let me conclude the transition from
fossil fuels is the most important

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:17.650
fossil fuels is the most important
 

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.410
fossil fuels is the most important
element of a sustainable economy and

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:19.420
element of a sustainable economy and
 

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.080
element of a sustainable economy and
planet this is the heart of the issue in

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.090
planet this is the heart of the issue in
 

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.210
planet this is the heart of the issue in
the u.s. it's going to take a major

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:24.220
the u.s. it's going to take a major
 

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.520
the u.s. it's going to take a major
effort by government and a real

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:26.530
effort by government and a real
 

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:28.590
effort by government and a real
partnership with the private sector and

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600
partnership with the private sector and
 

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.090
partnership with the private sector and
I should mention the US isn't alone in

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:30.100
I should mention the US isn't alone in
 

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.730
I should mention the US isn't alone in
this Europe is working on this China is

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:32.740
this Europe is working on this China is
 

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.740
this Europe is working on this China is
working on this you're seeing this in

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:34.750
working on this you're seeing this in
 

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:37.380
working on this you're seeing this in
Latin America all over the world this

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:37.390
Latin America all over the world this
 

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.710
Latin America all over the world this
technology is being worked on and people

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:40.720
technology is being worked on and people
 

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.290
technology is being worked on and people
are paying attention to this changeover

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:43.300
are paying attention to this changeover
 

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.900
are paying attention to this changeover
but if you solve the energy problem you

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:45.910
but if you solve the energy problem you
 

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:47.610
but if you solve the energy problem you
solve the water problem because you can

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:47.620
solve the water problem because you can
 

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.830
solve the water problem because you can
desalinate and transport water wherever

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840
desalinate and transport water wherever
 

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.290
desalinate and transport water wherever
you need it you solve the food problem

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:52.300
you need it you solve the food problem
 

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.240
you need it you solve the food problem
because food basically needs water and

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:54.250
because food basically needs water and
 

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:56.910
because food basically needs water and
nitrogen and those things can be solved

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:56.920
nitrogen and those things can be solved
 

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.890
nitrogen and those things can be solved
by solving the energy problem and of

00:30:58.890 --> 00:30:58.900
by solving the energy problem and of
 

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.510
by solving the energy problem and of
course climate change and ecosystem

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:00.520
course climate change and ecosystem
 

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.240
course climate change and ecosystem
destruction is all helped by solving the

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:03.250
destruction is all helped by solving the
 

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.760
destruction is all helped by solving the
energy problem
