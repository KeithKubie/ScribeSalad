00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.442
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:06.900
ASHLEY CHANG: How
you doing, Daron?

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:07.630
DARON ROBERTS: Doing well.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:08.505
It's good to be here.

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:11.330
I left Austin, it
was 75 degrees.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.900
ASHLEY CHANG: And we're
even less than 57,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.830
the opposite, right?

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.160
DARON ROBERTS: But it's good.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.660
It's good.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.650
I brought scarves, I got
hats, all the things.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.500
ASHLEY CHANG: You
got a Google beanie.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.300
DARON ROBERTS: Beanies, yes.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.216
I got a Google beanie.

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:23.200
ASHLEY CHANG: We have supplied
him with some Google swag.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.502
So we are really excited to
have you here today, Daron.

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:26.960
DARON ROBERTS: I'm
glad to be here.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.242
Thank you for having me.

00:00:28.242 --> 00:00:29.950
ASHLEY CHANG: So my
name is Ashley Chang,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.360
and today, I'm just so excited
to introduce all of you

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.160
to Daron K. Roberts.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.070
Daron has an amazing story.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.410
It's not conventional
in any means.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.470
Daron is a Harvard
Law School grad

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.620
turned NFL coach turned
best selling author.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.570
And now, he is a lecturer at the
University of Texas at Austin,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.330
where he actually started
a center for sports

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.960
leadership and innovation.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.574
He's the founding
director there.

00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:02.990
DARON ROBERTS:
Yes, it's been fun.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.387
And I chase five little people,
ages seven to seven months.

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:10.970
This is great.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.717
I'm glad to be here.

00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:13.800
This is a break from home.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.305
It's good.

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:14.640
ASHLEY CHANG: Good.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.720
So we'll talk about a
lot of things today.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.540
We'll talk about his
book, "Call an Audible."

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.460
Congratulations on your book.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.910
Amazon-- it was one of their
number one new releases.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.850
Sports Illustrated said this is
one of the best sports business

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.950
books of 2017.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.992
No big deal, right?

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:32.200
DARON ROBERTS: It's been fun.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.366
It was one of those things--

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:36.100
I don't know if people are like
me, where you have this Google

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.340
Doc, and it's been living for
five to six years with ideas.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.740
And that was where I
was with this book.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.090
I had been working on an
introduction for four years.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.240
And I finally just woke up one
morning and told my wife, OK.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.430
Six days a week,
two hours a day,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.040
I'm going to write
from 3:30 to 5:30.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.900
I'm going to go to
the same coffee shop,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.360
turn off the Wi-Fi, and just go.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.950
And she's like, Godspeed.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.960
And we did it, and it was funny.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.250
ASHLEY CHANG: Here it is.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.333
DARON ROBERTS: Here it is.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.360
It's actually tangible.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.930
ASHLEY CHANG: Amazing.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.770
And I have one, too.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.169
It's my own special copy.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.759
I love it.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.630
DARON ROBERTS: Do you read it
before you go to bed at night?

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.130
ASHLEY CHANG: I do.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.840
Well, I've already read it.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.790
And I'll read it again
maybe after this talk.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.230
DARON ROBERTS: And you can buy
more copies if you need to.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.390
ASHLEY CHANG: OK so I
can't go through you?

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.515
I got to go through Amazon?

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.140
DARON ROBERTS: Better
to go through me.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.030
Yeah, a better take.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.425
I got five college tuitions.

00:02:24.425 --> 00:02:25.300
ASHLEY CHANG: Gotcha.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.550
We have to support the family.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.230
I understand.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.250
So Daron, you've done
a lot, but I also

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.770
want to mention
in his free time,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.090
Daron also started and leads a
nonprofit football camp for--

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.410
is it high school students?

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.910
DARON ROBERTS: High
school students.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.320
So these are not blue
chip athletes, right?

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.590
These are high school, try hard,
I love football Daron types.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.710
And we take them for a week--

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.780
40 high school students.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.920
And in the morning it's yoga
and meditation and reflection,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.040
and then we play football
for about 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.680
Then it's three
hours of ACT prep.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.510
And we built a
curriculum where we

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.460
have taken the ACT math
section and translated it

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.500
into football examples.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.640
So we teach geometry and
algebra using a football field

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.032
as a grid.

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.490
And then at night,
we have a series

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.000
of two workshops--
so social media

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.240
etiquette, dress etiquette,
how to write thank you notes.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.640
And it's been a
wonderful program.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.990
We've had 500 kids come
through in the last nine years.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.120
ASHLEY CHANG: That's phenomenal.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.830
It's really nice
to know that you

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.141
are giving back to the community
and teaching practical skills,

00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:42.640
right?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.390
Yes, the academic piece, but
also, what should you wear?

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.270
How can you present
yourself in a way that

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.499
is the best reflection of you?

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:52.540
DARON ROBERTS: The social
media class-- oh, geez.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.610
So part of the
application process

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.070
is they have to list their
social media handles.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.770
And then we have
a team of people

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.660
who we scrub all of
their handles, platforms,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.224
and take screenshots of the
good, the bad, and the ugly.

00:04:11.224 --> 00:04:12.640
And they don't
know what's coming.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.070
And so on day four, I
kind of just walk up.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.230
And I'll have this dummy
slide up about, hey,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.790
how to make a speech.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.880
And then slide two
will be someone's post

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.970
where it's nothing but
profanity and drinking a beer.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.796
Hey, who is this?

00:04:28.796 --> 00:04:29.920
And everyone's embarrassed.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.794
Oh my gosh, I can't
believe he would do that.

00:04:31.794 --> 00:04:32.660
I say, now, hold on.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.130
There are 2 billion
people out there

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.140
on some form of social media.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.760
Why would you be embarrassed?

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.700
And so we start there
and then kind of work

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.885
through how they can
present a good image online.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:46.010
ASHLEY CHANG: That's great.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.730
I think with technology
and with all social media,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.030
it's so easy to just write
something or post something.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.730
But if you were to
actually sit in a stage

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.770
and have the whole
world, maybe you

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.026
would say that maybe your
students or other folks

00:04:59.026 --> 00:05:00.400
wouldn't actually
post that much.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.233
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.880
And all the research right
now is showing that so much

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.700
of what we do online
is subconscious.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.360
So they're showing
people tweets, posts

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.240
that they've liked or
shared and asking them

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.320
if they recognize them.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.200
And the rate's around 25%.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.647
So you're just scrolling,
scrolling, scrolling,

00:05:19.647 --> 00:05:21.480
scrolling, scrolling,
like here, heart here,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.560
heart there, and it becomes
sort of stream of consciousness.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.080
And so really for
us, we're trying

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.090
to get the students to be more
intentional and deliberate

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.980
about their move.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.350
So when you hit
the heart button,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.750
we say for employers
or other schools,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.890
that is an endorsement.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.210
So you need to think about, do I
want to cosign on this message?

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.910
ASHLEY CHANG: And this is
all in his free time, right?

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.625
So in addition to the
4th and 1 football camp,

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:51.720
Daron also leads a
industry leading podcast.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.900
And he's also the chief
of the Donut Council,

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.400
which is probably going to be
my favorite part of this talk.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.970
And We'll tell you a little
bit more about that later.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.680
And like I mentioned
in some of the comms

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.510
that you might have
seen before, we will--

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.340
I've promised them,
if it's OK with you--

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.170
we will talk about Kevin Durant.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.615
And we will talk about
donuts, which you love.

00:06:09.615 --> 00:06:10.990
DARON ROBERTS:
Durant and donuts.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.520
I can do that.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.120
ASHLEY CHANG: Good.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.620
done.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.150
Is that all right with you all?

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.411
OK, sounds good.

00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:17.410
So why don't we just start
at the beginning, OK?

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.429
You're Texas born and raised.

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:20.220
DARON ROBERTS: Yes.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.460
ASHLEY CHANG: And when
you were a teenager, kid,

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.720
what were your dreams?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.590
DARON ROBERTS: So fifth
generation east Texan

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.280
would sit at-- my dad showed me
this map of this Panola County

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.140
where he's from, and it was
a census tract from 1870.

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.940
And there's a plot of land that
has 153 acres and the name Bill

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.860
Roberts, and it's 1870, right?

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.050
So he points to the map.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.640
He points to me.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.195
And he says, this is why you
will never have any excuses.

00:06:51.195 --> 00:06:53.100
I'm like, what the
hell's he talking about?

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.060
I don't know.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.140
And then I find out that
my great great grandfather

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.940
finds a way to get 153 acres
in a county that sent troops

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.400
to the Confederacy.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.010
How does a black man in 1870--

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.920
how do you do that?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.730
And so my last
book will be this.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:13.770
I want to present three
different scenarios

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.440
in a fictional way of
what could have happened.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.700
But that sort of set
the stage for me of,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.250
OK, I got to pull the
top off of my goals.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.180
And so I wanted to be the
governor of Texas by 40.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.482
I turned 40 in November.

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:29.940
ASHLEY CHANG: You
can adjust to 41.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.814
DARON ROBERTS: I took
a wrong turn somewhere.

00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:35.160
Yeah, kind of push it out.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.820
I wanted to be the
governor, and so I

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.250
thought that was undergrad,
government pre-law, law school,

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.260
practice somewhere,
run for Congress--

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.430
a very linear if A then B,
if B then C. And now my life

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.180
is just like a sketch pad.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.430
ASHLEY CHANG: Well, I love it.

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:55.560
I think it's just a
different direction.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.015
OK, so let's talk about law.

00:07:57.015 --> 00:07:59.010
So you wanted to
go to law school.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:07:59.940
Why law school?

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.700
Was it because you
wanted to be governor?

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.909
And then I know you kind
of talked about Harvard.

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:06.450
There was something
about that school

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.627
that really drew you there.

00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:08.460
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.040
Gregory Peck had a
lot to do with it.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.000
If I think about the
imagery that really

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.050
made me think about law
school, "To Kill a Mockingbird"

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:19.800
comes to mind.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.590
And scenes where
this powerful figure

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:26.580
being able to influence
the community around him--

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.500
that was one image
that stood out for me.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.310
And then my dad bought a book.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.674
It was a biography
of Thurgood Marshall.

00:08:35.674 --> 00:08:37.049
I just remember
this image of him

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:40.500
standing on the steps
of the Supreme Court

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.860
after Brown v. Board
and thinking to myself,

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.800
I want to be like that guy.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.640
And so everything was
channeled towards law school.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.326
And I'm at the
University of Texas.

00:08:53.326 --> 00:08:54.450
I'm student body president.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.110
I had great grades.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.335
I'm like, I'm just
going to walk in.

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:57.360
ASHLEY CHANG: It's
going to be easy, right?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.200
DARON ROBERTS: It's
going to be easy.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.200
They're going to be like,
oh, we've been waiting

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.710
for you for the last 18 years.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.580
ASHLEY CHANG: Welcome, Daron.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.450
DARON ROBERTS: Welcome, welcome.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.320
Finally, right?

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:09.300
And I get the letter back,
and it's the old wait list.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.530
So it's, we like you,
we like some more people

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:14.800
a lot more than you.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.407
ASHLEY CHANG: And you're
like, how is this possible?

00:09:17.407 --> 00:09:19.740
DARON ROBERTS: In the event
that all of them tell us no,

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.500
we may call you back.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.690
But if you have better
options, don't wait for us.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.880
ASHLEY CHANG: I feel like
that's worse than a no.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.110
DARON ROBERTS: Yes it is.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.770
It is.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.060
Because it's like you're close.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.560
It's funny.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.410
At the time, I thought
I wanted the no.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.010
But in retrospect, I think the
wait list was probably better,

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.890
because there's this
little glimmer of hope

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.850
that I could somehow alter
the situation in some way.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.310
But I got listed
four years in a row.

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.710
So Gwen Robertson,
my mom's, like,

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.755
just do something
with your life.

00:09:51.755 --> 00:09:52.630
I worked on the Hill.

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.180
I went to the Kennedy School.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.872
And then the fourth
year, I got in.

00:09:55.872 --> 00:09:57.330
ASHLEY CHANG: And
was it everything

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.570
you imagined and more?

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.899
DARON ROBERTS: It was worse.

00:10:00.899 --> 00:10:01.440
It was worse.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.023
It was a hell.

00:10:04.745 --> 00:10:05.430
It was.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:07.630
It was.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:08.970
ASHLEY CHANG: Good, I like this.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.760
DARON ROBERTS: I
was about to lie.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.384
I was about to
blatantly lie to myself.

00:10:11.384 --> 00:10:13.620
I'm like, no, it was bad.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.370
It's an interesting
place, right?

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.720
So you have 550 students come
into a class, and everyone's so

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.980
high strung.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.980
You've got the folks who are
just fresh out of undergrad,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.040
so they're going berserk.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.560
Every single second of the day,
the gunners on the front row.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.680
I had worked for a while,
so I was kind of chill.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.180
I had to make sure
I got the Dunkin'

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.569
Donuts before going into class.

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:35.610
ASHLEY CHANG: Priorities.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.110
DARON ROBERTS:
Priorities, priorities.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.740
But it was fun.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.860
I think I enjoy
being challenged.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.270
And I did like the grind
of the 1L first year.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.387
In the library, you kind
of stink a little bit.

00:10:48.387 --> 00:10:50.220
You're reading stuff,
you're falling asleep.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.010
I liked that piece of it.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.470
But I knew there was something
else I should probably

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.387
be doing with life.

00:10:56.387 --> 00:10:58.470
ASHLEY CHANG: And so this
talk is all about risks.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.670
And your story in itself
is really interesting--

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.880
to pivot so many
different times.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.290
And I'd like to know--

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.090
it was your summer
internship, right?

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:11.880
Your first summer
internship in law school--

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.060
tell us about that
experience and how you felt.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:22.260
DARON ROBERTS: So I worked at
name ampersand name, name, name

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.370
in DC.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.310
And I remember the
first day walking

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:33.130
in working my way to my office
and recognizing the fact

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.040
that no one had smiled--

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.210
receptionist, insert
first year associate,

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.099
insert 30 year partner.

00:11:42.099 --> 00:11:42.890
I thought, wow, OK.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.385
Maybe it's just a rough time.

00:11:45.385 --> 00:11:48.370
The was the summer.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:54.310
And the highlight-- first
day, this first year associate

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.850
comes in.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.600
Hey, man, what are
you doing for lunch?

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.024
I'm like, I don't
have any plans.

00:11:57.024 --> 00:11:58.190
You're going with me, right?

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.981
ASHLEY CHANG: You're
like, this guy's nice.

00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:01.300
DARON ROBERTS: It's great.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.200
We go to lunch.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.820
He's not talking to me.

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.235
It's 2006, he was on a
BlackBerry, you know.

00:12:07.235 --> 00:12:08.860
And I'm like, hey,
man, how's it going?

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.443
We're talking.

00:12:09.443 --> 00:12:11.890
He's like, I just love it
when you summers get here,

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:13.630
because we get our
lunches comped.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.270
ASHLEY CHANG: Oh my gosh.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:14.853
So he didn't--

00:12:14.853 --> 00:12:16.860
DARON ROBERTS: It's recruiting.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.020
ASHLEY CHANG: He wanted you
there not necessarily to talk

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.940
to you but to eat the lunch.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:23.050
DARON ROBERTS: Yes.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.190
So then I thought, wow.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.300
The highlight of
this grown man's life

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.702
is a comped summer intern lunch?

00:12:31.702 --> 00:12:34.243
ASHLEY CHANG: You're like, this
is not really what I thought.

00:12:34.243 --> 00:12:36.430
DARON ROBERTS: This is not.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.910
So I remember going back to
law school, thinking, OK.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.440
There's probably something else.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.230
And that's when my
buddy the next year

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.990
calls me to go to
work a football camp.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:50.620
And we were both
try hard players.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.140
There were no teams beating
down our door in high school

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.967
saying, come play for us.

00:12:55.967 --> 00:12:58.050
But he was a football
coach-- a high school coach.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.570
And he said, hey, come to the
South Carolina football camp.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.519
So I get there, and
they need someone

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:06.310
to fill in for a coach
who hadn't shown up.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.260
So I'm thinking, I
played Texas football.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.265
I know what's going on.

00:13:10.265 --> 00:13:12.439
So I raised my hand,
and I'm like, yo.

00:13:12.439 --> 00:13:13.230
Where do you coach?

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.771
I'm like, Mount
Pleasant High School.

00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:17.500
He's like, all right,
Mount Pleasant High School.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.500
You have group six.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.000
Yes sir.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.160
I'm like, what the
hell's he talking about?

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.510
Group six was 60
sixth graders, none

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:29.380
of whom had any athletic
talent whatsoever.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.240
Mamas had taken them to
academy to get swooshes,

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.790
and they were
protecting the house.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.260
And they were doing
it and could not back

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.360
pedal the length of
this stage, and they

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.790
had a coach who couldn't coach.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.660
Best 72 hours my life.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.060
there are these
very brief moments

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.480
in football where
socioeconomic status goes

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.230
out the window, what side
of town you live, religion.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.680
You're just trying to get
11 people on the same page.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.830
And I recognized
for me, that became

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.180
a new form of public service.

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:10.310
So I started the journey
to try to become a coach.

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:12.250
ASHLEY CHANG: So I
think many of us--

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.110
I'm sure you might agree--

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.240
often times, we have
inklings to do things.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.970
We see certain passions.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.700
But what was it that
got you from feeling

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.850
that you love this thing
and shoving it away as like,

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:28.390
OK, that was a great
72 hour vacation,

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.940
and then turning it
into something tangible

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:34.820
and deciding you wanted
to coach football?

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.320
DARON ROBERTS: So
Brene Brown says--

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.200
she says, emotions are data.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.750
And I could not get away
from the feeling in my gut.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.020
Even when I left the camp,
I go back to Cambridge,

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.230
it was in my mind.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.930
It was this uneasy
feeling in my stomach.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:55.630
And I've also just
been of the belief--

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.480
my dad's a Baptist minister.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.990
So if you walk into the
Mount Olive Baptist Church

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:05.460
on a Sunday at 12:24
PM, Kurt Roberts

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.440
is going to be
standing up saying,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.490
you don't know when
you're going to die.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.410
You better get right with Jesus.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.030
And I think hearing
that for so long--

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.350
just the delicate
nature of mortality.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.050
You don't know.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.300
We assume so much.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.571
I've always thought, let me try
to pull these things that I'm

00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:27.445
thinking about putting
off into the distance.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:32.025
Let me pull them into
the present tense,

00:15:32.025 --> 00:15:34.150
because I don't know if I
get to retirement, right?

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.460
And people are like,
oh, just go practice,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.040
and then you can do that
sort of as a retirement job.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.030
I'm like, who says I get
to retirement, right?

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:48.370
So from that step,
I went into Excel--

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.060
which, if this was 2018, I
would have gone into Sheets.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.230
And I went through
every team in the NFL,

00:15:56.230 --> 00:16:00.340
and I found their address
and every coach on staff.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:04.300
And I went through every bio and
tried to find some connection.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.480
Are you from Texas?

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.567
Then you're getting
a letter from me.

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:10.150
Did you study
government in undergrad?

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:11.483
You're getting a letter from me.

00:16:11.483 --> 00:16:14.050
And I just wrote multiple
letters to every team

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:14.960
in the NFL.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:18.100
ASHLEY CHANG: So this is one of
my favorite parts of this book,

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:22.070
and I'm going to read a
piece of one of the letters.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.359
Dear Coach, and you sounded
exactly like this, right?

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.525
DARON ROBERTS: Yes, exactly.

00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:26.566
ASHLEY CHANG: Dear Coach.

00:16:26.566 --> 00:16:29.920
I am a third year student
at Harvard Law School,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.220
and I want to become
a football coach.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.580
After just three days of
working as a volunteer coach,

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.460
I realized that changing the
life trajectories of young men

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.850
can be fulfilled by coaching a
sport that I fell in love first

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.290
in high school.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.190
I understand that you receive
countless letters each year,

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.330
but I promise I will work
harder than anybody else you are

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.190
considering for this position.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.840
And then you went
down, and you said

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.460
some other wonderful things.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.770
And then ended with,
please just consider me

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.260
for any entry level position
you may have available.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:03.760
So what?

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.999
You sent this out to
many, many, many people.

00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:08.398
DARON ROBERTS: Yes.

00:17:08.398 --> 00:17:14.770
My last name wasn't Belichick,
and I didn't have any buddies.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.359
There was no in.

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:21.790
So for me, I knew the only
way that I could break in

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.140
would be to start at not
even the bottom, below

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.209
the totem pole.

00:17:28.209 --> 00:17:29.500
ASHLEY CHANG: So what happened?

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.430
You sent this, and--

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.830
DARON ROBERTS: I sent this,
and I got 31 rejections.

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:36.490
So Belichick, Tomlin, you
name it, going down the list.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.535
John Fox-- all these
teams are saying no.

00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:41.955
And it gets to a point
where this is April.

00:17:41.955 --> 00:17:45.190
This is two months
before I'm graduating.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.890
And my classmates are
going to the Supreme

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:52.585
Court, and the White House, and
insert banking, I bank here.

00:17:52.585 --> 00:17:56.079
And I'm just waiting on one yes.

00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:57.870
And I finally get a
call one day from a guy

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.162
named Herm Edwards, who was a
Kansas City Chiefs head coach.

00:18:02.162 --> 00:18:03.870
And he's like, hey,
this is Herm Edwards.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:05.500
I need to talk
with Daron Roberts.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.340
So I think it's a prank.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.290
And I'm about to
say something that

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:14.210
was not going to get me a job.

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:15.750
I'm like, yes, sir?

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.620
He said, hey.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.060
I don't open my mail.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.400
My secretary put this
letter on my desk.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.450
What's wrong with you?

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.730
So I said, well, nothing
that's been documented.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:28.977
I work this camp.

00:18:28.977 --> 00:18:30.060
He's like, yeah, whatever.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:30.990
OK, here's the deal.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.882
He's like, take out
a pen and paper.

00:18:32.882 --> 00:18:34.630
I take out the pen.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:35.620
Training camp intern.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.295
I'm like, yes.

00:18:36.295 --> 00:18:37.420
Training camp intern.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:43.000
No pay-- it gets better-- no
benefits, and then he says,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.040
18 hour days.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.250
So I'm going back
to employment law.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.510
I'm like, this has got to
be some kind of a claim.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:53.075
I'm like, 18 hour days?

00:18:53.075 --> 00:18:55.640
He goes, are you in?

00:18:55.640 --> 00:19:00.020
And this three seconds
sort of window--

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.840
and I knew I couldn't ask for
any clarifying information.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.170
I said yes.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.030
He's like, OK.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.960
Graduate from law school,
get here, hangs the phone up.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.850
So I drove June 6 from
Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:19.200
to Kansas City, Missouri
in a 2002 Chevy Tahoe

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.871
that I still own,
because I'm cheap.

00:19:22.871 --> 00:19:24.620
It's also why I'm a
Planet Fitness member.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.869
ASHLEY CHANG: And [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:25.869 --> 00:19:27.990
DARON ROBERTS: Yes.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.990
ASHLEY CHANG: We talked
about that a great deal.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.550
DARON ROBERTS: Yes.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.120
And I was the grunt.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.850
I didn't sign a piece
of paper in six months.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.370
If you were to google Daron
Roberts Kansas City Chiefs

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.850
in 2007, nothing would come up.

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.740
I was, hey, Daron.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.130
Offensive linemen
would say, hey,

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.550
we need 40 barbecue sandwiches.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:50.510
Yes Sir.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.240
I go downtown, get the
sandwiches, bring them back.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.180
The defensive lineman-- hey,
we need two cases of dip--

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.340
Skoal.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.080
I go, fine.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.330
I go to 7-Eleven, trying to
get as much dip as I could,

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.890
take it back.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.800
I slept at Arrowhead
for six months.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.320
I got a twin blowup mattress.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.220
And I just wanted
to be the first face

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.880
that Herm Edwards saw when he
walked into the office 4:30

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.020
every morning.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:18.770
I was right there.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:21.890
And I was the last face he
saw when he left at 11:00 PM.

00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:26.360
ASHLEY CHANG: And how did you
decide to give up law school?

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:31.100
And I'm sure--
that life for this?

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.650
DARON ROBERTS: I had a
professor, David Wilkins,

00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.320
who was a really
great mentor of mine.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.510
I'm talking with him about the
decision, and he says, listen.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.330
When you get your diploma,
what you won't find on it

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.640
is an expiration date.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.430
He said, I'm just going to
take a wild gamble here and say

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.440
that when you leave the
NFL, there will still

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.210
be legal problems going on.

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.330
So if you want to
practice, you can.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.740
He said, let me ask you this.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:02.380
How rare is this
opportunity for you?

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.840
So how many times
will NFL teams allow

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.760
you to become a coaching intern
or a training camp intern?

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.530
And so for me, I just thought
that with every opportunity

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.620
that I get, I think
to myself, OK.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.370
One, does it kind of
flow with my purpose?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.900
And that was an easy check.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.320
And then how rare is it?

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.580
Will this come around or
something like it soon?

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.310
And if the answer is no
to that, I'm taking it now

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.590
and then just adjust from there.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:31.170
ASHLEY CHANG: So tell us
more about that first year--

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.180
the good, the bad.

00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.721
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah,
coaches wouldn't

00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:35.190
talk to me for two weeks.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:38.040
I had all these coaches on staff
who were former NFL players,

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.670
and they had paid their dues.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.180
And they got this dude who
hasn't coached or played

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.127
in college just around in
the corner in a hoodie.

00:21:49.127 --> 00:21:50.460
And they're like, what the hell?

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.150
Who is this guy?

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:52.410
Why did you bring him on?

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.076
But they sort of
warmed up a little bit.

00:21:54.076 --> 00:21:56.700
First game we play at
Houston, a part of my job

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.930
is to make copies.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.820
So I make a copy of the plane
manifest for the flight.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.155
And I see Daron
Roberts, seat 40D.

00:22:04.155 --> 00:22:05.280
ASHLEY CHANG: There you go.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:08.130
DARON ROBERTS: I'm
like, bam, bam, bam.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.810
This is on a Thursday.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.290
Friday, chief of staff--

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.264
hey.

00:22:15.264 --> 00:22:16.180
Get all the manifests.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.400
Throw them away.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.650
Here's the actual manifest.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.160
We had to make some changes.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.740
40D-- no Daron Roberts.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.605
So someone in the organization
had yanked my name.

00:22:28.605 --> 00:22:31.225
They thought that I had
not paid my dues yet--

00:22:31.225 --> 00:22:34.487
a pretty high up person
in the organization.

00:22:34.487 --> 00:22:35.320
So I said, screw it.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.740
I bought a Southwest flight from
Kansas City, Missouri to Hobby.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.370
I land in Houston.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.670
I know where the team hotel
is that Saturday Night.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.430
I'm the first person
on the team to get off.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.790
Herm walks in, and he's
like, dude, this guy.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.994
He was like, what are you doing?

00:22:51.994 --> 00:22:53.410
He's like, were
you on the flight?

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.810
I was like, no, I took a flight.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:55.230
Hey, listen.

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.100
I don't want to be in the way.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.390
I'm just going to sit
in the back of the room.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.620
If you need me-- he's like, we
probably won't need you, Daron.

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.070
But just stay out of the way.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.590
Cool.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.229
Special teams coach--
he's like, hey.

00:23:07.229 --> 00:23:08.020
What are you doing?

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.210
I was like, hey,
I took a flight.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:09.575
ASHLEY CHANG: Surprise.

00:23:09.575 --> 00:23:10.825
DARON ROBERTS: He's like, hey.

00:23:10.825 --> 00:23:13.800
I could use you
tomorrow, because--

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.474
we had a lot of new players.

00:23:15.474 --> 00:23:16.890
And I need to be
able to find them

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.820
when we go punt or
kick off, so could you

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.820
help me wrangle players?

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:24.810
I'm like, I could, but
don't have any credentials.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:25.480
Can you kinda--

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.554
ASHLEY CHANG: Yeah.

00:23:26.554 --> 00:23:28.470
DARON ROBERTS: He's like,
let me do something.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.270
By midnight, I had credentials.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.305
By kickoff, I'm on the
sideline, and I'm in.

00:23:33.305 --> 00:23:35.430
And so I was on the flight
from that point forward.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:36.930
But I think the
point is, you really

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:42.210
have to barge your way
in, in a diplomatic way,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.850
in a non-creepy way-- which
in retrospect, it probably

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.734
was creepy.

00:23:46.734 --> 00:23:48.150
So you have to be
somewhat creepy,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:49.290
but kind of find this balance.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:49.831
I don't know.

00:23:49.831 --> 00:23:51.090
I don't have a nice--

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:51.690
ASHLEY CHANG:
Creepy factor scale?

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.250
DARON ROBERTS:
Creepy factor, right?

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.040
But I think it's so easy for
us to send emails and think

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.830
that we've done the due
diligence like the email is

00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.910
enough.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:04.830
And you need physical
presence to separate yourself

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:08.087
from all the other
folks who are trying

00:24:08.087 --> 00:24:09.170
to get into this position.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.930
ASHLEY CHANG: Today, we want
to talk about risk-taking

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.650
and certainly your story.

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.880
Do you have tips for
actionable things

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.720
that folks listening and
Googlers here can take back

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.120
to say, I have this inkling.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.920
I'd really like to do this.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.220
How can I get from
there to something

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.110
that could be my life style?

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.990
DARON ROBERTS: So there's
some really good research--

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.800
the Ikea effect.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:39.140
So who's shopped at Ikea?

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:39.800
OK.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.970
We've all done it, right?

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.490
You walk in, and you smell
those weird meatballs.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:46.155
And you're walking around--

00:24:46.155 --> 00:24:46.450
ASHLEY CHANG: You
don't like meatballs?

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:47.180
DARON ROBERTS: It's kind of odd.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.200
It's weird.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.394
Anyway, they're
like halfway cooked.

00:24:50.394 --> 00:24:52.310
ASHLEY CHANG: I don't
know what you're saying.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.570
DARON ROBERTS: So everything
looks so pristine,

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:58.740
and you're like, oh, everything
can go into my apartment.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.360
I'll pick that desk.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.555
You get the box,
and you go home.

00:25:02.555 --> 00:25:05.430
And you realize you
don't have any tools.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.190
You have never
assembled anything

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:08.930
since like third grade--

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:12.830
building the volcano
that doesn't go off.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.360
And you build this thing,
and it's a little wobbly.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.950
And one of the drawers
doesn't really pull out.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.290
But it's yours,
and you built it.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.280
We're finding that
this Ikea effect--

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.470
and think about it sunk cost.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.360
People think about
the fact that they've

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.070
dumped so much time and effort
into one course of action.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.890
They use that experience
and that ownership

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:40.760
to then talk themselves out
of taking the risk, right?

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.040
Because I've worked at
Google for eight years,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.610
and I started here,
and now I'm there.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:51.110
I'm not going to take a chance
and now become a chef, right?

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.610
What we've found
is the way to get

00:25:52.610 --> 00:26:00.910
past that is to expose
yourself to rejection.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.840
So I'm going to challenge you to
put yourself in positions where

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.180
people are telling you no, OK?

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.350
Here's another technique--
a rejection resume.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.940
You should write this down.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.564
Write this down or
tweet it to yourself

00:26:11.564 --> 00:26:14.814
or email it to
yourself or something.

00:26:14.814 --> 00:26:16.480
ASHLEY CHANG: We have
many, many, many--

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.340
DARON ROBERTS: Many forms.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.950
Take your resume,
and under education,

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.660
list all of the schools
you didn't get into.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:30.687
Work experience-- every
job you did not get.

00:26:30.687 --> 00:26:31.520
Go all the way down.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.061
For awards and
distinctions-- all the

00:26:33.061 --> 00:26:35.330
awards and honors
that you didn't get.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.960
Take it, and then send it
to all of your friends.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.780
All right?

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.470
So I do some trainings
with corporations.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.910
And I'll have the CEO or
CFO do this and then ask

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.470
her to send it out.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.852
At first, they
don't want to do it.

00:26:51.852 --> 00:26:53.810
And then they do it, and
then they send it out.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.620
And it helps to humanize
them in the organization.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.430
So someone's like, oh, I didn't
get into Berkeley either.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.320
That's great.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.070
I got turned down for
that 30 for 30 too, right?

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.280
So I think building this
comfort level with rejection

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.360
and getting the no
helps, because you

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:16.370
will document all of your big
nos in life and then realize,

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.570
I'm still alive.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.070
I'm OK.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.574
And if I get a subsequent
no from taking a risk,

00:27:22.574 --> 00:27:24.740
I'm going to survive, because
look at all the things

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:26.480
that I've been
able to withstand.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.895
So really going
through and cataloging

00:27:28.895 --> 00:27:31.174
and being very
intentional about,

00:27:31.174 --> 00:27:32.840
hey, when are the
times that I've gotten

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.240
turned down or didn't get
the big thing that I wanted

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:40.010
and comparing that to, I'm
still in a good position.

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:44.330
Let me take that as confidence
to go ahead and take more risk.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.130
So in my class,
my students-- they

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.580
go on rejection challenges.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.470
So partners-- you have
to go to Starbucks

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.150
and ask for a free drink.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.240
Your partner videotapes you.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.300
And I had them do a pre
write up and a post write up.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.630
And then we also take some
risk-seeking scores, right?

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.862
And they are so afraid--

00:28:04.862 --> 00:28:05.570
even the partner.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.397
Like, we've got the footage.

00:28:07.397 --> 00:28:08.980
ASHLEY CHANG: Can I
have a free drink?

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.040
DARON ROBERTS: The partner
who's not even getting rejected

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.007
is shaking back there.

00:28:14.007 --> 00:28:16.340
We take all the footage, and
then we splice it together.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.470
And I show it to
everyone in the class,

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.330
and that's usually a
pretty interesting day.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:25.010
But they go in, they get the
no and a macchiato, right?

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:27.470
You can hear them trembling
and their voice trembling.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:31.190
And then you have these great
papers being written where they

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:35.870
say, it wasn't so bad, right?

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.370
Beforehand, I thought
this was going

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:41.040
to be the worst experience
on the face of the planet.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.160
I got the no.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.470
It wasn't so bad.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.740
I think I'm even willing to take
a bigger risk in the future.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.220
So we're really doing a
lot of research around,

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.940
can we help to build
your rejection immunity

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.730
by exposing you to new
strains of rejection?

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:58.730
ASHLEY CHANG: Great.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.510
And so we're talking about you
as a lecturer and as a teacher

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.940
now, right?

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.960
You were an NFL coach,
and you moved on

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.330
to many different teams.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.845
And then you pivoted
again, right?

00:29:09.845 --> 00:29:12.330
So you went from
coaching in the NFL,

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:15.020
which was another
one of your dreams--

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.070
amazing work.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:18.830
And then how did you
decide, OK, time to pivot.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.240
Let me take another risk.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:20.970
Let me teach.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:21.803
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:29:21.803 --> 00:29:23.850
So that's all Dylan Roberts.

00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:25.580
So I was in Cleveland.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.350
Is anyone here from
Cleveland, before I

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.895
start making disparaging--

00:29:29.895 --> 00:29:31.520
this goes out to the
world, doesn't it?

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.270
ASHLEY CHANG: It's going to
be recorded today, Daron.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.050
DARON ROBERTS: I
know, I know, I know.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.675
So there's this place
called Cleveland.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.220
So we get to
Cleveland in 2013 we

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.560
went 4 and 12, which,
as you'll know,

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.120
is not uncommon for
the Cleveland Browns.

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.090
It was actually a
pretty damn good year.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:53.700
Unfortunately, the owner didn't
agree with that assessment.

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:58.190
And we play at Pittsburgh,
we fly back into Cleveland

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:00.290
the last game of the season.

00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:04.354
I get a text from the
owner's assistant that says,

00:30:04.354 --> 00:30:05.270
8:00 AM staff meeting.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.060
So we wake up and
go into the office.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.130
And the owner walks,
and he says, hey.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:17.130
Really appreciate all
of your contributions.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.260
You're all fired.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.131
Good luck.

00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:23.410
So I go home, and
I'm scrambling eggs.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:26.665
And my son walks in, and
he's tugging on my shirt.

00:30:26.665 --> 00:30:29.020
So I'm scrambling eggs,
thinking about where

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:33.360
is the next NFL city, and
he's tugging on my shirt.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.100
I'm like, what's up man?

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.351
You eat breakfast?

00:30:37.351 --> 00:30:39.690
I'm like, yes.

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:41.630
Scramble, scramble, scramble.

00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:42.130
Tug, tug.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:44.360
I'm like, what, dude?

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.150
You eat breakfast?

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.350
so I turned to my wife.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:52.280
I said, Hilary, we are paying
a lot of money for this kid

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.990
to go to a private school.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.360
Is it too late to get a refund?

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.201
I don't see the--

00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:00.200
something's not working.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.260
My wife, raised on
a ranch in Kansas,

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:08.300
she said, well, let
me ask you a question.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.211
When was the last time you
had breakfast with Dylan?

00:31:12.211 --> 00:31:13.960
ASHLEY CHANG: Oh, he's
never seen you eat?

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.293
DARON ROBERTS: He'd seen me eat.

00:31:15.293 --> 00:31:18.370
And I'm like, oh, yeah.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.310
I could not pinpoint
the time, right?

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:25.710
So I have a breakdown.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.220
Eggs are burning, you've
got alarms going off.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:35.450
And just the irony for me was
that I had spent all of my time

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.920
with other people's sons, and
my own son didn't know me.

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:50.240
He was legitimately surprised
to see me with scrambled eggs,

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.080
and that was a problem.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.380
So I decided to
take a sabbatical.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.590
Side note-- if you
ever take a sabbatical,

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:01.570
the equation is, take the
time you think, and it's 5x.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:02.070
OK?

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.319
You're like, oh, I'm just
going to be gone for a year,

00:32:04.319 --> 00:32:05.480
and then I'll come back.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.257
Four years later, I'm still
on sabbatical from coaching.

00:32:08.257 --> 00:32:09.090
But it's been great.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:13.220
I went back to teach at UT
some leadership classes.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.010
The Ray Rice episode unfolds.

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.290
And I take this proposal
to our president for us

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:22.250
to create a center for sports
leadership and innovation--

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.960
to be more
intentional around how

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.990
we teach athletes
to become leaders,

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.460
to manage their finances.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.235
And that was in 2014.

00:32:32.235 --> 00:32:33.360
And I present the proposal.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.620
And he's like, OK,
you're going to run it.

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:40.950
I said, I'm on sabbatical, so
I'm kind of like here, but not.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.500
He's like, no,
you're running it.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.682
And December 2014, we launched.

00:32:46.682 --> 00:32:48.140
So we've been at
it for four years.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.910
It's been very, very exciting.

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:54.560
I teach a class to
freshmen athletes at UT.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.530
And we start with Brene Brown's
work around vulnerability

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:02.390
and empathy, migrate over into
Angela Duckworth and "Grit"

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:06.160
and Carol Dweck and "Mindset."

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.600
We have our failure
management sequence

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.210
where they go and do all these
rejection challenges, and then

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.322
end with the leadership
and financial management.

00:33:13.322 --> 00:33:14.780
ASHLEY CHANG: And
how many students

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.170
have gone through this program?

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.970
DARON ROBERTS: So
I've had 850 students.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:22.760
The great thing about the
class, I think Ashley,

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:28.160
is that half of the class is
comprised of student athletes,

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.140
half are non-athletes.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.020
So you have these
two worlds colliding.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.540
You've got the receiver on
the football team sitting down

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.170
with this computer CS major.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.230
And one of the first things I
do on the first day of class--

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.420
I'll have the computer
science major come up

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.320
and put her schedule
down on the board,

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.570
and I'll have the football
player come up and do the same.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.170
And you'll see football player--

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:58.160
5:00 AM, work out, breakfast,
shower, classes, lunch,

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:02.710
practice, tape, get to
bed at 10:00, 11:00.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:07.160
The coder-- the coder's been
up from like 11:00 to 3:00

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.080
working on code, sleeps
to 10:00, goes to class,

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.199
eats something around
5:00, and back to coding.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:17.659
And so I say, look.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:19.908
The football player thinks,
oh, we have it so tough.

00:34:19.908 --> 00:34:22.199
We have so much time that
we're putting into our craft.

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:27.360
I said, you've got folks
who are coders in training.

00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.510
They are spending as much if
not more time than you are.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.100
They just don't have
110,000 people cheering them

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.060
on on Saturdays.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:39.020
So you're both putting a
lot of time into your craft.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.719
Let's find ways to kind of
bridge the gap between student

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.000
athletes and non-athletes.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.710
So it's been fun.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.730
They keep me young.

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.850
ASHLEY CHANG: So this pivot
was more so unexpected,

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.556
but it's something that seems
to be very fulfilling, right?

00:34:52.556 --> 00:34:53.389
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.800
I think my life has now been--

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.090
I'm trying to find
ways to expand

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:06.030
the world views of athletes.

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.680
So football players,
for example--

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.910
I tell them, you
are mathematicians.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:16.950
For a quarterback to
throw a ball 45 yards

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:21.780
to avoid two defenders over
the back shoulder of a person

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:26.550
who's running a 4.3 40 down
a sideline with the wind

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:29.130
blowing 10 miles
out of the west--

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.540
that kind of precision.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:34.240
That is very complex math.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.460
Take that and translate it
over into your algebra class.

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.180
And they see these worlds as
being two separate spheres.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.980
And everything
that we're doing is

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.310
trying to break down
these barriers to say,

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.250
when you give the speech at
halftime that helps your team

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:54.630
to come back from a deficit,
that's crisis management.

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:56.930
That has an application
in the private sector.

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:58.620
Don't see it as, oh--

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:00.360
ASHLEY CHANG: This
is just sports,

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.662
and this is what I would
need to do outside of that.

00:36:02.662 --> 00:36:03.870
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.200
So let's bring those
lessons in any sport,

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.560
really, and translate those
over into life away from sports.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.730
ASHLEY CHANG: Sure.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.580
Can you talk about your
story about how Kevin Durant

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.930
fits in all of this?

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.070
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.420
So Kevin Durant spent one year
at the University of Texas,

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:27.160
was one and done, and has such
an appreciation for that time.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.460
And when you talk
to him, he looks

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:34.980
at that one year sort of as
the calm before the storm--

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:38.280
and was a phenom
out of Maryland.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.040
In 2015, he started
thinking about how

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.930
he could have a
better relationship

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.790
with the university.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:48.920
And so we're having
conversations with his agent.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.970
I said, hey.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:54.085
How about you come to
campus, make a speech?

00:36:54.085 --> 00:36:55.460
And he's like,
no, I would rather

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.570
do a one on one conversation.

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.150
And so we did this
talk, and we just

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:01.640
talked through how
much he loves mom,

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.316
which I think is incredible.

00:37:03.316 --> 00:37:04.940
He talked about the
fact that he thinks

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:09.080
that there is such a
deficit of love and people

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.810
who are willing to be
vulnerable and that he's

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:17.450
trying to help people build
a comfort level with that.

00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:20.660
And then he talked
about, hey, I want

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.110
to find ways to be more
supportive of what we're doing

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:26.220
on campus for our athletes.

00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.745
And so he's been a supporter.

00:37:28.745 --> 00:37:30.770
He wrote a nice check
to us a few weeks ago.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:31.040
ASHLEY CHANG: Yeah,
congratulations.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:31.660
This is January.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.701
DARON ROBERTS: Thank you.

00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:33.230
Thank you.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.250
ASHLEY CHANG: It
was a nice check.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.440
It was half a million
dollars that Kevin Durant

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.977
donated to the center
that Daron founded.

00:37:38.977 --> 00:37:40.310
So big congratulations to Daron.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.650
DARON ROBERTS: Thank you.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.576
Appreciate it.

00:37:41.576 --> 00:37:42.075
Thank you.

00:37:42.075 --> 00:37:44.015
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:44.015 --> 00:37:46.900
And if anyone
wants to match it--

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.900
PayPal, Venmo, whatever.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.340
ASHLEY CHANG: Any takers?

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:48.839
Anybody?

00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:49.780
Just raise your hand.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.650
DARON ROBERTS: We got it all.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:53.240
ASHLEY CHANG: I think there
was a hand back there, right?

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.110
DARON ROBERTS: Yes.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.055
I got the little Stripe thing.

00:37:57.055 --> 00:37:57.930
So he has been great.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:00.180
And we've been able to really
reach a lot of students,

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.510
and we're going to be a
little more ambitious now

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.710
with some of our offerings.

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:05.270
And we're moving
into that period

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.630
where we're scaling beyond
the University of Texas.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:09.830
ASHLEY CHANG: Amazing.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.680
Well, I also want to
let you know we'll

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.170
have some time for questions.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.340
So if you want to just
line up at the mics--

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.840
have a few more
things to ask Daron.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.990
But please also feel comfortable
to ask him anything you want.

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.652
Take the risk.

00:38:21.652 --> 00:38:22.860
DARON ROBERTS: Take the risk.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:23.890
Take the plunge.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:24.890
ASHLEY CHANG: Daron, OK.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.220
Now, we talked about Durant.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.630
Now, our other favorite
topic-- donuts, right?

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.720
What is with you
and donuts, and what

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.150
is with this donut council?

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:40.040
DARON ROBERTS: So
I realized that I

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.980
need to be very intentional
about spending time

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.922
with my family.

00:38:44.922 --> 00:38:46.630
And I think a lot of
people say, oh, I'll

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.009
spend more time with my family,
and then that's on a Sunday.

00:38:50.009 --> 00:38:51.550
And then you get to
Saturday, and you

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:54.790
think, oh, I haven't spent any
time with my family, right?

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:59.414
So I went into Google
Calendar, and--

00:38:59.414 --> 00:39:01.330
ASHLEY CHANG: We haven't
even talked about it.

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:02.050
This is great.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.024
We should have you come back.

00:39:03.024 --> 00:39:03.990
Are you free next week?

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.560
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah, of course.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.980
Just kind of up the temperature
level a little bit outside.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.410
So my family's color
code is orange.

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:18.710
And we have every Saturday,
7:30, I take the kids,

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:21.392
and we go to a different
donut shop in Austin.

00:39:21.392 --> 00:39:23.350
ASHLEY CHANG: And you
said there were how many?

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:24.922
DARON ROBERTS: There are 38.

00:39:24.922 --> 00:39:26.630
ASHLEY CHANG: Is that
more than New York?

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:27.760
DARON ROBERTS: It's crazy.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.330
It's crazy.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.160
And what's happened-- this has
been going on for four years.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.915
My mom does embroidery,
so we've got T-shirts.

00:39:35.915 --> 00:39:38.040
We walk in, and people are
like, oh, Donut Council.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:38.930
Hey.

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.359
Comp you a few donuts,
be sure to post.

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:43.400
ASHLEY CHANG: That's how
you ask for free things.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.477
Just wear the shirt.

00:39:44.477 --> 00:39:45.310
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.990
And now it's gotten
to the point where

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:53.960
my kids are kind of becoming
snobs in a sense of--

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.750
my daughter last
week, we were a place.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:00.682
She goes, you know, cinnamon
rolls here are a bit dry.

00:40:00.682 --> 00:40:02.390
ASHLEY CHANG: And
which daughter is this?

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:03.180
How old is she.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:03.460
DARON ROBERTS: Sydney.

00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:03.820
Sydney's five.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.070
I'm like, Sydney, you're five.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.355
Just eat the damn thing.

00:40:06.355 --> 00:40:07.730
ASHLEY CHANG: But
Dad, it's not--

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:08.450
DARON ROBERTS: She's
like, it's not as moist.

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:10.120
This donut hole they have--

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.170
just eat.

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:14.400
Now I'm spending
a small mortgage.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.560
It started out, oh, half
a dozen donut holes here.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.250
Have fun.

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:23.449
People want bear claws
and chocolate sprinkles.

00:40:23.449 --> 00:40:25.990
ASHLEY CHANG: Well, and it start
off with how many, and now--

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.600
DARON ROBERTS: So yeah.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:27.683
It started off with three.

00:40:27.683 --> 00:40:28.680
Now we have five.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.930
ASHLEY CHANG: Congratulations.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:31.720
I know your youngest is
seven months, rights?

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.386
DARON ROBERTS:
[INAUDIBLE] seven months,

00:40:33.386 --> 00:40:36.137
and he's just trying to
get some of the residue

00:40:36.137 --> 00:40:36.970
from the donut hole.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:39.900
He's just kind of
licking himself.

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:41.310
But it's also a great time for--

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:45.950
I get back with him around
11:00 so my wife can just go

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:48.320
and be childless for a while.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.990
She works for a nonprofit
and also helps with kids,

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:54.770
and so it's good to kind
of give her some space.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.600
But we're at it for four
years, and it's been fun.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:01.029
So if anyone wants to donate
to the Donut Council--

00:41:01.029 --> 00:41:02.570
ASHLEY CHANG: Half
a million dollars?

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:03.140
DARON ROBERTS: Half
a million dollars

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.349
will go a hell of a long way.

00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:06.098
ASHLEY CHANG: How many
donuts can you eat?

00:41:06.098 --> 00:41:07.840
Maybe with the bear
claws it'd be less.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.798
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah,
yeah, with the bear claws.

00:41:09.798 --> 00:41:11.840
So now we're actually thinking--

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.466
my oldest wants to make a
pivot to breakfast tacos.

00:41:15.466 --> 00:41:17.840
ASHLEY CHANG: So you got to
have new embroidered T-shirts

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.530
from grandma.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.590
DARON ROBERTS: We have bylaws.

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:23.040
I have veto authority.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.770
I'm one of the
permanent members.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:25.280
ASHLEY CHANG: Self-appointed.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.845
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah,
self-appointed.

00:41:26.845 --> 00:41:28.220
I'm not sure how
I feel about it.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.844
I mean, we are in
Austin, Texas, right?

00:41:29.844 --> 00:41:33.830
So there's a breakfast
taco on every corner,

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:34.880
but it kind of seems--

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.830
ASHLEY CHANG: It's a
little different, right?

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:36.650
DARON ROBERTS: It's
a little different.

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:37.640
It's not quite so pure.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.300
ASHLEY CHANG: It's
not quite donuts.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.260
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.420
So it's been a great way to
spend time with the kids.

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.070
It'll be fun, because my
son was talking about, oh,

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.020
when I have kids, I want
to do the same thing.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.920
So it'll be neat to see
the grandkids doing that.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.000
ASHLEY CHANG: So
the coolest part

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.260
for me hearing about
the Donut Council--

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:59.000
and why I wanted to talk about
it today-- is it's not just

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.400
go eat donuts with Dad.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.812
You talk about real lessons.

00:42:03.812 --> 00:42:05.270
Can you share a
little bit of that?

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.103
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:42:06.103 --> 00:42:08.380
So we talk through
current events.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.770
I usually pick
one current event,

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:13.730
and then I'll pick
one character trait.

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.390
And so a couple of weeks
ago, it was gratitude.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.900
And we talked about the
value of saying thank you.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.110
And I'll have them
kind of think about,

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:26.420
hey, when was the last
time you said thank you?

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.730
Sydney-- you could tell Sydney
kind of runs the house--

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:33.080
Sidney said she got an extra
slice of pizza at school,

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.189
and she told the lady at
the cafeteria thank you.

00:42:35.189 --> 00:42:37.230
I was like, well, how did
you get an extra slice?

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:39.961
She goes, oh, well, she knows
I really like this cheese

00:42:39.961 --> 00:42:42.460
that they don't normally have,
and she gave me an extra one.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.310
ASHLEY CHANG: It's not dry.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:44.476
DARON ROBERTS: It's not dry.

00:42:44.476 --> 00:42:46.250
She's very particular
about her food.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.140
And I said, well, how
do you think she felt?

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.750
She goes, she gave me
a big smile, right?

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.900
So we talk about how there
are these things called

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.700
soft skills that people talk
about that's completely off.

00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.134
They're hard.

00:43:00.134 --> 00:43:01.550
And these are the
skills that will

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:05.000
get you fired,
hired, governments

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.680
fall, countries fall--

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.717
like just truth and integrity.

00:43:08.717 --> 00:43:10.550
So they're very important,
and they're hard.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:13.741
And we have to be very
intentional about talking

00:43:13.741 --> 00:43:14.240
about them.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:23.030
Now they have their own topics.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:24.530
They're starting to bring them.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:28.550
Hey, can we talk about
movies and how we

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:30.979
can get more time on the iPad?

00:43:30.979 --> 00:43:33.270
I'm like, no, it doesn't
really fit in with the scheme.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.690
ASHLEY CHANG: Veto power.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:34.900
DARON ROBERTS: Veto
power, done, right?

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:35.560
ASHLEY CHANG: Not a soft skill.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:36.150
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah,
not a soft skill.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:37.340
It doesn't fit.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:41.120
So it's been a blast.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.180
ASHLEY CHANG: You are
teaching students and athletes

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.811
how to take risks.

00:43:45.811 --> 00:43:47.810
Are you starting to teach
that to your children?

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.850
And if so, how are
you doing that?

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.830
DARON ROBERTS:
Yeah, so I'm going

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.080
to start this year
actually to kind of going

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.970
through the rejection resume.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:57.730
I going to start
broadcasting when I get

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:58.730
turned down from things.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.640
So I've been going
through a two week cycle

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.950
with the Harvard
Business Review pitching

00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.220
them this article about Super
Bowl winning coaches and focus

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.220
and how CEOs can
do the same thing.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:12.560
It got so close, and she
finally was like, no.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.426
Right?

00:44:13.426 --> 00:44:15.050
Well, I took a
screenshot of the email.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:17.299
I thought, I need to just
put this out on social media

00:44:17.299 --> 00:44:19.910
without her information
and say, I got turned down

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:21.230
by Harvard Business Review.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:22.310
But you know what?

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:24.410
It just helps me.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:28.370
I think the thing with rejection
is you can't take it personal,

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:32.060
but you have to make it
personal in the sense of I

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.290
have to dissect
the entire process.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.570
Did I give her enough time?

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.940
Did I really flesh
out the proposal?

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.410
Could it have been
more succinct?

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:43.100
And then use that
for round number two.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:47.150
So with them, we've been
talking about entrepreneurship

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:48.080
in our home.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.970
And so my kids
said, hey, you know

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.120
how you stuff all
those Christmas cards?

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.400
We want to start a business
where people will send

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.745
their unstuffed cards to us.

00:44:56.745 --> 00:44:58.120
ASHLEY CHANG: I'll
send you mine.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:58.995
DARON ROBERTS: Right?

00:44:58.995 --> 00:45:01.490
I've got a legion of hands.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:04.760
And we'll stuff it for
them and mail them off.

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.660
I thought, that's pretty good.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.870
So my wife and I have
talked about having

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:10.610
some sort of
entrepreneurial theme

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:14.277
this year where we help them
get something off the ground.

00:45:14.277 --> 00:45:15.110
ASHLEY CHANG: Great.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:17.550
Well, we can't wait to
see what you do next

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.075
and what your kids-- especially
Sydney-- what she does then.

00:45:20.075 --> 00:45:22.000
DARON ROBERTS: Watch
out for Sydney.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.950
ASHLEY CHANG: I think
we have a question.

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:26.100
AUDIENCE: Hey there.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.482
So I have a thought
that I haven't fully

00:45:28.482 --> 00:45:29.940
thought through
yet and just wanted

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.470
to see if maybe something
you've thought about.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:38.580
But how do you address
a person or whatever

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:43.230
that's acting like a
person who is risk-averse,

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:46.890
but perhaps their risk aversion
comes from a place of needing

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.850
to be perfect?

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.650
When we talk about
kids, when we grew up,

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.924
we talked about
practice makes perfect.

00:45:54.924 --> 00:45:57.090
Now I make a deliberate
attempt to tell my daughter,

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.880
practice makes progress,
but I feel like a lot of us

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.570
were raised to think about
being really perfect.

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:05.910
And I feel like when
I think about myself,

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:07.440
that I'm very risk-averse.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.470
But I wonder if a lot
of my risk aversion

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:13.020
comes from this
psychology of being

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.630
raised to try to be perfect.

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.648
I don't know if that's
something that you've--

00:46:17.648 --> 00:46:19.064
DARON ROBERTS:
What was your name?

00:46:19.064 --> 00:46:19.910
AUDIENCE: [? Katie. ?]

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:20.850
DARON ROBERTS:
[? Katie. ?] First thing--

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:23.416
I'm going to steal that
practice makes progress.

00:46:23.416 --> 00:46:24.790
So if you see it
in another form,

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:27.646
then know I've just
taken it from you.

00:46:27.646 --> 00:46:28.520
AUDIENCE: It's yours.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:32.580
DARON ROBERTS: Secondly,
I was at Amazon last week,

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.550
and one of their 14--

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:36.390
hope this is OK.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:38.580
One of their 14
leadership principles

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:43.830
is a bias for action, and I've
adopted this massive action

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:45.630
theme for the year.

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.430
I deal with 300 freshmen a year.

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.860
And the helicopter
parent phenomenon

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:53.220
is a very real thing,
where they land

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.400
at the University
of Texas, and It's

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.160
got to be a 4.0, highest
honors, president of this club,

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.990
in the right dorm.

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:03.900
The color of the bed
sheets have to be perfect.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.360
Everything has to be perfected.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:11.530
So I'm constantly talking
with them about imperfections

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:14.700
and also trying to get
them to favor action.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.170
And I'll say, listen.

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:18.820
All you want is more data.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.330
So if you wait to build this
thing until you have it all--

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:26.780
what you think--
perfectly prepared,

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:29.130
you've kept yourself from
collecting the data that you

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:31.088
would have gotten if you
would have just thrown

00:47:31.088 --> 00:47:32.850
a beta version out there.

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:37.440
And so I think we
do feel like-- and I

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.320
think it's sort of this
Instagram culture of I

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:43.290
need the right filter, and
the lighting, and the angle,

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:45.120
and then I'm going to post.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.060
We've taken that approach and
sort of translated it over

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.060
into our professional lives.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.640
And I'm a big believer in
just throw something out

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:58.500
there, get the feedback,
go for version two.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.750
Because I think that's
holding us back.

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:03.330
We have ten year projects
that could have been two year

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:05.130
projects, because
we haven't been

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:07.380
willing to put something
into the marketplace

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:09.310
and just let the market
speak for itself.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:10.710
So it's a real thing.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:14.460
I think that the more
that we can just say this

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:18.110
doesn't have to be
completed when I let go,

00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:22.212
that I'm going to take that data
and use it to make it better.

00:48:22.212 --> 00:48:23.950
I think you have a good point.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:24.650
Thank you.

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:25.020
AUDIENCE: Hey, Daron.

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:25.560
Thanks for coming.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.851
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah, thank you.

00:48:26.851 --> 00:48:28.710
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
about your choice

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.985
to get into coaching versus
something that might have been

00:48:31.985 --> 00:48:34.110
a more natural fit with
your Harvard Law background

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:35.790
like front office type work--

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:38.010
if the goal was to
do something really

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:40.782
far outside your
wheelhouse or if you did

00:48:40.782 --> 00:48:42.990
consider that, and that
wasn't where the passion was.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:44.070
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:45.924
And it's interesting
you say that.

00:48:45.924 --> 00:48:46.590
Your name again?

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:46.955
AUDIENCE: Todd.

00:48:46.955 --> 00:48:47.320
DARON ROBERTS: Todd.

00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.680
It is interesting you
say that, because, Todd,

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.930
I had the coaches
on my staff say

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.030
when I first walked
into Kansas City,

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:57.060
oh, you should go the GM track.

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:01.020
You'd be a better suited GM.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:04.475
I liked the challenge
of starting something--

00:49:04.475 --> 00:49:06.510
I played in high
school, like I said,

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:09.270
but I didn't have any
coaching knowledge, right?

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:14.530
And I liked the challenge of
having to learn a new code.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:16.500
It's a language.

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.270
That was more exciting
for me than sort

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.940
of doing something that
resembled a bit of what

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.230
I had invested three years.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.680
I'm constantly looking for
ways to stay in over my head,

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.180
and I thought that the GM
track made too much sense.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.977
I really wanted to stretch my
mind in a different direction.

00:49:35.977 --> 00:49:36.810
And I tell you what.

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:42.800
When you have 25, 26-year-old
men who are 6'5", 240 pounds,

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:48.240
running 3.38 40s, flat-footed
jumping 46 inches,

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:55.650
and you have to tell them the
route to run on a certain play,

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:59.130
it takes a lot of courage to
look up at this guy and say,

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:01.230
this is what you need to do.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:03.800
And I knew that was going to
stretch me more than the office

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.250
side of the job.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:09.930
And the last point
is what's ironic--

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:13.840
it's made me a better teacher.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.360
Dealing with athletes for
seven years has helped me,

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:22.830
I think, to be a fairly good
teacher in the classroom.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:25.730
So it was a thought, but
then I sort of dismissed it

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.395
and went for coaching.

00:50:27.395 --> 00:50:28.520
ASHLEY CHANG: Thanks, Todd.

00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.080
AUDIENCE: My name's Corey.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.280
I got a comment and a question.

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:35.960
So if you're ever in Atlanta,
check out Sublime Donuts--

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:37.110
best donuts in the city.

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.443
ASHLEY CHANG: Oh, I would agree.

00:50:38.443 --> 00:50:40.270
A few of us were just there.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:41.990
DARON ROBERTS: You didn't call?

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.500
Thanks.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.195
ASHLEY CHANG: Look, you're
getting me in trouble.

00:50:44.195 --> 00:50:44.900
Let's move on to the question.

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:45.775
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:50:45.775 --> 00:50:47.920
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned this idea

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.450
of when you were talking about
the illustration of the CS

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.120
student and the athlete
and these two worlds

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.240
combining of sports
and the outside world.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.180
I feel like we're in
a place where there's

00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:00.680
very interesting
things happening

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:03.170
with sports technology and
those two fields going together.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:07.340
So I'm wondering if you've seen
anything happen on UT campus

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.440
or other campuses or
your program is working

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.920
with any programs
to not only get

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.590
the technology into
the athlete's hands

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:18.020
to have them using it on
the field or in practice,

00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.360
but also teaching them
about the technology

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.999
so they can get
interested in it and maybe

00:51:22.999 --> 00:51:25.040
change it for the better
to help future athletes.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:25.831
DARON ROBERTS: Yes.

00:51:25.831 --> 00:51:30.080
So Corey, great first great tip
on the sublime, and then great

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.040
question.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:36.320
So actually, in the fall,
we're unveiling a sports

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.230
entrepreneurship sequence
at the business school.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:42.620
So we're going to have 20
athletes, 20 non-athletes,

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:46.370
and they will start at
ideation all the way

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:49.310
to putting the thing into
the marketplace-- a year

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:50.710
long course.

00:51:50.710 --> 00:51:53.000
And we'll bring in
sports entrepreneurs

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.890
to expose them to this thing
that we call entrepreneurship.

00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:59.960
I think you're spot
on, because it's

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.404
been relatively recent that
people have kind of looked

00:52:02.404 --> 00:52:03.320
around and said, wait.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:08.790
Instead of waiting for
the data to come back,

00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:12.450
we can just use the on the
field data from practice

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:14.640
and from training
camps to inform

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.770
the way that we build products.

00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:19.920
And you actually have a
couple of athletic departments

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.180
that are considering
building in-house incubators.

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:28.225
So you see this with the 76ers,
for example, where they're just

00:52:28.225 --> 00:52:29.850
saying, let's just
bring this in-house,

00:52:29.850 --> 00:52:33.000
because we have world
class athletes to get

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.040
good feedback from.

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:36.990
Let's use this
setting as a space

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.960
where we can ideate and
then test out new concepts.

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:42.660
So I think over
the next few years

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.882
that this concept will
really, really take off.

00:52:45.882 --> 00:52:46.590
Thank you, Corey.

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:48.350
That was good.

00:52:48.350 --> 00:52:50.380
ASHLEY CHANG:
Let's go over here.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:51.280
AUDIENCE: Hi, Daron.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:55.240
My name is Veronica,
and I am seeing

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:58.900
in my field of expertise,
which is employment law, that

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:01.060
at the higher levels
of corporate America,

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.340
especially when you're
dealing with C-suite folks

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:08.890
and the leaders in the
companies, that the soft skills

00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:11.740
that you alluded to
earlier directly contribute

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.950
to the breakdown and meltdown
of workplace relationships.

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:19.990
So in your talks and your
trainings with those leaders,

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:23.770
what kind of response are you
getting from those leaders

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:28.950
when you talk to them about
skills like vulnerability?

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:31.430
DARON ROBERTS: So at
first, they walk in,

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:35.450
and its HR has put
this thing together.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:37.930
And they've got to go get
real mushy for an hour, right?

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:40.690
So they don't want to be there.

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:41.980
And then we really--

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.260
especially with
vulnerability-- first,

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:47.410
I'll show them the research
that says, for managers

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:51.070
who score high on the
vulnerability scale,

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:52.930
their teams produce
more all the things

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:56.080
you care about--
revenue and shareholder.

00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.140
All of those measures go up.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.890
And it's counter-intuitive,
but the reason

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:06.040
is the team members say, oh,
if she has the confidence

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.450
to be vulnerable-- and there
are some limits, right?

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:11.350
But to be vulnerable-- it
creates this safe space,

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:13.150
and they feel more comfortable.

00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:16.930
And they actually produce
more and better products

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:18.820
and ideas and concepts.

00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:20.560
So I first have to
get them to buy in

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:26.380
that there's this
very real bottom line

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:29.980
benefit to being and using
vulnerability and empathy.

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:32.770
And then I use that hook
to them say, hey, listen.

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:36.010
It's also just good as a human.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:39.370
Empathy-- the ability to take
the perspective of someone

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:40.550
else.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:42.580
If there is anything
that's in short supply

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.670
right now in our
country or in the world,

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.110
it's got to be empathy.

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:49.127
Because we're all, we
know the right answers,

00:54:49.127 --> 00:54:50.710
we know what everyone
should be doing.

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:52.210
It's a black white.

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:55.630
It's a very binary world
that a lot of us live in.

00:54:55.630 --> 00:55:00.550
But to be able to stop and say,
I'm not from the same hometown.

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:02.330
We're not the same
race or religion.

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:05.330
But I can see how
she would arrive

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:08.040
at this feeling or conclusion.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.590
I think that's important.

00:55:09.590 --> 00:55:10.850
It's an uphill battle, though.

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:13.250
I think, especially
in corporate America,

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:17.934
vulnerability and empathy are
tough sells, but we're working.

00:55:17.934 --> 00:55:19.850
ASHLEY CHANG: So we'll
take one last question,

00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:22.840
and then you can come and ask
Daron a few more afterwards.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.900
Please.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.060
AUDIENCE: My name's Zach.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:27.420
I'm curious.

00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:29.330
In the two pivots that
happened, they kind of

00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:31.852
came at natural points,
I would say, as far

00:55:31.852 --> 00:55:34.130
as you graduated, and then--

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:38.060
maybe unnatural-- but you
were fired or you were let go.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.290
I'm curious.

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:42.950
Outside of that, how often
do you kind of re-evaluate

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:46.250
where you are, whether
there's something

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:49.640
else you could be doing that
would expand your impact?

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:53.100
And moreover, you've done a
bunch of different things.

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:59.810
You've coached a group of, say,
10 guys in your receiver group

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:03.440
or whatever, and now you're
directing this big thing.

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.930
How do you compare
those different options

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:09.869
and evaluate impact in
all these different ways.

00:56:09.869 --> 00:56:10.910
DARON ROBERTS: Man, Zach.

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:13.190
You just got right
to the heart of it.

00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.690
ASHLEY CHANG: Maybe we should
have done this question first.

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.390
DARON ROBERTS: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:18.710
That's the process.

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:20.270
Right now, this is where I am.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:25.610
So I talked about staying
in over your head.

00:56:25.610 --> 00:56:29.720
I am constantly thinking now,
am I challenging myself enough?

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:35.530
If I get comfortable,
it gets a little--

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:38.170
I'm on edge, and I feel like I
may be getting to that point,

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:40.890
right?

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:45.150
I'm also at the point where
I have determined for me

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:50.500
that my life needs to
consist of writing, speaking,

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.070
and teaching.

00:56:52.070 --> 00:56:54.510
And if I think about the
commonality between coaching

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.600
and what I do in the classroom,
it's the teaching piece.

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.510
That's the common thread.

00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:04.920
So now that I've identified
that subset of what I need,

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.990
I'm going to filter or
any opportunity that

00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:09.610
comes across my plate
through those three.

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:11.160
It needs to go three for three.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.240
I'm going to be 40.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.530
I can't go two for three.

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.030
I need a three for three set up.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:20.210
But I even don't
know if I'm really

00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:23.150
challenging myself
enough right now,

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:25.250
so I'm actively
thinking about that.

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:28.410
And if you have some answers
for me, I will take them.

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:29.780
I'll pay you for them.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.724
But I think it's a
question that people

00:57:32.724 --> 00:57:34.640
who want to be intentional
about their lives--

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.697
they're constantly
asking that question.

00:57:36.697 --> 00:57:37.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:37.990
DARON ROBERTS:
Thank you for that.

00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:39.030
Thank you.

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.780
ASHLEY CHANG: Well,
Daron, thank you

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:41.970
so much for spending time
with us today and sharing

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:42.470
your story.

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:43.860
DARON ROBERTS: Thank you.

00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:45.640
ASHLEY CHANG: I have
one quick question.

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:47.499
It has to be really quick.

00:57:47.499 --> 00:57:48.290
Super Bowl Sunday--

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:49.289
DARON ROBERTS: Oh, lord.

00:57:49.289 --> 00:57:50.340
ASHLEY CHANG: --thoughts?

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:51.631
DARON ROBERTS: Eagles by three.

00:57:51.631 --> 00:57:54.050
