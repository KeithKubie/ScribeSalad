&gt;&gt; DICMAR (ph): Hi, my name is Sander Dicmar
(ph).

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.850
&gt;&gt; CRESPO: My name is Arturo Crespo.
&gt;&gt; PRECK (ph): I’m Devash Preck (ph).

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.270
&gt;&gt; COLEMAK (ph): And I’m Mark Colemak (ph).
&gt;&gt; All: And we work on Android Market.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.620
&gt;&gt; COLEMAK (ph): And I’m going to show you
how to find things on Android Market. Android

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.520
Market has several options for browsing content
that you can download. We have the featured

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.710
gallery appeared at the top which is icons
of applications that you can install, and

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.500
we also have categories of applications and
games. Going into the applications, it shows

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.640
you different subcategories or you can look
at all the applications. And from here, you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
can look at--you can browse by popularity,
of what’s popular and really not so popular,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.860
and also by date to see what’s the latest
things that have been uploaded.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.810
&gt;&gt; DICMAR (ph): And I’m going to show you
how to search and install an application through

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.950
the Android Market. I’d like to install
an application that tracks my carbon foot

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.500
print on a daily basis so I can click on the
search pattern in our Android Market. Enter

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:00.690
the search query carbon, and market shows
me all the applications that have carbon in

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.110
their description. I can then click on this
application called Ecorio, I can view the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.060
details for the application and once I’m
suitably pleased, I can install the application.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.710
Market now shows me the permissions that are
required for this application. Some of the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.490
permissions that are required are a network
communication and knowing my location. Once

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.770
I’ve approved these permissions, I can click
on okay, and market starts the download and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.380
installed in the background. I can now go
back to market home, browse to any other application

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.320
that I’d like. I like this game called Bonsai
Blast and I can start the install of this

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.090
simultaneously. Now what market is doing is
downloading and installing both applications

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.909
in the background. Once the download and installation
succeeds, I receive a notification on the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.549
notification bar. I can pull the notification
window and click on Ecorio which has been

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.830
just installed.
&gt;&gt; CRESPO: Next I’m going to show you how

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.499
you can find all the application you have
downloaded, and rate one of them. So I can

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:17.290
go and click on my downloads and I get the
list of all application including the two

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.889
that we just downloaded. So, after I'm in
this screen, I can go to Ecorio and now it

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:30.379
can read the application again but I can also
write the application. So, you can go click

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:36.519
and rate it, and here we have our screen working,
give it a score of between one to five stars.

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:43.569
So let’s give it four stars, above average.
I could also post a comment telling people

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.829
more about this application. If I have more
serious concerns about the application, I

00:02:47.829 --> 00:03:00.230
can go and flag the application. And I can
write what are my concerns. In this case,

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.609
there is no, there are no concerns so we’ll
go back.

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:11.010
&gt;&gt; PRECK (ph): Finally, here’s how to uninstall
an application. First, I go to my downloads,

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.099
and I click on Android says, then I press
uninstall. It will tell me that I’m about

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:25.129
to uninstall this application from my phone
and I click okay. And then I can give a reason

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:31.419
for why I uninstalled it. If it’s malicious,
I can report it here, but this is just a game

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.309
I don't want to play. So, I’ll choose it.
