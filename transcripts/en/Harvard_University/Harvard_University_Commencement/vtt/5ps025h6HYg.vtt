00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.830
As we recover from Senior Week
and sit down with our family

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.340
and friends from
home, this question

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.070
will come up over dinner and in
many situations in the future.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.750
So, what did you
learn at Harvard?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.450
What will you tell them?

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.920
What has our Harvard
education really been?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.080
Our Harvard education.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.100
It could have been
discovered in our passions,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.890
realizing disciplines
that we'd never

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.230
heard of before coming to
college, extracurriculars

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.860
that we somehow
ended up spending

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.370
hours on without realization.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.060
Our Harvard education.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.080
Perhaps it was the realization
that when a friend strikes up

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.680
a meaningful, late
night conversation,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.980
that paper or problem
set could wait.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.320
Or learning the importance
of thinking of a friend

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.090
and stopping by their
room just to check in

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.820
and see how they were doing.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.349
Our Harvard education.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:08.490
Oftentimes, it may have been
failing and dusting ourselves

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.240
off and getting back up and
facing everything again.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.770
Our Harvard education.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.390
Maybe it was realizing that we
were not content simply being

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.230
a product of Harvard,
that we wanted Harvard

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.680
to be a product of us, that
we wanted to do something

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.760
so that we could look back
at our college and say,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.870
this is an institution
that better reflects me

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.320
and the values I hold dear
because of my efforts.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.040
Our Harvard education.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.260
It could be about becoming
more comfortable with being

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.110
uncomfortable, with inevitable
uncertainty, steadfast turmoil

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.260
in constant flux.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.330
Our Harvard education
could have been

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.080
about taking risks, embracing
our fear of the unknown

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.690
and moving forward despite of
it, and taking deep breaths

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.090
and making decisions to change
our lives when we weren't

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.630
living the realities
that we wanted.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.750
So, what did our time
at Harvard teach us?

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.950
How will it help as we go
forth into the real world?

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.010
We may not have all the
answers now, and that's OK.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.250
We don't and can't know now
everything that we have learned

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.550
and all the ways in which we
have changed here at Harvard.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.530
That ceremony we have tomorrow,
commencement, means beginning.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.870
We are just getting started.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.940
And as we go forth
from Dexter Gate,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.880
having hopefully grown in
wisdom and soon departing

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.540
to better serve thy
country and thy kind,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.300
I hope that we stay
true to ourselves.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.010
It has taken us so much courage
and grit to grow up and become

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.410
who we are during the
challenging and incredible

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.800
experience that
Harvard has been.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.670
With each decision that
we make with our hearts,

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.360
our compass is tweaked a
little here, a little there,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.140
to ultimately land each of us in
the spot that is right for us.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.774
Thank you so much class of
2014, and congratulations.

00:03:21.774 --> 00:03:24.618
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.400
Thanks Jen.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.236
My name is Arjun Modi, a proud
resident of Kirkland House,

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:35.485
and I am your class treasurer.

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:37.710
[CHEERING]

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.260
I'm Rainjade Chung, and I
represent Kirkland House

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.520
on the senior class committee.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.490
[CHEERING]

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.810
It is our great pleasure
to introduce to you today

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.950
a man who holds a special
place in all of our hearts.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.450
The one and only, Dean Pfister.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.000
Dean Pfister is the Asa Gray
professor of Systematic Botany,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.440
and his love of plants,
trees, flowers, and fungi

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.980
is known all too
well by most of us.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.960
Dean Pfister joined Harvard
40 years ago in 1974.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.820
Since then he has been
intimately involved

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.440
in undergraduate life.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.230
In 1982, he assumed a role
special to myself and Rainjade

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.110
when he became comaster
of Kirkland House,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.920
serving for 18 years
with his wife Kathleen.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.470
Most recently he was Dean
of Harvard summer school

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.875
before leaving
that post to serve

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:32.580
as interim dean of the
College this past year.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.900
And what a year it has been.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.370
In a message to the class
declaring that we already

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.280
beat Yale, the weekend
before the game,

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.580
he reminded us that Harvard
is home to the world's largest

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.930
university owned herbarium
with more than five

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.196
million specimens
to Yale's 350,000.

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:51.634
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:51.634 --> 00:04:53.622
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.400
Because of this he said
that Yale could not even

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.020
compete with us,
a premonition that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.892
was confirmed when we
won the game 34 to seven.

00:05:06.892 --> 00:05:10.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.360
From sharing his reading list
with the class, which often

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.900
consists of mystery novels
such as How the Light Gets In,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.510
a Chief Inspector Gamache novel,
to helping us identify fungi

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.120
around Harvard
Yard, to reminding

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.190
us to take care of
ourselves and others

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.420
amidst difficult times on
campus and off, Dean Pfister

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.560
has undeniably been a
source of comfort, support,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.940
and many a laugh.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.590
He has brought us
cupcakes in Lamont,

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.980
traveled with us to
class on the shuttle,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.270
and helped us welcome
freshman to their new homes

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.660
on housing day.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.670
Dean Pfister, you will be missed
by the undergraduate community,

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.770
and we wish you all the
best in your next adventure.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.510
Please join us in a warm round
of applause for Dean Pfister.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.890
Thank you.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:57.390
Thank you.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.950
Thank you.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.260
This is wonderful.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.200
Greetings and congratulations
to the class of 2014.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.570
My congratulations are not only
to the remarkable women and men

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.670
who will march tomorrow
toward their future,

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.850
but also parents and friends who
have made the journey possible.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.980
Thank you too.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.890
At last, I have you all here
in my extended classroom.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.240
Please pay very close
attention because tomorrow we

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.950
pass out the exams.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.660
Allow me to review the syllabus.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.530
Look over toward
University Hall here,

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.490
a single pine stands there.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.740
Its predecessor,
also a white pine,

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.240
was blown down in one
of the hurricanes that

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.050
occurred in the 1980s.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.570
Originally, a row
of pines marked

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:16.620
a special spot, the site in
times before indoor plumbing,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.172
of the college outhouse.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.160
Such an essential place.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.020
So full of history--

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.995
--that marks the spot where
we celebrate our last days

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:34.495
together.

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.720
Time flows on, things change.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.300
Just as Harvard has changed
over time, so have you.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.540
During this interim year, I
have had the singular pleasure

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.490
and honor of greeting a freshman
class whose graduation I will

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.900
not oversee, and
celebrating today

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:09.010
and all year a senior class that
I did not welcome as freshmen.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.030
We have all been on a journey.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.200
Yours has been one
of concentrations

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.780
and requirements,
performances, competitions,

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.460
high points, low points.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:28.160
Well, mine has been
characterized by what?

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.590
Perhaps I could
summarize it a bit

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.760
as learning about the
complicated ecosystem

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.350
of academic administration.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.940
And more importantly,
following you all

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.870
in your final
undergraduate year.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.810
In The Fellowship of the
Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote,

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.850
"Not all those who
wander are lost."

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:55.700
Facing the challenges
in our journey,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.920
I suspect that all of us
have felt at times lost.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.830
But now in retrospect,
I think we may just

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.535
be wandering quite a bit.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.340
When I talked to freshman
at convocation in September,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.170
I reflected on my
early academic journey.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.590
How I grew up in Ohio,
that my sister and I

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.990
were the first in our
family to attend college,

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.870
that I went to Miami University,
the real Miami University

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:26.830
in Oxford, Ohio.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:35.500
Looking back, I must
confess that I was clueless.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.740
Perhaps when you review
your first year now

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.820
you'll get the same sense.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.850
I was a small town kid
on a pretty small campus,

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.250
inadequately prepared to cope.

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.580
Despite my rough start, I
discovered an academic field

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.470
and a set of mentors
who saved me.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.260
By telling the freshman about
my initial college difficulties,

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.710
I hope to encourage them to
reach out, extend themselves

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.070
to find what would
compel and inspire them.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:15.330
Today my point in telling you
about my undergraduate trials

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.200
is that you and I share
an important aspect

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.650
of our journey.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.250
We succeeded.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.920
Henry Ward Beecher wrote,
"We should not judge people

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.370
by their peak of excellence,
but by the distance

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.490
they have traveled from the
point where they started."

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:37.010
Personally, I find
these words reassuring.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.700
You may also find them
worth remembering.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.540
So here we are.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:48.610
We have traveled to the very,
very eve of commencement.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.300
It may interest you in the early
days of Harvard-- Jen stole

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.090
some of this from
me-- commencement

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.590
came not at this point in time
of the year, but in the fall

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.395
after a summer break.

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:06.490
It came when the year was
commencing, a beginning.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.220
In the spring there was another
type of celebration, Class Day.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.070
Class Day was the
last day of term.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.920
In the 1830s, seniors
met in the morning

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.330
in one of the common
rooms in University Hall.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.260
There they had a
religious service

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.940
conducted by one of
their own before marching

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.630
in procession two
Wadsworth House where

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.560
the president lived.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.810
The seniors then escorted the
president to Holden Chapel

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.650
where there were
prayers, orations, poems,

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:41.710
a class ode, most in Latin.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.740
Later a new set of customs
that included dancing

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:48.640
around the Liberty Tree
and Elm near Holden Chapel.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.560
On those occasions,
as one writer

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.450
noted, "The seniors provided
punch in a barrel and brandy

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:04.650
and water in pails which were
placed at the foot of the tree

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.410
and were steadily
replenished all afternoon,

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.810
mugs being provided
for all comers.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.990
There was singing and
dancing, speaking,

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:18.670
intermingled with
unlimited drinking.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.940
Not the slightest
attempt was made

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.870
to control or repress this.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.185
It was simply a brutal
hallowing orgy."

00:12:27.185 --> 00:12:30.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.020
"There was little
attempt at fun,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.360
no kind of system of
traditional order.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:42.310
Nothing but steady drinking
and the resulting drunkenness."

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:49.190
Now a few of you think, perhaps,
that you invented everything

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.067
anew.

00:12:50.067 --> 00:12:53.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.570
The tree is long
gone, killed by elm

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:01.060
disease early in
the last century.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.450
But Class Day spirit lives on.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.185
Now the celebration of
commencement and class day

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.900
have merged and changed.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:14.710
Today and tomorrow you have
orations, singing, and pomp.

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:19.330
Maybe not so many barrels of
booze around, though I'm always

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.120
surprised and grateful
to note the grounds crew

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.775
has managed to collect all
the discarded bottles and cans

00:13:25.775 --> 00:13:29.000
and cups before the
arrival of your guests

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.410
on commencement morning.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.530
Still, our language of
commencement beginning

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.260
carries on.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.940
For you this is another
sort of beginning.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.450
So let me tell you
what to expect tomorrow

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.230
regarding the venerable
exercises here

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:51.300
in Tercentenary Theatre
and your role in them.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.370
During the
commencement exercises,

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.320
the president will
confer degrees

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.930
upon the university's graduates.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.840
First Ph.D. and Master's
degrees are called.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.790
Then the professional
schools will

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:09.000
be acknowledged in the reverse
order of their founding.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.990
Each of the schools has
its own little cheers

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:19.140
and its members will wave about
their special little props.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:22.280
Then last, the
college is called.

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:26.770
That gives us a chance
to outdo them all.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.240
When you are recognized,
it's your moment

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.120
to inform the graduate
and professional school

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.340
students about which school
is the true jewel in Harvard's

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.520
crown.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.120
I hope you will seize the
day and out-cheer them all.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.000
Make sure that
those cheers can be

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.440
heard all the way to Somerville.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:53.530
And then when you quiet down
I will begin the salutation.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.500
Madame President and Fellows
of Harvard College, this

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.010
refers to Drew Faust in
the Fellows of the Harvard

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.680
Corporation.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:08.300
They form the legal entity
that is Harvard University.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.690
Next I will greet Mr.
President and members

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:13.550
of the board of overseers.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.300
This refers to the
second governing body

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.590
of our university
and its presidents.

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.490
After these salutations
I will attest

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:26.210
that you have fulfilled
the faculty's requirements

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:30.340
for the first degree
in arts and sciences.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.400
At that point right
there is no going back.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.670
We've given away your room.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.000
Much as we love you, we
have opened the doors

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.210
to a new class.

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.260
Like Adam and Eve,
you're cast out.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.270
You have gone to the other side.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:58.280
Finally, I will pronounce
that each candidate stands

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.040
ready to advance knowledge,
to promote understanding,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.400
and to serve society.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.950
To advance knowledge, to
promote understanding,

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.650
to serve society.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.550
Such a noble affirmation.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.770
But the fact is we leave
a lot to your imagination

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:25.800
and ingenuity about what
those noble words mean.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.180
Fortunately during
your time at Harvard,

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.800
you have all been
engaged in these goals,

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.840
whether you liked it or not.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.890
What we are certifying
and my deepest hope

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.000
is that as you go
out from Harvard,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.360
you will indeed advance,
promote, and serve.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.250
It is what we expect of
you, whether in education,

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.740
in business, in
professions, in life.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.830
Are these obligations?

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.750
Yes, they are responsibilities.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:02.170
But this is what we
expect of ourselves

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:07.490
and for our fellow inhabitants
of the small planet.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.819
One of my favorite
spots in Harvard Yard

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:14.670
is behind Holden Chapel
toward Massachusetts Avenue.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.359
The chapel was built
to face the street.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:23.310
And this outward facing part is
the fancy side of the building.

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:27.940
It is near the spot that
the class tree stood.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.200
You will find a sundial there.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.880
Many of you may have
already found that.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.500
Inscribed around the
support are the words,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:42.960
"On this moment hangs eternity."

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.240
Keep this in mind tomorrow
when you celebrate.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.790
On this moment hangs eternity.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:53.520
You need to make the
best of the moment.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.130
It leads us forward.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:18:01.185
What we do and decide now
is with us to eternity.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:07.670
Meanwhile, we are
here now, closing

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:13.290
in on these last moments under
this magnificent green but wet

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:13.790
canopy.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.110
I have enjoyed and valued our
time together immeasurably.

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.530
There were many performances
by various groups-- the Harvard

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:32.900
Pops, Din &amp; Tonics, I, Too,
Am Harvard-- visits to houses,

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.660
and the senior scavenger hunt.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:39.880
When it looked like you
could use a cupcake,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.320
I was glad you bring it to you.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.100
It pleased me to see so many
students in my office hours

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.890
to discuss concerns
or just to say hello.

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.670
Riding the shuttle bus
on a winter's morning

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.990
allowed me to chat
with some of you

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:00.060
and gave me a sense of what you
were doing in order to juggle

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:04.940
classes, activities, athletics.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.110
And of course there
were the emails.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:12.650
For many of you my periodic
messages were informative.

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.810
If they made you
smile and brought

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:19.500
you a bit closer to this
marvelous community,

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.860
well, that was perhaps
most important.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:29.800
The last few days are your days.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.870
Amid the hustle and bustle,
please spend a moment

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.970
to reflect on what
you have done,

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:44.210
the races run, lost, and won,
the perspectives examined,

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:49.030
the minds changed-- yours,
and perhaps your parents--

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.470
papers written, problems solved.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.610
Bear in mind that with luck
and health, those friends

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.280
you hold dear today
will come to join

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.500
you sharing the fifth,
10th, 25th, reunions.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.920
Much has happened
in these four years.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.670
Much has changed.

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.750
There is a saying, no one ever
steps in the same river twice,

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:18.310
for it is not the same river,
and it's not the same person,

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.970
though you cannot step back
into the same Harvard we have

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:29.740
shared, this Harvard, you and
I, in the same river together.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.100
I'm proud of you.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.460
I will close with the first
lines of Tolkien's poem.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.880
It's a riddle, really.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.750
"All that is gold
does not glitter.

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:47.220
Not all those who
wander are lost."

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:53.370
May you, the graduates, find
the gold that does not glitter.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:58.620
Friends, family, the
love of your life,

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:03.650
perhaps children, and
your own kind of success.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:08.380
And may you wander
but always come home.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.190
Best of luck to you all.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.150
Congratulations.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.114
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.320
Thank you so much, Dean Pfister.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.950
And good afternoon,
class of 2014.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:49.260
My name is Michele Dimino,
and I am your class secretary.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:50.530
My name is Michelle Luo.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:54.280
I am one half of the senior
class tech and media team.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.540
And I'm Karen Xiao, the other
half of your tech and media

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.830
team.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.430
It's hard to believe that four
years have passed since we sat

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.250
in this very place at our
freshman convocation, strangers

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.460
to one another and to
the campus around us.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.270
After hundreds of hours spent
in dining halls and classrooms

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.350
and thousands of steps
through the gates of the yard,

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:20.920
these places and faces
have become, at the least,

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.330
familiar to us.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.560
And often, they've
come to mean much more.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.090
Tomorrow when we
receive our diplomas

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:31.170
and officially become
alumni of Harvard college,

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.500
we will do so in houses
that have become our homes

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.100
and with people who have
truly become our family here.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.350
It has been our pleasure
as your class committee

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:45.580
to see our 2014 community grow
and strengthen during a very

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.360
special senior year.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.160
And it has been my
particular pleasure

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.620
to flood your inboxes
with emails and event

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.510
updates along the way.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:56.580
In the years to
come, we look forward

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.610
to making this community
even more connected

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.960
and to continuing to see old
classmates become new friends.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.220
As you look ahead, know that
the Harvard alumni network will

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.960
be there for you, and that your
classmates will have your back

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.650
and be at your side,
just as they are today

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:17.140
and have been since we came to
Harvard as the class of 2014

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:18.010
four years ago.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:25.040
We know that for all of you
here, adventure is out there.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.560
Being spread out
across the world

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.880
doesn't mean that
our class will not

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.671
be able to stay connected
with one another.

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:39.040
We are overjoyed to see so
many of you pinned on Map14.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.720
From those of you
staying in Boston

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.030
to those of you moving
halfway across the world,

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:47.120
remember that wherever
you are, you can always

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.250
revisit the class of
2014 Facebook page

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.480
whenever you're feeling
nostalgic for senior bar

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.260
photos.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.735
You can always reach out
to your city captains who

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:59.540
will be dedicated to keeping
you in touch with each other

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.620
as well as with
other Harvard alumni.

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.040
Finding a new friend
in an old city

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.290
can be as simple as browsing
our city Facebook groups

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.350
or opening up Map14.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.060
Even as we go our
separate ways, we

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:17.340
will continue to learn and
grow together as a class.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.840
Today marks the end of
a four year journey,

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.590
but the beginning
of lifelong one.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.430
By Friday at 5:00 PM, we
will lose swipe access

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:29.963
to all Harvard buildings.

00:24:29.963 --> 00:24:31.815
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:31.815 --> 00:24:36.075
And with that, we lose our
beloved daily dining service,

00:24:36.075 --> 00:24:39.150
the $65 of Board
Plus every semester,

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:40.930
and the ability to
walk out the door

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.430
and be surrounded by hundreds
of loving tutors, friends,

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.560
and classmates.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.090
But we will never
lose the memories

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.480
of all nighters spent
in the dining halls,

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.220
the delicious taste of
Cape Cod chips from Fly-By,

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.820
and the experiences we have
shared these past four years.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.660
Don't forget that those
friends and memories are just

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.526
a Facebook post, a
text, or an email away.

00:25:04.526 --> 00:25:06.900
We hope to see you cheering
in the stands at Harvard Yale

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.950
next year, and returning
for our five year reunion,

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.090
and many more after that.

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.550
Don't be a stranger.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.176
Keep in touch.

00:25:16.176 --> 00:25:18.596
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.270
Thank you, Michele,
Karen, and Michelle.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.850
We are looking
forward to staying

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.340
connected in the coming years.

00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:39.660
I am Caitlin Fai, Currier
House representative.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.060
I am Sarah June, Lowell
House representative.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.070
During these past four
years, we had taken a part

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.530
in a number of
Harvard traditions.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:55.150
We played Yale in football
and won each November.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.240
We celebrated our houses
with shouts and cheers,

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.450
on housing day and
every day since.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.820
Some of us even jumped
from Weeks Bridge

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.785
into the questionable
waters of the Charles River.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:14.210
Some of these traditions
were stayed and respectable,

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:18.380
such as convocation, while
others were decidedly less

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.660
proper, such as primal scream.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.590
Running a naked lap around
Harvard Yard on the night

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.730
before exam period may not
seem like a typical Harvard

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:31.800
tradition, but we
participated undeterred.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:35.730
Through traditions we have been
able to cultivate and celebrate

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.900
past, present, and future
shared experiences.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.730
Today we are here to introduce
one of the more respectable

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:48.080
Harvard traditions, the
tradition of class color.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:52.550
The class color tradition began
when the senior class of 1882

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.860
wore green and white rowing
uniforms to distinguish itself

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.750
from the other class boats
on the Charles River.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.770
The three original colors--
green, orange, and blue--

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:08.280
represented Harvard's fiercest
athletic and academic rivals--

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:10.830
Dartmouth, Princeton, and Yale.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.080
Wearing the colors of
our rivals was a way

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:15.275
to express victory
over them, to triumph.

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:23.310
In 1904, students began to wear
pins with their class colors

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.730
on them.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.440
As the tradition developed,
wearing the colors

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.590
on t-shirts and ties create a
sense of unity and cohesiveness

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:33.660
among the class.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.620
The class color tradition
lapsed in the mid 20th century,

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.230
but the senior class
revived it in 2012.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:45.200
Today we continue the
tradition as the class of 2014

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.090
receives the color green.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:51.100
Green was originally meant
to represent Dartmouth,

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.870
one of our foremost
athletic rivals.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.270
However, in the past year
Harvard swept Dartmouth

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:02.430
in men and women's soccer,
basketball, squash, swimming,

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.520
and even ice hockey.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.670
Since it's not much
of a rivalry anymore,

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.900
green signifies
something different

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.700
for the Harvard class of 2014.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.150
It represents
growth and renewal.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.700
Since we arrived on
campus four years ago,

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:20.260
we have changed and matured.

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.675
Some of us would barely
recognize our freshman year

00:28:22.675 --> 00:28:25.450
selves, and all of
us have broadened

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.070
our intellectual horizons.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.470
Now we are ready to move
forward from Harvard,

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.356
wisened and enlightened,
or so we think.

00:28:35.356 --> 00:28:38.150
Yet our class color
green will be passed on

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:42.800
to the rising sophomores,
class of 2017.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.590
They will adopt it
as their own, and we,

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.220
during this time of
rebirth, will move forward

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.920
to new things.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.370
Class of 2014, we
will leave Harvard,

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.310
but will forever be
linked through the color

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:57.590
green to the
classes that follow.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:58.556
Thank you.

00:28:58.556 --> 00:29:01.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:06.988 --> 00:29:07.980
Go Roland!

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.468
[CHEERING]

00:29:09.468 --> 00:29:12.610
Good afternoon, 2014.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:17.690
My name is Roland Yang, and I
am one of your class marshals.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:19.800
I have the honor
and the pleasure

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.480
of introducing our incoming
president of the Harvard Alumni

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:29.290
Association, Cynthia Torres,
Harvard College class of 1980,

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:33.320
and Harvard Business
School class of 1984.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.230
Hailing from Santa
Monica, California,

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:38.930
Torres was a resident
of Lowell House

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:43.490
and a government concentrator
in her undergraduate years.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.930
She also served as a business
tutor in Winthrop House

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.990
during her time at
the Business School.

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:52.640
Torres has been active
in alumni affairs

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.590
ever since her graduation,
and her involvement

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.850
reads like a guide on how to
stay connected with Harvard.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:04.760
From chairing two committees at
the Harvard Alumni Association

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.610
to serving as first Vice
President of the Executive

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:12.800
Committee, Torres has seen
many aspects of alumni life,

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.190
and she brings a
wealth of experiences

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:17.800
to the Harvard community.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:22.690
Our speaker today has a
special bond with the year 2014

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.590
and with our class.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:31.560
First, 2014 marks Torres' 30th
reunion at the Business School.

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:35.260
Second, Torres was with
us from the very beginning

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:39.430
of our Harvard careers, serving
as a marshal at our freshman

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:41.190
convocation.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:45.340
Third and most important,
she is the proud parent

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.380
of Spencer Gisser, who
as a fellow senior,

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.310
is graduating with us from
Pforzheimer House this year.

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.810
We are delighted to have
Cynthia Torres with us

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.140
on this incredibly
special occasion

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.380
as she welcomes us to our new
Harvard community as alumni.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.970
Please join me in
welcoming Cynthia Torres,

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:09.342
incoming president of the
Harvard Alumni Association.

00:31:09.342 --> 00:31:12.294
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.720
Thank you Roland, for that
kind and generous introduction.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.580
Greetings class of 2014.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:32.420
Today you are one of 1,650
graduating undergraduates.

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.230
Tomorrow you'll be
welcomed by President Faust

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:40.520
into the fellowship of
educated men and women

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.220
and join a larger
global community

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:48.640
of 320,000 proud Harvard alumni.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.700
As the incoming president of
the Harvard Alumni Association,

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:58.870
I want to talk about what
the HAA can do for you.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:02.750
As Roland mentioned, I do feel
a special bond with your class.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:07.440
Four years ago I served as
the lead marshal for the Mower

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.930
Dormitory Group when you
marched into this same theater

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:15.600
at your freshman convocation.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.360
I have returned to
campus often since then.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.500
One of your classmates is
my own son, Spencer Gisser,

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.270
who today is a graduating
senior Pforzheimer House.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.850
I am so proud of him.

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:36.450
And in that way, I know
how all your parents feel.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:40.350
Students, please make a point
today of hugging your parents

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:44.890
and thanking your family
for all their support.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.660
And yes, Spencer, babe,
I am talking to you.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.730
When I entered Harvard
in 1976 from my hometown

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.550
of Eagle Rock in
urban Los Angeles,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.710
I had no idea what to expect.

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:05.910
I had never lived in snow.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:10.070
I was mystified by the rivalry
between the fans of the Boston

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.500
Red Sox and the
New York Yankees.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:19.530
I was a Dodgers fan being
from L.A. I didn't know anyone

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:24.460
at Harvard and I wasn't sure how
I'd fit in or even if I would.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.060
My father had
grown up in poverty

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:30.220
as a Mexican-American
migrant farm worker,

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.790
and my mother was
a homemaker raising

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:36.090
four children on a tight budget.

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:40.910
And four years later
when I sat where you are,

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:45.410
I imagined that my Harvard
experience, as transformative

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:51.520
as it was, would
end upon graduation.

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.470
But in fact it was
just the beginning.

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:59.510
Since graduation I have
volunteered for Harvard

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.830
every year in every city
that I have lived in,

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.460
and I've moved a lot.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.000
Whenever I've moved
someplace new,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.540
I would contact the
local Harvard Club

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.070
and ask how I could help.

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:15.179
My freshman concerns
of not knowing

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:19.429
how I'd fit into a
community were gone forever.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:22.860
I have sat at many
registration tables,

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.800
met the Harvard alumni
who came through the door,

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.630
and listened to
captivating lectures

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.120
by the Harvard faculty.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.500
I have also interviewed some
of the amazing high school

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.150
students who apply for
admission each year.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.940
You can do these things too.

00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:48.300
My Harvard alumni mantra is
attend, volunteer, learn,

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.580
and connect.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:55.440
This last year, I traveled
around the world with the HAA

00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:02.210
meeting alumni leaders in Sofia,
Bulgaria, in Santiago, Chile,

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:05.140
and in Sydney, Australia.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:09.180
For me, the true
magic of Harvard

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:16.540
is its people, its extraordinary
students, faculty, and alumni.

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.720
Think about it.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:22.810
You're joining a club that
includes presidents, the Chief

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:27.830
Justice of the Supreme Court,
Nobel Prize winners, Pulitzer

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:32.990
Prize winners, Emmy Award
winners, technology titans,

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:36.250
leaders of social movements.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:39.490
We even have Weezer's
Rivers Cuomo and Rashida

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.090
Jones to make us all feel cool.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:43.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.820
The alumni community that
you are about to join

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:49.410
is here for you.

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.990
Networking is entirely
different from what

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:56.460
I thought it was when
I was in college.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.170
I have discovered that
the best networkers want

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:03.080
to know what they
can do for you.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.770
So come to the HAA's
next global networking

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:09.350
night, which is free of
charge and is happening

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:14.710
in over 70 cities around
the world on June 23.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:18.690
Another way to connect is to
join a Harvard shared interest

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.860
group.

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.490
These are virtual communities of
alumni that you access through

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:32.980
our website, which is
alumni.harvard.edu/cigs.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:36.560
There are now nearly 50
shared interest groups

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.510
with about 20,000
participating alumni.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.060
The groups include
Harvard Alumni

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:48.120
In Wine and Food, the Harvard
Asian American Alumni Alliance,

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:53.130
Harvard Alumni Entrepreneurs,
Harvard Radcliffe Science

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:58.780
Fiction Networking
Society, and Harvardwood.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:00.960
All of Harvard's
shared interest groups

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:06.770
are looking for young alumni and
welcome your energy and ideas.

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:11.120
For the past three years I have
co-chaired an alumni careers

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.960
task force that works closely
with the Office of Career

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.900
Services.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:21.690
Our group has developed a long
list of distinguished alumni

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:25.830
that spans the entire
occupational spectrum.

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.260
These alumni are
here to help you.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.770
The earliest years
of their own careers

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:36.790
often involved false
starts and meandering.

00:37:36.790 --> 00:37:40.140
But we also know that who
the undergraduates really

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:43.910
want to talk to are
the recent grads

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:48.200
to ask, what is it
really like out there?

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.980
So we hope that a
short time from now

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.950
you will volunteer
through Crimson Compass

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:56.540
to aid students in their
career explorations.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.730
The Harvard Alumni
Association will

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:03.540
be conducting our annual
meeting here tomorrow afternoon.

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.580
Please join us back here
after your house graduation

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.110
ceremonies conclude.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:13.990
We want you to discover that
your Harvard experience turns

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:20.160
out to be so much more than your
four years here in Cambridge.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:25.500
So here is what I wish for you.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.300
That your Harvard
experience and education

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.030
does not end with
your graduation.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.540
That you will choose
to remain engaged

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.350
with the people who have
meant so much to you

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.600
during your years here.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.910
That in time you will become
leaders in your professions

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:48.220
and in your communities
and that the continuing

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:52.440
support of your fellow alumni,
both your peers and those

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.840
who have preceded you,
will help sustain you

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.570
as you change the world.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.040
Congratulations, class of 2014.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:02.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.300
Does anyone have a laptop?

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.298
I need to go join my
local Harvard Club.

00:39:13.298 --> 00:39:15.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:15.980
Thank you.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.408
Thank you, Cynthia.

00:39:18.408 --> 00:39:19.970
Hi everyone.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:23.470
My name is Katie Walsh, and
I am the 2014 senior class

00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:25.620
committtee representative
from Adams House.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.730
[CHEERING]

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.840
Today I have the honor
of introducing our 2014

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.150
Senior Gift committee co-chairs.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:40.050
Arleen Chien, Preetha Hebbar,
Terah Lyons, Kavya Shankar,

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.450
and Joshua Zhang.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:46.450
Our five co-chairs come from
separate segments of Harvard.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:50.010
They cover four different
academic departments and a slew

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.320
of different
extracurricular pursuits,

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.920
yet they have developed an
incredible bond as a team.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.380
After a year of close
collaboration on Senior Gift,

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.110
our co-chairs have
created a friendship

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:05.960
full of memories
and silly nicknames.

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:09.650
Their friendship is a model
of Senior Gift's capacity

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:13.770
to bring everyone
in 2014 together.

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:16.220
Participating in Senior
Gift does not just

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.460
mean donating to Harvard.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:21.960
It means thinking about and
appreciating our time here,

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.840
paying it forward
to underclassmen,

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:28.480
investing ourselves even more
in this institution we love,

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.250
and creating new
while strengthening

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.550
the long lasting,
incredible relationships we

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.470
have made here.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.860
I am so grateful for what these
five individuals had given

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.170
to our class and to
Harvard's future.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:45.321
Please join me in welcoming
our 2014 Senior Gift co-chairs.

00:40:45.321 --> 00:40:48.267
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:03.488 --> 00:41:05.320
Thank you, Katie.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.960
Hi everyone, and
happy Class Day.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.170
I'm Arleen.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.810
As many of you know, the theme
of our Senior Gift campaign

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:16.810
this year was focused around
the metaphor of a puzzle.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.250
In our messaging
and conversations,

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:23.730
we try to educate everyone about
the important role philanthropy

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.970
plays at Harvard, and we
asked our fellow 2014-ers

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:30.870
to join us and be
a piece of this.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:34.920
We each hold a unique piece of
the Harvard College experience,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.330
and together we are
the class of 2014.

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:42.530
Thank you to the
1,185 seniors who

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:46.990
decided to make a gift this
year, helping us hit 78%

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:50.990
participation, the fifth highest
Senior Gift participation

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:53.110
mark in the college's history.

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:58.566 --> 00:41:59.704
Hi, I'm Preetha.

00:41:59.704 --> 00:42:03.580
[CHEERING]

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.570
This year, we had
the honor to speak

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:07.990
with many of our classmates
about their own individual

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:11.730
experiences and their
reasons for giving back.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.400
These conversations were carried
out by our 150 person gift

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.350
committee, comprised
of seniors who

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:22.840
volunteer their time to
this important effort.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.190
Each conversation yielded
a unique narrative.

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.740
And while we found
common threads,

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:32.180
it was thought provoking to
glimpse into our classmates'

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.350
individual Harvard experiences.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:37.930
Our campaign was a
class wide effort,

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.230
so we really
appreciate the feedback

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:44.430
and support given to
us by our engaging,

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:48.530
thoughtful, and
incredible classmates.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.890
Giving back to Harvard is
a way to say thank you.

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.580
But it is also a way to
be a piece of something

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.572
bigger than ourselves.

00:42:56.572 --> 00:42:58.977
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:03.490
I'm Terah.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:06.190
Throughout the campaign we
heard an incredible number

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:08.620
of compelling reasons
for giving back.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.190
You gave because Harvard helped
you identify your passion,

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:15.840
because it helps connect you to
incredible friends and mentors.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.760
You gave to support the
student organizations

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.360
you have been a part of.

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.150
You gave because you are about
athletics and high quality

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.820
advising relationships.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.650
You gave because financial aid
made your Harvard experience

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.260
possible in the first place.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:33.610
You gave because you want
the classes of 2018 and 2019

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:37.920
and 2020 to have as incredible
an experience as you did.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.910
Senior Gift serves as the
single largest collective act

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:45.220
that our class will
ever participate in,

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.200
and it is our way of showing
both alumni and underclassmen

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.710
that we care about this
place and the transformative

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:53.367
qualities that it possesses.

00:43:53.367 --> 00:43:56.979
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:56.979 --> 00:43:57.520
Hi, everyone.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.560
I'm Kavya.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.490
Senior Gift is
only the beginning

00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:05.100
of a tradition of giving back,
and we thank all the seniors

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.380
who expressed their
intention to continue giving.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.930
Our gifts today, and in the next
few years, have a huge impact.

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.760
They motivate and
energize other alumni

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.310
as well as symbolize
our vote of confidence

00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:21.590
in the strength and
future of Harvard College.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:24.040
Tomorrow as graduates,
we join a community

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.580
of alumni whose
generosity has helped

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.930
to ensure that Harvard
continues to be

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.700
a remarkable place for
all of its students.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.280
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.380
My name's Josh Zhang.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:45.360
To conclude, thank you again for
listening as we ask all of you

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.860
to reflect upon your
experiences here,

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:52.980
where H stands just as much for
home as it does for Harvard.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.280
Thank you for sharing your
thoughts and feedback with us,

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.370
whether you agreed or
disagreed, as we continue

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.690
to do what Harvard
students do best:

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:04.910
challenge and
motivate one another.

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:07.810
Thank you for coming
together as a class

00:45:07.810 --> 00:45:10.250
and giving back and
paying it forward

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:12.380
so that generations
of students after us

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:16.520
may enjoy an even more
beautiful and robust Harvard.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.710
We, the class of
2014, have already

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:22.300
accomplished so much during
our four years together here

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.780
as students.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.110
I can only imagine what
we'll accomplish as alumni.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:27.360
Thank you 2014.

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.342
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:38.870
Hello everyone.

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:41.256
My name is Maria
Barragan-Santana,

00:45:41.256 --> 00:45:45.480
and I am incredibly thankful
to serve as the Winthrop House

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.860
representative to the
senior class committee.

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.820
And it is now my honor to
introduce our first student

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.020
orator this afternoon.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:59.072
Many know this economics
concentrator and Winthrop House

00:45:59.072 --> 00:46:03.220
resident as a business
editor at the Harvard Crimson

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:07.030
or as a cast member of the
Hasty Pudding Theatricals.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:10.452
Or perhaps have seen him
perform in other theatrical

00:46:10.452 --> 00:46:13.620
productions, including
playing the role of Aldolpho

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.460
in The Drowsy Chaperone.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:21.510
Most importantly, however,
he is a great friend.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:25.220
One, who I've had the pleasure
of knowing since my freshman

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:29.532
year, in there, when we
were in the same entryway.

00:46:29.532 --> 00:46:32.530
He's the kind of friend
who you can count on

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.340
to help you through the
everyday stresses that

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.530
come with Harvard, believing
in you when you doubt yourself,

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.650
and celebrating with
you when you succeed.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:47.460
So please help me and join
me in welcoming to the stage

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:52.180
to deliver the Harvard
male oration, my friend,

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:57.660
the enthusiastic, inspiring,
hardworking, and always

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.220
supportive Adam Conner.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.540
I failed Harvard.

00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:28.012
Hello, class of 2014.

00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:29.440
Let me back up a second.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:34.290
That might have
been a bit extreme.

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:37.140
Hi Mom, and what's up Cheryl?

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.014
Hello.

00:47:38.014 --> 00:47:39.762
Hi.

00:47:39.762 --> 00:47:42.160
You know, I did a
lot of preparation

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:45.680
in writing this
speech for you today.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:51.190
And I did that mostly by
thinking about what a Harvard

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:54.910
orator should look
and sound like.

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:58.860
And what I came up
with was an image

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:04.060
of a student implementing
sophisticated literary elements

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:07.400
to effectively wear his
intelligence on his sleeve,

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:11.000
and referencing deep,
thoughtful quotes

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.120
scroll by erudite
classical poets,

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.450
and weaving together brilliantly
constructed sentences

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:22.290
of solid gold, using words taken
from deep and thoughtful quotes

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.690
scrolled by erudite
classical poets.

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:30.570
And maybe even overusing
the word erudite.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:32.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.920
But for eight minutes at a
podium in Tercentenary Theatre,

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:42.490
they are unblemished
and pristine.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:45.268
They are the ideal
Harvard graduate.

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:51.870
I don't have any of
that for you today.

00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:55.090
I don't use a lot of
metaphors and I barely

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:59.400
know what erudite means.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:04.020
Some might say that I'm
a failure in that regard.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:09.090
And so today, I come
bearing a simple message.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:14.320
We have endured what we
perceive as a failure

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:18.350
without really even
knowing what failure is.

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:21.820
We have conflated
failure with not getting

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.870
exactly what we want.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:29.360
And in doing so, have diminished
our many accomplishments.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.770
Take me for example.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:36.460
I am a first generation
college student on one side.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:38.400
I spent the majority
of my free time

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.790
here acting for thousands of
people, making them laugh,

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:45.010
and sometimes making them cry.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:49.250
I was even once kissed square
on the mouth by Jack Bauer,

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:50.750
if you can believe it.

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:51.280
I was.

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:59.010
I also couldn't get
into a final club.

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:03.850
I lost my bid to become Business
Manager of the Harvard Crimson.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.050
I sometimes struggle
with grades.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.530
And I didn't secure a full
time job with the company

00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:12.090
that I interned with.

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:16.790
To the untrained eye,
what does that look like?

00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:22.310
Success, or something different?

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:23.770
Let me switch
gears for a moment.

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:29.450
Harvard students,
we love to compare.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:32.540
After every exam
we clump together

00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.910
and we talk about what we wrote.

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:36.420
I mean, who hasn't
done that before?

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:41.300
We check our Facebooks and
see just how many people

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:45.150
have more impressive jobs or
graduate opportunities than we

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:46.830
do.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:50.290
Frankly, there's no more
blatant comparison of ourselves

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:53.700
to others then there is on
Housing Day, and no more

00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:57.180
blatant perception of failure.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.490
I got quadded.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:01.300
I thought that was a failure.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.390
I did.

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:10.720
I then got n minus 2 housing
within the quad, and I thought,

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.440
that's a failure
within a failure.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.870
That's a fail-ception.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.017
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:18.017 --> 00:51:20.350
I think that Edgar Allan Poe
must have written something

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:20.910
about that.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:25.010
Don't look that up.

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:30.790
It's just strange for a group
of individuals hand picked

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:34.410
by Harvard admissions to
bring continue successes

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:38.380
to the greatest university
in the world, bar none,

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:42.510
to at times feel compelled
to focus on looking

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:45.910
for miniature failures
in the comparisons

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:49.150
that we draw with one another.

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.820
Why?

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.390
I'm not saying that
comparing is bad.

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:56.860
Sometimes comparison is great.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.290
The inherent sense of
competition among students

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:03.350
here is extremely beneficial to
our development in some ways.

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:08.030
It requires us to perform
better and to work harder.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:12.190
A little competition is
healthy and it makes you grow.

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:14.510
But I am saying
that a lot of times

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:20.250
we take these comparisons in
the most negative way possible.

00:52:20.250 --> 00:52:25.150
An aspiring doctor may feel
relatively unaccomplished

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:29.840
when hearing about a friend's
cool tech internship.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.740
The lack of a thesis
paper from your suite

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.270
of academic
accomplishments becomes

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:38.960
a perceived intellectual
inferiority, despite your lack

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.800
of interest in academic writing.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:50.260
Being ignored by or rejected
from a social organization

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.860
becomes an assertion
that you may

00:52:52.860 --> 00:53:00.950
be cool or popular, but just
not enough for your peers.

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:05.910
And from these differences that
we rebrand as deficiencies,

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:10.680
we manufacture failure.

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.600
But we're not failures, are we?

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.340
No.

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.750
Of course not.

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:20.740
Without getting too cloyingly
preachy about Harvard,

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.440
we are all on the
path to living out

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.250
remarkably successful lives.

00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:28.700
And we knew that from
the moment we got here.

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.130
We opened that email
from admissions

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:33.880
after smashing the Refresh
button again and again

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.110
on our inbox.

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:42.740
We saw our acceptance and
we said, well, I'm set.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:48.190
And in a lot of cases, it didn't
even take a year for some of us

00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:53.850
to see some great thing that one
of our peers did and say, whoa.

00:53:53.850 --> 00:53:57.420
I'm no longer set.

00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.950
Our futures become
uncertain to us,

00:53:59.950 --> 00:54:04.060
often based on something
totally out of our control.

00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:06.830
And what's more, we
don't take the time

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:11.320
to truly celebrate the
success in the first place.

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.900
It might appear
that way sometimes

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:19.640
in the form of a celebratory
meal or drink or gift.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:24.060
But at a certain point,
albeit a relatively minor one,

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:28.430
it becomes an issue
of you being behind

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.870
and you needing to catch
up so that you are not

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:35.200
considered a failure.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.670
Now I don't mean to make
Harvard students out

00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:43.000
to be petulant frenemies who
constantly feel pessimistic

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.540
about their abilities.

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.010
They're not.

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:51.420
They're diverse, down to
earth, and downright brilliant.

00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:55.080
Check out that fancy
literary device.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.320
And I'm honored to be
counted among the company

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.020
of such talented individuals.

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:06.800
But I am saying that sometimes,
not being first or the best

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.230
can sour what we've
accomplished and drive us

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:17.350
to saying or thinking, at
some point, I have failed.

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:23.630
And as I said before, we
are so not failures at all.

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:25.500
Look at us.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:31.740
We are poets,
musicians, artists.

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:35.460
We are athletes and
champions at that.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:40.240
We are scientists, bound to
unlock the greatest discoveries

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.020
heretofore in human history.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:45.450
We are future
politicians who will

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:47.950
shape this nation
for the better.

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:52.690
There may even be a future
president sitting in this crowd

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:54.830
this afternoon.

00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:56.750
And guess what?

00:55:56.750 --> 00:56:03.960
That president might
not have had a 4.0.

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:08.410
And that president may not
have gotten the dream job

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:11.350
that he or she
thought they wanted.

00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:14.000
And you know what
I'm willing to bet?

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:20.136
That president is sitting here
today and listening to me talk

00:56:20.136 --> 00:56:23.450
and looking back on
his or her for years,

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:29.580
and might be reminded of
the failures rather than

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:34.010
the future, disregarding all
of the great things happening

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:37.671
right now and those that
will happen in the many years

00:56:37.671 --> 00:56:38.170
to come.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:46.770
So I stand up here before
you and I look back

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:51.240
at the 45 months since I first
stepped into Harvard Yard-- I

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.230
know, it's a lot of months--
as a fresh-faced, fledgling

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.730
freshman.

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.880
And what do I see?

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:09.620
Well, I didn't get the social
standing I thought I wanted

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:14.100
or the big leadership position
that I thought I wanted,

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:18.090
or the grades that
I maybe wanted.

00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:21.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:25.310
Or the job that I thought
I definitely wanted.

00:57:25.310 --> 00:57:30.050
On paper, that looks
a lot like failure.

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:34.780
That's academic life,
personal life, social life,

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:37.240
future professional life.

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:42.398
On paper that's a
whole lot of nothing.

00:57:42.398 --> 00:57:45.450
You know what?

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:48.130
That's fine.

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:52.460
Because I didn't
really fail, did I?

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:56.580
I just didn't get what
I thought I wanted.

00:57:56.580 --> 00:58:02.780
Instead, I got friendships
that will last a lifetime.

00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:07.930
I got a great job that I
love, keeps me close to home.

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:11.100
I found a girl that I love.

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.530
And I got a fantastic education.

00:58:14.530 --> 00:58:19.920
But I didn't get exactly
what I thought I wanted.

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.301
None of us has always
gotten exactly what we want.

00:58:23.301 --> 00:58:26.270
And at one point or
another, we have all

00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:28.900
considered that failure.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:33.210
And it takes a long time to
resolve that perceived failure

00:58:33.210 --> 00:58:37.110
as a learning experience or as
an opportunity for other doors

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:39.320
to open.

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:42.800
But especially this
week, a week spent

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:47.080
celebrating our hard
work and our triumphs,

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:51.110
a week culminating in
a commencement so named

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:54.220
because it marks
a new beginning,

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:59.220
we should start
focusing on the success.

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:03.660
Because in the end, we can try
to measure our relative level

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:09.470
of success here at Harvard based
on the setbacks and the defeats

00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:11.818
and the B minuses.

00:59:11.818 --> 00:59:17.760
Or we can take a step back
and see just how little

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:21.440
that matters in the long run.

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:27.250
Only then will we truly
recognize how far we've come

00:59:27.250 --> 00:59:28.300
and how far we'll go.

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:34.275
I failed Harvard.

00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:40.100
Or did I?

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:40.979
Thank you.

00:59:40.979 --> 00:59:42.935
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:00.140
Good afternoon, class of
2014, friends, and family.

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.150
My name is Yolanda
Borquaye and I

01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:06.280
am one of the 2014
senior class marshals.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.660
Today I have the distinct
privilege and honor

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:11.240
of introducing to you
a Pforzheimer House

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.390
native and friend,
Christie DiSilvestro.

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:16.722
Christie hails from
Haverford, Pennsylvania,

01:00:16.722 --> 01:00:18.180
and has spent much
of her time here

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.570
at Harvard exploring the
intersection between psychology

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:24.170
and medicine, particularly
as it pertains

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:27.570
to the psychological issues
children and families face

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:32.040
after traumatic injury
or long-term diagnosis.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.220
After graduation she'll
be continuing this passion

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.165
in graduate school at the
University of Pennsylvania.

01:00:37.165 --> 01:00:39.540
When I asked several of her
friends to describe Christie,

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.998
the two words that
they kept saying

01:00:40.998 --> 01:00:44.160
were kind and thoughtful,
and I am so honored

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.380
and pleased that she'll be
addressing us here today.

01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:49.220
So without further
ado, please join me

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.270
in welcoming our
next 2014 Harvard

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:53.628
orator, Christie DiSilvestro.

01:00:53.628 --> 01:00:56.118
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:10.270
A picture, a permanent record
of happiness or triumph or love,

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:13.060
a small token to ensure
that a moment doesn't get

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.140
lost in the fray.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.750
Photographs are everywhere.

01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:20.700
With the rise of Instagram
and the ever-growing Twitter

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:23.570
and Facebook perfectly
coinciding with our college

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:26.520
career, we have
endless opportunities

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.380
to capture moments and
freeze them forever.

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.730
We take pictures of
almost everything.

01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.790
We do this so much that we
don't think twice about it,

01:01:36.790 --> 01:01:39.310
and might not even realize
the significance of what

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:41.040
we're capturing.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.390
Years from now we
will have the ability

01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:47.460
to look back on our college days
and have an array of memories

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:51.670
to focus on, never having
to lose a flash of happiness

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:55.440
as we grow more
distant from Harvard.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.230
But what about the memories
that we don't capture on film?

01:01:59.230 --> 01:02:02.730
The times when unexpected
challenges stop us

01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:04.840
in our tracks?

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.800
These are the moments
when snapping a selfie

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.110
is the furthest
thought from our minds.

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:13.800
Think of all the tough
times that you've faced

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.060
or the obstacles you've
helped a friend overcome,

01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:19.190
and how that's affected
you as a person.

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:21.040
Think about surprising
opportunities

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.905
that came your
way and caused you

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:26.590
to choose a different path
than you had predicted.

01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:30.790
The truth is when we experience
something that changes us

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:34.370
forever, whether
it is good or bad,

01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:37.540
we don't use an
iPhone to save it.

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.670
We remember these
moments forever

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:42.030
without the help of a lens.

01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:44.170
They can't be
captured in a picture.

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:46.890
No words can easily
describe them.

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:51.250
And yet, they define
our self-portrait.

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:53.610
When we first
arrived on campus we

01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:56.530
were filled with the frenzy and
excitement of early freshman

01:02:56.530 --> 01:02:57.710
year.

01:02:57.710 --> 01:03:01.480
We had the opportunity to
entirely reinvent ourselves,

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.840
starting fresh in a
place where no one had

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.780
prior impressions of us.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:09.750
It was an adventurous, turn on
the camera type of experience

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:12.960
when we pictured the story
of our new lives and the path

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.800
that we would travel on
for the next four years.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.530
Now imagine that you could
read a letter written

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:24.080
by that wide-eyed freshman
year self about who you were

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:26.800
and what you wanted to become.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.490
What would be your
reaction today?

01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:31.630
Would those hopes
and beliefs map

01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:35.160
onto who you have
become as an individual?

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.020
For all of us, our
college experience

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:41.120
and even our identities
did not unfold

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.070
in exactly the way we imagined.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.570
We have since migrated from
that first mold that we made.

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:49.380
But the changes
we've experienced

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:53.430
have made us into stronger,
more mature, and more resilient

01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:55.520
individuals.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.300
The event that has
changed the most

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.710
crashed down on me in the
spring of my freshman year

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.036
as a varsity water polo player.

01:04:02.036 --> 01:04:04.560
A double hip injury
assaulted my body

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:07.920
and left me unable
to walk within days.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.100
The injury resulted in
two expensive surgeries

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.690
and over six months on crutches.

01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:17.750
For more than two years, I
could not sit, stand, or walk

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.400
liberally.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:21.730
Not only could I
not play sports,

01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:25.380
I couldn't navigate
campus, go to class,

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:28.380
or live the normal life
of a college student.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.895
I took one semester of
final exams lying down

01:04:30.895 --> 01:04:34.820
in a bed in UHS and
another semester of finals

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.170
standing and writing at a
podium while the proctor

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:40.390
sat at the desks
because I could not sit.

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:43.000
I was constantly in pain.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.310
But as our challenges often
do, this time of darkness

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:50.660
showed me light and laughter
in places I never expected.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.410
An endearing new
nickname-- Crutchy--

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:57.290
that I heard more often than
my real name, and a pair

01:04:57.290 --> 01:04:59.640
of crutches that I
covered in zebra tape

01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:04.280
helped give me a boost when
moving at a snail's pace.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.680
I received help from
people I had never met,

01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.220
from people whose names
I would never know.

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:13.670
Harvard is notorious
for its selective hand

01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:17.000
picking of students, and
through my experience,

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.890
I learned that this campus is
full of the most compassionate

01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:22.270
people.

01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:25.200
I never felt alone in
such a warm community

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.270
and received a helping hand
from everyone around me.

01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:32.800
In return, the most I could
do was lend my crutches

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.560
to friends at parties
to help them meet guys,

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.595
a tactics we found
surprisingly successful.

01:05:39.595 --> 01:05:42.390
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:46.060
Tiny moments morphed
into great memories.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.640
Picture a handsome guy you
have a crush on inviting you

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.910
to a party that you declined
because you can't walk up

01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:55.220
the stairs, so he offers
to give you a piggyback.

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.620
I had to rely on others for
almost everything that I did.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:02.950
Even your classic Sunday
morning walk of shame

01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:05.590
was no longer independent.

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:08.300
It's an entirely
different experience

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:11.060
when he has to carry
you back to your dorm

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:16.010
while his roommate carries
your crutches alongside him.

01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:20.010
If you're thinking that would
be awkward and hilarious,

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:22.070
it totally was.

01:06:22.070 --> 01:06:26.100
But these memories are now
my most endearing treasures

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:30.494
that sparked the beginning of
a long lasting relationship.

01:06:30.494 --> 01:06:34.070
When I look back at the
journey of my injury,

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:35.840
my goals and my
impression of how

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:40.210
I might fit into this
community completely changed.

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:44.100
I tried to hold onto water polo
for two years after I was hurt,

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:47.380
but I eventually
had to let that go.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:50.710
I learned to immerse
myself in joy.

01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:53.610
I learned how important
it is to surround yourself

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:56.320
with the people who lift
you up-- in my case,

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.290
sometimes literally--
and walk away

01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:01.950
from the ones who
bring you down.

01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:04.430
My injury was not a time
I was ready to pull out

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.430
the camera and document.

01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:10.610
But it was important
and life changing.

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:14.190
Many of our greatest lessons
are not learned in class

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:16.220
or read in a textbook.

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.640
We all tackled a huge
transition from the safety net

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.520
of living at home
with our families

01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:24.140
to the autonomy of
a college campus.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.490
When we faced struggles,
we were forced

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:29.050
to rely on our
friends and peers.

01:07:29.050 --> 01:07:32.780
We became mentors and shoulders
to lean on for others.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.810
Their hard times
became our challenges

01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:39.880
just as their moments of
joy became our celebrations.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:42.530
We created a new
definition of family,

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:45.800
one that included all
those who are alongside us

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.430
for our hurdles and heartaches.

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.300
Through this
process, we developed

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.650
our own unique
identities, preparing

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:56.270
us to take on the real world.

01:07:56.270 --> 01:08:00.070
No matter what has caused you to
change over the past few years,

01:08:00.070 --> 01:08:04.570
embrace those changes and who
you have become as a result.

01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:06.690
Maybe you took an
elective senior year

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:10.180
and surprised yourself with how
much you enjoyed the material,

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:14.160
making you rethink your
career path late in the game.

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.960
Maybe you had issues with
roommates and adjusting

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:21.040
to a new living situation at
the beginning of a school year.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.620
Perhaps you made
a mistake, caused

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:27.910
harm that you took the steps
to remedy and make right.

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:30.290
Maybe you received
inspiring advice

01:08:30.290 --> 01:08:32.680
that made you turn your
life around and walk

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.960
with more confidence.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.850
When you think of
the big moments that

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:39.640
have affected your
college career,

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:44.569
you don't need a digital
photograph to remember them.

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:47.300
One of them, the
Boston Marathon,

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:50.970
affected and unified
us unlike any other.

01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:53.750
Everyone remembers where
they were junior year when

01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.870
they heard about
the detonations,

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:58.590
even if they weren't at
the marathon experiencing

01:08:58.590 --> 01:09:01.740
the terrifying panic firsthand.

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:03.410
Everyone remembers
the entire day

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:08.490
of lockdown later that week,
and the relief when it was over.

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:11.479
This disaster taught
us the importance

01:09:11.479 --> 01:09:13.979
of appreciating the
strangers around us,

01:09:13.979 --> 01:09:16.090
knowing that at any
given moment they

01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:18.880
could be the very
ones to save us.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.399
It taught us to run to help
others rather than running

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.859
away.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:26.490
As a class, leaning
on each other,

01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:31.180
we grew from this tragedy and
became stronger because of it.

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:33.420
Eventually we
learned that it's OK

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:35.569
if something blindsides
us and causes

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:39.500
us to stray from the plan we
thought we were executing.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.124
Sometimes these
blindsides can teach

01:09:41.124 --> 01:09:43.800
us to appreciate what is
around us even more than we

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.470
did before.

01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:47.540
I personally have a
renewed appreciation

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:50.180
for the little things
that surround me.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.720
I now appreciate the
ability to walk freely

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.710
around campus, the
ability to concentrate

01:09:55.710 --> 01:09:59.110
without the constant
reminder of physical pain,

01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:01.270
the ability to see
someone struggling

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:03.160
and be able to offer
him or her that

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:07.880
helping hand instead
of only receiving it.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:10.010
All these major changes
we have experienced

01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:15.590
in college-- the good and the
bad times that shape us-- these

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:18.800
are the images that
captured memories,

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.750
that aren't in a Facebook
album, but instead

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:26.020
compile and create the album
of us, the self-portrait

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:29.760
with moments we will
always hold dear.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.050
Embrace the changes
that come your way

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:35.200
and enrich your
development as a person.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.940
Enjoy the little
things, for one day,

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:42.240
you may look back and realize
they were the big things.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:46.250
So enjoy all the laughs
that make life so wonderful,

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:50.230
but also take time to stop and
think about all the moments

01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:54.460
and changes that actually got
you to where you are today.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:58.800
The people you've leaned on and
those who have leaned on you,

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.210
the friends you've celebrated
with in triumph and progress,

01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:06.912
the unexpected side roads
that you've traveled on.

01:11:06.912 --> 01:11:08.716
And then, yes.

01:11:08.716 --> 01:11:10.420
Take a picture.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:13.740
But be sure to appreciate
the entire self-portrait

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:15.850
you are truly capturing.

01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:18.540
And when something
memorable comes your way,

01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:24.706
don't never hesitate to say,
but first, let me take a selfie.

01:11:24.706 --> 01:11:26.182
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:27.166
Thank you!

01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:29.626
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:48.170
Good afternoon faculty, friends,
family, and the class of 2014.

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:50.115
My name is Catherine
Philbin, and I

01:11:50.115 --> 01:11:52.980
am thrilled to be serving
as the representative

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.115
from the great Dunster House.

01:11:55.115 --> 01:11:58.050
[CHEERS]

01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:01.960
Today it is my honor to
introduce the Richard Glover

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.190
and Henry Russell
Ames Memorial Award.

01:12:06.190 --> 01:12:11.030
As many of you already know,
the members of the class of 2014

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:16.140
have shown a great commitment
to the service of others.

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:21.050
This includes the service
to Harvard, the nation,

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:23.850
and our global community.

01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:27.210
Many members of our great
class have gone four years

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:31.580
without any recognition for
their hard work, compassion,

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:34.550
and determination
to help others.

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:37.740
However, the Ames
Award works to honor

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:42.100
two unsung heroes of our class.

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:48.720
On June 19, 1935, Richard Glover
Ames and Henry Russell Ames,

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.410
brothers and Harvard
students, gave their lives

01:12:52.410 --> 01:12:56.200
to save their father who was
washed overboard during a storm

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.000
off the coast of Newfoundland.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.190
Every year since,
the Ames Award has

01:13:01.190 --> 01:13:03.940
been given in their
memory to recognize

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:07.120
two members of our class
who have shown energy

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:09.270
in helping others
and who exhibit

01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:12.560
the same heroic
character and inspiring

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:15.620
leadership as the Ames brothers.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:19.070
The selection committee received
a large number of nominations

01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:24.420
from faculty, house masters,
tutors, and fellow seniors,

01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:27.610
and the decision process
was incredibly difficult,

01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:31.410
and we could not be more
proud of our classmates who

01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:36.290
have made such a tremendous
impact on their communities.

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:39.820
I invite all of the nominees
for this year's Ames Award

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:42.370
to please stand
and be recognized.

01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:44.835
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:00.130 --> 01:14:03.030
At this time, it is my
pleasure to introduce

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:05.580
Akshay Sharma,
class marshal, who

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:09.720
will present the first
recipient of the Ames Award.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.530
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:15.720
Thank you, Cath.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.030
Good afternoon.

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:18.020
What a beautiful day.

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:19.665
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.680
Congratulations again
to all the nominees,

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.880
and thank you for your
outstanding leadership

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.910
and heroism in
service to others.

01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:35.740
The Ames Award is
presented annually

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:39.230
as the senior class leaves
the gates of Harvard,

01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:45.040
and it reminds us the importance
of connecting, engaging,

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.680
and serving in the communities
that we are about to enter.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.030
Each one of us
has within ourself

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:58.450
the potential to affect
positive change in this world

01:14:58.450 --> 01:15:01.692
when we combine the
skills we have developed,

01:15:01.692 --> 01:15:05.650
the passions that we
have cultivated here

01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:07.980
with an awareness of
the existing need.

01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:15.220
Ultimately, the success
that we measure in our lives

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:22.880
will not be defined by how high
we reach or how far we travel,

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:25.690
but by how many lives we change.

01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:32.280
Our first of today's
Ames Award recipients

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.706
has been dedicated in his
pursuit to help those in need.

01:15:36.706 --> 01:15:40.350
In the face of grave
financial adversity,

01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:44.490
his sheer passion for learning
and high scholastic achievement

01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:47.280
afforded him the
opportunity to receive

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.920
a fully funded
primary education.

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.540
Upon arriving at
Harvard, he has set

01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:58.470
to the task of giving
back to the community that

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:02.480
supported him in the past.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:05.220
Originally from
Swaziland, a country

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:07.530
with one of the
highest incidence

01:16:07.530 --> 01:16:11.400
rates of HIV infection
in the world,

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.260
he has dedicated
his last four years

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.420
to combating the disease
that claimed many

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.902
in his community, both
friends and family.

01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:27.660
He has spent the last three
years at the Reagan Institute

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:32.320
of MIT, Harvard, and the
Massachusetts General Hospital

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:36.920
researching the
immunological basis of HIV.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.110
He spent summers at the
Don McKenzie Hospital

01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:43.850
in Durban, South Africa,
implementing testing,

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:51.280
counseling, and treatment
adherence programs for HIV.

01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:54.290
And last year, he
founded an organization

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:57.130
by the name of
[? Salbona ?] Health,

01:16:57.130 --> 01:17:01.140
tasked with increasing and
improving the health of HIV

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:05.100
patients globally by
increasing patient adherence

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:10.360
to integral
antiretroviral therapies.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.530
Next year he will be
back in his home country

01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:15.960
Swaziland, working to
combat and find solutions

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:21.330
to structural problems linked
to poor HIV treatment adherence,

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:24.800
mainly food security.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:28.520
Members of this recipient's
house community at Harvard

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:31.460
are confident that
he will succeed

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:34.640
in bringing about a
genuine transformation

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.810
in his community.

01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:40.840
They cite the nobility
and genuineness

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.730
of his passion for
public service.

01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:48.420
And all the while, his
extraordinary achievement

01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:53.230
is coupled with
genuine humility.

01:17:53.230 --> 01:17:58.550
Please join me in congratulating
our first Ames Award recipient,

01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:02.840
resident of Pforzheimer House,
fellow member of the class

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:09.690
of 2014, a healer of
the world, and hero,

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:11.436
[? Mjhanke ?] [? Shbangu. ?]

01:18:11.436 --> 01:18:13.916
[APPLAUSE]

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.560
It is now my honor to introduce
Erin Drake, class marshal who

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.565
will present the second
recipient of the Ames award.

01:19:13.565 --> 01:19:14.941
[CHEERS]

01:19:14.941 --> 01:19:16.384
Go Erin!

01:19:16.384 --> 01:19:17.830
Woo!

01:19:17.830 --> 01:19:19.910
Thank you Cath, and
congratulations again,

01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:23.700
[? Mjhanke. ?]
Hello, class of 2014.

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:26.591
You all look very
warm out there.

01:19:26.591 --> 01:19:27.340
It's warm up here.

01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:29.560
OK.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.330
Our next Richard Glover Ames
and Henry Russell Ames Award

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:36.860
goes to a woman whose
recommender described her

01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:43.240
as a force of nature, an
advocate, a mentor, and someone

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.180
who is relentlessly
loyal, keeping her friends

01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:51.270
a top priority, even when school
and extracurriculars could

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:53.330
easily distract.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:56.340
This woman is someone
who I and many of you

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:58.590
have met over the
past four years.

01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:02.410
She was a participant in the
First Year Urban program,

01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:06.950
a peer counselor for Room
13, and a tireless volunteer,

01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:10.720
supervisor, and director at
the Phillips Brooks House

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.940
association's Harvard
Square Homeless Shelter.

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:15.900
Alternatively,
you could know her

01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:20.130
as a girl who had a
Facebook picture with Drake.

01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:23.790
During her time here she
has studied psychology,

01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:27.270
but has learned to be a selfless
leader and someone whose

01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:31.010
friends describe as more
dependable than anyone,

01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:34.210
compassionate, and empathetic.

01:20:34.210 --> 01:20:37.770
Now she leads a team of
students in their effort

01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:41.250
to establish the first entirely
student run youth homeless

01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:43.920
shelter in the nation.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.720
Regardless of when or how
you came in contact with her,

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:51.420
I'm sure she didn't just list
off her activities, leadership

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:55.160
roles, and famous
friends as I just did.

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:59.080
I'm sure that because,
like most unsung heroes,

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.920
she lets her work
speak for itself.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:07.170
Well today, on a day when
there's time and an opportunity

01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:11.400
to honor two of many
unsung heroes in our class,

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:18.830
join me in congratulating the
next 2014 Richard Glover Ames

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:23.660
and Henry Russell Ames Award
recipient, Sarah Rosenkrantz.

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.990
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:06.790
Congratulations to the
2014 Ames recipients.

01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:09.240
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:18.795
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:22:18.795 --> 01:22:21.170
My name is Raina Gandhi, and
I'm the proud representative

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:23.086
of Mather House on the
senior class committee.

01:22:23.086 --> 01:22:25.770
[CHEERS]

01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:27.640
I'm Basil Williams,
and I'm proud to be

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:29.380
the representative
of Pforzheimer House.

01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:34.800
Looking back to when we
last sat in this yard,

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.630
during our freshman
convocation, we

01:22:37.630 --> 01:22:40.110
had high hopes for
the next four years.

01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:42.070
We expected that
we would change,

01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:45.110
that we would grow and
develop into smarter and more

01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:49.540
thoughtful scholars,
citizens, and people.

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:53.860
Yet what we didn't
necessarily think about then

01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:58.040
was how growth depends not
only on positive change,

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.780
but also on loss.

01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:04.470
Each loss develops
our character,

01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:07.670
teaches us something
new about life,

01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:11.213
and may challenge or
reinforce our own beliefs.

01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:16.800
The most tragic losses
involve the passing

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.320
of those who we love.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.020
Many of us have lost relatives,
family, friends, and classmates

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:26.940
without whom we would not
have reached this occasion.

01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.410
There are classmates who
started with us at Harvard

01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:32.670
but will not be walking with
us at commencement tomorrow.

01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:35.610
These classes have shaped
our experiences here

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:38.950
and deserve to be recognized
for their contribution

01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:41.670
as long with ours.

01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:43.760
Please join us in
a moment of silence

01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:47.720
to remember the family, friends,
and members of the university

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:50.260
community who are
not amongst us today.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.800
Thank you.

01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.460
As we graduate
tomorrow we wonder,

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:14.010
where do we go from here?

01:24:14.010 --> 01:24:16.790
We'll be facing new
challenges after we

01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:19.410
pass through these gates.

01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:23.160
Yet we don't have
to face them alone.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.790
Cody Laramie wrote,
"We are part of lives

01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:32.450
we have yet to live and see."

01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:35.630
The lives we are a part
of are not just our own,

01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:39.020
but those of our
loved ones as well.

01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:42.490
Reach out to those around
you for support and guidance.

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:45.980
Hold onto the memories
and relationships

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:49.710
we've built during
our time here.

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:52.690
They can help carry us
through both challenging times

01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:58.240
and triumphant times, trying
times, and joyous times.

01:24:58.240 --> 01:24:59.760
Thank you.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.260
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:14.760
Good afternoon seniors,
friends, family, and loved ones

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:16.880
joining us here today.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.990
Thank you to Raina and
Basil for their touching

01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:21.560
and beautiful remarks.

01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:25.390
My name is Anthony Palillo and I
am one of the 2014 senior class

01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:28.190
marshals.

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:31.720
I am honored and excited to be
introducing Quincy House native

01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.870
and a good friend, Jenna Martin,
as our 2014 Female Ivy Orator.

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:39.866
Jenna is originally from
Los Angeles, California.

01:25:39.866 --> 01:25:43.370
At Harvard, Jenna was an English
concentrator, the head writer

01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:46.630
of On Harvard Time, an on
campus comedic news show,

01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:49.390
and a member of the
Lampoon Lit Staff.

01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:52.560
Jenna was also involved with
sketch comedy on campus,

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.800
and during her summers she
interned at The Daily Show

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.190
with Jon Stewart
and The New Yorker,

01:25:58.190 --> 01:26:01.550
where she was published twice
on the magazine's website.

01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:04.890
After graduation, she will
be returning to Los Angeles

01:26:04.890 --> 01:26:08.640
to pursue a career as
a television writer.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:10.610
Without further
ado, please join me

01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:13.420
in welcoming the amazing,
extremely talented,

01:26:13.420 --> 01:26:16.954
and wonderful Jenna Martin,
our 2014 Female Ivy Orator.

01:26:16.954 --> 01:26:19.439
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:25.410 --> 01:26:26.300
Thank you, Anthony.

01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:33.180
I'd like to thank you all for
coming, family and friends

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:36.480
especially, because,
let's face it.

01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.146
No one likes going
to graduations.

01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:46.290
With apologies to any recent
middle school graduates,

01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:49.870
kindergarten graduation
is the last cute one.

01:26:49.870 --> 01:26:53.240
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.480
And coming to this
one is like going

01:26:55.480 --> 01:27:01.870
to a wedding for 1,655
couples when you really

01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:03.800
only care about one--

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.260
[LAUGHTER

01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:06.160
--if that.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.780
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:14.270
To the esteemed
professors and TFs,

01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:17.200
you've been to so
many graduations

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:21.120
that I sincerely hope
you're playing a drinking

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.625
game to get through this one.

01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:25.560
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:28.585
I'll even say some key
words to get you chugging.

01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:32.240
Harvard.

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.096
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.040
Graduation.

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.170
Future.

01:27:41.170 --> 01:27:42.948
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:42.948 --> 01:27:43.447
Compassion.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:50.390
To the class of 2014,
I imagine we're all

01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:54.520
feeling some mix of
anxiety and relief.

01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:58.440
And if you're anything like
me, a little bit of anxiety

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:03.630
is enough to overwhelm
whatever else you're feeling.

01:28:03.630 --> 01:28:07.380
That anxiety can make
you prematurely nostalgic

01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:11.680
for the days when your biggest
problem was a five to seven

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:17.470
page paper, also known as a four
page paper with wide margins

01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:19.270
and a really long title.

01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:21.234
[LAUGHTER]

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:26.120
Or when your biggest
problem with that

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.870
you have too many advisers.

01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:33.880
By now each of us has
had a freshman adviser,

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.870
a peer advising fellow, a
proctor, a resident dean

01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:42.220
of freshman-- those
last two are different,

01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:47.850
by the way-- a sophomore
adviser, an Allston Burr

01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:52.330
resident dean, a sophomore
advising coordinator,

01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:57.221
a concentration adviser, and
for the masochistic, a thesis

01:28:57.221 --> 01:28:57.720
adviser.

01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:01.270
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:05.602
I sincerely thank
all of my advisors.

01:29:05.602 --> 01:29:07.720
But I just want to
put it out there

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:12.530
that Luke Skywalker defeated the
empire with only one advisor.

01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:14.515
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:22.186
And he spoke in
incoherent aphorisms--

01:29:22.186 --> 01:29:25.890
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:31.080
--had crazily
inconvenient office hours,

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:34.900
and never once offered
Luke a mini Mr. Goodbar.

01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.320
[LAUGHTER]

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:41.420
Despite the luxury
of too many advisers,

01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:43.420
there are some
questions on our minds

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:47.010
right now that no one
can answer for certain.

01:29:47.010 --> 01:29:50.730
Like, will the clubs I
joined be enough to convince

01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:56.420
my future children
that I used to be cool?

01:29:56.420 --> 01:30:01.900
Will my concentration have any
application in the real world?

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:04.250
It's common at this
point to bring up

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:06.090
folklore and mythology.

01:30:06.090 --> 01:30:09.450
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:09.450 --> 01:30:13.515
But I don't think Celtic studies
gets the attention it deserves.

01:30:13.515 --> 01:30:15.670
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:23.010
Most people either
don't know what

01:30:23.010 --> 01:30:25.735
that is, or think you're
pronouncing it wrong.

01:30:25.735 --> 01:30:29.240
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:33.270
And perhaps the scariest
question of all,

01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:37.010
did I peak in college?

01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:39.840
I think that there
are two and only

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:43.120
two answers to this question.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:46.202
Absolutely not and,
you know, probably.

01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:53.980
I'll entertain the you
know, probably answer first.

01:30:53.980 --> 01:30:58.250
We're about to enter a scary
world where our dumb mistakes

01:30:58.250 --> 01:31:01.390
will be met with a dubious
look and a wisecrack

01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:04.140
about where we went to college.

01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:07.370
At least here if someone
says, ugh, there's

01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:11.920
no way you go to Harvard,
it's usually a pickup line.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.848
[LAUGHTER]

01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:28.840
If I may speak from my own fears
of having peaked in college,

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:31.330
when I first came to
Harvard, a part of me

01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:34.920
just wanted to study
English and write comedy,

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:38.320
but another part of me wanted
to discover something new that

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:43.950
would become my passion, like
anthropology or conceptual art,

01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:45.770
but hopefully
investment banking.

01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:48.076
[LAUGHTER]

01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:55.380
Four years later, I'm
getting a degree in English,

01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:59.670
and every club I joined was
somehow related to comedy,

01:31:59.670 --> 01:32:02.350
with the arguable
exception of the Lampoon.

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:04.795
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:10.670 --> 01:32:14.230
It turns out I can't be changed.

01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:18.665
If I may sum up my experience
in the metaphor-- oh, I'm sorry,

01:32:18.665 --> 01:32:20.380
a simile--

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.530
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:25.320
Who says an English
degree is useless?

01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:34.010
I'm like one of television's
many illustrious bad boys.

01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:40.820
Don Draper, Tony
Soprano, Chuck Bass.

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:44.600
Harvard's Gen Ed requirements
and activity fairs

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:48.390
are like another character
who thinks it can change me,

01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:51.370
but sorry Harvard.

01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:52.770
I can't be changed.

01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:58.470
And that's why this
day makes me sad.

01:32:58.470 --> 01:33:03.580
Because not only can I no longer
compare myself to Don Draper,

01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.430
but I also don't
know for certain

01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:10.380
if I'll find another place where
I can be so completely myself

01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:13.750
and still have friends
and feel fulfilled.

01:33:13.750 --> 01:33:16.880
Where else will I be
surrounded by so many people

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:21.640
just being their dorky selves
and doing what they love?

01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:24.016
Except at a white collar prison.

01:33:24.016 --> 01:33:25.914
[LAUGHTER]

01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:36.440
So maybe it's all
downhill from here.

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.150
Just like it's been downhill
for commencement day

01:33:39.150 --> 01:33:41.630
speakers since Oprah
came last year.

01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:43.554
[LAUGHTER]

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:52.150
But I mean, seriously.

01:33:52.150 --> 01:33:56.700
Good luck tomorrow, former mayor
of something what's his face?

01:33:56.700 --> 01:33:58.656
[LAUGHTER]

01:34:04.530 --> 01:34:09.110
However, the one thing I do
like about graduation also

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:13.560
leads me to believe that we
didn't all peak in college.

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:16.490
My fellow graduates,
there's probably

01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:20.360
someone in the class of
2014 who makes you think,

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:22.020
well, I'm screwed.

01:34:22.020 --> 01:34:26.440
But that guy is
going to be amazing.

01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:30.330
Well, graduation allows
you to share something

01:34:30.330 --> 01:34:32.270
with that person.

01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:34.120
And I'll bet
there's someone else

01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.180
who feels the same
way about you.

01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:40.050
Why, the person
who looks up to you

01:34:40.050 --> 01:34:45.840
could even be speaking right
now if your name is Zamyla Chan.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:49.970
[CHEERS]

01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:53.870
If you're still worried that you
might have peaked in college,

01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:56.640
then think of your
favorite Harvard grad.

01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:00.440
Could be JFK, could
be Natalie Portman.

01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:03.326
Mine hands down is John Adams.

01:35:07.340 --> 01:35:09.580
I mean, his life
probably didn't turn out

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:12.890
the way he expected
when he graduated,

01:35:12.890 --> 01:35:17.430
but he still became
our second president.

01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:21.957
You might even say he was
the Yale of presidents.

01:35:21.957 --> 01:35:23.945
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:33.080
He married an incredible lady
and inspired an entire mini

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.070
series.

01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:36.415
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.930
When I was accepted
into Harvard,

01:35:42.930 --> 01:35:47.270
I couldn't wait to go to the
same school as our grouchiest

01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:50.080
founding father.

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:53.770
You might even say I
came for the John Adams

01:35:53.770 --> 01:35:56.300
and then stayed
for the Sam Adams.

01:35:56.300 --> 01:35:59.910
[LAUGHTER]

01:35:59.910 --> 01:36:01.420
Yeah, but please don't say that.

01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:04.920
My parents are in the audience.

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:09.010
My point is, the person who
made you excited to come here

01:36:09.010 --> 01:36:12.710
should also make you
excited to leave.

01:36:12.710 --> 01:36:18.470
Class of 2014, I'm not
saying you can do anything.

01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:21.240
As you will discover
tomorrow, you

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.969
can't look good
in a cap and gown.

01:36:23.969 --> 01:36:27.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:36:27.140 --> 01:36:29.310
But at least there's
a good chance

01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:32.000
you didn't peak in college.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:35.840
Congratulations to the class
of 2014 and their families.

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.300
[APPLAUSE]

01:36:47.995 --> 01:36:51.230
Thank you, Jenna, for
a beautiful oration.

01:36:51.230 --> 01:36:56.440
Good afternoon class of
2014, friends, and family.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:00.230
My name is Natalia Duarte, and
I am the senior class committee

01:37:00.230 --> 01:37:02.065
representative for
Leverett House.

01:37:02.065 --> 01:37:03.780
[CHEERS]

01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:04.480
Yay, bunnies!

01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.960
[LAUGHS]

01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:09.010
The person I am now
introducing actually

01:37:09.010 --> 01:37:13.210
once had the task of introducing
me at a Leverett House charity

01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:14.900
date auction.

01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:19.450
When I thought I was going to
be going for the lowest bid

01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:24.120
he turned the tables, riled up
the crowd with southern twang

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:27.740
and innuendos,
and somehow had me

01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:32.420
auctioned as one of the most
expensive prizes of the night.

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:35.440
He made me feel like
the belle of the ball,

01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.470
and now I must do the same.

01:37:38.470 --> 01:37:41.220
Today I have the
distinct privilege

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:46.000
of introducing someone who
is not only a fellow Leverett

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:47.370
House resident.

01:37:47.370 --> 01:37:51.530
He's a very dear friend to
me, and has been over my time

01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:53.270
at Harvard.

01:37:53.270 --> 01:37:57.480
Zack Guzman is one of
those rare individuals

01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.690
who always somehow
manages to make your day,

01:38:01.690 --> 01:38:04.970
and with whom there is
never a dull moment.

01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:08.020
Originally from Virginia,
Zack has anchored

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:11.840
Harvard sketch comedy
show On Harvard Time

01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:17.620
and broadcasted sports for WHRB,
Harvard Student radio station,

01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.210
including a recent stint
in Spokane, Washington,

01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:24.710
covering Harvard's
March Madness victory.

01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:26.740
This experience
got him a full five

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:29.990
seconds of fame on television.

01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:34.010
Zack would like to thank his
roommates, Andrew Walsh, Joe

01:38:34.010 --> 01:38:39.610
Lair, Matt Lowe, and James Sun
for always being there for him.

01:38:39.610 --> 01:38:42.770
And even though this
isn't a date auction,

01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:45.600
Zack would like to remind
the ladies of the crowd

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.320
that love knows no age.

01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:51.130
Getting a little
desperate, aren't we?

01:38:51.130 --> 01:38:54.170
Ladies and gentlemen,
without further ado,

01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:59.100
I present to you Zack Guzman,
your 2014 Male Ivy Orator.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.485
[APPLAUSE]

01:39:08.499 --> 01:39:09.290
Thank you, Natalia.

01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:16.110
Hello fellow classmates,
family, and encroached

01:39:16.110 --> 01:39:17.480
upon squirrels of the yard.

01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:25.010
My name is Zack Guzman,
and I am in love.

01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:27.530
I have been in an
ongoing relationship

01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:30.500
for quite some time,
and perhaps some of you

01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:33.340
out in the audience, or
dare I say sitting up here

01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:39.610
with me on stage, might think
that this is a foolish notion.

01:39:39.610 --> 01:39:42.000
But I am not alone.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.640
I wouldn't be surprised if every
one of us in the class of 2014

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:48.900
said the same thing.

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:52.220
You see, our love
affair started even

01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:55.240
before we met the
love of our lives.

01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.020
In high school we
were desperately

01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:59.090
searching for a
significant other,

01:39:59.090 --> 01:40:00.810
and we set our eyes
on the most sought

01:40:00.810 --> 01:40:06.710
after, desirable piece of
assuredness on the market.

01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:09.150
She had everything my
hormone-filled teen self could

01:40:09.150 --> 01:40:10.950
ask for.

01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:14.410
Intellect, financial
stability, and as we

01:40:14.410 --> 01:40:19.120
saw with the whole satanic black
mask thing, a reverse tiger

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:21.480
mom and Drew Faust who
allowed Harvard the freedom

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:23.420
to do whatever she
wanted in the basement.

01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:25.400
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:31.880
But as we learned at
the first chance dance,

01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:33.800
you can't just walk
up and tell someone

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.800
you want to spend the rest
of your life with him or her.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:38.470
No, no.

01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:41.940
As society dictates, the
more appropriate strategy

01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:43.766
is to tell this to their friend.

01:40:43.766 --> 01:40:46.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.210
To instill the appropriate
level of jealousy,

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:52.810
I reached out to Stanford,
Harvard's tanner Californian

01:40:52.810 --> 01:40:53.310
friend.

01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:55.820
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:01.090
But I missed the chitchat of
startups, golf, and something

01:41:01.090 --> 01:41:04.820
about the weather being
an unbearable 64 degrees.

01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:07.350
I decided to cut things off.

01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:10.870
It would be better for her
this way, and in the end,

01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:14.000
we caught Harvard's eye.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.220
The true problem,
though, was how many

01:41:16.220 --> 01:41:19.250
others saw what we
saw in our love.

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:23.250
On our Tinder profile which,
for the parents in the crowd,

01:41:23.250 --> 01:41:26.280
is today's premier and
shadiest iPhone dating app--

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.870
[LAUGHTER]

01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:32.220
--Harvard had 35,023
people swipe her

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:35.635
to the right, which you only do
with the most attractive users.

01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:42.160
To put that in perspective--
because some of you

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:45.230
might not know this--
in my four years here,

01:41:45.230 --> 01:41:49.100
my farmers only profile, which
is described as Tinder for,

01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:54.820
quote, "Good old country folk,"
has been viewed only once

01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:56.754
by a farmer in rural
Mass with the username

01:41:56.754 --> 01:41:58.420
XOXOHarvardSexyFunGuy
[? #FeanDister. ?]

01:42:02.812 --> 01:42:05.277
[LAUGHTER]

01:42:12.690 --> 01:42:15.470
Serious love prospects
only, Dean Pfister.

01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:22.490
But lo and behold, we
were swiped to the right

01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:25.590
too, sparking the
honeymoon phase, where

01:42:25.590 --> 01:42:28.740
nothing at all about the
other person could bother you.

01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:30.970
Not her coldness, not
her crippling fear

01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:33.640
to only refer to herself as a
school in Boston when others

01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:36.540
ask, and not the kinky
demands that everyone pee

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:38.572
on John Harvard's foot
in order to graduate.

01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.750
We found it cute that
security guards wanted

01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:45.990
to check and make sure
we weren't stealing books

01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:48.100
from the library.

01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:51.130
You didn't mind the
fact that Harvard's idea

01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:55.810
of culinary variety meant
variously colored yet strangely

01:42:55.810 --> 01:42:58.980
similarly tasting
sauces on top of freshly

01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:04.172
cut, cage free endangered fish
known simply as [? Sui ?].

01:43:04.172 --> 01:43:07.010
[LAUGHTER]

01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:11.090
And if it wasn't beef
fettuccine Alfredo night--

01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:12.855
which God help us
all if it was--

01:43:12.855 --> 01:43:14.580
[LAUGHTER]

01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:17.400
--you didn't mind Harvard
bought the recycled fiberglass

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.030
version of single
ply toilet paper

01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:22.510
and limited your use
to two roles per week.

01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:25.210
[LAUGHTER]

01:43:25.210 --> 01:43:29.960
Yet after a while, as is the
case with most relationships,

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:32.230
the luster began to wear.

01:43:32.230 --> 01:43:33.720
It didn't take
long to discover we

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:37.270
were captives of
a crazed romantic.

01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:40.260
Suddenly Harvard wanted to
put a label on everything.

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:43.540
What is your concentration?

01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:45.040
The answer to this
question depended

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.890
on each of our prior interests.

01:43:47.890 --> 01:43:52.036
Perhaps you want something
serious so you chose gov.

01:43:52.036 --> 01:43:54.370
[LAUGHTER]

01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:56.750
Maybe you wanted
something casual,

01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:58.610
so you chose
applied mathematics.

01:43:58.610 --> 01:44:01.280
[LAUGHTER]

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:05.370
If you had a crush on governor
Chris Christie or Beyonce,

01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:07.370
you chose economics
because you're

01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:09.440
heard ec had even better curves.

01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.750
[LAUGHTER]

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:15.540
But by junior year,
I started to doubt

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:18.670
why ever fell in love with
Harvard in the first place.

01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:21.600
I no longer found backpack
checking in Lamont Library

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:25.290
cute, and started to play the
game, how many books can I

01:44:25.290 --> 01:44:27.400
steal without the
security guard noticing?

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:30.890
[LAUGHTER]

01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:34.630
Two course backs, a signed
copy of [INAUDIBLE] textbook,

01:44:34.630 --> 01:44:37.050
and an Orangina is
a personal best.

01:44:37.050 --> 01:44:39.320
[LAUGHTER]

01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:41.920
Then word got out we
might have cheated on her

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:45.150
or at least collaborated
with multiple individuals,

01:44:45.150 --> 01:44:48.070
causing Harvard to read
through all of our emails.

01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:51.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:54.440
Yet still with all
of Harvard's quirks,

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:58.840
senior year reminded us
that time is fleeting.

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:01.080
Oh, what you wouldn't
give now to be back

01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:03.900
with Harvard in the stacks
of Widener one last time.

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:09.665
I myself have a memory
of discussing my grade

01:45:09.665 --> 01:45:14.150
with a TF in the stacks, only
to learn I couldn't get it up.

01:45:14.150 --> 01:45:16.002
[LAUGHTER]

01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:23.190
Perhaps you too
have fond memories.

01:45:23.190 --> 01:45:25.580
But this doesn't
need to be goodbye.

01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:28.240
And I don't believe
today is a break up.

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:31.930
In fact, it looks
more like a wedding.

01:45:31.930 --> 01:45:33.740
I mean, our parents are here.

01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:34.950
They've paid quite the dowry.

01:45:34.950 --> 01:45:37.350
[LAUGHTER]

01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:40.055
And Harvard's reverse tiger mom
is still nowhere to be found.

01:45:40.055 --> 01:45:42.534
[LAUGHTER]

01:45:42.534 --> 01:45:44.950
And perhaps it's easy to think
that we're all marrying out

01:45:44.950 --> 01:45:48.910
of our league when we
look at Harvard's exes.

01:45:48.910 --> 01:45:52.320
I mean, just off the top of my
head I could name presidents.

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:56.970
Henry David Thoreau, Bill Gates,
Tommy Lee Jones, and the Artist

01:45:56.970 --> 01:46:02.290
Formerly Known as-- and
still known as-- Yo Yo Ma.

01:46:02.290 --> 01:46:06.010
Yet with all of that in
mind, we must not forget,

01:46:06.010 --> 01:46:08.130
Harvard chose us too.

01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:12.480
She liked us enough to
put a one ring on it.

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:14.180
It's not a one-sided
relationship

01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:16.950
like most of those we
knew in high school.

01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:21.920
Tomorrow we will leave,
but be bonded forever.

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:26.077
My father, who is Mexican, which
really doesn't have anything

01:46:26.077 --> 01:46:27.535
to do with this
part of the story--

01:46:27.535 --> 01:46:29.884
[LAUGHTER]

01:46:33.330 --> 01:46:35.540
I just mention it, because
the last time I did,

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:36.505
Harvard accepted me.

01:46:36.505 --> 01:46:38.254
[LAUGHTER]

01:46:47.218 --> 01:46:49.130
So I'll throw it
out there again.

01:46:49.130 --> 01:46:51.510
[LAUGHTER]

01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:55.610
He once told me, marry
the right person and life,

01:46:55.610 --> 01:46:58.440
no matter how difficult the
challenges you might face,

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.840
will always be fun.

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.660
I have no doubt our challenges
will get more serious than

01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:08.370
our complaints of having to walk
10 minutes to get to bio labs,

01:47:08.370 --> 01:47:11.170
dealing with getting snubbed
from Harvard's student model

01:47:11.170 --> 01:47:14.650
fashion show-- four
years in a row--

01:47:14.650 --> 01:47:18.260
[LAUGHTER]

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.760
--probably because
you're too good looking.

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.337
Or stomaching an
endangered fish.

01:47:25.337 --> 01:47:26.920
Seriously, that last
one's not a joke.

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:27.610
Google it.

01:47:27.610 --> 01:47:31.100
S-W-A-I-- someone's got to
do something about that.

01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:33.240
[LAUGHTER]

01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:37.960
But through it all, Harvard
will be there with us.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.880
And even though we might
be marrying someone

01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.960
roughly 354 years older
than us, Harvard's vitality

01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.820
has never wavered.

01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:50.090
AKA, don't plan on getting
any of the endowment,

01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:51.350
you dirty gold diggers.

01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:55.450
[LAUGHTER]

01:47:55.450 --> 01:47:59.400
To conclude, I'd like to
congratulate the happy couple

01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:01.300
that is all of us
and all that we

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:05.390
have gained in our four
years we've been together.

01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:07.740
Despite what those jealous
of our liberal arts schooling

01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:11.770
might say, truly think of
all the applicable gifts

01:48:11.770 --> 01:48:13.720
we have been given.

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.720
I mean, just for
myself tomorrow,

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:19.700
I graduate with a
Spanish citation,

01:48:19.700 --> 01:48:22.450
which means I can
legally hablas Espanol.

01:48:22.450 --> 01:48:24.329
[LAUGHTER]

01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:31.200
I got a degree in
economics, which

01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:33.760
means according to the
study I just conducted

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.335
with the only other
econ alum up on stage,

01:48:36.335 --> 01:48:37.585
I'm going to be a billionaire.

01:48:37.585 --> 01:48:39.296
[LAUGHTER]

01:48:39.296 --> 01:48:40.260
And a woman.

01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.670
[LAUGHTER]

01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:48.330
Yes, I will be a billionaire.

01:48:48.330 --> 01:48:51.360
Provided, of course,
I download the Lean

01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:55.300
In audio book on my iPod
and immediately delete

01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:59.330
the contradictory message
delivered by Fat Joe's 2004 hip

01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:01.022
hop classic, Lean Back.

01:49:01.022 --> 01:49:03.432
[LAUGHTER]

01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:11.330
How Ms. Sandberg can refute Mr.
Joe's well articulated thesis

01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:15.650
of pulling up your pants,
doing the Rockaway,

01:49:15.650 --> 01:49:18.360
and proceeding to lean
back, lean back, lean back,

01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.710
is not my place to say.

01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:27.110
But I am sure she will
address such in her speech.

01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:31.840
And as if that wasn't
enough, I get a secondary

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.890
in neurobiology,
which means I only

01:49:34.890 --> 01:49:37.225
need to operate on brains
if someone who concentrated

01:49:37.225 --> 01:49:38.695
in neurobiology isn't around.

01:49:38.695 --> 01:49:40.758
[LAUGHTER]

01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:45.700
Your gifts might be these.

01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:48.400
Most likely even
better than these.

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.110
The point is, we've
worked hard to get

01:49:50.110 --> 01:49:54.160
here, even harder
to get here today.

01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:56.060
And I'd wager once we
are thrown into a world

01:49:56.060 --> 01:49:59.360
without great inflation,
probably our hardest tomorrow.

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:00.680
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:03.290
But we are ready.

01:50:03.290 --> 01:50:07.690
With our fair spouse at
our side, we say, I do.

01:50:07.690 --> 01:50:10.492
And before
consummation tomorrow--

01:50:10.492 --> 01:50:12.897
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:15.790 --> 01:50:18.080
--before consummation I'd
like to propose a toast.

01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.915
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:21.915 --> 01:50:23.415
I thought there was
champagne served

01:50:23.415 --> 01:50:24.570
at these things
for all of you too.

01:50:24.570 --> 01:50:25.070
I'm sorry.

01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:27.440
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:30.680
May we live our
lives not comparing

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:34.370
to those that came before
our class or those that

01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:39.660
may come after, but rather
cherish in the comfort knowing

01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:43.080
that we will have this
place that we love forever

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:47.470
in our hearts, for the rest
of our lives, till death do us

01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:48.320
part.

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.643
Cheers and congratulations
class of 2014.

01:50:50.643 --> 01:50:51.629
Thank you, Mom.

01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:52.615
Thank you, Dad.

01:50:52.615 --> 01:50:55.080
[APPLAUSE]

01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:58.038
[MUSIC- TERROR SQUAD, "LEAN
 BACK"]

01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:21.990
Good afternoon, everyone.

01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:25.030
My name is Irene Chen, and
I am a proud representative

01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:26.905
of Cabot House on the
senior class committee.

01:51:26.905 --> 01:51:30.210
[CHEERS]

01:51:30.210 --> 01:51:31.960
Hi, my name is
Ginny Fahs, and I am

01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:34.721
one of your 2014
senior class marshals.

01:51:34.721 --> 01:51:37.180
[CHEERS]

01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:41.110
We are very honored today to
introduce our featured guest

01:51:41.110 --> 01:51:44.740
and our keynote speaker,
Sheryl Sandberg, who

01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:47.420
has made significant
contributions in government,

01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:50.120
business, and technology.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.440
Sheryl graduated
from Harvard in 1991,

01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:56.550
a time when laptops
didn't exist and very

01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:59.510
few students used computers.

01:51:59.510 --> 01:52:01.920
Sheryl used Harvard's
computer system

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:04.410
only once as an
undergraduate, to run

01:52:04.410 --> 01:52:07.260
regressions for
her senior thesis.

01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:12.240
She remembers storing her data
on large, heavy magnetic tapes

01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:16.440
that she had to lug in
big boxes around campus.

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:19.110
She had to stay up all
night spinning tapes

01:52:19.110 --> 01:52:21.200
to input her thesis
data, and when

01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.980
she tried to execute
her final calculations,

01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:27.610
she brought down the
entire computer system.

01:52:27.610 --> 01:52:30.870
So years before Facebook's
founder Mark Zuckerberg

01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:33.600
famously crashed the
harbor computer network,

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:36.500
our speaker beat him to it.

01:52:36.500 --> 01:52:38.850
The data was worth
the crash, and Sheryl

01:52:38.850 --> 01:52:42.980
graduated with a summa cum
laude degree in economics.

01:52:42.980 --> 01:52:44.730
She went on to Harvard
Business School

01:52:44.730 --> 01:52:48.120
where she graduated top
of her class in 1995,

01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:50.000
and later served as
the Chief of Staff

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:53.460
to the United States Secretary
of the Treasury, Larry Summers,

01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:56.620
who had been her thesis adviser.

01:52:56.620 --> 01:53:00.220
In 2001 she joined Google
in its early stages

01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:03.890
as vice president of global
online sales and operations.

01:53:03.890 --> 01:53:07.640
Then in 2008, Mark
Zuckerberg approached her

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:10.640
about joining a growing
company called Facebook.

01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:13.570
Sheryl became Facebook's
Chief Operating Officer

01:53:13.570 --> 01:53:15.490
and just celebrated
her sixth year there.

01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:20.470
During her undergraduate
years, Sheryl

01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:22.700
was an enthusiastic
Harvard booster

01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:25.550
who gave tours with the
Crimson Key society,

01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:28.380
taught aerobics in the
MAC five days a week,

01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:30.910
and served as a big
sister for a program

01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:34.220
through the Phillips
Brooks House Association.

01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:38.940
Today Cheryl is aiming to
be every woman's big sister.

01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:43.050
In 2013 she released
her first book, Lean In,

01:53:43.050 --> 01:53:46.700
which looks at barriers both
internal and external that

01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.740
prevent women from
taking leadership

01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:50.840
roles in the workplace.

01:53:50.840 --> 01:53:54.880
Her book inspired the Lean In
movement, which provides women

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.250
with tools and community
support to help

01:53:57.250 --> 01:53:59.840
them achieve their ambitions.

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.860
In selecting a
keynote speaker, we

01:54:01.860 --> 01:54:04.230
were hoping to find someone
who had demonstrated

01:54:04.230 --> 01:54:06.680
an extraordinary
ability to succeed,

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:09.900
someone who has taken
significant professional risks,

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:13.850
someone who has been an advocate
for a pressing social issue,

01:54:13.850 --> 01:54:16.680
and someone who can
lead us all in aerobics.

01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:19.010
[LAUGHTER]

01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:20.960
Sheryl meets all these criteria.

01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:22.700
Please welcome Sheryl Sandberg.

01:54:22.700 --> 01:54:26.508
[APPLAUSE]

01:54:26.508 --> 01:54:27.008
Thank you.

01:54:27.008 --> 01:54:28.000
Thank you guys.

01:54:31.472 --> 01:54:32.464
Thank you.

01:54:35.450 --> 01:54:37.710
Congratulations everyone.

01:54:37.710 --> 01:54:41.116
You made it.

01:54:41.116 --> 01:54:46.280
[APPLAUSE]

01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.070
And I don't mean to
the end of college.

01:54:48.070 --> 01:54:50.530
I mean to Class Day.

01:54:50.530 --> 01:54:53.610
Because if memory serves,
some of your classmates

01:54:53.610 --> 01:54:56.483
had too many scorpion bowls
at the Kong last night

01:54:56.483 --> 01:54:59.800
and aren't with us today.

01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:02.910
Given the weather, the one
thing Harvard hasn't figured out

01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:05.880
how to control, some of
your other classmates

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:08.290
are someplace warm
with a hot cocoa,

01:55:08.290 --> 01:55:11.060
so you have many reasons
to feel proud of yourselves

01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:14.090
as you sit here today.

01:55:14.090 --> 01:55:16.380
Congratulations to your parents.

01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:19.890
You have spent a lot of
money so your child can

01:55:19.890 --> 01:55:22.570
say she went to a small
school near Boston.

01:55:22.570 --> 01:55:25.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:27.540
And thank you to
the class of 2014

01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:29.940
for inviting me to be
part of your celebration.

01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:31.960
It means a great deal to me.

01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:36.170
And looking at the list of past
speakers was a little daunting.

01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:38.610
I can't be as funny
as Amy Poehler,

01:55:38.610 --> 01:55:40.680
but I'm going to be
funnier than Mother Teresa.

01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:43.155
[LAUGHTER]

01:55:46.630 --> 01:55:50.700
25 years ago, a man named Dave
I did not know at the time

01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:52.790
but who would one day
become my husband,

01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:55.610
was sitting where you
are sitting today.

01:55:55.610 --> 01:56:00.210
23 years ago, I was sitting
where you are sitting today.

01:56:00.210 --> 01:56:02.620
David and I are back this
weekend with our amazing son

01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:05.490
and daughter to
celebrate his reunion.

01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:08.570
And we both share
the same sentiment.

01:56:08.570 --> 01:56:10.650
Harvard has a good
basketball team.

01:56:10.650 --> 01:56:13.750
[LAUGHTER]

01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:17.770
Standing here in the yard brings
memories flooding back for me.

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:21.610
I arrived here from
Miami in the fall of 1987

01:56:21.610 --> 01:56:26.080
with big hopes and
even bigger hair.

01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:29.110
I was assigned to live in one
of Harvard's historic monuments

01:56:29.110 --> 01:56:31.066
to great architecture, Canaday.

01:56:31.066 --> 01:56:35.470
[LAUGHTER]

01:56:35.470 --> 01:56:37.620
My go-to outfit-- and
I'm not making this up--

01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:41.040
was a jean skirt, white
leg warmers and sneakers,

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:43.950
and a Florida sweatshirt,
because my parents who

01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:46.370
were here with me then as
they're here with me now,

01:56:46.370 --> 01:56:48.850
told me everyone would
think it was awesome

01:56:48.850 --> 01:56:50.120
that I was from Florida.

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:52.479
[LAUGHTER]

01:56:52.479 --> 01:56:53.895
At least we didn't
have Instagram.

01:56:56.930 --> 01:57:00.260
For me, Harvard was
a series of firsts.

01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:04.111
My first winter coat-- we
didn't need those in Miami--

01:57:04.111 --> 01:57:07.190
my first 10 page paper--
they didn't assign those

01:57:07.190 --> 01:57:12.350
in my high school-- my first C,
after which my proctor told me

01:57:12.350 --> 01:57:15.570
that she was on the admissions
committee, and I got

01:57:15.570 --> 01:57:18.070
admitted to Harvard
for my personality, not

01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:19.100
my academic potential.

01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:24.840
The first person I ever
met from boarding school--

01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:28.820
I thought that was for
really troubled kids--

01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:30.460
the first person I
ever met who shared

01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:32.780
a name with a whole
building, or so I

01:57:32.780 --> 01:57:34.580
met when the first
classmate I met

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:38.130
was Sarah Wigglesworth,
who bore no relation at all

01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:40.440
to the dorm, which
would've been nice to know

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:43.170
at that very
intimidating moment.

01:57:43.170 --> 01:57:45.630
But then I went
on to meet others.

01:57:45.630 --> 01:57:50.459
Frances Strauss, James Weld,
Jessica Science Center [? B. ?]

01:57:50.459 --> 01:57:52.924
[LAUGHTER]

01:57:56.880 --> 01:58:01.180
My first love, my
first heartbreak,

01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:04.510
the first time I
realized I love to learn,

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:06.410
and the first and
very last time I

01:58:06.410 --> 01:58:08.946
saw anyone read
anything in Latin.

01:58:08.946 --> 01:58:11.790
[LAUGHTER]

01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:14.090
When I sat in your seat
all those years ago,

01:58:14.090 --> 01:58:16.050
I knew exactly
where I was headed.

01:58:16.050 --> 01:58:17.550
I had it all planned out.

01:58:17.550 --> 01:58:20.400
I was going to the World Bank
to work on global poverty,

01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:22.052
then I would go to
law school, then

01:58:22.052 --> 01:58:23.885
I would spend my life
working in a nonprofit

01:58:23.885 --> 01:58:25.820
or in the government.

01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:27.530
At Harvard's
commencement tomorrow,

01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:29.670
as your dean
described, each school

01:58:29.670 --> 01:58:31.890
is going to stand up
and graduate together--

01:58:31.890 --> 01:58:35.210
the college, the law school,
the med school, and so on.

01:58:35.210 --> 01:58:39.630
At my graduation, my class
cheered for the Ph.D. students

01:58:39.630 --> 01:58:42.320
and then booed the
business school.

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:45.960
Business school seemed
like such a sellout.

01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:48.720
18 months later I applied
to business school.

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:50.230
[LAUGHTER]

01:58:50.230 --> 01:58:51.760
It wasn't that was
wrong about what

01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:53.760
I would do decades
after graduating.

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.484
I had it wrong a year
and a half later.

01:58:57.484 --> 01:58:58.900
And even if I could
have predicted

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.920
I would one day work
in the private sector,

01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:03.570
I never could have
predicted Facebook.

01:59:03.570 --> 01:59:06.050
Because there was no internet.

01:59:06.050 --> 01:59:08.070
And Mark Zuckerberg was
in elementary school.

01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:10.790
[LAUGHTER]

01:59:10.790 --> 01:59:12.830
Already wearing his hoodie.

01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:16.330
[LAUGHTER]

01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:20.220
Not locking into a
path too early gave me

01:59:20.220 --> 01:59:23.600
an opportunity to go into a
new and life changing field.

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:26.540
And for those of you think I
owe everything to good luck,

01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:28.730
after Canaday, I got quadded.

01:59:28.730 --> 01:59:29.688
[LAUGHTER AND CHEERS]

01:59:29.688 --> 01:59:30.646
What's up, Adam?

01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:37.830
There is no straight
path from your seat

01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:39.250
today to where you are going.

01:59:39.250 --> 01:59:41.010
Don't try to draw that line.

01:59:41.010 --> 01:59:44.480
You will not just get it wrong,
you'll miss big opportunities.

01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:46.010
And I mean big.

01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:47.490
Like the internet.

01:59:47.490 --> 01:59:50.250
[LAUGHTER]

01:59:50.250 --> 01:59:52.710
Careers are not ladders--
those days are long

01:59:52.710 --> 01:59:54.630
gone-- but jungle gyms.

01:59:54.630 --> 01:59:57.366
Don't just move up and
down, don't just look up.

01:59:57.366 --> 02:00:00.610
Look backwards,
sideways, around corners.

02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:02.580
Your career and
your life will have

02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:05.420
starts and stops
and zigs and zags.

02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:09.360
Don't stress out about the white
space, the path you can't draw,

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:11.387
because therein lies
both the surprises

02:00:11.387 --> 02:00:12.303
and the opportunities.

02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:16.910
As you open yourself
up to possibility,

02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:20.110
the most important thing
I can tell you today

02:00:20.110 --> 02:00:23.620
is to open yourself
up to honesty.

02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:26.360
To telling the
truth to each other,

02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:29.850
to being honest with
yourselves, and to being

02:00:29.850 --> 02:00:33.380
honest about the
world we live in.

02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:35.590
If you watch children
you will immediately

02:00:35.590 --> 02:00:37.820
notice how honest they are.

02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:41.540
My friend Betsy was pregnant and
her son, or their second child.

02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:43.720
Son Sam was five,
he wanted to know

02:00:43.720 --> 02:00:45.760
where the baby was in her body.

02:00:45.760 --> 02:00:49.630
So he asked Mommy, are the
baby's arms in your arms?

02:00:49.630 --> 02:00:51.300
And she said, no, no, Sam.

02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:52.270
Baby's in my tummy.

02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:54.300
Whole baby.

02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:57.610
Mom, are the baby's
legs in your legs?

02:00:57.610 --> 02:00:59.050
No Sam.

02:00:59.050 --> 02:01:01.610
Whole baby's in my tummy.

02:01:01.610 --> 02:01:04.320
Then mommy, what's
growing in your butt?

02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:07.070
[LAUGHTER]

02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:15.960
As adults, we are almost
never this honest,

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:18.060
and that can be a
very good thing.

02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:20.000
When I was pregnant
with our first child

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.490
I asked my husband Dave if
my butt was getting big.

02:01:23.490 --> 02:01:27.460
At first he didn't answer but
I pressed, so he said, yeah.

02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:29.370
A little.

02:01:29.370 --> 02:01:31.600
For years my sister-in-law
said about him

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:34.220
what people will now say about
you for the rest of your life

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:38.300
when you do something dumb:
and that guy went to Harvard.

02:01:38.300 --> 02:01:42.740
[LAUGHTER]

02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:45.220
Hearing the truth at
different times along the way

02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:46.530
would have helped me.

02:01:46.530 --> 02:01:48.390
I would not have
admitted it easily when

02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:50.030
I sat where you sit.

02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:53.450
But when I graduated I was much
more worried about my love life

02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:54.930
than my career.

02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:57.130
I thought I only had a
few years, very limited

02:01:57.130 --> 02:02:02.820
time, to find one of the good
guys before they were all taken

02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:04.510
or I got too old.

02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:06.890
So I moved to D.C.,
I met a good guy,

02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:11.960
and I got married at the
nearly decrepit age of 24.

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:14.590
I married a wonderful
man, but I had no business

02:02:14.590 --> 02:02:15.940
making that kind of commitment.

02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:18.310
I didn't know who I was
or who I wanted to be.

02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:23.880
My marriage fell apart
within a year, something

02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:27.210
that was really embarrassing
and painful at the time.

02:02:27.210 --> 02:02:30.791
And it did not help that so many
friends came up to me and said,

02:02:30.791 --> 02:02:31.540
I never knew that.

02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.081
Never thought that
was going to work.

02:02:33.081 --> 02:02:36.230
Or, I knew you two weren't
right for each other.

02:02:36.230 --> 02:02:39.450
No one had managed to say
anything like that to me

02:02:39.450 --> 02:02:41.580
before I marched
down an aisle when

02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:44.856
it would have been
far more useful.

02:02:44.856 --> 02:02:47.230
And as I lived through those
painful months of separation

02:02:47.230 --> 02:02:50.130
and divorce, boy
did I wish they had.

02:02:50.130 --> 02:02:53.800
And boy, did I wish
I had asked them.

02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:55.790
At the same time in
my professional life,

02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:57.440
someone did speak up.

02:02:57.440 --> 02:02:59.680
My first boss out of
college was Lant Pritchett,

02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:01.520
an economist who
teaches at the Kennedy

02:03:01.520 --> 02:03:03.850
School who's here with us today.

02:03:03.850 --> 02:03:06.210
After I deferred law
school for the second time,

02:03:06.210 --> 02:03:08.040
Lant sat me down
and said, I don't

02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:10.320
think you should go
to law school at all.

02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:12.264
I don't think you want
to go to law school.

02:03:12.264 --> 02:03:13.930
I think you think you
should because you

02:03:13.930 --> 02:03:16.900
told your parents you
would many years ago.

02:03:16.900 --> 02:03:18.740
He noted that he
had never once heard

02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:20.720
me talk about the law
with any interest.

02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:26.300
I know how hard it can be to
be honest with each other.

02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:28.070
Even your closest
friends, even when

02:03:28.070 --> 02:03:30.520
they're about to make
serious mistakes.

02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:32.800
But I bet sitting
here today, you

02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:36.040
know your closest friends'
strengths, weaknesses,

02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:38.360
what cliff they might drive off.

02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:42.360
And I bet for the most
part you've never told them

02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:44.790
and they've never asked.

02:03:44.790 --> 02:03:46.380
Ask them.

02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:49.430
Ask them for the truth,
because it will help you.

02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:51.910
And when they answer
honestly, know

02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:55.560
that that's what makes
them real friends.

02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:57.890
Asking for feedback is
a really important habit

02:03:57.890 --> 02:04:01.370
to get into as you leave
the structure of the school

02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:03.910
calendar and exams
and grades behind.

02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:06.330
On many jobs, if you want
to know how you're doing,

02:04:06.330 --> 02:04:08.270
you're going to have
to ask, and then you're

02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:10.954
going to have to listen
without getting defensive.

02:04:10.954 --> 02:04:11.620
Take it from me.

02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:13.980
Listening to criticism
is never fun,

02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:17.240
but it's the only
way we can improve.

02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:19.330
A few years ago, Mark
Zuckerberg decided

02:04:19.330 --> 02:04:21.360
he wanted to learn Chinese.

02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:23.430
And in order to
practice, he started

02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:25.680
trying to have work meetings
with some of our Facebook

02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:27.990
colleagues who are
native speakers.

02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:30.990
Now you would think his very
limited language skills would

02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:34.200
keep these conversations
from being useful.

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:36.350
One day he asked a
woman who was there

02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:38.990
how it was going, how
did she like Facebook?

02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:42.120
She answered with a long and
pretty complicated sentence.

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:44.880
So he said, you
know, simpler please.

02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:47.470
She spoke again.

02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:49.270
Simpler please.

02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:51.080
This went back and
forth a couple of times,

02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:55.438
so she just blurted out of
frustration, my manager is bad.

02:04:55.438 --> 02:04:58.651
[LAUGHTER]

02:04:58.651 --> 02:05:01.740
That he understood.

02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:05.800
So often the truth is sacrificed
to conflict avoidance,

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:07.790
or by the time we
speak the truth,

02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:11.810
we've used so many caveats and
preambles the message totally

02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:12.930
gets lost.

02:05:12.930 --> 02:05:16.180
So as you ask each other for
the truth and other people,

02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:19.390
can you elicit it in
simple and clear language?

02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:21.505
And when you speak
your truth, can you

02:05:21.505 --> 02:05:23.320
use simple and clear language?

02:05:30.250 --> 02:05:33.180
As hard as it is to be
honest with other people,

02:05:33.180 --> 02:05:36.710
it can be even more difficult
to be honest with ourselves.

02:05:36.710 --> 02:05:40.360
For years after I had children
I would say pretty often,

02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:44.060
I don't feel guilty working
even when no one asked.

02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:46.122
Someone might say, Sheryl,
how's your day today?

02:05:46.122 --> 02:05:47.080
And I would say, great.

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:49.390
I don't feel guilty working.

02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:52.170
Or, do I need a sweater?

02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:54.990
Yes, it's
unpredictably freezing.

02:05:54.990 --> 02:05:57.750
And I don't feel guilty working.

02:05:57.750 --> 02:06:01.640
I was kind of like a
parrot with issues.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:04.430
Then one day on the treadmill
I was reading this article

02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:07.300
in the sociology journal about
how people don't start out

02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:08.570
lying to other people.

02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:10.370
They start out
lying to themselves.

02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:12.640
And the things we
repeat most frequently

02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.590
are often those lies.

02:06:14.590 --> 02:06:17.460
So as sweat was pouring down my
face I started wondering, well,

02:06:17.460 --> 02:06:19.500
what do I repeat
pretty frequently?

02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:23.240
And I realized, I
feel guilty working.

02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:26.730
I then did a lot of research
and I spent an entire year

02:06:26.730 --> 02:06:29.330
with my dear friend Nell
Scovell writing a book,

02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:32.170
talking about how I was
thinking and feeling.

02:06:32.170 --> 02:06:35.510
And I'm so grateful that so
many women around the world

02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:37.670
connected to it.

02:06:37.670 --> 02:06:40.845
My book, of course, was
called Fifty Shades of Grey.

02:06:40.845 --> 02:06:43.960
[LAUGHTER]

02:06:43.960 --> 02:06:46.520
I can see a lot of you
connected to it as well.

02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:50.030
[LAUGHTER]

02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:52.240
We have even more
work to do in being

02:06:52.240 --> 02:06:55.090
honest about the
world we live in.

02:06:55.090 --> 02:06:58.150
We don't always see the hard
truths, and once we see them,

02:06:58.150 --> 02:07:01.340
we don't always have the
courage to speak out.

02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:03.740
When my classmates
and I were in college

02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:07.170
we thought the fight for gender
equality was won, it was over.

02:07:07.170 --> 02:07:10.930
Sure, most of the leaders
in every industry were men,

02:07:10.930 --> 02:07:13.910
but we thought changing that
was just a matter of time.

02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:18.120
Lamont Library right over
there, one generation before us,

02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:20.260
didn't let women
through its doors.

02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:23.510
But by the time we sat in your
seats, everything was equal.

02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:26.500
Harvard and Radcliffe
was fully integrated.

02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:29.265
We didn't need feminism
because we were already equals.

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.870
We were wrong.

02:07:33.870 --> 02:07:35.720
I was wrong.

02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:40.800
The world was not equal then,
and it is not equal now.

02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:43.960
I think nowadays we
don't just hide ourselves

02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:47.640
from the hard truths and shut
our eyes to the inequities,

02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:51.170
but we suffer from the
tyranny of low expectations.

02:07:51.170 --> 02:07:53.630
In the last election cycle
in the United States,

02:07:53.630 --> 02:07:56.170
women won 20% of
the Senate seats.

02:07:56.170 --> 02:07:58.010
And all the headlines
kept screaming out,

02:07:58.010 --> 02:08:01.270
women take over the Senate,
women take over the Senate.

02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:04.230
I felt like screaming back,
wait a minute everyone.

02:08:04.230 --> 02:08:08.140
50% of the population
getting 20% of the seats?

02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:10.100
That's not a takeover.

02:08:10.100 --> 02:08:13.290
That's an embarrassment.

02:08:13.290 --> 02:08:18.350
Just a few months ago this year,
a very well respected and well

02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:20.950
known business executive
in Silicon Valley

02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:25.360
invited me to give a speech
to his club on social media.

02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:27.470
I'd been to this club a
few months before when

02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:30.020
I'd been invited for
a friend's birthday.

02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:31.380
It was a beautiful building.

02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:33.540
And I was wandering
around looking at it,

02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:36.520
looking for the women's room,
when a staff member informed

02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:39.790
me very firmly that the
ladies' room was over there,

02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:41.700
and I should be sure
not to go upstairs

02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:45.390
because women are never
allowed in this building.

02:08:45.390 --> 02:08:47.370
I didn't realize I was
in an all-male club

02:08:47.370 --> 02:08:49.030
until that minute.

02:08:49.030 --> 02:08:50.820
I spent the rest of
the night wondering

02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:53.090
what I was doing there,
wondering what everyone

02:08:53.090 --> 02:08:56.140
else was doing there, wondering
if any of my friends in San

02:08:56.140 --> 02:09:01.000
Francisco would invited me
to a party at a club that

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:05.140
didn't allow blacks or
Jews or Asians or gays.

02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:07.380
Being invited to give a
business speech at this club

02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:09.280
hit me as even more
egregious, because you

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:11.000
couldn't claim that
it was only social.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.700
Business wasn't done there.

02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:15.530
My first thought was, really?

02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:16.450
Really?

02:09:16.450 --> 02:09:18.760
A year after Lean
In, this dude thought

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:22.730
it was a good idea to invite me
to give a speech to his literal

02:09:22.730 --> 02:09:25.700
all boys club.

02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:27.320
And he wasn't alone.

02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.150
There was an entire committee
of well-respected businessmen

02:09:31.150 --> 02:09:35.660
who joined him in issuing
this kind invitation.

02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:38.210
To paraphrase Groucho
Marx-- and don't worry,

02:09:38.210 --> 02:09:41.260
I won't try to do
the voice-- I don't

02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:44.810
want to speak at any club that
won't have me as a member.

02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:47.530
So I said no, and I did
it in a way I probably

02:09:47.530 --> 02:09:49.920
wouldn't have even
five years before.

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:52.260
I wrote a long and
passionate email

02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:55.890
arguing that they should
change their policies.

02:09:55.890 --> 02:09:58.520
They thanked me for
my prompt response

02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:03.800
and wrote that perhaps things
will eventually change.

02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:07.370
Our expectations are too low.

02:10:07.370 --> 02:10:10.385
Eventually needs to
become immediately.

02:10:13.210 --> 02:10:15.610
[APPLAUSE]

02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:24.180
We need to see the truth
and speak the truth.

02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:25.970
We tolerate
discrimination and we

02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:28.240
pretend that
opportunity is equal.

02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:30.830
Yes, we elected an African
American president,

02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:33.430
but racism is pervasive still.

02:10:33.430 --> 02:10:37.430
Yes, there are women who run
Fortune 500 companies-- 5%

02:10:37.430 --> 02:10:40.370
to be precise-- but
our road there is still

02:10:40.370 --> 02:10:43.700
paved with words
like pushy and bossy,

02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:48.040
while our male peers are
leaders and results focused.

02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:51.390
African American women have to
prove that they're not angry.

02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:55.850
Latinas risk being
branded fiery hot heads.

02:10:55.850 --> 02:10:58.490
A group of Asian American
women and men at Facebook

02:10:58.490 --> 02:11:01.950
wore pins one day that said, I
may or may not be good at math.

02:11:05.470 --> 02:11:08.360
Yes, Harvard has
a woman president.

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.160
And in two years
the United States

02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:11.910
may have a woman president.

02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:15.730
[CHEERS]

02:11:15.730 --> 02:11:17.980
But in order to get
there, Hillary Clinton

02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:23.370
is going to have to overcome
two very real obstacles, unknown

02:11:23.370 --> 02:11:29.502
and often ununderstood gender
bias, and even worse, a degree

02:11:29.502 --> 02:11:30.200
from Yale.

02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:34.390
[LAUGHTER]

02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:38.210
You can challenge stereotypes,
both subtle and obvious.

02:11:38.210 --> 02:11:41.880
At Facebook we have posters
around the wall to inspire us.

02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:44.560
Done is better than perfect,
fortune favors the bold,

02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:46.760
what would you do if
you weren't afraid?

02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:49.410
My new favorite:
nothing at Facebook

02:11:49.410 --> 02:11:51.780
is someone else's problem.

02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:54.330
I hope you feel that
way about the problems

02:11:54.330 --> 02:11:56.430
you see in the world
because they are not

02:11:56.430 --> 02:11:58.450
someone else's problem.

02:11:58.450 --> 02:12:01.630
Gender inequality harms
men along with women.

02:12:01.630 --> 02:12:04.550
Racism hurts whites
along with minorities.

02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:08.280
And the lack of equal
opportunity keeps all of us

02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:09.980
from fulfilling
our true potential.

02:12:13.210 --> 02:12:17.384
So as you graduate today, I want
to put some pressure on you.

02:12:17.384 --> 02:12:18.800
I want to put some
pressure on you

02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:22.720
to acknowledge the hard
truths, not shy away from them,

02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:25.900
and when you see
them to address them.

02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:28.430
The first time I
spoke out about what

02:12:28.430 --> 02:12:30.730
it was like to be a
woman in the workforce

02:12:30.730 --> 02:12:33.650
was less than five years ago.

02:12:33.650 --> 02:12:36.370
That means that for
18 years from where

02:12:36.370 --> 02:12:39.830
you sit to where I
stand, my silence

02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:44.020
implies that everything was OK.

02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:46.600
You can do better than I did.

02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:50.370
And I mean that so sincerely.

02:12:50.370 --> 02:12:54.660
At the same time I wanted to
take some pressure off you.

02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:56.360
Sitting here today
you don't have

02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:58.010
to know what career
you want or how

02:12:58.010 --> 02:13:00.190
to get the career
you might want.

02:13:00.190 --> 02:13:02.680
Leaning in does not
mean your path will

02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:04.900
be straight or smooth,
and most people

02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:08.110
who make great contributions
start way later

02:13:08.110 --> 02:13:09.910
than Mark Zuckerberg.

02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:13.210
Find a jungle gym you want to
play on and start climbing.

02:13:13.210 --> 02:13:16.870
Not only will you figure out
what you want to do eventually,

02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:20.350
but once you do,
you will crush it.

02:13:20.350 --> 02:13:24.750
Looking at you all here
today I am filled with hope.

02:13:24.750 --> 02:13:29.890
All of you were admitted to
a small school near Boston,

02:13:29.890 --> 02:13:32.870
either for your academic
potential, your personality,

02:13:32.870 --> 02:13:35.410
or both.

02:13:35.410 --> 02:13:37.680
You've had your
firsts, whether it's

02:13:37.680 --> 02:13:41.860
a winter coat, a love, or
a C. You've learned more

02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:44.940
about who you are and
who you want to be.

02:13:44.940 --> 02:13:48.040
And most importantly,
you've experienced

02:13:48.040 --> 02:13:50.100
the power of community.

02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:54.130
You know that while you are
extraordinary on your own,

02:13:54.130 --> 02:13:59.670
we are all stronger and
can be louder together.

02:13:59.670 --> 02:14:04.110
I know that you will
never forget Harvard,

02:14:04.110 --> 02:14:06.840
and Harvard will
never forget you.

02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:09.290
Especially during the
next fundraising drive.

02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:12.930
[LAUGHTER]

02:14:12.930 --> 02:14:17.250
Tomorrow you all become part
of a lifelong community which

02:14:17.250 --> 02:14:21.110
offers truly great opportunity,
and therefore comes

02:14:21.110 --> 02:14:23.640
with real obligation.

02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:26.970
You can make the world
fairer for everyone.

02:14:26.970 --> 02:14:30.900
Expect honesty from
yourself and each other.

02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:37.200
Demand and create truly equal
opportunity, not eventually,

02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:39.450
but now.

02:14:39.450 --> 02:14:41.640
And tomorrow, by
the way, you get

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:45.590
something Mark Zuckerberg does
not have: a Harvard degree.

02:14:45.590 --> 02:14:46.770
Congratulations everyone.

02:14:46.770 --> 02:14:49.235
[APPLAUSE]

02:15:05.879 --> 02:15:06.920
Thank you so much Sheryl.

02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:08.560
That was wonderful.

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:10.270
Hello everyone.

02:15:10.270 --> 02:15:12.390
My name is Alicia Johnson,
and I have the pleasure

02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:14.681
of serving as the house
representative of Quincy House.

02:15:14.681 --> 02:15:17.600
[CHEERS]

02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:20.205
My name is Sharon Carlson and
I am the house representative

02:15:20.205 --> 02:15:21.420
for Elliot.

02:15:21.420 --> 02:15:23.270
[CHEERS]

02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:27.090
Together we have the honor
of introducing the class ode.

02:15:27.090 --> 02:15:29.690
Each year, members of the
class have the opportunity

02:15:29.690 --> 02:15:32.307
to write two verses in
the tune of Fair Harvard

02:15:32.307 --> 02:15:34.682
and compete for the chance to
present their opus on Class

02:15:34.682 --> 02:15:35.890
Day.

02:15:35.890 --> 02:15:40.550
While there are more than
1,600 different class

02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:43.290
of 2014 experiences,
the class ode

02:15:43.290 --> 02:15:45.520
strives to find
our common strands

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:48.250
and create a piece of work
that we can all relate to.

02:15:48.250 --> 02:15:51.540
From late nights at Lamont to
even later nights at the Quincy

02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:54.440
Grill, we have been through
a lot during our time here,

02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.680
and the class ode creates
an opportunity for us

02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:59.830
to celebrate our class and
experienced through song,

02:15:59.830 --> 02:16:02.420
allowing the class
of 2014 to live on,

02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:06.360
long outlasting our short
time within these ivy walls.

02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:08.150
Two verses maybe
not seem like a lot

02:16:08.150 --> 02:16:10.330
to express everything we
have felt during our time

02:16:10.330 --> 02:16:14.000
here, like the refreshing
and liberating feeling

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.620
of the frigid
Cambridge air caressing

02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:20.710
our skin during your first
primal scream and the pain

02:16:20.710 --> 02:16:24.410
in your knees after getting
caught in your first pile up.

02:16:24.410 --> 02:16:27.830
The embarrassment you fell
after walking into Lowell House

02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:32.250
and naively asking, where
is the lecture hall?

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:35.510
Or the moment you turned in
your thesis simultaneously

02:16:35.510 --> 02:16:38.020
turning [INAUDIBLE].

02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:39.770
But this year's writers
of the class ode

02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:42.510
have done a remarkable
job at representing

02:16:42.510 --> 02:16:46.830
a piece of our college
lives in 124 words.

02:16:46.830 --> 02:16:48.969
We would like to introduce
the writers hailing

02:16:48.969 --> 02:16:50.969
from the Harvard
University band.

02:16:50.969 --> 02:16:53.469
[CHEERS]

02:16:56.859 --> 02:16:59.150
Thank you.

02:16:59.150 --> 02:17:05.690
Allyson Freedy, Sebastian Gomez,
Radhika Jain, Stephen Kent,

02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:09.170
James Looney, and
Georgia Abrantes Shelton

02:17:09.170 --> 02:17:11.739
to present the 2014 class ode.

02:17:11.739 --> 02:17:13.619
[APPLAUSE]

02:17:13.619 --> 02:17:17.540
Please rise now and join us in
performing the class ode sung

02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:19.830
to the tune of Fair Harvard.

02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:22.189
Lyrics can be found
printed in your program.

02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:38.846
[MUSIC]

02:17:45.262 --> 02:17:45.762
[SINGING]

02:17:45.762 --> 02:17:53.790
Come classmates and loved
ones, rejoice on this day.

02:17:53.790 --> 02:17:58.386
Take a breath now that
four years have passed.

02:18:01.150 --> 02:18:08.699
From bright crimson lanyards
to tassels and gowns

02:18:08.699 --> 02:18:13.345
to the futures with
which we've been tasked.

02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:23.730
First housing day nerves,
then storming the yard,

02:18:23.730 --> 02:18:28.014
taming Yale yet again and again.

02:18:30.549 --> 02:18:37.895
All nighters, plans changing,
fears hidden and shared,

02:18:37.895 --> 02:18:45.760
till we stood not
alone but as friends.

02:18:45.760 --> 02:18:53.216
Resolutely we plunged
into erudite toil,

02:18:53.216 --> 02:18:59.870
treasured instincts
of home we soon found.

02:18:59.870 --> 02:19:07.678
Then deadlines they seemed
not to matter at all,

02:19:07.678 --> 02:19:14.510
as we echoed the
strength of this town.

02:19:14.510 --> 02:19:22.420
Fair Harvard so dear,
we cherish with pride.

02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:29.709
Every offset and
triumph we've lived.

02:19:29.709 --> 02:19:36.350
Of science and art and
of courage we learned.

02:19:38.910 --> 02:19:47.366
Now we part to
create and to give.

02:19:47.366 --> 02:19:50.342
[APPLAUSE]

02:20:06.730 --> 02:20:09.590
Thank you very much for
writing our class ode.

02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:11.274
I am thankful to the
Harvard Glee Club

02:20:11.274 --> 02:20:12.690
because I actually
know that tune.

02:20:12.690 --> 02:20:13.980
[LAUGHTER]

02:20:13.980 --> 02:20:14.840
Hey!

02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:15.820
Hey!

02:20:15.820 --> 02:20:19.930
[LAUGHTER]

02:20:19.930 --> 02:20:23.080
Good afternoon, class
of 2014, faculty,

02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:26.076
administrators,
family and friends.

02:20:26.076 --> 02:20:27.450
My name is
Christopher Cleveland,

02:20:27.450 --> 02:20:31.013
and I am proud to serve as
your 2014 second marshal.

02:20:31.013 --> 02:20:33.380
[CHEERS]

02:20:33.380 --> 02:20:37.830
Despite the weather, today
has truly been amazing.

02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:39.460
I want to thank
each of our speakers

02:20:39.460 --> 02:20:42.560
today for sharing
their experiences.

02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:44.920
As I look upon the
yard, I can tell

02:20:44.920 --> 02:20:48.590
that Harvard has touched
each of us in a unique way.

02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:51.830
The inspiration of
convocation, the enormity

02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:56.400
of Harvard's 375th birthday,
the solidarity after the Boston

02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:00.460
Marathon bombing, and the
revelry of Senior Week

02:21:00.460 --> 02:21:03.350
have become the tears and
laughter of remembrance

02:21:03.350 --> 02:21:06.020
as we reflect on
what it has meant

02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:11.370
and means to be a part
of the class of 2014.

02:21:11.370 --> 02:21:14.250
I have come to see the
journey of a Harvard education

02:21:14.250 --> 02:21:18.050
as a transition from feeling
welcome in this place to that

02:21:18.050 --> 02:21:20.640
of belonging in this place.

02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:23.952
And there's a key
difference between the two.

02:21:23.952 --> 02:21:25.790
The realization
of this difference

02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:30.050
came to me as I sat with my
house master, Rakesh Khurana,

02:21:30.050 --> 02:21:34.910
and other students at
a recent breakfast.

02:21:34.910 --> 02:21:37.420
Rakesh looked at
each of us asked

02:21:37.420 --> 02:21:39.660
what sentiments
the word belonging

02:21:39.660 --> 02:21:42.540
raised within each of us.

02:21:42.540 --> 02:21:44.375
We settled on the
feeling of ownership.

02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:50.370
At Harvard, we are not guests.

02:21:50.370 --> 02:21:55.950
We are the owners of this
place, the education, the name,

02:21:55.950 --> 02:21:58.740
and the power.

02:21:58.740 --> 02:22:00.510
Our journey at
Harvard has challenged

02:22:00.510 --> 02:22:03.810
us to think not merely as
visitors to this place,

02:22:03.810 --> 02:22:06.350
but as cultivators
of a university

02:22:06.350 --> 02:22:10.000
that enables the students to
be successful, and encourages

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:13.010
the success to touch the lives
of people around the world.

02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:18.880
The transition
has been exciting.

02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:21.720
Through our courses and
extracurriculars, friends

02:22:21.720 --> 02:22:24.055
and mentors, we
have been stretched

02:22:24.055 --> 02:22:28.390
to understand ourselves
as Harvard students.

02:22:28.390 --> 02:22:31.990
And the transition has
not always been easy.

02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:35.080
As our student speakers
today have shown us,

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:36.960
we can all understand
those times

02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:40.852
during our education at
Harvard when we felt crippled,

02:22:40.852 --> 02:22:46.700
when we're sure we've peaked,
when we've experienced love,

02:22:46.700 --> 02:22:50.580
and when we're certain
we have failed.

02:22:50.580 --> 02:22:55.350
And yet, despite the
challenges of this transition,

02:22:55.350 --> 02:23:00.010
we can probably claim
today on Class Day,

02:23:00.010 --> 02:23:05.450
that each and every member
of 2014 belongs at Harvard,

02:23:05.450 --> 02:23:11.240
owns Harvard, and is Harvard.

02:23:11.240 --> 02:23:13.440
As we look toward the
festivities of commencement

02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:16.110
tomorrow, we are
encouraged to carry

02:23:16.110 --> 02:23:19.300
our sense of belonging
to the class of 2014

02:23:19.300 --> 02:23:23.430
and to Harvard College
onward into the beginning

02:23:23.430 --> 02:23:28.080
and throughout our alumni lives.

02:23:28.080 --> 02:23:31.590
Harvard class of 2014, you
have accomplished something

02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:35.110
magnificent by graduating
from the college.

02:23:35.110 --> 02:23:37.000
I look forward to
seeing you all tomorrow

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.780
as we are given our degrees,
and in the coming years

02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:45.570
as we use our degrees to do
amazing things for this world.

02:23:45.570 --> 02:23:48.950
Thank you, and congratulations.

02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:52.000
[APPLAUSE]
