00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.530
- My name is Michael Novak.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.280
I'm 34 years old and I'm a dancer

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.740
with the Paul Taylor Dance
Company in New York City.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.010
I have what I call the recipe,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.600
which is something that I've built

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.530
over a number of years of dancing.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.330
The first is a cross training program.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.793
And that can involve weightlifting,

00:00:18.793 --> 00:00:23.620
Gyrotonics, yoga, some
kind of aerobic activity

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.380
like swimming in the pool, cardio.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.560
Second part is getting
ready for the rehearsals.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.440
And that can range from
taking daily technique classes

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.730
which can be ballet or modern,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.528
going over all the
dances that I have to do

00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:42.010
in a given day,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.690
which can range from one
dance to six or seven dances.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.420
The third one is performances.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.010
So performance day is a bit different

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.790
because we have what's
called a tech rehearsal

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.030
where we basically run the
entire show before the show.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.580
So I tend to not do weight training

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.860
or any kind of intense
physical preparation

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.460
before a show because it's about the show.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.040
I try to save as much
energy for the performance.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.630
The fourth thing is recovery time.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.780
And this is something that
I've been implementing

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.790
as I get older and as my body
you know starts to change.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.550
That recovery time becomes more crucial.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.760
So I started dancing around age 10,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.230
and around the age of 13 or 14,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.290
I started to develop a severe stutter.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.990
And for about a year and a half,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.290
I was intense speech therapy to regain

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.700
my ability to speak.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.160
Because I couldn't talk,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.370
dance became a way for me to communicate

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.950
and to get out all the frustrations

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.490
and all the feelings that I had inside

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.560
that I couldn't get out.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.480
And around the age of 18,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.590
you know when you're in high school

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.720
and you're trying to decide
what you wanna do next,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.430
I thought I wanna go to college

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760
and I wanna get a degree in dance.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.260
I was accepted to the University
of the Arts in Philadelphia

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.170
on a full ride scholarship.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.180
I started to develop shin splints

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.170
pretty close to when I
started taking ballet classes

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.460
because of improper technique.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.343
And I, as a dancer,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.410
just pushed through the pain
and was like I'm gonna be fine,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.500
I'm gonna persevere and
overcome all obstacles

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.250
and it will be great.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.560
The shin splints kept getting worse

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.660
and I ended up developing
stress fractures in both shins.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.330
The combination of the stress fractures

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.760
and being on my feet you
know 80 hours a week,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.860
and not really making a
lot of money at the time

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.260
was really hard on me emotionally.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.230
And to the point that I burned out.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.850
I quit.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:42.683
I was done.

00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:44.010
I was gonna go back to school.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.180
But while I was at Columbia,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.150
I started to get this itch to dance again.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.670
I studied a lot of dance
history, dance theory,

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.580
dance criticism, and I was reminded

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.870
of how much I loved the dance field

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.130
and the industry and
especially its history.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.510
And I think that passion,

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.468
the understanding for the history of dance

00:03:03.468 --> 00:03:05.930
really kind of rekindled the flame

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.741
to actually have a dance career.

00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:10.380
And towards the end of my college career,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.310
I decided you know what,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.128
I'm gonna give it one more shot.

00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:16.163
I'm gonna see if I can
actually make this happen.
