00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:03.253
[music playing]

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:08.550
1952 was one of
the biggest years

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.219
of UFO sightings in US history.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.889
The culmination of that year
was incredible sightings

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.686
over the weekend of
July 19, 20, and 26, 27.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:21.104
REPORTER (ON TV):
Washington International

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.856
was picking up UFO returns.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:26.234
People were reporting sightings
of strange lights in the sky.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.778
You've got these reports
of these objects flying

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:30.488
over the nation's capital.

00:00:30.488 --> 00:00:33.116
A week later, this situation
essentially repeats itself.

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.201
REPORTER (ON TV): The press,
having gone through this thing

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.870
the week before,
were better prepared.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.788
And they were down at the
Washington International

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.915
Airport asking what these
things were that were

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.500
being picked up by radar.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.753
We were getting into the
target returns on the ground.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.171
About 2:00 or 3:00
in the morning,

00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:48.173
we were still getting
these returns.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.341
Andrews Air Force
Base scrambles

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:55.221
two F-94 jet interceptors to
investigate what was going on.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.723
REPORTER (ON TV): This
time, one of the pilots

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.058
reported that he did
see a group of lights.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.560
And he flew towards them.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.645
And they appeared to
be all around him.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.023
Then they moved off,
according to the ground

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:08.026
radar and his report.

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:09.778
Harry Truman made
some phone calls

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:12.197
to try to get some information
on what was going on.

00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:14.032
Government people coming
out of their offices

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.284
saw these objects.

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.953
And you couldn't tell them
that it hadn't happened.

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.748
The Air Force really
had to say something.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:24.292
So they held the
largest press conference

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.127
since the end of the
Second World War,

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:29.297
run by the head of Air Force
Intelligence, General Samford.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:33.009
I am here to discuss the
so-called flying saucers.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.887
General Samford and the
rest of the Air Force brass

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.472
believe that these
lights were caused

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.182
by temperature inversions.

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:40.642
And when that
happens, that can

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:43.061
cause anomalies in the radar.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.938
Radar signals can bounce
and cause all kinds

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.731
of mirages and illusions.

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.274
I can't think
that that explains

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.151
the lights that these
pilots have reported.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:53.363
The senior traffic
controller, Perry Barnes,

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:54.656
said not a chance.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.866
We know through
declassified literature,

00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:00.537
no one was really taking this
weather explanation seriously.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:03.289
Nobody thought that was
true because the Air Force

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.916
had been chasing those objects.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:06.209
The Air Force baked it.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.335
The press served it.

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:08.795
And the public ate it.

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.630
That's really what happened.
