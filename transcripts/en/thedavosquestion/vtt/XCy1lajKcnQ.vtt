00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:14.050
&gt;&gt;Well, one innovation that can, I think help
the world is world

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.550
governance of future.
Because you know where the U.N. and other

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:31.210
organizations propose to
whole countries to prove foods but there is

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.270
not any regulation or any
good management.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:46.800
And we are organizing in Dakar, Senegal, in
May, next March or May, the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.870
world conference on the governance in the
future in the world.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:01.829
About energy, my, my proposal in Copenhagen
was to turn to sort of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.809
energy.
Because you know the world tried all forms

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:19.130
of energy.
The wind, the water, and the [INAUDIBLE] petrol

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.270
now energy.
These all form are very big improvement but

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:38.210
we call the proper energy.
And we think that we can create in factory,

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.100
energy factory, that
provide the all of the energy we need for

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:55.500
the 20 next years and the
amount of the capacity is about 100,000 mega

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.950
watts.
We can do it.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:09.150
I would say.
And now France is building a factory for their

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:20.990
energy, and German also.
And as a cost of China to create some energy

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:30.470
to the health of the
[INAUDIBLE] anyway, I am proposing after that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.000
to turn to sort of
energy.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.340
About the environment, about environment,
I think one possible problem

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.390
is the desert.
The desert is advancing to destroy the Savanna

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:59.849
and the forests.
So we have a very big problem what we call

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:07.030
Great Green Wall.
The Great Green Wall a wall of trees 15-meter

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.440
large on 7,000 kilometers
from Dakar to Jabuti.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:28.069
And we have started to build our part in Senegal.
That means we have presently on 500,000 kilometers.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.160
And this project is supported by the whole
international community,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.320
European Union and the other countries.
Until now there is anything very significant

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:48.209
as the contribution to the
construction of this wall that is very important

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:55.970
for all humanity.
Only France has send soldiers with plenty

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:07.560
of trees in the wall, Great
Green Wall.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.580
You talk about financial problem.
I stated that the financial pieces cannot

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:23.340
find the solution in the
countries, but in Africa we called all our

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.800
capacity for [INAUDIBLE] to
invest in the rail production.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:40.620
About Haiti, I would say that I stated that
the highest of the duty to

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.949
return to Africa because they are transplanted,
they are ancestors was

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:54.430
transplanted by force, by slavery system and
Senegal have a particular

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.820
relationship with Haiti.
And many Haitians live in Senegal.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.360
In general, [INAUDIBLE] that an southwesters
come from 16 gal.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:14.000
So I have stated that.
So if I can ask to any country, citizenship

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.880
you should grant them for
that.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.550
I think they have the right.
The other question is how is if the government

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.310
of Haiti and the people
of Haiti think that they want to come back

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.320
to Africa.
We should recognize them for this duty and

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:41.570
help them as they did for
Liberia one century before.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.710
At the beginning, they were a problem between
the natives and the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:54.380
African-Americans who came from the United
States but now there is very

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:02.060
integration though this people and only the
citizens of Liberia.
