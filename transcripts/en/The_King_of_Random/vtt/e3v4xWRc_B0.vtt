00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.700
In today's video,
we've got Alex,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:03.480
the host of the YouTube
channel "The Gripsion"

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.600
showing us how to make
a dry ice powered launcher.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.920
[Music]

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.640
Guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.140
I'm Calli.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.040
And I'm Alex from the YouTube
channel, The Gripsion.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.020
We are going to be teaching
you guys how to make

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.900
an awesome dry ice launcher.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.850
So Alex came up
with this very cool design,

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.604
and he came down from Canada
to show it off for us,

00:00:25.604 --> 00:00:27.862
and to help us teach you
how to build one.

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:29.240
Here basic idea.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.100
We'll glue some ABS
and PVC pipe together.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.350
Then we'll add some dry ice
to build pressure to launch

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.800
gummy bears and [inaudible].

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.050
Okay. So Alex, what are the parts
that we need to make this?

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.860
So we have some ABS pipe here,
a couple of clean-out adapters,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.180
a 3/4 inch ball valve.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.280
So we have this pressure gauge,
and that will tell us

00:00:49.294 --> 00:00:51.450
how much pressure we
are actually building.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.980
We have a 3 inch piece
of 3/4 inch PVC pipe,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.820
and then we have this 12 inch
3/4 inch piece of PVC pipe.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.940
The last piece we need
for this dry ice launcher is

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.880
a pressure relief valve,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.960
and this is going to ensure

00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:06.911
that we don't build
too much pressure.

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:07.416
Very cool.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.880
So it looks like we're going to be
building a chamber and a barrel,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.693
and we're going to have

00:01:11.693 --> 00:01:14.650
our PSI gauge to make sure we've
got a good amount of pressure,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.740
and a safety valve to make sure
that nothing blows up on us.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.396
Yeah.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:19.570
Always a good plan.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.300
So Alex, this is a launcher.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.800
What can it launch?

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.060
All kinds of things.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.440
Pretty much anything
that can fit in this diameter.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.338
So if you had a small banana,

00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.476
you could even just
stuff it in here.

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:31.787
But we like shoot gummies

00:01:31.787 --> 00:01:33.750
and all kinds
of soft things like that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.500
so it doesn't hurt if you
accidentally hit somebody.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.940
So this is a large piece
of ABS piping,

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.700
and you can see

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.851
that Alex has already cut it
down to the length that we need,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.240
which is 12 inches.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.440
The first step in building
this launcher is going to be

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.650
to take the ABS glue,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.300
and start putting some
of these pieces together.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.200
[Music]

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.822
Let me see if it presses in,
if it doesn't,

00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:58.172
you need to start getting ready
with the mallet right away.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.700
That pressed pretty good.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.700
Oh, but now I can't--

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.860
Well, it's glued.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.440
Hit it with the mallet
just in case.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.100
Good point.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.060
Done.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.737
Now, as you can see,
this glue kind of seeping out,

00:02:10.737 --> 00:02:13.337
and we are just going to take
a paper towel and clean

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.300
that right up.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.800
A note if you're trying
to glue ABS together,

00:02:15.804 --> 00:02:17.666
you may have noticed
that I press it together,

00:02:17.666 --> 00:02:19.020
and immediately tried
to twist it,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.340
and I already couldn't.

00:02:20.342 --> 00:02:22.392
That's because this glue
works so quickly,

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.627
it actually functions

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:26.050
by melting part
of the surface of the plastic,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.780
and then as all
the solvents dissipate,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.120
it like welds them together.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.440
So it very
quickly goes together.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440
So you have to be ready
to the pieces together,

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.740
try and twist it if you can,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.643
but just be aware,

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:38.493
you're not going
to be able to move it

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.820
once they've been put together.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.440
They glue almost immediately.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:49.800
[Music]

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.852
Three-- Three sets
of hands may have been a little

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.360
too much for this but...

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.960
No.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.240
Okay.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.320
More hands.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. Oh no!

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.760
Oh no, it's on the table.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.220
Alex, mallet, mallet.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.599
I think that's gonna do it.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.760
I think so too.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.720
This piece is
completely done now.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.800
So now, we are going
to drill a hole in here,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.580
and then put some threads in it.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.060
[Music]

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.100
So the plan here is

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.520
that we are going to be drilling
a hole just slightly

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.400
smaller into the threaded cap
than the pipe itself

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.000
just to make sure
that it fits really snugly.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.246
Alright, so this is probably
going to be pretty tough.

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:31.524
So we might need pop
this back into the vice,

00:03:31.524 --> 00:03:32.436
and use a wrench

00:03:32.436 --> 00:03:35.342
so then we can kind of
really tightly screw this in.

00:03:35.342 --> 00:03:40.460
[Music]

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.640
That's pretty good like that.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.540
So now we are going
to unscrew it.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.215
Now, we're going to use
our transition glue

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.060
to connect this PVC piece
on the ABS piece.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.740
You have to make sure you're
using the right kind of glue,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.060
because if you got
the wrong stuff,

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.160
it's not going to bond.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:01.320
[Music]

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.900
All right.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.820
This is on there really
well, so hopefully,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.139
it makes a nice seal
so no pressure comes out.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.960
All right.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.340
So while we're
drilling and gluing,

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.060
we're also going to be adding
a pressure relief valve,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.810
just to make sure
that everything is

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.280
where we need it to be.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.553
We're also going to drill
a small hole that lets us put

00:04:16.553 --> 00:04:17.586
in our pressure valve,

00:04:17.586 --> 00:04:19.292
so we can see what
the pressure is.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.960
For the pressure valve,
we are using--

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.580
We want a 1/2 inch drill bit.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:39.540
[Music]

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.580
And now, we are going

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.980
to put this pressure
relief valve on it.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.440
If you use tools
on the ABS, power tools,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.480
it warms up a lot and gets
a little bit melty sometimes.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.299
Now, we are going
to make some threads

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.720
and screw this in.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.620
And because this is metal,

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.150
we don't need to make
threads ahead of time,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.920
so we'll just screw
this right in.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.560
[Music]

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.300
Okay, I think we've got
some good attachment there.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.180
So now,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.760
as we're holding this thing,
kind of like that,

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.860
we can see the PSI gauge.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.180
I'm actually gonna go
a little bit more than that

00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:19.536
because it's still
kind of on my arm,

00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:20.650
and the goal is to make it

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.250
that if it does get
too much pressure,

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.050
and dump all the pressure out,
it's not going to hit us.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.120
Now, we are just going
to screw this piece in,

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.540
and then attach the valve.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.140
Yeah.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:31.800
This isn't very tight fit.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:33.520
So we'll fix that.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.579
Now, we are going
to add some Teflon tape

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.852
to the end of this.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.160
It's just going to give

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.560
it a nice strong seal
onto the valve

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.300
so no pressure gets released.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.380
[Music]

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.740
So I think now it's
time to put a valve on,

00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:52.447
and I'm just going
to make sure where it is,

00:05:52.447 --> 00:05:54.100
so that's closed,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.240
and we want to kind of
be holding a launcher like this.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.258
So then right
when we open it,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.800
it's just a nice fast opening.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.778
So I think we'll screw
it on this way,

00:06:03.778 --> 00:06:06.072
and that will be
the perfect angle.

00:06:06.172 --> 00:06:09.750
Now, this is at the perfect spot
where I can look at the gauge,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.580
and open it really fast.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.900
This thing just looks cool.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.620
Yeah.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.940
And now, it's pretty much done.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.400
How about let's hit it
with some spray paint?

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.580
Let's do it.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:32.800
[Music]

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.260
As always with PVC
or ABS piping,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.840
when you're putting on
the first layer of spray paint,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.380
you want to make sure it's
a really light mist, dust coat,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.854
because if you try
and put it on hard,

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.940
it's going to like
beat up and fish eye.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.040
It won't look good.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:56.960
[Music]

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.420
So now that the paint is dry,

00:06:58.432 --> 00:07:00.552
now, we are going
to go test it.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.360
What are we going to shoot?

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.240
Gummies.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.320
Real quick.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.880
Before we run outside
and test this thing out,

00:07:07.892 --> 00:07:10.516
we want to give a shout out to
Alex's channel, The Gripsion.

00:07:10.516 --> 00:07:11.850
Alex, tells about what you do.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.802
So I make all kinds
of cool projects,

00:07:13.802 --> 00:07:15.714
do super cool
science experiments,

00:07:15.714 --> 00:07:17.950
and make awesome
projects all the time,

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.100
just like this one.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.880
[Music]

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.660
All right.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.920
So to make this work,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.640
we're going to add just
a little bit of water,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:28.450
about half a cup,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.940
and then a little bit
of are broken up dry ice,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.080
and it should start
building up pressure.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.700
We'll have to watch

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.600
the pressure gauge to make sure
it's not getting too high.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.240
[Music]

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.980
How much?

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.980
All right, that's
pretty good like that.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.720
Just a couple pieces.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.780
Yes?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.920
Yes.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.560
So the valve is open
at the moment,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.820
so you can see we've just got
vapors pouring out the top.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.800
And then once we
close the valve,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.750
then it will start
building pressure.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.700
So then we can load
some gummies in.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.040
[Music]

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.000
Like a lot of gummy bears.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.384
Okay.

00:08:11.384 --> 00:08:12.769
More Gummy Bears.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.000
It might be getting close
to the valve now.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.100
Now, do you want to test that?

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.640
Sure.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.900
Go for it.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.300
All right.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.280
So only at like 10 to 12 PSI.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.220
So let's see if this works.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.360
3, 2...

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.340
That went--

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.020
It's like a gummy bear shotgun.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:37.560
Yes.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.800
That's awesome.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.702
Hey, you know
what you guys need now?

00:08:45.702 --> 00:08:46.502
What?

00:08:46.502 --> 00:08:47.733
A moving target.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.800
Who's volunteering as tribute?

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.240
I volunteer as tribute.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:59.780
[Music]

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.560
All right.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.340
Let's get some more
Gummy Bears going.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.000
Close the valve.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.780
This is how you get
co-worker aggression out.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.380
All right.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:10.460
Moving target.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.275
Say 1.

00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:14.560
Give me like a 3, 2, 1.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:16.400
3, 2, 1.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.060
You missed.

00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:24.502
They were all around you.

00:09:24.502 --> 00:09:25.302
I win.

00:09:25.302 --> 00:09:30.580
[Music]

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.460
Oh good.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:32.600
Good, make it more dangerous.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.150
Maybe aim up just a little bit,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:35.800
because she's trying
to catch them this time.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.480
3, 2, 1.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.060
Well, I missed, but you got me.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.140
3, 2...

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.520
I think I was close.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.280
[Music]

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.400
There are piece
of grass on that.

00:10:00.402 --> 00:10:02.250
Now that we've shot each other,

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.650
it's only fair
that we let Alex shoot us.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.440
3, 2, 1.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:15.340
[Music]

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.240
I got one.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.560
Nice.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.720
3, 2, 1.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.460
I got one.

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.680
I win.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.640
[Music]

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.960
Nate's really upset

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.576
that I caught
the gummy bear last time,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:35.459
and he didn't.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.620
I don't want to talk about it.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.600
3, 2, 1.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.640
I got one.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.740
Well...

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.100
Didn't uh...

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.440
This peg me in the face.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.660
I'm gonna eat it now.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.960
3, 2, 1.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.680
That went really high.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.640
Dang it, I missed it.

00:10:57.642 --> 00:10:58.700
And over there.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.600
Mostly over there.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.600
I think Alex gets
most dedicated award.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.040
He took off after that.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.150
One hit me right in the glasses.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.780
That's why you were the glasses.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.400
Yeah, it was just
like, yoooo, bang!

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:18.420
