1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,060
So this is where we were
at the end last time.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,780
Trying to decide when a high homo or a
low Lumo is unusual in its energy because

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,830
as the world is things
like to be in low energy,

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,110
we'll talk about that later.
Why that's so,

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,300
but that means that electrons tend to
be in the occupied, the low occupy,

6
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:27,720
the low energy orbitals and
not the high energy orbitals.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,290
So that empty orbitals are almost always
higher than any occupied orbitals.

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,890
So if you want to get good energy match
and therefore mixing and therefore

9
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:45,270
bonding, right, the occupied
orbital that you're interested in,

10
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:50,130
it must be unusually high and the
vacant orbital must be unusually low.

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,910
So the task we have is to recognize what
orbitals should be unusually high and

12
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:02,280
what ones should be unusually low.
And if we can find the unusual ones,

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,320
then we'll know what's reactive.
Be able to identify functional groups.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,280
Okay,
so unusual compared to what?

15
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,610
Compared to normal occupied and vacant
orbitals that is in organic chemistry or

16
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,390
most kinds of chemistry,
actually a carbon, carbon,

17
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,250
carbon hydrogen bonds are occupied
orbitals not unusually high.

18
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:31,251
There are standard of usual and the
anti bonds corresponding anti bonds are

19
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,270
unusual are the usual,
uh, vacant orbitals.

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,510
So what can make things unusually low
are unusually high when the valence Shell

21
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:46,770
orbitals that if they bonded, would go
down and up, don't bond with anything,

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,120
don't mix with anything, then
there'll be unusual. Second,

23
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,050
if the overalls don't overlap,
then they don't go down and go up.

24
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,640
Third,
if you have an unusual atomic orbital,

25
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,610
these are made of carbon
and hydrogen going down.

26
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:06,660
But if you start with something that's
unusual, unusually high, or unusually low,

27
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,010
then the things that come from it will
be unusually high or unusually low.

28
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,150
And finally electrical charge.
So right at the end,

29
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:18,630
last time we were looking
at the first example,

30
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:21,660
unmixed valence,
shell atomic orbitals.

31
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,270
So we saw that the simplest of all acids,

32
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:28,590
h plus of course is unusually,
it would,

33
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,120
if it were occupied, it would be
unusually high for an occupied orbital,

34
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,900
right?
Because it hasn't gone down,

35
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,170
but it's vacant and it's unusually low
for a vacant orbital because it hasn't

36
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,820
gone up and so on with these others.

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,900
And unshared pair on nitrogen
or a little less so on oxygen.

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,660
A vacant orbital on Boron that's not
bonding with anything is an unusually low

39
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,494
Lumo.

40
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,620
Even though orbitals on Boron are not
unusually low because the nuclear charge

41
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:04,220
isn't very big for something
that's using a, uh,

42
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,070
a second and equals to quantum
level orbitals valence orbitals,

43
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,850
it's an unusually low chart
nuclear charge for that.

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,890
So the orbitals are unusually low. Uh,
pardon me, are unusually high in energy,

45
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,230
not being attracted by more protons,

46
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,180
but it's low for a vacant orbital
if it hasn't mixed with anything.

47
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,890
Okay. And finally, notice that
some of these are charged.

48
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:34,810
H plus plus means that's a good
place to put an electron, right?

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,480
So unusually low, oh, pardon me. Oh,

50
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:40,930
H minus unusually high because
of the negative charge.

51
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,150
Ch three minus especially high.

52
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,540
So this slide also shows the fourth
point that electrical charge makes a

53
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:53,800
difference on the how normal
occupied and vacant orbitals are.

54
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,140
Okay?
Uh,

55
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,150
so these unusually low vacant orbitals
are acids like h plus unusually high

56
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,400
occupied orbitals are basis like oh h
minus as we just showed on the previous

57
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,234
slide.

58
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,240
That means that you can mix the high
homo of Ooh minus with the low Lumo of h

59
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:15,370
plus and two electrons,

60
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:20,050
the ones that were on the Oah minus go
down and energy. And that makes a bond.

61
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,920
And our notation for showing that is to
draw a curved Arrow and it gives water.

62
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,610
Now think carefully about
what a curved Arrow means.

63
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:32,500
It's not the same as a straight arrow.

64
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,320
A curved Arrow designates
a shift of electron pairs.

65
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,740
It doesn't show that this
Adam moves from here to here.

66
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,400
It shows that a pair of electrons shifts
and that pair of electrons goes from

67
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:52,861
being on the oxygen to being between
oxygen and hydrogen to form the bond.

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,160
So you start the curved Arrow where the
electron pair is at the beginning and

69
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:04,390
you end the Arrow put its point where
it's going to be in the product, right?

70
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:07,240
So it's not showing that an
atom moves from here to there.

71
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,660
It's showing that the electrons that
were formerly on oxygen are now between

72
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:13,960
oxygen and hydrogen.

73
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,010
The effect of that is of course to
pull the hydrogen to the oxygen,

74
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,560
but that's not what's
being shown by the Arrow.

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,150
What's being showed by the Arrow is how
the electrons are moving and our picture,

76
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,820
okay,
so there's a case.

77
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:32,560
Now here's another base with the same
acid and we'd draw a curved Arrow there

78
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:35,710
and show making an ammonium
ion out of ammonia.

79
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,330
Or we could use the same
base with a different acid,

80
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,720
the low vacant orbital of Bh three and
draw the same curved Arrow and make this

81
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,120
an ion.
Make the bore on oxygen bond.

82
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,930
Or we could start with
completely different ones.
We could start with ammonia,

83
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:56,680
not o h minus,
not Arrhenius is acid.

84
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,850
A radius is based, but ammonia
not Arrhenius acid, h plus,

85
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:05,030
but be h three but it's
exactly the same reaction.

86
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,680
The high homo mixes with the low
Lumo to form a new bond. Okay,

87
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:11,540
so that's what curved arrows show.

88
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,900
And don't confuse it by trying to draw
molecules or atoms moving and showing the

89
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,190
curved air. If you want to show a movie
and draw some other kind of Arrow draw,

90
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:23,930
a dotted arrows are a straight arrow
or a wiggly arrow or something.

91
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,690
But the curved arrows have
a very specific meaning.

92
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,140
Now, the, the second, uh,

93
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,190
reason that things could be unusually
high or low is because they don't have

94
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,570
much overlap. Notice in the first case,
it was just an extreme case of that.

95
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:43,900
There was no overlap at all.
The orbitals were just there.

96
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,020
But even though the orbitals
are mixed with something else,

97
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,400
if the overlap is poor,
they haven't changed very much.

98
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:54,730
They still look very much like
they did originally. Right?

99
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,630
So a good example of not having
very good overlap is decide,

100
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,190
decide, overlap of p
orbitals. The Pie overlap.

101
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:06,940
You remember from looking at those
curves of amount of overlap for different

102
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:11,740
orbitals versus distance. The
Pie overlap isn't very big. So,

103
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,010
even though the,
uh,

104
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,340
the P orbitals start a little
higher on carbon than they do on a,

105
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,060
uh,
uh,

106
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,020
on hydrogen or, or normal bonds of
carbon that have s character in them,

107
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,880
they start a little higher, but
they don't mix very much. Right.

108
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,290
So the,

109
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,410
the Pi or bundle is unusually high and
the Pi Star anti-bonding orbital is

110
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:46,030
unusually low because they didn't
go down or up very much. Okay.

111
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:46,810
Now,

112
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,810
which of those do you think is more
remarkable in its highness or lowness?

113
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,770
Which do you see?
So for this reason,

114
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,040
the carbon carbon double bond could
behave either as an acid or as a base,

115
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,023
right?
Hi.

116
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Occupied orbital makes it a base low
vacant orbital makes an acid and indeed

117
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,930
does have both kinds of reactivity.
But which do you think is more pronounced?

118
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,060
Which would be more familiar?

119
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,950
How high the occupied one is
or how low the vacant one is.

120
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,710
Lucas, what do you say hello?
The Bacon. And why do you say so?

121
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,630
Because electrons have to
move into a position

122
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,090
as close as possible.

123
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,160
Yeah.
But on the other hand,

124
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:40,280
the electrons of the pie want
to move into something else.

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,140
There are lots and lots and
lots of electrons. Oh No.

126
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,510
Well there are lots of, there even more
vacant Oracle's than there are electrons.

127
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,211
Right,

128
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:53,930
because you also have story in
electronics like in a storable private.

129
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,950
Let's just at the
picture. Yeah, Catherine.

130
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,420
I think the
farther away from [inaudible].

131
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,660
Wow. The Homo is further
above the normal bonds.

132
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,340
Then the Lumo is below
the normal anti bonds. Why

133
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,493
can't hear it very well?

134
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,260
Because the P orbitals started a
little off cause they started. Yeah,

135
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,810
a little higher.
Right.

136
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,400
So most reactions that will study or at
least many reactions that will study of

137
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:31,840
the carbon carbon double bond.
It's reactive because of the high homo,

138
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,300
not because of the low lube oil.

139
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,640
Although there are cases where
the low Lumo makes it reactive,

140
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but it's this Pi orbital here that makes
it particularly remarkable because they

141
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:46,900
started a little high.
Okay.

142
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,390
So the high homo makes
it unusually reactive.

143
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,780
Now how bout the C O Double Bond?
Right.

144
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,840
So it starts with the same
p orbital on the carbon,

145
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,260
which has pi overlap.
Therefore not much.

146
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:02,560
Shifting up and down was
a p orbital of oxygen,

147
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,010
which of course is lower than that of
carbon because of the higher nuclear

148
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:09,640
charge.
Which of these will be most unusual?

149
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,860
Somebody got a suggestion.

150
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,670
So what would you think the characteristic
reactivity of a CEO double bond?

151
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,970
Would it be reactive mostly as a high
Hobo that is as a base or mostly as a low

152
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:33,780
Lumo, which is more unusual compared
to what we compare things with

153
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,103
Andrew.

154
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,950
Why this is further away and why is it
further down compared to what we usually

155
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,870
compare?
Why does the

156
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,220
Pies Star C Double Bondo?
Why does,

157
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,930
why is that orbital so very
low? One reason, pardon me,

158
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,070
one reason it's low is because the overlap
isn't very much so it didn't go up so

159
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:03,910
much. Right. That's the same
true that cc double bond,

160
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:06,160
but what's special about
the CEO? Double Bond. Yeah,

161
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,760
because of it.

162
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,540
Bad Energy match,
right.

163
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,000
It didn't go up very much from the carbon

164
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,480
or down very much from the oxygen,

165
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:21,840
but the average is low
that it starts from,

166
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,140
so it's an what's special
here is the, the, the,

167
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:28,950
the Pi is not so unusual,
not so far from here,

168
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,490
but this one Pi star
is very far from here.

169
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,230
So what should make a carbonyl,
uh, especially reactive,

170
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,470
is it's low vacant orbital because of
poor overlap and that it started with an

171
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:47,400
oxygen unusually low
orbital atomic orbital.

172
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,193
Okay.

173
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,950
We saw another example here.
There's three membered.

174
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:58,951
Carbon ring is unusually reactive
for a carbon carbon bond.

175
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,620
That is the electrons in that carbon
carbon bond are not shifted down so much

176
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,190
and the anti bond is not shifted up so
much as a normal carbon carbon bonds.

177
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:12,843
Why?

178
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,330
What's special about the bonds
and the three membered ring,

179
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,900
Kevin?
Oh their bet.

180
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,100
And what does that mean? Yeah, but,

181
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,240
but their bet.
So what

182
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,540
does it overlap as well? So it
doesn't go up and down as much? Right?

183
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,230
So another example of poor overlap.
Okay.

184
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,210
Or You could have an unusual atomic
energy or in the molecular orbital,

185
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,890
for example. How about
a CF single bond? Right?

186
00:12:49,891 --> 00:12:54,870
So the overlap can be perfectly good.
It's a regular old sigma bond straight on,

187
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,220
right?
But the fluorine starts very low.

188
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,140
There's bad energy match.

189
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:06,590
So the Pi Star isn't so very different
from a vacant orbital on carbon,

190
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,360
unusually low as a vacant orbital.
So it should act as an acid.

191
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,640
Things that have high homos should come
up and react with. With that, uh, uh,

192
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,810
sigma star of CF,
it's an unusually low Lumo.

193
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,390
Can you think of what
the flip side of that,

194
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:26,040
how could you have something like this?

195
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:31,041
A carbon bonded to something that for the
same or analogous reason would have an

196
00:13:31,381 --> 00:13:34,170
unusually high occupied orbital.

197
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,200
What would you want the
carbon to bond with?

198
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,970
She an elephant. Lithium. Why?

199
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,853
Lithium

200
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,230
can cause you looked at the PowerPoint.

201
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,600
Why Lithium
is

202
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:10,340
easy for the barons electronically
to be given the right. Why?

203
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,420
Because it would be stable
as a get request. Why?

204
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,220
Because that's restating the same thing,
right?

205
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,420
What's different about lithium?

206
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,860
Why are orbitals on lithium as an atom
unusually high in energy compared to

207
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,030
carbon?
Hydrogen.

208
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,123
Catherine

209
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,760
has, it has a low nuclear charge, right?
It's right at the left end of the table.

210
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,400
Okay,
so it does,

211
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,280
it's orbitals aren't very stable
because it doesn't have very low,

212
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,040
very high nuclear charge.
So it's a high energy and that,

213
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,600
and therefore it has bad energy match.

214
00:14:56,601 --> 00:15:00,290
Or it could have been lithium that I
drew here. I happened to draw Boron,

215
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:04,370
which is for the same reason a
lower nuclear charge than carbon.

216
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,720
Therefore, higher energy is an
atomic orbital when they mix.

217
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:13,580
What's special here is the
occupied orbital sigma,

218
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,330
right? Which is unusually high
because the average started. Hi.

219
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,450
Okay, so we, so boron,

220
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,990
you may remember that in the first slide
we showed boron had a vacant orbital,

221
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,520
right? That p orbital on Boron
is vacant, unusually low.

222
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,040
Therefore what?
Acid or base,

223
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,733
okay,

224
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,430
unusually low vacant orbital,

225
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,040
which does that make it acid? So
Bh three should be an acid, right?

226
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,540
But what I just showed you is what? Shy
on the previous slide. We'll go back.

227
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,120
It has a high, unusually high homo BH
three. So what does that make it shy?

228
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,810
Making a debate.

229
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,120
So is it an acid or a base?

230
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,133
Okay.

231
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,690
Wilson. It's both. And
what does that suggest?

232
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,310
If the same molecule is
both an acid and the base,

233
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,140
what do acids react with?

234
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,060
So what if the same molecules,
an acid and a base,

235
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,090
it's going to react with itself.

236
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,790
Two with the molecules will
react with one another. Okay. At,

237
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,850
that's why you can't do a
crystal structure of Bh three
cause BH three becomes B

238
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:44,560
two h six let's look at how it happens.

239
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,860
So there's the low Lumo that
makes BH three and acid.

240
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,870
What's the High Homo?

241
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,850
What's the high homo of Bh three

242
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,700
in localized terms,

243
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:02,120
I don't mean these big things
that go over the whole molecule.

244
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,760
It's the Bh Bond, right? Which was
poorly matched and energy and so on.

245
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:13,210
So there it's noticed that the BH
bonding electrons are big on hydrogen.

246
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:17,180
Small on Boron. We saw
that last lecture. Okay.

247
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,150
So they should overlap like this.
Right?

248
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:24,320
And the vacant orbital on
B h three should stabilize,

249
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,670
or the vacant orbital on the B should
stabilize these high energy electrons in

250
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:29,600
the Bh bond.

251
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,410
But now you could imagine many different
orientations of the top molecule that

252
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,340
would allow overlap.

253
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,690
Do you know why I chose
this particular orientation?

254
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,010
Which one as the acid in

255
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,090
which one is the base?

256
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,920
The one on the bottom of the
vacant orbital act as an acid.

257
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,720
The one on the top back.
That is a base.

258
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,290
So what other possibility is there

259
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,363
you Andrew,

260
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,200
there also as you can reverse the roles,

261
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,680
Aha, you can have. So that
would make notice. Incidentally,

262
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:18,770
what I forgot to mention here is that
there are three nuclei being held together

263
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:20,850
by that pair of electrons.

264
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:25,851
Now originally the top molecule that
pair of electrons mostly on hydrogen,

265
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:29,940
but partly on Boron,
held the hydrogen and the Boron together.

266
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,700
Now that same pair of
electrons is attracted is,

267
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,760
is helping form a bond with a boron,
the bottom boron.

268
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,290
So in fact,

269
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,320
that's an unusual kind of bond because
it's bonding three nuclei together,

270
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,550
not just to,
it's doing double or perhaps triple duty.

271
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,880
So we need a new symbol to talk about
such bonds and a reasonable one would be a

272
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:01,200
bond that looks like that.
It's a y bond.

273
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,240
We could make it blue.

274
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,173
Okay.

275
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,210
But now we have as you and just said,

276
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:13,950
the vacant orbital on the top and the
high occupied orbital on the bottom and

277
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:15,780
they can do exactly the same thing.

278
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,600
So we have two of these three center,

279
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,260
two electron bonds,
right?

280
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:27,890
Two electrons holding three
atoms together. Right?

281
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,220
Or we can draw it that way.
Right.

282
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,190
And that's the structure of B two h six

283
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,800
two of the pairs of electrons are each
bonding three atoms together instead of

284
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:44,100
two.
Any questions about this?

285
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,100
Yeah,
Alison dotted line.

286
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,730
The dotted just means
it's a little different.

287
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:53,860
You could draw the solid
why if you want to.

288
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,040
There's no really standard
notation for that,

289
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,080
but it's clear what it means.

290
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:03,730
It's just that a pair of electrons is
being shared among three nuclei rather

291
00:20:03,731 --> 00:20:06,310
than two. And their electron
density is correspondingly.

292
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:10,150
If you did a different density Mac map,
if you could do an x ray of this,

293
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,770
you'd expect electron density to build
up in the middle of all three. Yeah.

294
00:20:14,771 --> 00:20:15,604
Claire,

295
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,660
let's me see like stupid,

296
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,520
but we've talked about some base and
although Lumo talks about as an acid is

297
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,960
unoccupied, so it's, I mean
I think about it like this,

298
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,060
it's sort of receiving electronics,
right?

299
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:34,370
But generally basis are supposed to
receive a lecture on this instead of acids

300
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,000
and no, you've got it backwards. Yeah.

301
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,680
Cause I

302
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,050
h plus is an acid,
right?

303
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,960
So it obviously can't
give up electrons there.

304
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,420
Adobe electrons and
acid accepts electrons.

305
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,803
Okay.

306
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,360
Think about it a little bit in the
privacy of your room and you'll see that,

307
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,050
okay,
I can

308
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,220
only happen here because of the geometry.
Yeah. And then to get, to get that,

309
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:12,570
you have to have overlap. So if
you didn't have, if that top,

310
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,470
if the top Bh three were
oriented so that the Bh bond,

311
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:18,660
we're vertical in the Boron
was way up at the top,

312
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:23,430
it wouldn't overlap the other one. So
you have to, you always to get a bond,

313
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,540
you have to have overlap because otherwise
the orbitals don't mix and you just

314
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:30,520
have the original orbitals as we've seen,
this is kind of fun.

315
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:33,780
During carnival it's kind
of been very common. No,

316
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:38,781
it's not very common because there are
not many vacant or low really low energy

317
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:43,890
vacant orbitals running around,
right? Boron is a very special case,

318
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,230
but a lithium can do the same thing,

319
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,860
but lithium doesn't have energies,

320
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,910
orbital energies as low as those of
Boron because it doesn't have as big a

321
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:57,450
nuclear charge. So Boron is particularly
good at getting this kind of thing.

322
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,250
And this answers the puzzle about Lewis
structures that we raised in lecture too,

323
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:10,230
about what, how can be h three
react with Bh three right?

324
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:14,220
That's how it does it by
making three center bonds. Now,

325
00:22:14,221 --> 00:22:18,420
here's the true and false quiz
on the basis of what you know.

326
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:23,421
Is it true that low energy molecular
orbitals result in bonding,

327
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,590
true or false?
I don't think you've trusted me anymore.

328
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,520
We've been saying that when you
get those low orbitals right,

329
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,490
things come together. You've got a
low orbital that results in a bog,

330
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:45,390
lots of overlap.

331
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,930
Can't talk you into it.
Go ahead.

332
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,830
That's false.

333
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,480
What makes a bond is lowered energy.

334
00:22:57,481 --> 00:23:01,530
Orbitals it's when things come together
and the electrons get more stable.

335
00:23:01,531 --> 00:23:02,970
It's not how low they are.

336
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:08,210
It's how much they're lowered
by the coming together
because then pulling apart,

337
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:11,940
they have to go back up again.
So it's not whether they're high or low,

338
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,340
it's whether they get lowered.
Okay.

339
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,390
Now compared to what?
What do they have to get lower compared to

340
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,203
you and Joe?

341
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,840
Kind of like how in your winning
gold did it, showed the antibody,

342
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,900
you can say something in
fewer words than that.

343
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,850
What do you compare to when you say
energy is lowered and that makes a bond?

344
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,860
What's it lowered compared to

345
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,730
Christopher DMC, their standard
states? Uh, the, well, yes,

346
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,550
but it could,
it wouldn't necessarily be between atoms.

347
00:23:55,551 --> 00:24:00,520
It could be between two molecules like
BH three with BH three what it's about.

348
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,340
You're right,

349
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,340
what it's lowered compared to is the
things that was before they came together.

350
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,380
Right now these things before they came
together, one of them had electrons.

351
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:16,550
One didn't. Those might
have been very high. Right?

352
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:19,520
So they came together,
the electrons went substantially down,

353
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,560
but still aren't so very low.

354
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,910
They could have been very low
energy orbitals to begin with,

355
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,420
but not gone down very much.
Okay.

356
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:32,450
Because there was bad
overlap say so these,

357
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,190
even though they're lower than the ones
we talked about first would not be so

358
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:37,761
bonding.

359
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:41,180
It's these that we're bonding because
they came down a lot when the mixing

360
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:44,030
happened.
So it's lowering compared to what?

361
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,490
Compared to the separated components
before you made this bond. Right.

362
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:54,140
So when things come together and that
results in the electrons going way down in

363
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:58,550
energy, that's a strong bond.
Yes. Genuine part of it.

364
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,490
Well, that's what we're going to have to
learn. That's a question of Lore, right?

365
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,760
And it has to be at least enough to
overcome the fact that when they come

366
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:15,140
together, other electrons, other orbitals
are filled orbitals are overlapping,

367
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,520
which is net repulsive.

368
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,080
So it may not be that there's
an absolute criterion, right?

369
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,520
It may be that if there are a lot of
other things opposing the coming together,

370
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,470
filled orbital with filled orbital,

371
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,280
then you have to have on you
really enormous going down.

372
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,660
So you can't make a simple question,
simple answer to that. But we're,

373
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,540
we'll learn as we see examples.
Okay,

374
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,320
so now Homo Lumo mixing for
reactivity and resonance.

375
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:49,280
So reactivity means between molecules.

376
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,400
So far we've been talking mostly about
Adam's coming together and forming a

377
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:58,820
bond. But molecules have high
orbitals and low orbitals.

378
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:01,400
As in the case of Bh
three, the Bh was, uh,

379
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,510
was a molecular orbital or if
not an atomic orbital, right?

380
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,540
So when things come together,
orbitals are orbitals.

381
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:11,750
If you have an unusually high energy and
then an unusually low energy and they

382
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:16,280
overlap and go down, that makes a
bond. So that's between molecules.

383
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:21,281
But it turns out that what resonance is
is Homo Lumo mixing within a molecule.

384
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:30,050
Now you might say the molecules
have certain molecular orbitals.

385
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,330
How can you mix them?
Right?

386
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,280
The idea is that we made our first
analysis on the basis of localized orbital

387
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:40,100
sigma sigma star here,
Sigma Sigma Star here.

388
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,230
Not these big Kolodny things
that go over the whole thing,

389
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,830
but it may be that this sigma sigma star
and this Sigma Sigma Star are near one

390
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:53,901
another and overlap so that when we made
our initial analysis and looked only at

391
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,280
this and only with this,

392
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:01,350
we didn't take into account that this
one might interact with this one and give

393
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:06,240
still lower energy when that
kind of thing is important.

394
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,510
That's when you have to draw
other resonance structures.

395
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,430
And I'll show you an example,

396
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,190
but first I'm going to show you reactivity
and then we'll go on to residence.

397
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,500
Okay, now let's look at the
frontier orbitals four h f

398
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,863
okay,

399
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,960
so it has four valence electron pairs
and five valence atomic orbitals,

400
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:34,380
two s two p, x, Y, Z on Fluor,

401
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,350
on fluorine and the one s on hydrogen.

402
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,140
And and four pairs of electrons.

403
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,500
So they're going to be four occupied
orbitals and these are what the,

404
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,880
this is what the lowest or, but it looks
like what does, what does it look like?

405
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,290
Well,
it's a two s orbital,

406
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,300
the one s being the core on flury
but it's made up of atomic orbitals.

407
00:27:56,581 --> 00:28:00,510
Is it exactly a two s of fluorine?

408
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,220
Does it look like a sphere on fluorine?
Alison, you're shaking hit your head.

409
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,960
And how would they get a little distorted?
What did we mix with the F orbital?

410
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:17,120
A little bit of the one s on hydrogen.
It's mostly the F on flury. Why?

411
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:22,850
Cause the flu rates way down in energy.
So the best the nation is mostly this,

412
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,220
but you can see that it's
a little bit egg shaped,

413
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,490
a little bit drawn out
toward the hydrogen. Okay,

414
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:32,240
so it's mostly a two s of or a fluorine,

415
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,650
but a little bit of one s on hydrogen
right now here's the next one.

416
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,110
What's that mostly?
Can you see

417
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,300
Tyler a site that would say it too.

418
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,550
It looks like the Tupe on Fleury.

419
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:55,330
Does it look exactly like a two P on
Florida or is it just hard for you to see

420
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:56,800
that it's not?
It's very simple.

421
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,020
The blue one might be a bit,

422
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,991
yeah,

423
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:04,290
the blue one is a little bit bigger
because it's got a little bit of the one s

424
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:08,460
of hydrogen lowering the energy
of the two P of fluorine.

425
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,380
Okay.
And now the next two orbitals are these,

426
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,310
what are those?

427
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,680
Okay, Steve, what did you say?

428
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,940
They're the two P Y and two
PC. A fluorine. Do they make,

429
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:27,260
why is their hydrogen in those two?
Why not?

430
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,350
Ah, they're orthogonal.
It's a pie versus a sigma.

431
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:35,210
There's no overlap,
therefore no mixing.

432
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:40,630
So those are the occupied orbitals
and the two p's have the same energy.

433
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,700
Okay.

434
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,110
And then remember they're going to be
five molecular orbitals and now you make

435
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:47,980
the last one,

436
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,540
which is going to have another
node with the leftovers.

437
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,510
What's leftover after we made
the occupied or, but also

438
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,560
what's it mostly leftover?

439
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,470
We used up the two P's of fluorine to
make those homos. Those were pure. Right?

440
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,830
But what was leftover
from from the bottom,

441
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:15,450
we use very little of one s on hydrogen
and there's a little bit of two p

442
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,390
fluorine and two s Florian that
we didn't use in the bottom ones.

443
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,310
So they're back in the top. So what
we have is mostly a one s on hydrogen,

444
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,720
but a little bit of some kind
of sp hybrid on fluorine.

445
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:33,460
Is that clear to everyone? So that's
the, that's the vacant orbital.

446
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,730
Is it unusual energy?
That vacant orbital?

447
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,920
It's, it's low. Is it unusually
low? Okay. Do you have an idea?

448
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,270
What kind of criteria do we
have for whether an orbital
should be unusually low?

449
00:30:52,271 --> 00:30:53,104
What do we look for?

450
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,210
Overlap. Energy match. How
about this case? Good overlap.

451
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,720
White. Good overlap. It's a hybrid.

452
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:11,660
Robert on fluorine pointed right
toward a hydrogen. Good overlap.

453
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,490
How about the energy match,
Kate?

454
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,293
Sure,

455
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,130
sure, sure. It's good or it's bad.

456
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,270
One of them is hydrogen.
What's the other one?

457
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,660
Where's flooring compared to hydrogen?
Why?

458
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,100
Right. Okay. Good. Energy match or
bad energy match? Not very good.

459
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,750
So you don't get much mixing.

460
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:44,220
And you know that already by looking at
the picture because you didn't mix it

461
00:31:44,221 --> 00:31:46,830
very much.
It's almost all one s of hydrogen.

462
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,010
So it's unusually low for a sigma star.

463
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:52,800
It didn't go up very much from hydrogen.

464
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,640
So indeed now it's got an
unusually low vacant orbital.

465
00:31:56,641 --> 00:32:01,380
What does that make it an acid or a base?
It's an acid.

466
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:04,800
Are you surprised that Ahf is an acid?
Why?

467
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,500
What's his name?
Hydrofluoric acid.

468
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,120
And that's what makes it an acid.

469
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
A radius would say it's an acid because
it gives up h plus we say it's an acid

470
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,090
because it's an unusually low
vacant orbital right now here. Uh,

471
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:28,530
so notice that those three are
made up of three atomic orbitals,

472
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,770
the one s of hydrogen,
the two s of fluorine,

473
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,680
and the two p a p two p orbital,
a fluorine,

474
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,990
and they're in different
mixtures in three of these.

475
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:39,090
Usually we've looked at just two things,
right?

476
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,590
There's one Adam atomic
orbital and another one.

477
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,220
And they mix right a pair here.

478
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,100
There are three going in to
give three molecular orbitals,

479
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,370
but still you can see quite easily
why they should be the way they are.

480
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:56,540
Why the bottom ones are almost pure
fluorine and the top one is almost pure

481
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,374
hydrogen.

482
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,340
Uh,

483
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,120
okay. And so that top one
is sigma star, the Lumo,

484
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,610
the unusually low Lumo look us,

485
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,710
be sure that the one is of
like the low nuclear charge.

486
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:16,420
Hydrogen is going to be that much
different from that really highly of their

487
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:17,680
charge to us in Florida.

488
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,380
Yeah.

489
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,340
This you have to learn and I'm going to
show you very soon how we can tell that

490
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:23,174
kind of thing.

491
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:25,940
Yeah.

492
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,680
Okay. There's a different picture that
was made in 1973 of the same thing.

493
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:34,220
These pictures were drawn just a year
or two ago, right? But this, this is,

494
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:37,670
you can see the same thing.
It's drawn at a different contour level.

495
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,550
It was based on a different calculation,

496
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:44,540
but you can see it's the same thing.
And we'll notice that.

497
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:49,570
How many nodes does this thing have
that are clearly visible to nodes?

498
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:54,290
Right? Between the H and f,
that one is anti-bonding.

499
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,020
Right?
When they came together,

500
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,670
they canceled in the middle rather than
reinforcing, there's another node there,

501
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,500
but notice that that didn't have
anything to do with the bonding that was

502
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:09,620
already there in the atomic
orbital you started with,

503
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:12,260
so it didn't have anything
to do with lowering.

504
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,590
It didn't have anything to do with whether
the thing was bonding or anti-bonding.

505
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,030
The pink node had to do with whether
it was bonding that came when they came

506
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:23,540
together. Right. It's an
unfair, it's unfavorable,

507
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,900
so it's better for them to come apart,
but if they come apart,

508
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:30,410
you don't do anything with the blue note.
It's still there. It's part of the Adam.

509
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,780
Okay, so you have to recognize
that there are two kinds of nodes.

510
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,680
There are nodes that were there already,
atomic orbital nodes,

511
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,620
and they're ones that are
associated with the coming together,

512
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,390
and that's what makes something bonding
or anti-bonding this particular case,

513
00:34:47,391 --> 00:34:52,200
it's anti-bonding. Okay,
now let's look instead of h,

514
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,510
let's look at ch three f.
Sam

515
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,540
because you have occupied orbitals and
then you have vacant orbitals and the

516
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:08,960
ones you're interested in are the lowest
of the vacant and the highest to the

517
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:13,070
occupied at this border between
occupied and vacant orbitals.

518
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,640
Okay, so this one has seven
valence pairs of electrons.

519
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:23,000
So you're going to occupy seven
orbitals and here's what they look like.

520
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,860
The seven that are occupied,
what's the very lowest one? Mostly

521
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:33,890
it's the two s of fluorine,
right? And what's the next one?

522
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:40,740
Well, it's ch bonds all
mixed together, right?

523
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,830
But also a little bit of a Pr,
but alon fluorine,

524
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,740
it has the blue sort of toward the front
and a little bit of that red behind as

525
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:51,260
part of the p orbital on flooring.

526
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:56,130
So it's a mixture of the
ch bonds and of the, uh,

527
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:59,670
of the p orbital on fluorine.
And then we have these others,

528
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,590
some of them coming and payers.

529
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,340
And those are the homos
because we have seven occupied.

530
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,990
And let's look at them a
little more closely and
compare them with each one with

531
00:36:09,991 --> 00:36:14,670
the one beneath it. And I'll draw
another picture too for of that.

532
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Older kind for making this comparison
and we're interested in what is it that

533
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:25,311
went together to make these orbitals
and why is one lower in energy and the

534
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:30,540
other higher?
So what do you see on the top orbital?

535
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:35,040
Say this one here at the top left.
What's that made up of?

536
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,160
What is it on the left side?
Sophie,

537
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,590
what would you say the orbital
is on the left side of that.

538
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,063
Okay,

539
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,730
right. This part here
is a two P pi, right?

540
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:52,480
Orbital of fluorine. Now what's this
thing on the right here? The Dash,

541
00:36:52,481 --> 00:36:53,460
the bit down here.

542
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,210
If you just saw that without any of the
rest of it, what would you say that was?

543
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,640
It's more, it's more than a one s
on hydrogen that would be spherical.

544
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,610
It's at a certain contour.
The CH bond.

545
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:17,060
You see that? So this is, this
is electron density in here,

546
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:22,061
bonding between Cnh and these two on the
top are little bits of ch bonds as well

547
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:26,490
mixed together.
So what this orbital is,

548
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:31,491
is a mixture between some
combination of ch bonds on the right

549
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,440
and the p orbital of fluorine on the left.
Now,

550
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:41,470
is it a favorable or an
unfavorable combination of
the fluorine orbital with the

551
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:45,920
Cah orbitals.

552
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:52,240
This one up here is the interaction
between the fluorine orbital and the Cah

553
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:56,510
orbitals bonding or anti-bonding.
Becky, do you have an idea?

554
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:04,380
Are they building up electron density
in between or having a node in between?

555
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,010
There's a node in between,
so that's anti-bonding.

556
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,070
What's the orbital on the bottom?
This one,

557
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,590
that's the same components,
but it's the bonding combination.

558
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,220
So this is the favorable combination
of those and this is their unfavorable

559
00:38:25,321 --> 00:38:26,154
combination.

560
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:30,750
So this lower energy when is favorable
and the upper energy is unfavorable

561
00:38:30,751 --> 00:38:34,290
combination.
How about here and here?

562
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,890
Can you what that is?

563
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,120
What's on the left here that that that
lump of red and this lump of Blue Eric.

564
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,003
Okay.

565
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,910
Here, here in this thing is made. That
is a, it's very complicated. Okay.

566
00:38:52,911 --> 00:38:57,830
Will you agree on that? Okay, but
part of it is part on the left,

567
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,430
there's a red lump in behind
and a blue lump in front.

568
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,520
You can see it maybe more clearly here,

569
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:09,500
red behind and blue in front
surrounding the green fluorine atom.

570
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,620
What is that?
Orbital at atomic orbital.

571
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:15,923
Can't hear it right away.

572
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,370
It's The p orbital on fluorine that's
pointed more or less toward you. Okay,

573
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,500
so this is a PR battle of flury
that's mixing with ch bonds here,

574
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,540
right? In fact, it's the same
thing as this turned on its side.

575
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,383
Okay,

576
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,300
so this is the bonding combination built
up between the fluorine in the CHS.

577
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,740
This is the anti-bonding one with a
node between the fluorine in the CHS.

578
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,990
So here we have a node in this bottom one,

579
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:54,080
but that node came from
the atomic orbitals.

580
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,140
That's what made it a p
orbital here on fluorine,

581
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:02,330
that when you don't get rid of,
if you pull the fluorine away,

582
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,520
that doesn't have anything
to do with the bonding.

583
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,900
That's just an atomic orbital node.
Right on the top.

584
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,040
You again have the same atomic orbital
node because it's the same p orbital

585
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:17,180
that's involved.
But what about the top Sam?

586
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:23,120
There's another node that one,
and that's an anti bonding node,

587
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:24,711
right?

588
00:40:24,711 --> 00:40:29,600
The electrons in that orbital
would get a lower in energy if the,

589
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:32,210
if you broke the bond,
if the fluorine came away.

590
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,860
So the pink nodes are the ones we're
interested in. The anti-bonding nodes,

591
00:40:36,861 --> 00:40:40,880
not the ones that are just part
of the atomic orbital. Okay?

592
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,360
Now, uh, we're getting
to Lucas's question.

593
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,720
So this thing down here is made up of
fluorine and c h the one here is made up

594
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:56,660
of fluorine and Cah,
right?

595
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,900
This is the favorable combination

596
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,820
and this is the unfavorable combination.
So you get it right.

597
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,470
So here are the two of them.

598
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,960
They come together when the f comes
up to the methyl right and you get a

599
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:14,180
favorable one and an unfavorable one,

600
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:20,050
but the fluorine and the Cah is
may not be at the same energy.

601
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,250
How do you know which one's lower?
That's your question.

602
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:32,230
Is the fluorine lower or is the
ch lower or are they about same?

603
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,930
Now,
how are we going to tell

604
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,850
if the fluorine is lower
and they come together?

605
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,380
What does the lower one look like?
Mostly flury.

606
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,360
If the floor higher and they come
together, what does the low one look like?

607
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,760
Mostly Ch, right? So by
looking at how big these are,

608
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,860
we can tell which one is lower.
So when we look here, uh, we,

609
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,910
uh, we, we see that here the,

610
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:07,820
I would say they're pretty
similar left to right.

611
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:12,800
There's not much difference between a
two p orbital on fluorine and ch Sigma

612
00:42:12,801 --> 00:42:16,400
bonds. Not much difference, but
to the extent they're different.

613
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,230
I would say looking at this,

614
00:42:18,231 --> 00:42:22,310
that the ch is a little bigger here and
the fluorine is a little bigger here.

615
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,560
Would you say that?
So,

616
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:29,561
which is lower a ch sigma bond
or the P orbital of fluorine?

617
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,190
Ch sigma bond would be a little
lower than Fleury. Not much though.

618
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:37,760
Pretty similar.
So they're about the same as we say.

619
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,610
But if you have to make a choice,

620
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,080
the ch is a little bit lower in energy,
the flu reads a little higher.

621
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,870
Okay.
Uh,

622
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:51,470
now there's also a vacant orbital
made up with the leftovers here.

623
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:56,030
Some of the leftovers. And what's that?
Let's look at a different picture of it.

624
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:00,020
So this has three nodes that are obvious.

625
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,950
There's one that's near the fluorine atom,

626
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:07,760
a node plane that goes back the
furthest to the left. Everyone see that?

627
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:13,670
Is that a bot anti-bonding node
or is that an atomic orbital node?

628
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:19,100
That's part of the Fleury
at atomic orbitals of some
hybrid on fluorine. Right?

629
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:21,940
And the same is true at the Cah end.

630
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,880
There's a node that's an atomic
orbital node of the carbon, right?

631
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,530
But what's important

632
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:34,280
between those other two is what's between
the fluorine and the carbon and the ch

633
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:39,281
three and that's anti-bonding so that the
Lumo is a sigma star anti bond between

634
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:42,710
C and methyl.

635
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,120
And why is it unusually low?

636
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:51,500
The question is whether the
Lumos should be unusually low.

637
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,880
Why is it unusually low?
Is the overlap bad?

638
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,370
No, the overlap's good. Did hybrids
pointed right toward one another?

639
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,100
But what makes it low in energy?

640
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:12,260
So you know, I'm not giving
you specific problems on this,

641
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:17,360
but look over those things and run your
brain as to those four different things

642
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:21,440
that make orbitals unusually
high or unusually low
because that's what you'll be

643
00:44:21,441 --> 00:44:23,450
doing next week.
When you're doing these wikis,

644
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:27,740
each of you decide some functional group.
Why is it functional?

645
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:32,970
What makes it unusually higher,
unusually low, or maybe neither, right?

646
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:38,690
Why is the c f bond more properly
the CF sigma star or orbital?

647
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,550
The anti-bonding orbital.
Why is it unusually low

648
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:52,190
compared to what?
What do you compare to

649
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:56,060
a ch bond?

650
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:01,190
How come C F is lower for the sigma star?
Alex?

651
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:07,010
Pardon me? Yeah. The fluorine is
really low. Their average is very low,

652
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,360
so the vacant doorbell is unusually
low. It didn't go up much, right?

653
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,980
Where have you seen that before?

654
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,603
H f

655
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:22,780
the previous slide. Ahf was exactly
the same. It's an acid. Remember Kate,

656
00:45:22,781 --> 00:45:23,650
you helped us with that.

657
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:28,651
It's an acid because of the bad energy
match between fluorine and hydrogen.

658
00:45:28,781 --> 00:45:29,680
This is the same thing,

659
00:45:29,681 --> 00:45:34,100
but it's the bad energy match
between fluorine and carbon. Okay,

660
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:39,340
so ch ch threeF is an acid for the
same reason that HF is an acid.

661
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:48,500
All right, there's the
low Lumo of Ahf, right?

662
00:45:48,501 --> 00:45:52,610
It's got that same anti-bonding node shy.

663
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,450
Why is there no,
maybe

664
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:02,870
it just happens that it
worked out that way. Oh,

665
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:07,370
it's let's screw hydrogen is one
s that makes it unusually low,

666
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:11,510
but it doesn't have very
big nuclear charge. Carbon
has a higher nuclear charge,

667
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:16,010
but you're talking two s and two P and
it turns out those just cancel out.

668
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:19,730
If that hadn't been the case,
organic chemist,

669
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,450
like if if Boron happened
to match hydrogen,

670
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,490
then maybe our organic chemistry
would be, but be Boron, hydrogen,

671
00:46:28,491 --> 00:46:32,480
not carb ever be borrow hydrates,
not carbohydrates. Right?

672
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,980
But that's the way things are. So in
this picture, we do sell that. Actually,

673
00:46:36,981 --> 00:46:40,250
there are other reasons it wouldn't be
boron because Boron has these vacant

674
00:46:40,251 --> 00:46:42,650
orbitals and farms B two h six and so on.

675
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:45,560
But it just happens that that
cancellation works that way.

676
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:50,570
You just by looking at this picture,
we can say that, uh, ch three,

677
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,910
there's four mg magic because the rules
around Floreano much smaller than those

678
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:59,450
around, Oh, let's look at
the next slide here. Uh,

679
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,580
is it this one? No, we're
going to get to that.

680
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,190
If you looked at ones that
were very badly mismatched,

681
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,370
then the favorable and unfavorable
combinations would be very dramatic.

682
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,560
And actually you've already
seen that in HF. Okay?

683
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:15,590
Uh, we have one minute
to start this. Okay.

684
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,860
So we're going to look at how c
h three f behaves like h f right?

685
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,980
Both of them are acids.
So first we'll look at HF,

686
00:47:24,981 --> 00:47:28,250
and next time we'll go on to see
h three f. So here's, here's HF.

687
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,020
So you have to bring,
here's a veilleux low vacant orbital.

688
00:47:32,021 --> 00:47:34,570
We've talked about that ad nauseum.
Okay,

689
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,500
now you want to get good
overlap from what direction?

690
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:43,180
We'll another orbital come in order
to get good overlap without the nuclei

691
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:44,470
getting too close together.

692
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,790
Obviously it'll come from are often
the right where this orbital is big,

693
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:52,300
where you can get a lot of overlap
without getting close to the nuclei.

694
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,950
So if you had something with a high energy
pair of electrons that would come and

695
00:47:56,951 --> 00:48:00,730
it would overlap from the right,
something like Ooh, minus,

696
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,590
and you draw curved Arrow
to show those electrons,

697
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,360
the high homo of Ooh,

698
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:10,780
minus being stabilized by
the vacant orbital of HF.

699
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,800
And how would you draw the curved Arrow?
Where would it start? Where would it end

700
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:22,420
to show the electrons have h
minus forming a bond with Oih Bod?

701
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,300
You start from the pair of electrons
that you're talking about and you'd end

702
00:48:30,301 --> 00:48:33,150
between h and o,
right?

703
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,090
But that means this is really important.

704
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:41,510
That means you're putting
electrons putting electron
density into this orbital,

705
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,613
right?

706
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:49,220
What effect does putting electrons
in that orbital have on the HF bond?

707
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,863
Okay.

708
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:54,660
Okay. The curved arrows,
blah, blah. We did that.

709
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:58,223
Sherwin,

710
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,980
it's what? What do you call that? Orbital.

711
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:09,140
What's the name of the orbital that
we're putting electrons into oneness?

712
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,770
It's Sigma Star. It's mostly one s
on hydrogen, but it's Sigma Star.

713
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,880
What does star mean?

714
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,900
What does it mean if you put
electrons in the bond? Double Braids,

715
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:25,560
right? It has that anti-bonding
node, so electrons that go into that,

716
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:28,680
we'll get more stable if the bond breaks.

717
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:32,070
So we're going to draw
another curved Arrow

718
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,833
like that.

719
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:41,740
So we make a new bond between Hno,
but we lose the bond between h and f.

720
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:46,150
So there's our product
that's an acid base reaction,

721
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,690
and it showed HF acting as an acid,

722
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,010
not because it gave h plus h
plus never appears in here.

723
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,200
Right? What happened is you make a
bond and break a bond to the hydrogen.

724
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,360
So it's an acid base reaction and the
same thing will show next time happens

725
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:07,060
with ch three f.
Okay.
