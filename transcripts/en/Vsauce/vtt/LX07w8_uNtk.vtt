Vsauce. Today we're gonna be covering a topic that is very close to my heart.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.710
Clever uses of YouTube's technologies.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, I've always had a lot of fun messing around with stuff like the loading c...

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.770
circle and annotations.
But,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.350
let's take a safari today through
things other YouTubers have done. Other

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.500
creative ways they've come up with using

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.410
what YouTube offers. Now obviously in this
one video we can't cover everything, so

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.070
please,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.590
leave in the comments below other cool
things you found other YouTubers

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.760
doing. We're gonna start things off with Skittles' touch. These videos are pretty new,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.840
but they let you physically get involved,
or at least with your

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.040
finger. I won't ruin the ending to that one,
but I also like the cage cop

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.390
version. Your finger helps fight crime.
By the way, there are links to all of these

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.800
videos for your own enjoyment

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.769
in the description. Back when YouTube
first supported widescreen, freddiew celebrated

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:52.010
by

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.100
interacting with the site itself.
He fought

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.790
and murdered the very letterboxing
surrounding him.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.350
Joe Sabia has built a lot of really awesome clever things.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.150
He's the guy who made the Oscar's 'Spot the
difference' video where you have to have a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.560
eye

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.740
and find the differences and click the
answer to keep moving on

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.340
and on and on.
Joe also made this brilliant slot machine

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.460
where you have to click each wheel at just the right time

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.009
to complete a character.
MysteryGuitarMan was behind this

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.490
super creative interactive piano, where you could
make him play a song,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.969
but I think the first person to explore
this fun idea was kokokaka

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.399
and play the piano.
In videos like these you have to let the whole

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.850
thing load and then you click on the actual piano keys

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.859
and they move you to the time code where that note is played.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.450
I'm also a huge fan of this interactive
bass guitar because you can play the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.909
notes

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.880
by just typing the numbers on your keyboard.
For instance, here I am using

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.780
this sequence to play a little song.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.850
But let's stop playing around and get
narrative. There are a lot of great choose

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.560
your join adventure stories on YouTube,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.860
but one of my favorites is Lego Spider,
where you help get a spider

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.470
off of your friend's head.
The music, by the way, is just incredible.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.920
But if music and dancing is all you want,
go with the mixable dancer.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.200
It's simple, but something about the costume and the dark background makes it

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.400
just crazy enough.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.819
If you prefer magic, be sure to check out
the old classic YouTube magic card trick,

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:26.799
if you haven't already.

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.700
It was made back when YouTube first
implemented annotations.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.340
The famous street fighter stop-motion
game from Patrick Boivin

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.870
was actually the inspiration behind my
Chris Brown punch out game. You have to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.690
give it a try.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.720
All of those idea used a lot of annotations,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.160
but MysteryGuitarMan took it in a
different direction by including

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.670
hidden annotations in his videos that
viewers had to scavenger hunt to find

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.030
to get secret words.
Boone Oakley took it one step

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.829
even further.
They're an ad agency whose actual website

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.920
is a YouTube video. The links on the side here navigate you around and they even

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.139
have arrows hard-wired into the video

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.350
that show you where to drag the play-head to see specific things.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.100
Now it's your turn.
Remember any fun tricks or

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.319
cool ideas that some other YouTuber did
that wasn't covered here? Well,

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.019
let us know in the comments below

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.119
or post those videos to Facebook.com/vsaucegaming.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.220
I'm talking cool contests, nifty ways to get guys involved or just

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.989
other surprising uses of the
technology. I wanna see more of these things,

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.529
so let us now.

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:30.749
And as always,

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.389
thanks for watching.
