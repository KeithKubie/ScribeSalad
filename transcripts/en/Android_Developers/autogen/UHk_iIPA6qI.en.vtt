the game you see does go fullscreen
 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.149
the game you see does go fullscreen
rather nicely you're you know the

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:52.159
rather nicely you're you know the
 

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:53.769
rather nicely you're you know the
pixelization you're saying is is very

00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:53.779
pixelization you're saying is is very
 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.659

quality graphics here but what and I

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620
quality graphics here but what and I
 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.589
quality graphics here but what and I
think that's mostly because the game is

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:08.599
think that's mostly because the game is
 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:10.899
think that's mostly because the game is
loaded up artwork that it's thinking

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:10.909
loaded up artwork that it's thinking
 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:13.059
loaded up artwork that it's thinking
that it's looking at the the density of

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:13.069
that it's looking at the the density of
 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:15.399
that it's looking at the the density of
the screen only and so if you're if

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:15.409
the screen only and so if you're if
 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:16.869
the screen only and so if you're if
you're you know on a tablet like this if

00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:16.879
you're you know on a tablet like this if
 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.249
you're you know on a tablet like this if
you're going to go to full screen and

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:18.259
you're going to go to full screen and
 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:20.589
you're going to go to full screen and
you're going to be using you know mdpi

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599
you're going to be using you know mdpi
 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:24.339
you're going to be using you know mdpi

Android application to navigate because
 

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.639
Android application to navigate because
of that as well you know and of course

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:05.649
of that as well you know and of course
 

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:06.689

Android and use and use acceleration

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480
Android and use and use acceleration
 

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.540
Android and use and use acceleration
hardware acceleration I think that you

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:33.550
hardware acceleration I think that you
 

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:34.380

rendering so a nap so this will now

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:04.210
rendering so a nap so this will now
 

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:06.000
rendering so a nap so this will now
cause a lot of applications to crash but

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.010
cause a lot of applications to crash but
 

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.010
cause a lot of applications to crash but
will cost some of them to actually run

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:08.020
will cost some of them to actually run
 

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.250
will cost some of them to actually run
faster so we'll see what David see all

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:11.260
faster so we'll see what David see all
 

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.500
faster so we'll see what David see all
right does it crash crash not yet well

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:13.510

let's go back into that's into the
 

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.120
let's go back into that's into the
actual game itself but yeah you see that

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:45.130
actual game itself but yeah you see that
 

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.980

how much more how much more smoothly

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:46.990

this is scrolling now like this is an

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:48.910
this is scrolling now like this is an
 

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.970
this is scrolling now like this is an
entirely better experience and all they

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:50.980
entirely better experience and all they
 

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.230
entirely better experience and all they
would have had to do is target the

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240
would have had to do is target the
 

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.620
would have had to do is target the
recent SDK version to get this so yeah I

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:55.630
recent SDK version to get this so yeah I
 

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.060
recent SDK version to get this so yeah I
think they should definitely do this now

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:57.070
think they should definitely do this now
 

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:58.200
think they should definitely do this now
whether or not we're actually gonna run

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.210
whether or not we're actually gonna run
 

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.730
whether or not we're actually gonna run
into a bug somewhere because of it I

00:29:59.730 --> 00:29:59.740
into a bug somewhere because of it I
 

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.020
into a bug somewhere because of it I
don't know the other thing this is fun

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:01.030
don't know the other thing this is fun
 

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.560
don't know the other thing this is fun
is you can actually do do a do a summon

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:04.570
is you can actually do do a do a summon
 

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.960
is you can actually do do a do a summon
and it actually produces this kind of

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:06.970
and it actually produces this kind of
 

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:08.970
and it actually produces this kind of
cool this kind of cool graphic just to

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:08.980
cool this kind of cool graphic just to
 

00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.930
cool this kind of cool graphic just to
show you the fact that they've actually

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:09.940
show you the fact that they've actually
 

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.930
show you the fact that they've actually
integrated you know full motion video

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:12.940
integrated you know full motion video
 

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.640
integrated you know full motion video
into the game in all sorts of places

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:15.650
into the game in all sorts of places
 

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:17.230
into the game in all sorts of places
and so it is kind of fun it adds

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240
and so it is kind of fun it adds
 

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.700
and so it is kind of fun it adds

show is it when you actually have text

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:28.490
show is it when you actually have text
 

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.850
show is it when you actually have text
at full resolution you actually can have

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:30.860
at full resolution you actually can have
 

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:33.490
at full resolution you actually can have
fairly low resolution graphics and still

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:33.500
fairly low resolution graphics and still
 

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.320
fairly low resolution graphics and still

again it is possible even if you're

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:35.300
again it is possible even if you're
 

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.790
again it is possible even if you're
doing something that's basically using a

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:36.800
doing something that's basically using a
 

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.920
doing something that's basically using a
lot of web views um it's really quite

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:38.930
lot of web views um it's really quite
 

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.960
lot of web views um it's really quite
possible to do the back key correctly so

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:40.970
possible to do the back key correctly so
 

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:43.270
possible to do the back key correctly so
props this developer there's still a lot

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:43.280
props this developer there's still a lot
 

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.500
props this developer there's still a lot
of work i think that needs to go through

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:44.510
of work i think that needs to go through
 

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.420
of work i think that needs to go through
to make the UI less cluttered looking

what it you know is one of the things
that's preventing these games from

that's preventing these games from
 

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.440
that's preventing these games from
getting huge huge success everywhere

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:53.450
getting huge huge success everywhere

I've got a couple of interesting options
 

00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:03.210
I've got a couple of interesting options
here I the most i have this kind of

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:03.220
here I the most i have this kind of
 

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.269
here I the most i have this kind of
stupid powerful card here this is a risk

00:35:06.269 --> 00:35:06.279
stupid powerful card here this is a risk
 

00:35:06.279 --> 00:35:08.940
stupid powerful card here this is a risk
to play this because if he's got

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:08.950
to play this because if he's got
 

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:10.019
to play this because if he's got
something that can take it on either

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:10.029
something that can take it on either
 

00:35:10.029 --> 00:35:12.479
something that can take it on either
side yeah I'm not in it it's gonna be

00:35:12.479 --> 00:35:12.489
side yeah I'm not in it it's gonna be
 

00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:14.190
side yeah I'm not in it it's gonna be
hard to take it back so that's that's

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:14.200
hard to take it back so that's that's
 

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.690
hard to take it back so that's that's
the only that's the only issue there

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:15.700
the only that's the only issue there
 

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.019
the only that's the only issue there
that we should just give up at this

00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:19.029
that we should just give up at this
 

00:35:19.029 --> 00:35:20.789

like this but the point of the
audience's game is that each card has a

00:35:39.029 --> 00:35:39.039
audience's game is that each card has a
 

00:35:39.039 --> 00:35:42.269
audience's game is that each card has a
basically a number and that corresponds

00:35:42.269 --> 00:35:42.279
basically a number and that corresponds
 

00:35:42.279 --> 00:35:43.979
basically a number and that corresponds
to the strength so all it really is is

00:35:43.979 --> 00:35:43.989
to the strength so all it really is is
 

00:35:43.989 --> 00:35:46.170
to the strength so all it really is is
making sure that that number is higher

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:46.180
making sure that that number is higher
 

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.640
making sure that that number is higher
than your opponent's number when you

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:47.650
than your opponent's number when you
 

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.460
than your opponent's number when you

green cards that it can take advantage
 

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.620
green cards that it can take advantage
of that yet in the in the ones that I

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:01.630
of that yet in the in the ones that I
 

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.749
of that yet in the in the ones that I
can draw from here and so I've drawn and

00:36:03.749 --> 00:36:03.759
can draw from here and so I've drawn and
 

00:36:03.759 --> 00:36:05.309

five cards and we can go and move these
 

00:36:07.059 --> 00:36:08.670
five cards and we can go and move these
over this is actually a fairly high

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680
over this is actually a fairly high
 

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.380
over this is actually a fairly high
level so the chances of this card not

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:10.390
level so the chances of this card not
 

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:13.289
level so the chances of this card not
being taken are really low oh because

00:36:13.289 --> 00:36:13.299

that one that one in the corner there is
mine forever and actually because they

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:51.880
mine forever and actually because they
 

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.850
mine forever and actually because they
think you're gonna win yeah because they

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:53.860
think you're gonna win yeah because they
 

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.190
think you're gonna win yeah because they
played that it's going to be tricky now

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200
played that it's going to be tricky now
 

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.560
played that it's going to be tricky now
they've locked up they've made it so

00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:58.570
they've locked up they've made it so
 

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:00.150
they've locked up they've made it so
that card is pretty much in vulnerable

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:00.160
that card is pretty much in vulnerable
 

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.360
that card is pretty much in vulnerable
now to their own attack but I don't have

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:03.370
now to their own attack but I don't have
 

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.530
now to their own attack but I don't have
any you probably need to play this input

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:04.540
any you probably need to play this input
 

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.970
any you probably need to play this input
in the corner right because you want to

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:05.980
in the corner right because you want to
 

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:07.500
in the corner right because you want to
yeah the problem right now is I don't

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:07.510
yeah the problem right now is I don't
 

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:09.300
yeah the problem right now is I don't
have anything I can't take that that

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:09.310
have anything I can't take that that
 

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.980
have anything I can't take that that
card that they just played so this is

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:10.990
card that they just played so this is
 

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.170
card that they just played so this is
this is this as a put something here

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:13.180
this is this as a put something here
 

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.850
this is this as a put something here
yeah I mean for right now this is

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:14.860
yeah I mean for right now this is
 

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.750
yeah I mean for right now this is
probably the best thing this allows me

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760
probably the best thing this allows me
 

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.310
probably the best thing this allows me
to protect the card above it so now I've

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:17.320
to protect the card above it so now I've
 

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.140
to protect the card above it so now I've
now I've locked up that card and I've

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:19.150
now I've locked up that card and I've
 

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:21.660
now I've locked up that card and I've
made that one hard to take right and now

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:21.670
made that one hard to take right and now
 

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:23.490
made that one hard to take right and now
you're gonna win but there's you know

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:23.500
you're gonna win but there's you know
 

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.050
you're gonna win but there's you know
it's not it's not it's not a

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:25.060
it's not it's not it's not a
 

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.880
it's not it's not it's not a
particularly decisive victory in terms

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:26.890
particularly decisive victory in terms
 

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:28.350
particularly decisive victory in terms
of in terms of but at least you know

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:28.360
of in terms of but at least you know
 

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.610
of in terms of but at least you know
that's what it is you card but I get a

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:29.620
that's what it is you card but I get a
 

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:30.990
that's what it is you card but I get a
new card then I can actually go and play

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000
new card then I can actually go and play
 

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.760
new card then I can actually go and play
with my deck and I can say all right

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:32.770
with my deck and I can say all right
 

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.110
with my deck and I can say all right
well now I've got this great car that

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:34.120
well now I've got this great car that
 

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.820
well now I've got this great car that
has a nine on it nines are really

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:35.830
has a nine on it nines are really
 

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.200
has a nine on it nines are really
important at this point in the game I

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:37.210
important at this point in the game I
 

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:39.240
important at this point in the game I
can take this one swap that out and then

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:39.250
can take this one swap that out and then
 

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:42.560
can take this one swap that out and then
move here and swap this one back in so

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:42.570
move here and swap this one back in so
 

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.600
move here and swap this one back in so
again it's a really fun game and there's

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:45.610
again it's a really fun game and there's
 

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.100
again it's a really fun game and there's
different challenges so you can go to

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:47.110
different challenges so you can go to
 

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.560
different challenges so you can go to
different areas firewater nature you

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:49.570
different areas firewater nature you
 

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:50.970
different areas firewater nature you
notice most of carts you wan we're

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:50.980
notice most of carts you wan we're
 

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.680
notice most of carts you wan we're
basically shadow element based so if you

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:52.690
basically shadow element based so if you
 

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.210
basically shadow element based so if you
want water in nature then you go and

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:54.220
want water in nature then you go and
 

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.430
want water in nature then you go and
play those levels as well exactly and

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440
play those levels as well exactly and
 

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.720
play those levels as well exactly and
that and again that's part of the reason

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:57.730
that and again that's part of the reason
 

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:58.950
that and again that's part of the reason
it's getting really hard is that I've

00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960
it's getting really hard is that I've
 

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.140
it's getting really hard is that I've
only been playing a shadow so I kind of

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.150
only been playing a shadow so I kind of
 

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:02.880
only been playing a shadow so I kind of
wish you didn't have that back button on

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:02.890
wish you didn't have that back button on
 

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.220
wish you didn't have that back button on
screen I mean if they caused me maybe no

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:05.230
screen I mean if they caused me maybe no
 

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:07.200
screen I mean if they caused me maybe no
yeah there's no reason to actually have

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:07.210
yeah there's no reason to actually have
 

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.310
yeah there's no reason to actually have
the back button on screen now the good

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320
the back button on screen now the good
 

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.020
the back button on screen now the good
news is that they is that it actually

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:10.030
news is that they is that it actually
 

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:12.270
news is that they is that it actually
works anyway but in this particular case

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.280
works anyway but in this particular case
 

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.670
works anyway but in this particular case
it's just adding extra stuff you know it

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680
it's just adding extra stuff you know it
 

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.560
it's just adding extra stuff you know it
does the away from a UI perspective it's

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:16.570
does the away from a UI perspective it's
 

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.120
does the away from a UI perspective it's

mean even though the overall design is
 

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:09.770

simple like we're not talking about

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:09.780

has some 3d in it but it's pretty
limited and so you know you know we're

00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880
limited and so you know you know we're
 

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.640
limited and so you know you know we're
