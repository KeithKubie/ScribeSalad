00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.970
Say stock XYZ is trading at $31.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.720
We have a call option on stock
XYZ with the $35 strike price.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.500
It's trading at $8.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.960
We have a put option on stock
XYZ with a $35 strike price.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.510
They have the same strike price.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.820
Trading at $12.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.806
And they both have the
same expiration over here.

00:00:20.806 --> 00:00:22.180
And then finally,
there's a bond.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.470
And this bond is
unrelated to stock XYZ.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.200
It's going to be
a risk free bond.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.180
So it could be some
type of a treasury bill.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.500
Worth $35 at option expiration.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.970
And you can buy it
right now for $30.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.800
And the reason why you can buy
it for less is you pay $30,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.840
you're going to get $35 in the
future at option expiration.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.100
So you're essentially getting
interest on that bond.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.530
So with these numbers, is there
a way to make risk free money?

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.710
And to think about that,
let's think about the put call

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.210
parity.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.140
We learned that a stock plus
a put at a given strike price,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.620
and the put is a put on
that stock, is equal to.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.459
It's going to have the
same value at expiration

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.490
as a call with the
same strike price.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850
A call with the same
underlying stock.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.640
Plus a bond, a risk free bond,
that's going to be worth that

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.140
strike price at the expiration
of these two options.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.270
So since this is going to have
the same value, the same payoff

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.670
in any circumstance,
as this at expiration,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.759
they really should be
worth the same thing.

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.550
But when you look at
the numbers over here.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.950
Let's see if that works out.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.325
The stock is trading at $31.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.940
The put option is
trading at $12.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.850
So that's plus 12.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.460
So this on the left hand side
right now if you had to buy it,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.600
it's trading at $43.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.660
Is On the right hand side,
you have the call option

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.420
is trading $8.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.470
And then the bond
is trading at $30.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.765
So this combination
is trading at $38.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.020
So even though they have
the exact same payoff

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.070
at option expiration,
the call plus the bond

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.070
is cheaper than the
stock plus the put.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.920
So you have an
arbitrage opportunity.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.830
You have an opportunity
to make profit

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.350
from a discrepancy in
price from two things that

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.000
are essentially equal.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.380
And what you always
want to do is

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.410
you always want to
buy the cheaper thing.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.091
And you want to sell the more
expensive thing, especially

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:37.840
when they are the same
thing, when they're

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.040
going to have the exact
same payoff in the future.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.450
So you want to sell this.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.340
So buying is pretty
straightforward.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.870
What does it mean to
sell this over here?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.330
Well, you could short the stock.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.150
That's essentially,
you're selling the stock.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.470
And then you would
you essentially

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.770
are shorting a put option.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.690
Or another way to think of it,
you could write a put option.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.150
So you short the stock
plus write a put.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.640
And so what would
happened there?

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.090
Shorting the stock,
you're borrowing the stock

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.875
and you are selling it.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.269
So you're going to get $31
from shorting the stock.

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.560
And writing the put means
you literally are essentially

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.520
creating a put option and
selling it to someone else.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.710
And so you're going
to get $12 for that.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.980
So you're going to get your $43.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.500
And then you're going to
buy the call and the bond.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.376
So you're going to spend $8
on the call, $30 on the bonds.

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:35.626
So you are going to spend $38.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.016
And you're going to
make a profit of $5.

00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:42.890
And what we're going to
see in the next video

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.090
is you make this profit upfront.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.600
And no matter what happens to
the stock price going forward,

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.570
you're able to rearrange things
so that everything else just

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.390
cancels out.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.926
And you can just keep your $5.
