introduction of antibiotics clearly had

00:09:06.449 --> 00:09:06.459
introduction of antibiotics clearly had
 

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:08.970
introduction of antibiotics clearly had
an impact on further driving down the

an impact on further driving down the
 

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.490
an impact on further driving down the
case rate and the death rate so this

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:11.500
case rate and the death rate so this
 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.470

here okay so these are the TB case rates

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:21.100
here okay so these are the TB case rates
 

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.960
here okay so these are the TB case rates
and this is the TB death rate from 1930

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.870
York State outside of New York City and
two things to draw your attention to

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880
two things to draw your attention to
 

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:47.340
two things to draw your attention to
first of all the most obvious thing is

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:47.350
first of all the most obvious thing is
 

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.340
first of all the most obvious thing is
the difference between the case state

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.350
the difference between the case state
 

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.040
the difference between the case state
rate and the death rate in New York City

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.050
rate and the death rate in New York City
 

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.860
rate and the death rate in New York City
compared to at the rest of the state how

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:55.870
compared to at the rest of the state how
 

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.660
compared to at the rest of the state how
much higher it is so New York State has

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:57.670
much higher it is so New York State has
 

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.000
much higher it is so New York State has
New York City has a much higher rate and

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.010
New York City has a much higher rate and
 

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.400
New York City has a much higher rate and
then notice that there's an overall

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:02.410
then notice that there's an overall
 

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.050
then notice that there's an overall
downward trend that except that is

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:04.060
downward trend that except that is
 

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.120
downward trend that except that is
accelerated by antibiotics so you can

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.130
accelerated by antibiotics so you can
 

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.680
accelerated by antibiotics so you can
see that the trend it's a little bumpy

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:07.690
see that the trend it's a little bumpy
 

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.689
see that the trend it's a little bumpy
it's a little up and down but was

00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:09.699
it's a little up and down but was
 

00:10:09.699 --> 00:10:12.000
it's a little up and down but was
steadily declining and then around the

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.010
steadily declining and then around the
 

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.310
steadily declining and then around the
early 1950s with the widespread

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320
early 1950s with the widespread
 

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.730
early 1950s with the widespread
deployment of antibiotics the rates of

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:17.740
deployment of antibiotics the rates of
 

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.100
deployment of antibiotics the rates of
both declined even further the drop and

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.110
both declined even further the drop and
 

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.870
both declined even further the drop and
the death rate is quite dramatic that

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880
the death rate is quite dramatic that
 

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.579
the death rate is quite dramatic that
decline in the case rate is a little

00:10:23.579 --> 00:10:23.589
decline in the case rate is a little
 

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.710
decline in the case rate is a little
less that they both the decline is

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720
less that they both the decline is
 

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.480
less that they both the decline is
accelerated by the create the

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:27.490
accelerated by the create the
 

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:34.350

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.619
 
so this decline coincided excuse me

00:10:37.619 --> 00:10:37.629
so this decline coincided excuse me
 

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:40.710
so this decline coincided excuse me
coincided with another historical trend

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720
coincided with another historical trend
 

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.479
coincided with another historical trend
which was the increasing concentration

00:10:42.479 --> 00:10:42.489
which was the increasing concentration
 

00:10:42.489 --> 00:10:44.400
which was the increasing concentration
of the disease among the poor

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:44.410
of the disease among the poor
 

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.739
of the disease among the poor
there was widespread agreement during

00:10:46.739 --> 00:10:46.749
there was widespread agreement during
 

00:10:46.749 --> 00:10:50.249
there was widespread agreement during
this period the 1960s that social

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:50.259
this period the 1960s that social
 

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:51.809
this period the 1960s that social
problems were at the root of

problems were at the root of
 

00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:53.669
problems were at the root of
tuberculosis and so the best way to

tuberculosis and so the best way to
 

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:56.009

question yeah yeah I mean it's it's a
it's a I think it's a really important

00:51:04.259 --> 00:51:04.269
it's a I think it's a really important
 

00:51:04.269 --> 00:51:08.009
it's a I think it's a really important
question to the extent I did it asked us

00:51:08.009 --> 00:51:08.019
question to the extent I did it asked us
 

00:51:08.019 --> 00:51:09.839
question to the extent I did it asked us
to think about what public health as an

00:51:09.839 --> 00:51:09.849
to think about what public health as an
 

00:51:09.849 --> 00:51:12.479
to think about what public health as an
enterprise does in society my colleague

00:51:12.479 --> 00:51:12.489
enterprise does in society my colleague

Nathanson who's a sociologist has a

00:51:15.989 --> 00:51:15.999
Nathanson who's a sociologist has a
 

00:51:15.999 --> 00:51:17.609
Nathanson who's a sociologist has a
great line that she likes to quote that

00:51:17.609 --> 00:51:17.619
great line that she likes to quote that
 

00:51:17.619 --> 00:51:20.029
great line that she likes to quote that
says public health was designed to

00:51:20.029 --> 00:51:20.039
says public health was designed to
 

00:51:20.039 --> 00:51:23.009
says public health was designed to
forestall revolutions not to foment them

00:51:23.009 --> 00:51:23.019
forestall revolutions not to foment them
 

00:51:23.019 --> 00:51:27.049
forestall revolutions not to foment them
and the idea is that by making

00:51:27.049 --> 00:51:27.059
and the idea is that by making
 

00:51:27.059 --> 00:51:30.690
and the idea is that by making
conditions tolerable for people at the

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:30.700
conditions tolerable for people at the
 

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.789
conditions tolerable for people at the
bottom of the social ladder and ensuring

00:51:32.789 --> 00:51:32.799
bottom of the social ladder and ensuring
 

00:51:32.799 --> 00:51:35.069
bottom of the social ladder and ensuring
that diseases that might affect them

00:51:35.069 --> 00:51:35.079
that diseases that might affect them
 

00:51:35.079 --> 00:51:38.150
that diseases that might affect them
don't spread to the more well-to-do that

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160
don't spread to the more well-to-do that
 

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.509
don't spread to the more well-to-do that
buttresses the existing social order and

00:51:41.509 --> 00:51:41.519
buttresses the existing social order and
 

00:51:41.519 --> 00:51:44.729
buttresses the existing social order and
so one place to look for empirical

00:51:44.729 --> 00:51:44.739
so one place to look for empirical
 

00:51:44.739 --> 00:51:46.620
so one place to look for empirical
research would certainly be during the

okay great thank you James all right so

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:32.790
okay great thank you James all right so
 

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:35.470
okay great thank you James all right so
the first question from the audience

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480
the first question from the audience
 

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.270
the first question from the audience
hiya thank you first of all this is nice

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280
hiya thank you first of all this is nice
 

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.710
hiya thank you first of all this is nice
you have like a little a little stand

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:39.720
you have like a little a little stand
 

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.660
you have like a little a little stand
for your question you guys could just

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:41.670
for your question you guys could just
 

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:44.870
for your question you guys could just
remain seated I think if you want okay

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:44.880
remain seated I think if you want okay
 

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.660
remain seated I think if you want okay
so in this map that you showed earlier

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:47.670
so in this map that you showed earlier
 

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:49.190
so in this map that you showed earlier
in the presentation you noted this

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200
in the presentation you noted this
 

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.530
in the presentation you noted this
correlation between yes I guess I'll

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540
correlation between yes I guess I'll
 

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:53.180
correlation between yes I guess I'll
bring it up but correlation between I

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:53.190
bring it up but correlation between I
 

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.579
bring it up but correlation between I
guess poverty stricken areas or just

00:52:55.579 --> 00:52:55.589
guess poverty stricken areas or just
 

00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:59.780
guess poverty stricken areas or just
impoverished areas and cases of TB but

00:52:59.780 --> 00:52:59.790
impoverished areas and cases of TB but
 

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:02.150
impoverished areas and cases of TB but
just statistically like if your example

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160
just statistically like if your example
 

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.319
just statistically like if your example
if you look at some of the whitened

00:53:03.319 --> 00:53:03.329
if you look at some of the whitened
 

00:53:03.329 --> 00:53:05.329
if you look at some of the whitened
areas there are still cases there so

00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339
areas there are still cases there so
 

00:53:05.339 --> 00:53:07.250
areas there are still cases there so
statistically it seems probable that

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260
statistically it seems probable that
 

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.260
statistically it seems probable that
there might be a couple of cases of TB

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:09.270
there might be a couple of cases of TB
 

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:14.510
there might be a couple of cases of TB
possibly of MDR XDR qualities that still

00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520
possibly of MDR XDR qualities that still
 

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:18.230
possibly of MDR XDR qualities that still
remain dormant in in certain I guess in

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240
remain dormant in in certain I guess in
 

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.849
remain dormant in in certain I guess in
certain people in those areas in those

00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859
certain people in those areas in those
 

00:53:19.859 --> 00:53:21.950
certain people in those areas in those
whited out areas so first of all would

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960
whited out areas so first of all would
 

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.809
whited out areas so first of all would
you agree with this assessment that some

00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:23.819
you agree with this assessment that some
 

00:53:23.819 --> 00:53:27.050
you agree with this assessment that some
XDR TB or MDR TB still exists might

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:27.060
XDR TB or MDR TB still exists might
 

00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:29.210
XDR TB or MDR TB still exists might
exist today but the cave that black dots

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220
exist today but the cave that black dots
 

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:31.550
exist today but the cave that black dots
are symptomatic cases these are active

00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:31.560
are symptomatic cases these are active
 

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.650
are symptomatic cases these are active
cases of TB so these would not record

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660
cases of TB so these would not record
 

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.589
cases of TB so these would not record
latent or asymptomatic cases right but

00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599
latent or asymptomatic cases right but
 

00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:37.910
latent or asymptomatic cases right but
if there are if there are symptomatic

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920
if there are if there are symptomatic
 

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.440
if there are if there are symptomatic
cases in a region then it makes sense

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:39.450
cases in a region then it makes sense
 

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:41.510
cases in a region then it makes sense
there would also be asymptomatic cases

00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520
there would also be asymptomatic cases
 

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.150
there would also be asymptomatic cases
there as well right mmm-hmm right so

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160
there as well right mmm-hmm right so
 

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.680
there as well right mmm-hmm right so
first of all what do you think that

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:45.690
first of all what do you think that
 

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.069
first of all what do you think that
possibly in xdr-tb strain might exist in

00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079
possibly in xdr-tb strain might exist in
 

00:53:49.079 --> 00:53:50.630
possibly in xdr-tb strain might exist in
a latent like one of these whited out

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640
a latent like one of these whited out
 

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:52.309
a latent like one of these whited out
regions and second of all do you think

00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319
regions and second of all do you think
 

00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:54.380
regions and second of all do you think
that today we're prepared to combat the

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:54.390
that today we're prepared to combat the
 

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:57.520
that today we're prepared to combat the
threat if such an xdr-tb strain surfaces

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:57.530
threat if such an xdr-tb strain surfaces
 

00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:59.809
threat if such an xdr-tb strain surfaces
well so for the first part I mean say

00:53:59.809 --> 00:53:59.819
well so for the first part I mean say
 

00:53:59.819 --> 00:54:01.550
well so for the first part I mean say
it's a good question I mean I think what

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:01.560
it's a good question I mean I think what
 

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:03.380
it's a good question I mean I think what
the map shows is the extent to which

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:03.390
the map shows is the extent to which
 

00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:08.290
the map shows is the extent to which
that the conditions may foster the the

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:08.300
that the conditions may foster the the
 

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.819
that the conditions may foster the the
reactivation of latent infection for

00:54:10.819 --> 00:54:10.829
reactivation of latent infection for
 

00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:12.859
reactivation of latent infection for
reasons that we either know or we may

00:54:12.859 --> 00:54:12.869
reasons that we either know or we may
 

00:54:12.869 --> 00:54:13.870
reasons that we either know or we may
not know having

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:13.880
not know having
 

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:17.920
not know having
do with things like depressed you know

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:17.930
do with things like depressed you know
 

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:21.880
do with things like depressed you know
the depressed nutritional status poor

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:21.890
the depressed nutritional status poor
 

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:25.000
the depressed nutritional status poor
overall health status I mean this map

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:25.010
overall health status I mean this map
 

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:27.070
overall health status I mean this map
would be the same for many other

00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:27.080
would be the same for many other
 

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.200
would be the same for many other
illnesses right I mean virtually any map

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:29.210
illnesses right I mean virtually any map
 

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:32.580
illnesses right I mean virtually any map
you're going to see a similar pattern

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:32.590
you're going to see a similar pattern
 

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:34.690
you're going to see a similar pattern
and so what was the second part of your

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:34.700
and so what was the second part of your
 

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:47.059
and so what was the second part of your
question

00:54:47.059 --> 00:54:47.069
 
 

00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:49.910
 
New York City has a very outstanding

00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920
New York City has a very outstanding
 

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.469
New York City has a very outstanding
Bureau of TB control and I think they

00:54:54.469 --> 00:54:54.479
Bureau of TB control and I think they
 

00:54:54.479 --> 00:54:57.620
Bureau of TB control and I think they
clearly have learned from the example of

00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:57.630
clearly have learned from the example of
 

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:02.329
clearly have learned from the example of
the early 1990s yeah I mean I think the

00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339
the early 1990s yeah I mean I think the
 

00:55:02.339 --> 00:55:04.849
the early 1990s yeah I mean I think the
structures are in place the the improved

00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859
structures are in place the the improved
 

00:55:04.859 --> 00:55:07.579
structures are in place the the improved
surveillance improved mechanisms for

00:55:07.579 --> 00:55:07.589
surveillance improved mechanisms for
 

00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:09.170
surveillance improved mechanisms for
ensuring treatment completion I do think

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.180
ensuring treatment completion I do think
 

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.939
ensuring treatment completion I do think

the cases in New York I believe are
 

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.360
the cases in New York I believe are
comparable to the cases the case rate in

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:53.370
comparable to the cases the case rate in
 

00:55:53.370 --> 00:55:55.910

the u.s. overall I am NOT very familiar
 

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.370
the u.s. overall I am NOT very familiar
with the u.s. case rate but I believe

00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380
with the u.s. case rate but I believe
 

00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:59.660
with the u.s. case rate but I believe
they're roughly on the same level

00:55:59.660 --> 00:55:59.670
they're roughly on the same level
 

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:02.800
they're roughly on the same level
I mean TV is much much more a problem of

particularly Southeast Asia and
 

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:08.600
particularly Southeast Asia and
sub-saharan Africa so the highest case

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:08.610
sub-saharan Africa so the highest case
 

00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:11.270
sub-saharan Africa so the highest case
rate is in Southeast Asia the highest

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280
rate is in Southeast Asia the highest
 

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.340
rate is in Southeast Asia the highest
number of cases is in sub-saharan Africa

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:13.350
number of cases is in sub-saharan Africa
 

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:15.170
number of cases is in sub-saharan Africa
and the extent of the problem there

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:15.180
and the extent of the problem there
 

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:15.800
and the extent of the problem there
completely

00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:15.810

00:59:59.230 --> 00:59:59.240
very well I think it's interesting that
 

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.040
very well I think it's interesting that
you are suspicious of Gov

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:01.050
you are suspicious of Gov
 

01:00:01.050 --> 01:00:04.940
you are suspicious of Gov
organs efforts you know the immunization

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:04.950
organs efforts you know the immunization
 

01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:07.070
organs efforts you know the immunization
registry so I'm not actually suspicious

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:07.080
registry so I'm not actually suspicious
 

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.160
registry so I'm not actually suspicious
that governor but you don't think that

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.170
that governor but you don't think that
 

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:11.330
that governor but you don't think that
it's a good idea that they want to

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:11.340
it's a good idea that they want to
 

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.040
it's a good idea that they want to
expand the uses of some of the data in

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:13.050
expand the uses of some of the data in
 

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:14.390
expand the uses of some of the data in
this

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400
this
 

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:19.040
this
actually I don't in this case I think

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:19.050
actually I don't in this case I think
 

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:20.930
actually I don't in this case I think
it's a good idea but I don't think it's

01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:20.940
it's a good idea but I don't think it's
 

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.560
it's a good idea but I don't think it's
a good idea to kind of do something

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:23.570
a good idea to kind of do something
 

01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:26.780
a good idea to kind of do something
that's against the way a system was

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:26.790
that's against the way a system was
 

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.750
that's against the way a system was
originally set up and to use data for

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760
originally set up and to use data for
 

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.750
originally set up and to use data for
other purposes for which it was not

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760
other purposes for which it was not
 

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.120
other purposes for which it was not
designed I think it's a good idea but

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:35.130
designed I think it's a good idea but
 

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:36.890
designed I think it's a good idea but
not a good idea to do it by

01:00:36.890 --> 01:00:36.900
not a good idea to do it by
 

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:39.110
not a good idea to do it by
administrative me yeah I mean I guess

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:39.120
administrative me yeah I mean I guess
 

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.660
administrative me yeah I mean I guess
there it would depend on the kind of

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:41.670
there it would depend on the kind of
 

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:43.610
there it would depend on the kind of
usage I mean there there's there's many

01:00:43.610 --> 01:00:43.620
usage I mean there there's there's many
 

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.930
usage I mean there there's there's many
things in that question I'm trying to

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940
things in that question I'm trying to
 

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.900
things in that question I'm trying to
think of which is the way to respond I

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:47.910
think of which is the way to respond I
 

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.370
think of which is the way to respond I
mean the immunization registry is an

01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:49.380
mean the immunization registry is an
 

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.020
mean the immunization registry is an
interesting case because of the

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:51.030
interesting case because of the
 

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:53.000
interesting case because of the
resurgence of anti vaccination ISM and

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:53.010
resurgence of anti vaccination ISM and
 

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:54.260
resurgence of anti vaccination ISM and
the country and the why for the

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:54.270
the country and the why for the
 

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:55.730
the country and the why for the
suspicion that people have and I thought

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740
suspicion that people have and I thought
 

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.410
suspicion that people have and I thought
you were going to bring up the example

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:57.420
you were going to bring up the example
 

01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.570
you were going to bring up the example
in Texas where the Texas immunization

01:00:59.570 --> 01:00:59.580
in Texas where the Texas immunization
 

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:02.240
in Texas where the Texas immunization
registry had to purge thousands and

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:02.250
registry had to purge thousands and
 

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:04.250
registry had to purge thousands and
thousand elements immunization records

01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:04.260
thousand elements immunization records
 

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.780
thousand elements immunization records
because of the angry demands from

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:05.790
because of the angry demands from
 

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.700
because of the angry demands from
parents and you don't believe in the

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:07.710
parents and you don't believe in the
 

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:09.350
parents and you don't believe in the
safety of immunization so that's a whole

01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:09.360
safety of immunization so that's a whole
 

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.870
safety of immunization so that's a whole
other issue I mean yeah that's an

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:11.880
other issue I mean yeah that's an
 

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.000
other issue I mean yeah that's an
example of what I'm talking about yeah I

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:14.010
example of what I'm talking about yeah I
 

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:15.520
example of what I'm talking about yeah I
mean one issue that you raised

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:15.530
mean one issue that you raised
 

01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:17.890
mean one issue that you raised
specifically on this this issue of

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:17.900
specifically on this this issue of
 

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.600
specifically on this this issue of
legislation is whether it's better to

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:20.610
legislation is whether it's better to
 

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.910
legislation is whether it's better to
enact public health policies through

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920
enact public health policies through
 

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:25.300
enact public health policies through
legislation or through administrative

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:25.310
legislation or through administrative
 

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:29.510
legislation or through administrative
regulations you know in in theory

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520
regulations you know in in theory
 

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.930
regulations you know in in theory
legislation provides more transparency

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:32.940
legislation provides more transparency
 

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:34.880
legislation provides more transparency
and more democracy to the extent that

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:34.890
and more democracy to the extent that
 

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:36.410
and more democracy to the extent that
people can give their input into

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:36.420
people can give their input into
 

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.560
people can give their input into
legislation as opposed to administrative

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:38.570
legislation as opposed to administrative
 

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.970
legislation as opposed to administrative
lawmaking where public health officials

01:01:40.970 --> 01:01:40.980
lawmaking where public health officials
 

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.490
lawmaking where public health officials
you know rewrite the health code you

01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:43.500
you know rewrite the health code you
 

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.530
you know rewrite the health code you
know there are indirect mechanisms of

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540
know there are indirect mechanisms of
 

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.750
know there are indirect mechanisms of
accountability for them through whoever

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760
accountability for them through whoever
 

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:51.380
accountability for them through whoever
is the executive who appointed them so

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:51.390
is the executive who appointed them so
 

01:01:51.390 --> 01:01:53.180
is the executive who appointed them so
I'm not sure which one is better I mean

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:53.190
I'm not sure which one is better I mean
 

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:55.520
I'm not sure which one is better I mean
through legislation enacting public

01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:55.530
through legislation enacting public
 

01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:57.410
through legislation enacting public
health policies through legislation may

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.420
health policies through legislation may
 

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.170
health policies through legislation may
open the process to a lot of people who

01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180
open the process to a lot of people who
 

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.320
open the process to a lot of people who
don't know very much about public health

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:02.330
don't know very much about public health
 

01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:06.050
don't know very much about public health
and may have some very misguided ideas

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:06.060
and may have some very misguided ideas
 

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:09.050
and may have some very misguided ideas
about public health I mean a lot of the

01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:09.060
about public health I mean a lot of the
 

01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.260
about public health I mean a lot of the
wurst really pernicious aids-related

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:11.270
wurst really pernicious aids-related
 

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:14.240
wurst really pernicious aids-related
legislation in the 1980s came around

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:14.250
legislation in the 1980s came around
 

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:17.540
legislation in the 1980s came around
from legislators that was entirely

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:17.550
from legislators that was entirely
 

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:20.870
from legislators that was entirely
motivated by bigotry and hatred of

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880
motivated by bigotry and hatred of
 

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.880
motivated by bigotry and hatred of
homosexuals and drug users so that's an

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:22.890
homosexuals and drug users so that's an
 

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:26.270
homosexuals and drug users so that's an
example of where legislation may not be

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280
example of where legislation may not be
 

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.390
example of where legislation may not be
such a good thing even if it increases

01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400
such a good thing even if it increases
 

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.980
such a good thing even if it increases
public it's sort of democratic

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:30.990
public it's sort of democratic
 

01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:34.910
public it's sort of democratic
participation I mean to gosh this is

01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920
participation I mean to gosh this is
 

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:36.470
participation I mean to gosh this is
such an interesting question I feel like

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480
such an interesting question I feel like
 

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.850
such an interesting question I feel like
I've lost the thread of your progress

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:37.860
I've lost the thread of your progress
 

01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:40.280
I've lost the thread of your progress
well I think I think you've answered the

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:40.290
well I think I think you've answered the
 

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:43.400
well I think I think you've answered the
question is that it it depends on the

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:43.410
question is that it it depends on the
 

01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:46.820
question is that it it depends on the
situation and that appears that

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:46.830
situation and that appears that
 

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:49.250
situation and that appears that
sometimes legislation is a good tool and

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:49.260
sometimes legislation is a good tool and
 

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.400
sometimes legislation is a good tool and
other times administration's their

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:52.410
other times administration's their
 

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:54.380
other times administration's their
public health law as the field has

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:54.390
public health law as the field has
 

01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:56.150
public health law as the field has
really boomed in the last decade or so

01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160
really boomed in the last decade or so
 

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.220
really boomed in the last decade or so
it's attracted a lot of interest and

01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:58.230
it's attracted a lot of interest and
 

01:02:58.230 --> 01:03:00.140
it's attracted a lot of interest and
there's increasing recognition I think

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:00.150
there's increasing recognition I think
 

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:02.540
there's increasing recognition I think
among many health authorities that

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:02.550
among many health authorities that
 

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.340
among many health authorities that
legislate law and legislation and

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:04.350
legislate law and legislation and
 

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:06.470
legislate law and legislation and
regulation is it was an extremely

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480
regulation is it was an extremely
 

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.330
regulation is it was an extremely
powerful tool for advancing public

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:08.340
powerful tool for advancing public
 

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:12.320
powerful tool for advancing public
health and that that kind of flourishing

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:12.330
health and that that kind of flourishing
 

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.750
health and that that kind of flourishing
of public health law has has brought to

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:14.760
of public health law has has brought to
 

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:17.180
of public health law has has brought to
people's attention a lot of really

interesting issues around how do you
 

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.620
interesting issues around how do you
write your legislation so that it's not

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:21.630

such as negative pressure rooms which I
think were used first up here at st.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:46.710
think were used first up here at st.
 

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:48.680
think were used first up here at st.
Luke's as I recall I know if it was

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:48.690
Luke's as I recall I know if it was
 

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:53.660
Luke's as I recall I know if it was
first but they were used yeah and then

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:53.670
first but they were used yeah and then
 

01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:57.380
first but they were used yeah and then
also it seems to me I wrote something

01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:57.390
also it seems to me I wrote something
 

01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:59.420
also it seems to me I wrote something
about a new test that came out of the

01:03:59.420 --> 01:03:59.430
about a new test that came out of the
 

01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:01.400
about a new test that came out of the
American Society of microbiology first

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:01.410
American Society of microbiology first
 

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:05.180
American Society of microbiology first
and or maybe a CAC and then was used to

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:05.190
and or maybe a CAC and then was used to
 

01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:10.580
and or maybe a CAC and then was used to
oh very early to test the those folks

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:10.590
oh very early to test the those folks
 

01:04:10.590 --> 01:04:12.170
oh very early to test the those folks
who were being arraigned before they

01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180
who were being arraigned before they
 

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:17.000
who were being arraigned before they
went in the prison system so the first

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:17.010
went in the prison system so the first
 

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:19.760
went in the prison system so the first
question I have a third one oh and the

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:19.770
question I have a third one oh and the
 

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.410
question I have a third one oh and the
okay and that's something of my

01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420
okay and that's something of my
 

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:23.930
okay and that's something of my
ignorance what up until the time of

01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:23.940
ignorance what up until the time of
 

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.390
ignorance what up until the time of
protease inhibitors let's say really

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400
protease inhibitors let's say really
 

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.460
protease inhibitors let's say really
when they began to be used widely up say

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:28.470
when they began to be used widely up say
 

01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:36.789
when they began to be used widely up say
96 or 97 how many of the HIV folks also

01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799
96 or 97 how many of the HIV folks also
 

01:04:36.799 --> 01:04:41.299
96 or 97 how many of the HIV folks also
had TB here in New York City not in

01:04:41.299 --> 01:04:41.309
had TB here in New York City not in
 

01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:48.049
had TB here in New York City not in
Africa I don't know okay so so the first

01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:48.059
Africa I don't know okay so so the first
 

01:04:48.059 --> 01:04:49.309
Africa I don't know okay so so the first
question about negative pressure rooms

01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319
question about negative pressure rooms
 

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:50.660
question about negative pressure rooms
that actually I do have something on

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:50.670
that actually I do have something on
 

01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:52.280
that actually I do have something on
that and in the book and it's a very

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:52.290
that and in the book and it's a very
 

01:04:52.290 --> 01:04:54.710
that and in the book and it's a very
interesting story so one of the real

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720
interesting story so one of the real
 

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.020
interesting story so one of the real
problems which I didn't talk so much

01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:57.030
problems which I didn't talk so much
 

01:04:57.030 --> 01:05:00.230
problems which I didn't talk so much
about was that hospitals were just doing

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240
about was that hospitals were just doing
 

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.720
about was that hospitals were just doing
an abysmal job of managing their TB

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:02.730
an abysmal job of managing their TB
 

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:07.609
an abysmal job of managing their TB
cases they were the the doctors were not

01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619
cases they were the the doctors were not
 

01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:12.309
cases they were the the doctors were not
treating it well and the the

01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319
treating it well and the the
 

01:05:12.319 --> 01:05:14.420
treating it well and the the
administrative procedures were just

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:14.430
administrative procedures were just
 

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:17.329
administrative procedures were just
sloppy and so positive chest x-rays

01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339
sloppy and so positive chest x-rays
 

01:05:17.339 --> 01:05:19.760
sloppy and so positive chest x-rays
would fail to be placed in patients

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:19.770
would fail to be placed in patients
 

01:05:19.770 --> 01:05:22.640
would fail to be placed in patients
charts medication orders wouldn't get

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:22.650
charts medication orders wouldn't get
 

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:24.380
charts medication orders wouldn't get
transmitted properly and one of the

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:24.390
transmitted properly and one of the
 

01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:26.450
transmitted properly and one of the
things that you that you have to do when

01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460
things that you that you have to do when
 

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.099
things that you that you have to do when
you isolate TB patients is ensure that

01:05:28.099 --> 01:05:28.109
you isolate TB patients is ensure that
 

01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:30.260
you isolate TB patients is ensure that
the room is at negative air pressure to

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:30.270
the room is at negative air pressure to
 

01:05:30.270 --> 01:05:32.630
the room is at negative air pressure to
the out to the outside hallways so the

01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640
the out to the outside hallways so the
 

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.849
the out to the outside hallways so the
the the the disease doesn't spread and

01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:34.859
the the the disease doesn't spread and
 

01:05:34.859 --> 01:05:38.089
the the the disease doesn't spread and
so hospitals had an enormous kind of

01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099
so hospitals had an enormous kind of
 

01:05:38.099 --> 01:05:40.730
so hospitals had an enormous kind of
hill to climb in bringing their care up

01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740
hill to climb in bringing their care up
 

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:43.240
hill to climb in bringing their care up
to standard and a lot of the hospitals

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:43.250
to standard and a lot of the hospitals
 

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.530
to standard and a lot of the hospitals
spent of would spend a fortune on these

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:45.540
spent of would spend a fortune on these
 

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.270
spent of would spend a fortune on these
negative air pressure rooms but then

01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280
negative air pressure rooms but then
 

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:51.230
negative air pressure rooms but then
would not put bathrooms in the room so

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240
would not put bathrooms in the room so
 

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:54.319
would not put bathrooms in the room so
that patients with TB were in a negative

01:05:54.319 --> 01:05:54.329
that patients with TB were in a negative
 

01:05:54.329 --> 01:05:55.549
that patients with TB were in a negative
air pressure room and then they would go

01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559
air pressure room and then they would go
 

01:05:55.559 --> 01:05:57.920
air pressure room and then they would go
walking down the hallway past how many

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:57.930
walking down the hallway past how many
 

01:05:57.930 --> 01:05:59.630
walking down the hallway past how many
other rooms so they could use a shared

01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640
other rooms so they could use a shared
 

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:03.470
other rooms so they could use a shared
bathroom so the issue of getting

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480
bathroom so the issue of getting
 

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.539
bathroom so the issue of getting
hospitals up to code that was one of the

01:06:05.539 --> 01:06:05.549
hospitals up to code that was one of the
 

01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:08.690
hospitals up to code that was one of the
one of the most time-consuming and

01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700
one of the most time-consuming and
 

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.490
one of the most time-consuming and
laborious things that Tom Frieden and

01:06:10.490 --> 01:06:10.500
laborious things that Tom Frieden and
 

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.549
laborious things that Tom Frieden and
his team did because you know it could

01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559
his team did because you know it could
 

01:06:13.559 --> 01:06:16.069
his team did because you know it could
be very difficult to exert leverage over

01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079
be very difficult to exert leverage over
 

01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:18.859
be very difficult to exert leverage over
the staffs of all of them there were so

01:06:18.859 --> 01:06:18.869
the staffs of all of them there were so
 

01:06:18.869 --> 01:06:22.730
the staffs of all of them there were so
many hospitals in the city your second

01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:22.740
many hospitals in the city your second
 

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.710
many hospitals in the city your second
question was Oh about the test I

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720
question was Oh about the test I
 

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.539
question was Oh about the test I
actually I do not know about this test

01:06:26.539 --> 01:06:26.549
actually I do not know about this test
 

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.579
actually I do not know about this test
so I will defer to maybe if we have a

01:06:28.579 --> 01:06:28.589
so I will defer to maybe if we have a
 

01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:31.410
so I will defer to maybe if we have a
physician in the audience Steve or

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:31.420
physician in the audience Steve or
 

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:47.490
physician in the audience Steve or
anyone who knows

01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:47.500
 
 

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.650
 
the city actually apartment health has

01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:50.660
the city actually apartment health has
 

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.570
the city actually apartment health has
some data which I think they're actually

01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:52.580
some data which I think they're actually
 

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.390
some data which I think they're actually
process

01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:55.400
process
 

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:58.830
process
now I thought something was given to

01:06:58.830 --> 01:06:58.840
now I thought something was given to
 

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.740
now I thought something was given to
some test was given within arraignment

01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:02.750
some test was given within arraignment
 

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:07.330
some test was given within arraignment
and maybe 92 93 91 something like that

01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:07.340
and maybe 92 93 91 something like that
 

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:14.010
and maybe 92 93 91 something like that
uh okay well I can I can look back and

01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:14.020
uh okay well I can I can look back and
 

01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:16.330
uh okay well I can I can look back and
what I have I mean I have no idea how

01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:16.340
what I have I mean I have no idea how
 

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.340
what I have I mean I have no idea how
sensitive and specific it was it is just

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:18.350
sensitive and specific it was it is just
 

01:07:18.350 --> 01:07:20.940
sensitive and specific it was it is just
a kind of idea of doing a preliminary

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:20.950
a kind of idea of doing a preliminary
 

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:26.080
a kind of idea of doing a preliminary
isolation before they went into the

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:26.090
isolation before they went into the
 

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:28.870
isolation before they went into the
arraignment in Rikers or whatever mm-hmm

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880
arraignment in Rikers or whatever mm-hmm
 

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.030
arraignment in Rikers or whatever mm-hmm
I don't know and then you're a third

01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:31.040
I don't know and then you're a third
 

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:33.910
I don't know and then you're a third
question so the number of hiv-positive

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920
question so the number of hiv-positive
 

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.320
question so the number of hiv-positive
people with TB HIV would not be known

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:38.330
people with TB HIV would not be known
 

01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:40.360
people with TB HIV would not be known
because HIV wasn't reportable and so

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:40.370
because HIV wasn't reportable and so
 

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:42.550
because HIV wasn't reportable and so
nobody really knew how many people with

01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:42.560
nobody really knew how many people with
 

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:44.650
nobody really knew how many people with
HIV were in the city in terms of well

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:44.660
HIV were in the city in terms of well
 

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.630
HIV were in the city in terms of well
they've diagnosed CDC estimates right

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640
they've diagnosed CDC estimates right
 

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.490
they've diagnosed CDC estimates right
yeah I mean in terms of diagnosed cases

01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:48.500
yeah I mean in terms of diagnosed cases
 

01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:51.910
yeah I mean in terms of diagnosed cases
of AIDS I would actually have to go back

01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920
of AIDS I would actually have to go back
 

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:53.470
of AIDS I would actually have to go back
and look at my files I'm actually I

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:53.480
and look at my files I'm actually I
 

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:54.760
and look at my files I'm actually I
don't I don't have that number in my

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:54.770
don't I don't have that number in my
 

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.560
don't I don't have that number in my
head I mean it's a really interesting

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:56.570
head I mean it's a really interesting
 

01:07:56.570 --> 01:07:57.210
head I mean it's a really interesting
question

01:07:57.210 --> 01:07:57.220
question
 

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:59.350
question
which I don't I don't know the answer in

01:07:59.350 --> 01:07:59.360
which I don't I don't know the answer in
 

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:06.460
which I don't I don't know the answer in
my head yeah first of all thank you

01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:06.470
my head yeah first of all thank you
 

01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:09.940
my head yeah first of all thank you
and I wanted to ask you talk you talked

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:09.950
and I wanted to ask you talk you talked
 

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:12.160
and I wanted to ask you talk you talked
a lot in our previous discussion and

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:12.170
a lot in our previous discussion and
 

01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:14.110
a lot in our previous discussion and
then also in your lecture about the

01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:14.120
then also in your lecture about the
 

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.110
then also in your lecture about the
differences of public health agencies

01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120
differences of public health agencies
 

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.870
differences of public health agencies
dealing with the social or environmental

01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880
dealing with the social or environmental
 

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.430
dealing with the social or environmental
factors of disease versus the more

01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.440
factors of disease versus the more
 

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.120
factors of disease versus the more
medical technical or curative factors of

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:28.130
medical technical or curative factors of
 

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:31.900
medical technical or curative factors of
disease and obviously ideally there

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:31.910
disease and obviously ideally there
 

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:33.520
disease and obviously ideally there
would be a very good balance between the

01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:33.530
would be a very good balance between the
 

01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:36.280
would be a very good balance between the
two in terms of funding and resources

01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:36.290
two in terms of funding and resources
 

01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:38.710
two in terms of funding and resources
but public health agencies only have a

01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:38.720
but public health agencies only have a
 

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:40.420
but public health agencies only have a
limited amount of funds so I was

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:40.430
limited amount of funds so I was
 

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:41.920
limited amount of funds so I was
wondering what your personal opinion was

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:41.930
wondering what your personal opinion was
 

01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:45.880
wondering what your personal opinion was
in terms of you know what the percentage

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:45.890
in terms of you know what the percentage
 

01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.550
in terms of you know what the percentage
of allocation should be not exactly but

01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560
of allocation should be not exactly but
 

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:51.760
of allocation should be not exactly but
you know generally towards preventative

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:51.770
you know generally towards preventative
 

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.390
you know generally towards preventative
and environmental measures as opposed to

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400
and environmental measures as opposed to
 

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.430
and environmental measures as opposed to
curative measures well I mean I think

01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440
curative measures well I mean I think
 

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.220
curative measures well I mean I think
your question gets at an important point

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:00.230
your question gets at an important point
 

01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:01.810
your question gets at an important point
underscore which is that public health

01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:01.820
underscore which is that public health
 

01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:03.670
underscore which is that public health
professionals politically are not

01:09:03.670 --> 01:09:03.680
professionals politically are not
 

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:07.150
professionals politically are not
powerful actors at all compared to the

01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:07.160
powerful actors at all compared to the
 

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:07.470
powerful actors at all compared to the
very

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480
very
 

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.810
very
interest groups in society who are

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:09.820
interest groups in society who are
 

01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:12.510
interest groups in society who are
fighting for a piece of the budget I

01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520
fighting for a piece of the budget I
 

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.850
fighting for a piece of the budget I
mean public health as a field is not at

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:14.860
mean public health as a field is not at
 

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:19.080
mean public health as a field is not at
all powerful and so you know the

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:19.090
all powerful and so you know the
 

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:24.690
all powerful and so you know the
question of their never mind their

01:09:24.690 --> 01:09:24.700
question of their never mind their
 

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.790
question of their never mind their
mandate their ability to affect these

01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:26.800
mandate their ability to affect these
 

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.290
mandate their ability to affect these
various societal conditions that they

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:28.300
various societal conditions that they
 

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.300
various societal conditions that they
might want to I think is is really in

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:30.310
might want to I think is is really in
 

01:09:30.310 --> 01:09:35.100
might want to I think is is really in
question I mean it's the question of

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:35.110
question I mean it's the question of
 

01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:36.960
question I mean it's the question of
allocation of health care dollars on

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:36.970
allocation of health care dollars on
 

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:41.700
allocation of health care dollars on
prevention versus cure is is a very

01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:41.710
prevention versus cure is is a very
 

01:09:41.710 --> 01:09:49.140
prevention versus cure is is a very
complicated one I'm not sure I'm not

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:49.150
complicated one I'm not sure I'm not
 

01:09:49.150 --> 01:09:51.360
complicated one I'm not sure I'm not
sure ice and say again your question

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:51.370
sure ice and say again your question
 

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:53.580
sure ice and say again your question
well I was wondering what I mean

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:53.590
well I was wondering what I mean
 

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:54.900
well I was wondering what I mean
obviously there's a range of

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:54.910
obviously there's a range of
 

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:55.950
obviously there's a range of
possibilities but well your personal

01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960
possibilities but well your personal
 

01:09:55.960 --> 01:10:00.090
possibilities but well your personal
opinion was on how much a public health

01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:00.100
opinion was on how much a public health
 

01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.880
opinion was on how much a public health
agency should embrace the attempt to

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:02.890
agency should embrace the attempt to
 

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:04.770
agency should embrace the attempt to
affect social and environmental

01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:04.780
affect social and environmental
 

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:08.490
affect social and environmental
conditions as well as allocating for

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:08.500
conditions as well as allocating for
 

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:13.680
conditions as well as allocating for
treatment well there are there are a

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:13.690
treatment well there are there are a
 

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:15.690
treatment well there are there are a
wide range of things that might be done

01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:15.700
wide range of things that might be done
 

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.140
wide range of things that might be done
to affect social conditions that are

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:18.150
to affect social conditions that are
 

01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:21.270
to affect social conditions that are
have to do with basic features of a

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280
have to do with basic features of a
 

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.010
have to do with basic features of a
capitalist society that I think are well

01:10:23.010 --> 01:10:23.020
capitalist society that I think are well
 

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.950
capitalist society that I think are well
beyond the ability of public health

01:10:25.950 --> 01:10:25.960
beyond the ability of public health
 

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.330
beyond the ability of public health
professionals I mean I'm in a School of

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:27.340
professionals I mean I'm in a School of
 

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:28.860
professionals I mean I'm in a School of
Public Health so my feeling is that

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:28.870
Public Health so my feeling is that
 

01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:30.720
Public Health so my feeling is that
public health should always get more

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:30.730
public health should always get more
 

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:33.150
public health should always get more
money but of course that's that's

01:10:33.150 --> 01:10:33.160
money but of course that's that's
 

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.530
money but of course that's that's
special pleading I mean if you look at

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:34.540
special pleading I mean if you look at
 

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:35.940
special pleading I mean if you look at
the overall health care budget a tiny

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:35.950
the overall health care budget a tiny
 

01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:38.760
the overall health care budget a tiny
fraction of Health dollars in the u.s.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:38.770
fraction of Health dollars in the u.s.
 

01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:41.760
fraction of Health dollars in the u.s.
are spent on prevention I mean

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:41.770
are spent on prevention I mean
 

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.980
are spent on prevention I mean
regardless of how you define prevention

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:43.990
regardless of how you define prevention
 

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.110
regardless of how you define prevention
very little of the money goes towards

01:10:46.110 --> 01:10:46.120
very little of the money goes towards
 

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.900
very little of the money goes towards
prevention and most of it goes towards

01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:48.910
prevention and most of it goes towards
 

01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:51.360
prevention and most of it goes towards
curative medicine so any kind of change

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:51.370
curative medicine so any kind of change
 

01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:54.570
curative medicine so any kind of change
in that in that balance I think would be

01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:54.580
in that in that balance I think would be
 

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:58.650
in that in that balance I think would be
a change in the right direction thank

01:10:58.650 --> 01:10:58.660
a change in the right direction thank
 

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:02.700
a change in the right direction thank
you

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:02.710
 
 

01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:04.650
 
so just building on my earlier question

01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:04.660
so just building on my earlier question
 

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.590
so just building on my earlier question
about readiness so in this particular TB

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600
about readiness so in this particular TB
 

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:10.110
about readiness so in this particular TB
outbreak or series of outbreaks d-o-t

01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:10.120
outbreak or series of outbreaks d-o-t
 

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.910
outbreak or series of outbreaks d-o-t
worked as an effective measure for

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920
worked as an effective measure for
 

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:14.310
worked as an effective measure for
countering the spread of the virus but

01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320
countering the spread of the virus but
 

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.650
countering the spread of the virus but
so we hear all the time about the spread

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:16.660
so we hear all the time about the spread
 

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:19.290
so we hear all the time about the spread
of these new novel legal pathogens like

01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:19.300
of these new novel legal pathogens like
 

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.490
of these new novel legal pathogens like
ranging from ecole

01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:20.500
ranging from ecole
 

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:24.720
ranging from ecole
one57 h72 the flu all of which make the

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:24.730
one57 h72 the flu all of which make the
 

01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:26.310
one57 h72 the flu all of which make the
host body weaker and you did mention

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320
host body weaker and you did mention
 

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.320
host body weaker and you did mention
that TB attacks when the host body or

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:28.330
that TB attacks when the host body or
 

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:30.510
that TB attacks when the host body or
the immune system is weakened so in the

01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:30.520
the immune system is weakened so in the
 

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.890
the immune system is weakened so in the
case that there was a citywide

01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:31.900
case that there was a citywide
 

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:33.360
case that there was a citywide
appearance of one of these pathogens

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:33.370
appearance of one of these pathogens
 

01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:35.610
appearance of one of these pathogens
again it could be bacterial or viral and

01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:35.620
again it could be bacterial or viral and
 

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:38.760
again it could be bacterial or viral and
origin would you say that that the

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:38.770
origin would you say that that the
 

01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:40.350
origin would you say that that the
amount of TB first of all do you think

01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360
amount of TB first of all do you think
 

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.300
amount of TB first of all do you think
that an enormous amount of TB cases

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:42.310
that an enormous amount of TB cases
 

01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:45.240
that an enormous amount of TB cases
would result and second of all do you

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:45.250
would result and second of all do you
 

01:11:45.250 --> 01:11:46.770
would result and second of all do you
think that the city would be able to

01:11:46.770 --> 01:11:46.780
think that the city would be able to
 

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:49.440
think that the city would be able to
deal with this massive info influx given

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:49.450
deal with this massive info influx given
 

01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:52.230
deal with this massive info influx given
given the fact that do T does require I

01:11:52.230 --> 01:11:52.240
given the fact that do T does require I
 

01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.910
given the fact that do T does require I
guess a significant amount of personnel

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920
guess a significant amount of personnel
 

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:55.500
guess a significant amount of personnel
and also resources to carry out

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:55.510
and also resources to carry out
 

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:57.300
and also resources to carry out
effectively so you're talking about the

01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:57.310
effectively so you're talking about the
 

01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:59.250
effectively so you're talking about the
appearance of a new microorganism that

01:11:59.250 --> 01:11:59.260
appearance of a new microorganism that
 

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:04.320
appearance of a new microorganism that
increased incidence of TB or any or any

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:04.330
increased incidence of TB or any or any
 

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:05.790
increased incidence of TB or any or any
pathogen that would weaken the immune

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800
pathogen that would weaken the immune
 

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.790
pathogen that would weaken the immune
system and allow dormant TB for example

01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800
system and allow dormant TB for example
 

01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.560
system and allow dormant TB for example
to become symptomatic and then that

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:10.570
to become symptomatic and then that
 

01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:13.170
to become symptomatic and then that
symptomatic TB would in turn result in

01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:13.180
symptomatic TB would in turn result in
 

01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:14.910
symptomatic TB would in turn result in
increased transmission to people who are

01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:14.920
increased transmission to people who are
 

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.890
increased transmission to people who are
already already weakened by the initial

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:16.900
already already weakened by the initial
 

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.330
already already weakened by the initial
bacteria and you could just have this

01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:18.340
bacteria and you could just have this
 

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:20.520
bacteria and you could just have this
enormous spread yeah I mean you can you

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:20.530
enormous spread yeah I mean you can you
 

01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:22.170
enormous spread yeah I mean you can you
can always imagine sort of doomsday

01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:22.180
can always imagine sort of doomsday
 

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:23.850
can always imagine sort of doomsday
scenarios I mean I think it would depend

01:12:23.850 --> 01:12:23.860
scenarios I mean I think it would depend
 

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.160
scenarios I mean I think it would depend
on on the nature of what the pathogen

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:26.170
on on the nature of what the pathogen
 

01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:31.470
on on the nature of what the pathogen
was on the extent of it on I mean again

01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480
was on the extent of it on I mean again
 

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.450
was on the extent of it on I mean again
I think the city has a very good TB

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:33.460
I think the city has a very good TB
 

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:36.120
I think the city has a very good TB
control infrastructure and the systems

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:36.130
control infrastructure and the systems
 

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:38.640
control infrastructure and the systems
around the city in terms of reporting is

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:38.650
around the city in terms of reporting is
 

01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:39.990
around the city in terms of reporting is
much better than it used to be the

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000
much better than it used to be the
 

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.940
much better than it used to be the
relationship between the Health

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:41.950
relationship between the Health
 

01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:47.640
relationship between the Health
Department in terms of reporting of of

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:47.650
Department in terms of reporting of of
 

01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:49.800
Department in terms of reporting of of
healthcare facilities of conditions is

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:49.810
healthcare facilities of conditions is
 

01:12:49.810 --> 01:12:51.390
healthcare facilities of conditions is
much better than it used to be it could

01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400
much better than it used to be it could
 

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.680
much better than it used to be it could
be a lot better but it's much better

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:52.690
be a lot better but it's much better
 

01:12:52.690 --> 01:12:55.110
be a lot better but it's much better
than it used to be so I think that the

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120
than it used to be so I think that the
 

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.400
than it used to be so I think that the
city is would probably be

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:56.410
city is would probably be
 

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:59.760
city is would probably be
well-positioned but you know in in some

01:12:59.760 --> 01:12:59.770
well-positioned but you know in in some
 

01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:01.940
well-positioned but you know in in some
kind of dire science fiction scenario

01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:01.950
kind of dire science fiction scenario
 

01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:07.020
kind of dire science fiction scenario
who knows okay let me make these the two

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:07.030
who knows okay let me make these the two
 

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:12.590
who knows okay let me make these the two
last questions so yep just um they were

01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600
last questions so yep just um they were
 

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.360
last questions so yep just um they were
just back to the question of magic

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:15.370
just back to the question of magic
 

01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:17.640
just back to the question of magic
bullets versus social and economic

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:17.650
bullets versus social and economic
 

01:13:17.650 --> 01:13:21.390
bullets versus social and economic
change were there some other things

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.400
change were there some other things
 

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:24.660
change were there some other things
going on like finding houses for housing

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:24.670
going on like finding houses for housing
 

01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:28.130
going on like finding houses for housing
for people with HIV and trying to

01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140
for people with HIV and trying to
 

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.330
for people with HIV and trying to
improve conditions in some

01:13:30.330 --> 01:13:30.340
improve conditions in some
 

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.740
improve conditions in some
I don't know if there was in some of

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:31.750
I don't know if there was in some of
 

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:33.120
I don't know if there was in some of
those homeless shelters and so on that

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:33.130
those homeless shelters and so on that
 

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:35.879
those homeless shelters and so on that
might also have had some impact

01:13:35.879 --> 01:13:35.889
might also have had some impact
 

01:13:35.889 --> 01:13:38.520
might also have had some impact
perhaps not as much as co2 but yeah it's

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:38.530
perhaps not as much as co2 but yeah it's
 

01:13:38.530 --> 01:13:40.229
perhaps not as much as co2 but yeah it's
a it's that's that's an important point

01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239
a it's that's that's an important point
 

01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:41.700
a it's that's that's an important point
I'm glad you bring that up so one of the

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:41.710
I'm glad you bring that up so one of the
 

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:44.510
I'm glad you bring that up so one of the
things that the city tried to do was to

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520
things that the city tried to do was to
 

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.310
things that the city tried to do was to
provide separate housing for homeless

01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320
provide separate housing for homeless
 

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.810
provide separate housing for homeless
hiv-positive people and homeless people

01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:51.820
hiv-positive people and homeless people
 

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.430
hiv-positive people and homeless people
with AIDS because they were particularly

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440
with AIDS because they were particularly
 

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.740
with AIDS because they were particularly
vulnerable to transmission in shelters

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:55.750
vulnerable to transmission in shelters
 

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:57.149
vulnerable to transmission in shelters
and there are actually many lawsuits

01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159
and there are actually many lawsuits
 

01:13:57.159 --> 01:14:00.000
and there are actually many lawsuits
against the city by Housing Works in

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:00.010
against the city by Housing Works in
 

01:14:00.010 --> 01:14:02.550
against the city by Housing Works in
other aids service organizations and and

01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560
other aids service organizations and and
 

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.500
other aids service organizations and and
so the city did do that and i and and

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:04.510
so the city did do that and i and and
 

01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:06.930
so the city did do that and i and and

Frieden and his team when they talked
 

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.370
Frieden and his team when they talked
about the measures that had been

01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:08.380
about the measures that had been
 

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.649
about the measures that had been
effective mentioned that is one of the

01:14:10.649 --> 01:14:10.659
effective mentioned that is one of the
 

01:14:10.659 --> 01:14:12.270
effective mentioned that is one of the
things that probably had an effect it's

01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:12.280
things that probably had an effect it's
 

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.120
things that probably had an effect it's
you know when multiple things are

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:15.130
you know when multiple things are
 

01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:16.379
you know when multiple things are
happening at the same time it's

01:14:16.379 --> 01:14:16.389
happening at the same time it's
 

01:14:16.389 --> 01:14:17.879
happening at the same time it's
sometimes difficult to tease out the

01:14:17.879 --> 01:14:17.889
sometimes difficult to tease out the
 

01:14:17.889 --> 01:14:20.129
sometimes difficult to tease out the
effects but given the significance of

01:14:20.129 --> 01:14:20.139
effects but given the significance of
 

01:14:20.139 --> 01:14:23.129
effects but given the significance of
transmission in shelters among

01:14:23.129 --> 01:14:23.139
transmission in shelters among
 

01:14:23.139 --> 01:14:24.720
transmission in shelters among
hiv-positive people it is almost

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:24.730
hiv-positive people it is almost
 

01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:27.089
hiv-positive people it is almost
certainly the case that providing

01:14:27.089 --> 01:14:27.099
certainly the case that providing
 

01:14:27.099 --> 01:14:29.220
certainly the case that providing
separate segregated housing for

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:29.230
separate segregated housing for
 

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:32.370
separate segregated housing for

hiv-positive people and for people with
 

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:34.530
hiv-positive people and for people with
AIDS had an effect on it I mean it

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:34.540
AIDS had an effect on it I mean it
 

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:39.149
AIDS had an effect on it I mean it
really I I have to concede sort of the

01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159
really I I have to concede sort of the
 

01:14:39.159 --> 01:14:41.129
really I I have to concede sort of the
limitations of the analytic categories

01:14:41.129 --> 01:14:41.139
limitations of the analytic categories
 

01:14:41.139 --> 01:14:42.660
limitations of the analytic categories
that I'm using because do you call that

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:42.670
that I'm using because do you call that
 

01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:44.850
that I'm using because do you call that
a targeted intervention do you call that

01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:44.860
a targeted intervention do you call that
 

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:46.919
a targeted intervention do you call that
or is does that rise to the level of

01:14:46.919 --> 01:14:46.929
or is does that rise to the level of
 

01:14:46.929 --> 01:14:49.350
or is does that rise to the level of
sort of a broad-based social reform the

01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360
sort of a broad-based social reform the
 

01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.910
sort of a broad-based social reform the
