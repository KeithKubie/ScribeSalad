00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
&gt;&gt; KAY: So, let's show you this how easy it
is to write an extension. We’re going to

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.130
build one live in front of you in the next
couple of minutes here. And it's not just

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.240
going to be a “Hello World” extension.
It's going to be something that actually does

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.450
something real. In fact, it's been a pretty
frequently requested feature in the browser

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.180
itself. We're going to build an extension
that allows you to email the page that you're

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.700
on to somebody else. So, just to show that
this is live and whatever, could somebody

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.770
give me the name of a small mammal? Anybody?
&gt;&gt; Gopher.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.609
&gt;&gt; KAY: Gopher. Okay, a gopher. So, we're
going to name this extension a gopher. And

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:41.039
the way--so, what we're going to do is we're
going start by creating a manifest file.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:48.109
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: I think it’s spelled that way.
&gt;&gt; KAY: So, when we first started creating

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.699
the extension, we create a directory and we
create a file on that called the manifest

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:57.309
file. The manifest file is just a simple JSON
file that has some key value pairs in it.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.960
One of them is the name. I might have a version,
a description. This is sort of the basic building

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.070
blocks sort of to find what an extension is.
For this particular extension, we're going

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.990
to use a bit of functionality called the browser
action. Now, a browser action is just a little

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.170
button that shows up in the toolbar of the
browser. And it has a whole bunch of different

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.720
options, but for now, all we're going to set
is the icon and the title of it. So, Aaron's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.450
got an image already made that we're going
to grab for it, and the title will set something

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.920
that matches our animal here, I guess. Right.
I don't know what the sound a gopher makes.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.090
They back, could be. So, let's go get that
image and copy it into the folder.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.590
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: Okay.
&gt;&gt; KAY: So, as I said, they're just collections

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.479
of Web pages and their resources, so they
just sort of live next to each other just

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.751
like they would on a Web server, but we’re
making this packet. So now, believe it or

00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:55.640
not, we’ve got actually an extension that's
going to do something in the browser. So,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.009
let's load it up. So, the way to do that is
we go into the browser and go to the launch

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.359
menu and extensions. So, this will take you
to the extensions management page. There's

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.259
a developer mode that you can turn on. And
from there, there's an option called load

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.370
unpacked extensions. This just says, “I'm
going to load a directory as if it were a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.150
fully ready to go extension.” So, we load
our gopher extension and boom. Right there,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.030
you see the new icon shows up in the toolbar
immediately, and has the little text that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.170
he specified there. Okay. But, if he clicks
on it, it doesn't do anything. So now, it's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.170
time to actually hook it up and make it do
something real, okay? So to do that, the next

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.640
step is to add something called the background
page. Now, background page is just an HTML

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.380
page, but it's not visible to the user. It's
hidden in the background but it's loaded when

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.470
the browser starts up and it's always running.
So, that's usually where people put the meat

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.549
of their extension launching. So, as I said,
it’s just a basic HTML page where I put

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:00.530
some script in there. And what the script
is going to do, it’s going to add an event

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.890
listener to the browser action button. And
that event listener is going to have a little

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.940
callback in it. And when it gets called, he's
going to call a window that open, bring up

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:17.700
a pop-up, and send to a Gmail URL, we’re
going to get in a minute here, and so we can

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.420
send that mail. Those of you who are Web programmers
in the audience now, there's a lot of options

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.719
to hear. So, we'll wait for Aaron to get them
all typed in?

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:32.000
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: Yeah. Oh, yeah, I can't remember
the URLs, so I'm going to copy it someplace

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.049
else. I'm not good in remembering long random
URLs.

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.930
&gt;&gt; KAY: But, I am.
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: So it’s easy to catch wherever

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.549
they set Webs.
&gt;&gt; KAY: So anyways, believe it or not, now

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.829
we’ve got an extension. We're ready to go.
So, let’s see if it actually does something.

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.780
So, the way we do this is we go to the management
page and we hit “reload,” just like you

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.370
would on a Web page. Now, a whole extension
reloads and the functionality is ready to

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.540
go. So, if you go to the Google page, we're
going to share that with somebody, click on

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.741
it. Nothing happened. Okay, live demo. So,
it's probably a bug. Let's find out, the good

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:14.741
thing another one...
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: So unconvincing.

00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:18.340
&gt;&gt; KAY: Yeah, so unconvincing. No one believes
that that was actually an accidental bug.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.440
Okay. Well, okay. So, let's find the bug anyway.
Just play along with us here. So, when you're

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.590
doing--as I said before, you get to use all
same developer tools that you would use for

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.280
normal Web pages. And we got really powerful
once with the WebKit’s Web Inspector. You

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.890
can see the “inspect back active views”
on that page. Just click on it and brought

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.720
up the Web Inspector. The Web inspector has
a ton of powerful features. You can inspect

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.080
the DOM, manage CSS. You can look at all the
resources that this loaded. You can use the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.940
active script debugger and set breakpoints.
You can look at the timeline if you want some

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.870
to measure performance and see what's going
where, or go to the CPU Profilers and Heap

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.720
Profilers. This is a really simple extension,
though. So, all we're going to do is notice

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.220
that there's a little red error indicator
in the corner. He is going to click on that.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.490
And it's going to tell us what our error was.
It says that this object has no method name

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.090
to add. So, apparently we got the method name
wrong. So, let's find out what the method

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.780
name really should have been. What Aaron is
showing you here is auto-complete in a console.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.970
The console has access to all of the objects
that are there and can show you what's there.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.910
So, Chrome.browserx on click and it’s “add
a listener” not “add,” yeah, exactly.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.669
So, good catch up. So for the person who caught
that in the audience and knew that we were

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:43.509
faking here, so, good job. So, we'll change
that to “add listener.” And now, we reload

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:53.360
the extension. And let's try out on that page.
There is the window. Oh...

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.830
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: I forgot to...
&gt;&gt; KAY: Yeah, yeah. I think we forgot the

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.050
feature there, but let's add that URL back
in. Can we do that?

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.690
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: Okay.
&gt;&gt; KAY: So, we can actually get this listener

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:10.050
that gets the--gets the Tab passed into it.
So, you forgot a plus there, I think.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.380
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; KAY: And so, we can attach that into the

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.990
body. So it's actually going to mail the URL
to the page that we’re on. So, quick fix

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.319
that.
&gt;&gt; BOODMAN: Oh, I nailed it. This demo is

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:27.800
going awesomely.
&gt;&gt; KAY: Yes. Here we go. Here we go. So now

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.780
we have the working mail of this page extension.
So, we'll send it to ourselves, and then we're

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.110
done. But actually even though we got a functioning
extension, we’re not quite done yet. The

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.490
next step is we'd like to share with our friends.
So, the best way to do that is on the Chrome

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.510
Extensions gallery. So, let's go and see if
we can upload that to the gallery. So, you

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.330
hit to the developer section of the Chrome
Extensions gallery, and you say, “Add new

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.449
item.” And this guy will tell you, he wants
a Zip file. A zip, you know, just package

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.830
up the directory as a single Zip file. So,
let's just do that quickly here. And then,

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:10.970
upload it directly. And when that's all done,
we're going to get to set some properties

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.090
that are going--about how it's going to appear
in the gallery. But I bet a bunch of you have

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:20.650
already done this, so not too big of a surprise
but a short little upload. And right now,

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.629
while it’s waiting here, so it may seem
like it's taking a little bit longer than

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:28.349
you'd think for a small file. But it's actually
doing a little bit of work on the backend,

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:35.039
verifying there are no errors and checking
to make sure that things are going. So, hello,

00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:40.840
excellent, perfect there. So now, we get to
the landing page and here is where you can

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.470
add a little more detail about what's going
to show up in the landing page when people

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.039
find your extension in the gallery. So, a
detailed description links to your Website.

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:54.020
You can upload screenshots linked to YouTube
videos, so that people can see screen casts

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.650
of your extension in action. We think this
is going to be a really compelling feature

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:03.740
and we'll show you a little bit more of that
in action later. So then when we're done,

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.270
we publish the extension and it will take
a second as it's going through. And there

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:13.819
you go, the extension is now live in the gallery,
and we're done. So, live extension, less than

00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:19.879
five minutes, I think. And, well, all in all
pretty easy and pretty fast.
