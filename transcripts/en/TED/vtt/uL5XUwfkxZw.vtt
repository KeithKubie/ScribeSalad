Leah Chase: Oh, this is beautiful.

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:17.321
Oh, gosh, I never saw such a room

00:00:17.345 --> 00:00:20.417
and beauty and strength
like I'm looking at.

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:22.575
That's gorgeous. It is.

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.902
It is a beautiful room.

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:29.210
Pat Mitchell: I almost said your age,
because you gave me permission,

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:31.909
but I realized that I was
about to make you a year older.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:33.448
You're only 94.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.099
(Laughter)

00:00:35.123 --> 00:00:36.727
(Applause)

00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:38.534
LC: Yeah, I'm only 94.

00:00:38.558 --> 00:00:39.958
(Applause)

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:44.068
I mean, you get this old
and parts start wearing out.

00:00:44.092 --> 00:00:45.838
Your legs start wearing out.

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:48.719
The one thing that my children always say:

00:00:48.743 --> 00:00:50.545
"But nothing happened to your mouth."

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:53.006
(Laughter)

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.126
So you've got to have something going,
so I've got my mouth going.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.896
(Laughter)

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:00.917
PM: So Mrs. Chase,
the first time we were there,

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:05.087
I brought a group of young women,
who work with us at TED,

00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:06.271
into the kitchen,

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:09.295
and we were all standing around
and you had already cooked lunch

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.389
for hundreds of people,
as you do every day,

00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:13.326
and you looked up at them.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.421
You have to share with this audience
what you said to those young women.

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:21.188
LC: Well, you know,
I talk to young women all the time,

00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:24.222
and it's beginning to bother me,

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:26.433
because look how far I came.

00:01:26.457 --> 00:01:32.767
I'd come with women
that had to really hustle and work hard,

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.021
and they knew how to be women.

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:40.523
They didn't play that man down.

00:01:40.547 --> 00:01:44.075
And, well, we didn't have
the education you have today,

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:45.725
and God, I'm so proud

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:50.138
when I see those women
with all that education under their belt.

00:01:50.162 --> 00:01:51.475
That's why I worked hard,

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:55.451
tried to get everybody
to use those resources.

00:01:55.793 --> 00:01:59.328
So they just don't know their power,

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:03.002
and I always tell them,
just look at my mother,

00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:05.471
had 12 girls before she had a boy.

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:06.669
(Laughter)

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:08.161
So you know how I came out.

00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:09.407
(Laughter)

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:10.986
Now, she had 14 children.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.058
She raised 11 of us out of that 14,

00:02:15.082 --> 00:02:18.021
and up until last year,
we were all still living,

00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:20.294
a bunch of old biddies,
but we're still here.

00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:21.644
(Laughter)

00:02:21.668 --> 00:02:25.899
And sometimes we can be just cantankerous
and blah blah blah blah blah,

00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:27.390
but we still go.

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:30.820
And I love to see women.

00:02:30.844 --> 00:02:32.956
You don't know what it does for me

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.448
to see women in the position
that you're in today.

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.913
I never thought I'd see that.

00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:41.278
I never thought I'd see women

00:02:41.302 --> 00:02:46.596
be able to take places
and positions that we have today.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.500
It is just a powerful thing.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.877
I had a young woman come to me.

00:02:51.328 --> 00:02:53.179
She was an African-American woman.

00:02:53.998 --> 00:02:56.085
And I said, "Well, what do you do, honey?"

00:02:56.824 --> 00:03:01.069
She said, "I am a retired Navy pilot."

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:04.571
Oh God, that just melted me,

00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:10.140
because I knew how hard it was
to integrate that Navy.

00:03:10.643 --> 00:03:16.291
You know, the Navy was the last thing
to really be integrated,

00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:20.542
and that was done by Franklin Roosevelt

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:25.090
as a favor to an African-American man,

00:03:25.114 --> 00:03:27.489
Lester Granger, that I knew very well.

00:03:27.513 --> 00:03:31.504
He was the head of the National
Urban League back there,

00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:33.807
and when Roosevelt asked him,

00:03:33.831 --> 00:03:39.086
he wanted to appoint Lester
as maybe one of his cabinet members.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.445
Lester said, "No, I don't want that.

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.794
All I want you to do
is integrate that Navy."

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:48.112
And that was what Franklin did.

00:03:48.136 --> 00:03:50.136
Well, Franklin didn't live to do it,

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.816
but Truman did it.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.438
But when this woman told me,

00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:57.621
"I have flown everything there is to fly,"

00:03:57.645 --> 00:04:01.238
bombers, just all kinds of planes,

00:04:01.262 --> 00:04:04.603
it just melted me, you know,

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:07.647
just to see how far women have come.

00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:08.913
And I told her, I said,

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:12.105
"Well, you could get
into the space program."

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.304
She said, "But Ms. Chase, I'm too old."

00:04:14.328 --> 00:04:16.804
She was already 60-some years old,

00:04:16.828 --> 00:04:19.828
and, you know, you're over the hill then.

00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:22.201
(Laughter)

00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:25.686
They don't want you flying
up in the sky at 60-something years old.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.962
Stay on the ground.

00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:30.312
When I meet women,

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.757
and today everybody comes to my kitchen,

00:04:32.781 --> 00:04:34.280
and you know that,

00:04:34.304 --> 00:04:36.511
and it upsets Stella, my daughter.

00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:38.811
She doesn't like people
coming in the kitchen.

00:04:38.835 --> 00:04:40.297
But that's where I am,

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:43.162
and that's where you're going
to see me, in the kitchen.

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:46.185
So when they come there,
I meet all kinds of people.

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:49.321
And that is the thing
that really uplifts me,

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:51.694
is when I meet women on the move.

00:04:52.463 --> 00:04:56.741
When I meet women on the move,
it is good for me.

00:04:56.765 --> 00:04:59.459
Now, I'm not one of these
flag-waving women.

00:04:59.483 --> 00:05:01.877
You're not going to see me
out there waving.

00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.924
No, I don't do that.

00:05:03.948 --> 00:05:04.956
(Laughter)

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.003
No, I don't do that, and I don't want
any of you to do that.

00:05:08.027 --> 00:05:09.758
Just be good women.

00:05:10.284 --> 00:05:12.721
And you know, my mother taught us ...

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.173
she was tough on us,

00:05:15.197 --> 00:05:16.880
and she said, "You know, Leah,"

00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:19.309
she gave us all this plaque,

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:23.381
"to be a good woman,
you have to first look like a girl."

00:05:23.405 --> 00:05:26.032
Well, I thought I looked like a girl.

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:27.577
"Act like a lady."

00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:29.168
That, I never learned to do.

00:05:29.192 --> 00:05:31.066
(Laughter)

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.051
"Think like a man."

00:05:33.075 --> 00:05:35.648
Now don't act like that man;
think like a man.

00:05:35.678 --> 00:05:37.128
And "work like a dog."

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.318
(Laughter)

00:05:39.342 --> 00:05:42.075
So we learned that the hard way.

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:43.986
And they taught you that.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.132
They taught you what women had to do.

00:05:47.156 --> 00:05:51.517
We were taught that women
controlled the behavior of men.

00:05:51.914 --> 00:05:54.421
How you act, they will act.

00:05:55.064 --> 00:05:58.255
So you've got to do that,
and I tell you all the time.

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:01.264
You know, don't play this man down.

00:06:01.288 --> 00:06:05.079
It upsets me when you may have a husband

00:06:05.103 --> 00:06:11.411
that maybe he doesn't have as much
education under his belt as you have,

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:14.514
but still you can't play him down.

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:17.237
You've got to keep lifting him up,

00:06:17.261 --> 00:06:19.561
because you don't want
to live with a mouse.

00:06:19.585 --> 00:06:23.787
So you want that man to be a man,
and do what he has to do.

00:06:24.478 --> 00:06:26.741
And anyway, always remember,

00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:28.789
he runs on cheap gas.

00:06:28.813 --> 00:06:31.119
(Laughter)

00:06:31.143 --> 00:06:33.558
So fill him up with cheap gas --

00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:35.454
(Laughter)

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:37.010
and then, you got him.

00:06:37.034 --> 00:06:38.371
It's just so --

00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:41.034
(Laughter)

00:06:41.058 --> 00:06:42.414
It's just --

00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:44.812
PM: You have to give us
a minute to take that in.

00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:47.392
(Laughter)

00:06:47.416 --> 00:06:51.409
LC: When I heard this young lady
speak before I came out --

00:06:51.433 --> 00:06:53.964
she was so beautiful,

00:06:53.988 --> 00:06:56.186
and I wished I could be like that,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.687
and my husband, poor darling --

00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:00.735
I lost him after
we were married 70 years --

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.636
didn't agree on one thing,

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.227
never did, nothing,

00:07:05.251 --> 00:07:06.672
but we got along together

00:07:06.696 --> 00:07:09.228
because he learned to understand me,

00:07:09.252 --> 00:07:11.363
and that was just hard,

00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:13.411
because he was so different.

00:07:13.435 --> 00:07:15.166
And that lady reminded me.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.948
I said, "If I would have
just been like her,

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:20.265
Dooky would have really loved it."

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:22.731
(Laughter)

00:07:22.755 --> 00:07:23.916
But I wasn't.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.813
I was always pushy, always moving,

00:07:25.837 --> 00:07:27.272
always doing this,

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:30.502
and he used to come to me
all the time, and he said,

00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:32.193
"Honey, God's going to punish you."

00:07:32.217 --> 00:07:33.766
(Laughter)

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.894
"You -- you're just not grateful."

00:07:35.918 --> 00:07:38.131
But it isn't that I'm not grateful,

00:07:38.155 --> 00:07:41.552
but I think, as long as you're living,
you've got to keep moving,

00:07:41.576 --> 00:07:43.420
you've got to keep trying to get up

00:07:43.444 --> 00:07:44.901
and do what you've got to do.

00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:45.926
(Applause)

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.124
You cannot sit down.

00:07:47.148 --> 00:07:49.052
You have to keep going,

00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:51.894
keep trying to do a little bit every day.

00:07:51.918 --> 00:07:53.620
Every day, you do a little bit,

00:07:53.644 --> 00:07:55.069
try to make it better.

00:07:55.093 --> 00:07:56.866
And that's been my whole life.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.354
Well, I came up
in the country, small town,

00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:02.744
had to do everything,
had to haul the water,

00:08:02.768 --> 00:08:05.306
had to wash the clothes, do this, do that,

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.996
pick the dumb strawberries,
all that kind of stuff.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.021
(Laughter)

00:08:09.045 --> 00:08:14.322
But still, my daddy insisted
that we act nice,

00:08:14.346 --> 00:08:15.762
we be kind.

00:08:15.786 --> 00:08:17.024
And that's all.

00:08:17.048 --> 00:08:18.614
When I heard this young woman --

00:08:18.638 --> 00:08:21.099
oh, she sounds so beautiful --

00:08:21.123 --> 00:08:23.901
I said, "I wish I could be like that."

00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:27.134
PM: Mrs. Chase, we don't want you
to be any different than you are.

00:08:27.158 --> 00:08:28.689
There is no question about that.

00:08:28.713 --> 00:08:30.337
Let me ask you.

00:08:30.361 --> 00:08:32.837
This is why it's so wonderful
to have a conversation

00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:34.941
with someone who has such a long view --

00:08:34.965 --> 00:08:36.116
LC: A long time.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.490
PM: to remembering Roosevelt

00:08:37.514 --> 00:08:39.318
and the person he did that favor for.

00:08:39.342 --> 00:08:42.272
What is in your head and your mind

00:08:42.296 --> 00:08:44.222
and what you have seen and witnessed ...

00:08:44.246 --> 00:08:49.629
One of the things that it's good
to remember, always,

00:08:49.653 --> 00:08:52.432
is that when you opened that restaurant,

00:08:52.456 --> 00:08:56.638
whites and blacks could not
eat together in this city.

00:08:57.041 --> 00:08:58.664
It was against the law.

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:02.839
And yet they did, at Dooky Chase.
Tell me about that.

00:09:02.863 --> 00:09:04.277
LC: They did, there.

00:09:04.301 --> 00:09:06.336
Well, my mother-in-law first started this,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.205
and the reason she started is,

00:09:08.229 --> 00:09:15.226
because her husband was sickly,
and he would go out --

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.313
and people from Chicago
and all the places,

00:09:19.337 --> 00:09:23.051
you would call his job a numbers runner.

00:09:23.931 --> 00:09:27.097
But in New Orleans,
we are very sophisticated --

00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:28.121
(Laughter)

00:09:28.145 --> 00:09:29.852
so it wasn't a numbers runner,

00:09:29.876 --> 00:09:31.932
it was a lottery vendor.

00:09:31.956 --> 00:09:33.630
(Laughter)

00:09:33.654 --> 00:09:35.663
So you see, we put class to that.

00:09:35.687 --> 00:09:36.933
But that's how he did it.

00:09:36.957 --> 00:09:41.999
And he couldn't go from house to house
to get his clients and all that,

00:09:42.023 --> 00:09:43.461
because he was sick,

00:09:43.485 --> 00:09:46.955
so she opened up
this little sandwich shop,

00:09:46.979 --> 00:09:49.875
so she was going to take down the numbers,

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:52.486
because he was sick a lot.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.371
He had ulcers. He was really bad
for a long a time.

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:57.731
So she did that --

00:09:57.755 --> 00:10:00.549
and not knowing anything,

00:10:00.573 --> 00:10:02.477
but she knew she could make a sandwich.

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:03.946
She knew she could cook,

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.779
and she borrowed 600 dollars
from a brewery.

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:12.749
Can you imagine starting
a business today with 600 dollars

00:10:12.773 --> 00:10:15.241
and no knowledge of what you're doing?

00:10:15.789 --> 00:10:19.975
And it always just amazed me
what she could do.

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:21.790
She was a good money manager.

00:10:21.814 --> 00:10:23.281
That, I am not.

00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:26.402
My husband used to call me
a bankrupt sister.

00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:27.863
(Laughter)

00:10:27.887 --> 00:10:29.523
"She'll spend everything you got."

00:10:29.547 --> 00:10:30.925
And I would, you know.

00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:33.059
PM: But you kept
the restaurant open, though,

00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:37.569
even in those times of controversy,
when people were protesting

00:10:37.593 --> 00:10:39.307
and almost boycotting.

00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:42.902
I mean, it was a controversial move
that you and your husband made.

00:10:42.926 --> 00:10:45.007
LC: It was, and I don't
know how we did it,

00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:48.911
but as I said, my mother-in-law
was a kind, kind person,

00:10:48.935 --> 00:10:53.748
and you didn't have any African-Americans
on the police force at that time.

00:10:53.772 --> 00:10:55.361
They were all white.

00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:57.235
But they would come around,

00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:58.828
and she would say,

00:10:58.852 --> 00:11:01.051
"Bebe, I'm gonna fix you
a little sandwich."

00:11:01.075 --> 00:11:03.812
So she would fix them a sandwich.

00:11:03.836 --> 00:11:05.831
Today they would call that bribery.

00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:07.935
(Laughter)

00:11:07.959 --> 00:11:10.623
But she was just that kind of person.

00:11:10.647 --> 00:11:12.246
She liked to do things for you.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.929
She liked to give.

00:11:13.953 --> 00:11:16.044
So she would do that,

00:11:16.068 --> 00:11:17.453
and maybe that helped us out,

00:11:17.477 --> 00:11:19.793
because nobody ever bothered us.

00:11:20.421 --> 00:11:24.311
We had Jim Dombrowski, Albert Ben Smith,

00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:29.292
who started all kinds of things
right in that restaurant,

00:11:29.316 --> 00:11:30.922
and nobody ever bothered us.

00:11:31.322 --> 00:11:32.956
So we just did it.

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.131
PM: Excuse me.

00:11:34.155 --> 00:11:36.238
You talked to me that day

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:40.507
about the fact that people considered
the restaurant a safe haven

00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:42.238
where they could come together,

00:11:42.262 --> 00:11:45.570
particularly if they were working
on civil rights,

00:11:45.594 --> 00:11:46.864
human rights,

00:11:46.888 --> 00:11:49.054
working to change the laws.

00:11:49.078 --> 00:11:52.833
LC: Well, because once
you got inside those doors,

00:11:52.857 --> 00:11:55.929
nobody ever, ever bothered you.

00:11:55.953 --> 00:11:58.221
The police would never come in

00:11:58.245 --> 00:12:00.761
and bother our customers, never.

00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:03.496
So they felt safe to come there.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.687
They could eat, they could plan.

00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:07.417
All the Freedom Riders,

00:12:07.441 --> 00:12:10.806
that's where they planned
all their meetings.

00:12:11.148 --> 00:12:14.336
They would come and we would
serve them a bowl of gumbo

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.519
and fried chicken.

00:12:15.543 --> 00:12:16.558
(Laughter)

00:12:16.582 --> 00:12:19.689
So I said, we'd changed
the course of America

00:12:19.713 --> 00:12:22.260
over a bowl of gumbo
and some fried chicken.

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:26.998
(Applause)

00:12:27.022 --> 00:12:30.029
I would like to invite the leaders, now,

00:12:30.053 --> 00:12:32.908
just come have a bowl of gumbo
and some fried chicken,

00:12:32.932 --> 00:12:35.726
talk it over and we'd go
and we'd do what we have to do.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:37.853
(Applause)

00:12:37.877 --> 00:12:39.287
And that's all we did.

00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:42.540
PM: Could we send you a list
to invite to lunch?

00:12:42.564 --> 00:12:43.657
(Laughter)

00:12:43.681 --> 00:12:44.897
LC: Yeah, invite.

00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:47.070
Because that's what we're not doing.

00:12:47.094 --> 00:12:48.946
We're not talking.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.186
Come together.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.567
I don't care if you're a Republican
or what you are -- come together.

00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:54.781
Talk.

00:12:54.805 --> 00:12:56.060
And I know those old guys.

00:12:56.084 --> 00:12:57.704
I was friends with those old guys,

00:12:57.728 --> 00:13:00.162
like Tip O'Neill and all of those people.

00:13:00.186 --> 00:13:03.233
They knew how to come together and talk,

00:13:03.257 --> 00:13:06.833
and you would disagree maybe.

00:13:06.857 --> 00:13:08.134
That's OK.

00:13:08.158 --> 00:13:11.138
But you would talk, and we would come
to a good thing and meet.

00:13:11.162 --> 00:13:14.017
And so that's what we did
in that restaurant.

00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:17.151
They would plan the meeting,

00:13:17.175 --> 00:13:20.254
Oretha's mother, Oretha Haley's mother.

00:13:20.278 --> 00:13:21.920
She was big in CORE.

00:13:21.944 --> 00:13:24.491
Her mother worked for me for 42 years.

00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:27.306
And she was like me.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.915
We didn't understand the program.

00:13:29.939 --> 00:13:33.597
Nobody our age understood this program,

00:13:33.621 --> 00:13:37.865
and we sure didn't want
our children to go to jail.

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:39.683
Oh, that was ... oh God.

00:13:39.707 --> 00:13:42.496
But these young people
were willing to go to jail

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.762
for what they believed.

00:13:43.786 --> 00:13:48.295
We were working with Thurgood
and A.P. Tureaud and all those people

00:13:48.319 --> 00:13:50.169
with the NAACP.

00:13:50.193 --> 00:13:52.172
But that was a slow move.

00:13:52.196 --> 00:13:55.759
We would still be out here trying
to get in the door, waiting for them.

00:13:55.783 --> 00:13:57.813
(Laughter)

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.252
PM: Is that Thurgood Marshall
you're talking about?

00:14:00.276 --> 00:14:02.382
LC: Thurgood Marshall.
But I loved Thurgood.

00:14:02.406 --> 00:14:03.892
He was a good movement.

00:14:03.916 --> 00:14:08.432
They wanted to do this
without offending anybody.

00:14:08.456 --> 00:14:10.209
I'll never forget A.P. Tureaud:

00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:12.128
"But you can't offend the white people.

00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:14.272
Don't offend them."

00:14:14.813 --> 00:14:16.678
But these young people didn't care.

00:14:16.702 --> 00:14:21.043
They said, "We're going.
Ready or not, we're going to do this."

00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:23.566
And so we had to support them.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.904
These were the children we knew,
righteous children.

00:14:26.928 --> 00:14:28.554
We had to help them.

00:14:28.578 --> 00:14:31.654
PM: And they brought the change.
LC: And they brought the change.

00:14:31.678 --> 00:14:33.574
You know, it was hard,

00:14:33.598 --> 00:14:36.757
but sometimes you do
hard things to make changes.

00:14:36.781 --> 00:14:39.312
PM: And you've seen
so many of those changes.

00:14:39.336 --> 00:14:41.145
The restaurant has been a bridge.

00:14:41.169 --> 00:14:45.623
You have been a bridge
between the past and now,

00:14:45.647 --> 00:14:48.131
but you don't live in the past, do you?

00:14:48.155 --> 00:14:51.164
You live very much in the present.

00:14:51.188 --> 00:14:54.389
LC: And that's what you have to tell
young people today.

00:14:54.413 --> 00:14:56.398
OK, you can protest,

00:14:56.422 --> 00:14:58.206
but put the past behind you.

00:14:58.601 --> 00:15:03.244
I can't make you responsible
for what your grandfather did.

00:15:03.268 --> 00:15:04.815
That's your grandfather.

00:15:04.839 --> 00:15:06.784
I have to build on that.

00:15:06.808 --> 00:15:08.062
I have to make changes.

00:15:08.086 --> 00:15:10.514
I can't stay there and say,

00:15:10.538 --> 00:15:12.537
"Oh, well, look what they did to us then.

00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:13.944
Look what they do to us now."

00:15:13.968 --> 00:15:15.655
No, you remember that,

00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:17.964
but that makes you keep going on,

00:15:17.988 --> 00:15:20.436
but you don't harp on it every day.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.624
You move,

00:15:21.648 --> 00:15:23.512
and you move to make a difference,

00:15:23.536 --> 00:15:27.334
and everybody should be involved.

00:15:27.358 --> 00:15:28.573
My children said,

00:15:28.597 --> 00:15:30.703
"Mother, don't get political," you know.

00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:32.718
(Laughter)

00:15:32.742 --> 00:15:35.798
"Don't get political, because you know
we don't like that."

00:15:35.822 --> 00:15:38.521
But you have to be political today.

00:15:38.545 --> 00:15:40.909
You have to be involved.

00:15:40.933 --> 00:15:42.713
Be a part of the system.

00:15:42.737 --> 00:15:46.031
Look how it was when we couldn't be
a part of the system.

00:15:46.055 --> 00:15:49.721
When Dutch Morial became the mayor,

00:15:49.745 --> 00:15:53.625
it was a different feeling
in the African-American community.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.864
We felt a part of things.

00:15:56.888 --> 00:15:58.398
Now we've got a mayor.

00:15:58.752 --> 00:16:00.982
We feel like we belong.

00:16:01.006 --> 00:16:04.287
Moon tried before Dutch came.

00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:06.326
PM: Mayor Landrieu's father,
Moon Landrieu.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.233
LC: Mayor Landrieu's father,
he took great, great risks

00:16:09.257 --> 00:16:13.461
by putting African-Americans in city hall.

00:16:13.485 --> 00:16:16.969
He took a whipping for that
for a long time,

00:16:16.993 --> 00:16:19.248
but he was a visionary,

00:16:19.272 --> 00:16:24.343
and he did those things that he knew
was going to help the city.

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:26.652
He knew we had to get involved.

00:16:26.676 --> 00:16:28.659
So that's what we have to do.

00:16:28.683 --> 00:16:29.965
We don't harp on that.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:31.573
We just keep moving,

00:16:31.597 --> 00:16:34.953
and Mitch, you know,
I tell Moon all the time,

00:16:34.977 --> 00:16:36.664
"You did a good thing,"

00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:40.505
but Mitch did one bigger than you
and better than you.

00:16:40.529 --> 00:16:42.257
When he pulled those statues down,

00:16:42.281 --> 00:16:43.704
I said, "Boy, you're crazy!"

00:16:43.728 --> 00:16:46.419
(Applause)

00:16:46.443 --> 00:16:47.964
You're crazy.

00:16:47.988 --> 00:16:51.982
But it was a good political move.

00:16:52.006 --> 00:16:54.978
You know, when I saw
P.T. Beauregard come down,

00:16:55.002 --> 00:16:58.026
I was sitting looking at the news,

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.617
and it just hit me
what this was all about.

00:17:02.527 --> 00:17:06.732
To me, it wasn't about race;
it was a political move.

00:17:07.639 --> 00:17:08.947
And I got so furious,

00:17:08.971 --> 00:17:11.027
I got back on that kitchen
the next morning,

00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:14.139
and I said, come on, pick up
your pants, and let's go to work,

00:17:14.163 --> 00:17:16.219
because you're going to get left behind.

00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:17.752
And that's what you have to do.

00:17:17.776 --> 00:17:19.506
You have to move on people,

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.268
move on what they do.

00:17:21.292 --> 00:17:24.707
It was going to bring
visibility to the city.

00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:28.648
So you got that visibility --
move on it, uplift yourself,

00:17:28.672 --> 00:17:30.306
do what you have to do,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.171
and do it well.

00:17:32.195 --> 00:17:33.437
And that's all we do.

00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:34.764
That's all I try to do.

00:17:34.788 --> 00:17:38.950
PM: But you just gave
the formula for resilience. Right?

00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:44.352
So you are clearly the best example
we could find anywhere of resilience,

00:17:44.376 --> 00:17:46.615
so there must be something you think --

00:17:46.639 --> 00:17:48.234
LC: I like emotional strength.

00:17:48.258 --> 00:17:52.057
I like people with emotional
and physical strength,

00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:54.723
and maybe that's bad for me.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:00.102
My favorite all-time general
was George Patton.

00:18:00.752 --> 00:18:02.936
You know, that wasn't too cool.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.204
(Laughter)

00:18:05.228 --> 00:18:06.420
PM: It's surprising.

00:18:06.444 --> 00:18:09.973
LC: I've got George Patton
hanging in my dining room

00:18:09.997 --> 00:18:12.459
because I want to remember.

00:18:12.483 --> 00:18:14.358
He set goals for himself,

00:18:14.382 --> 00:18:18.043
and he was going to set out
to reach those goals.

00:18:18.067 --> 00:18:19.730
He never stopped.

00:18:19.754 --> 00:18:22.051
And I always remember his words:

00:18:22.075 --> 00:18:24.670
"Lead, follow, or get out of the way."

00:18:25.203 --> 00:18:26.709
Now, I can't lead --

00:18:26.733 --> 00:18:27.875
(Applause)

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:29.681
I can't be a leader,

00:18:29.705 --> 00:18:31.760
but I can follow a good leader,

00:18:31.784 --> 00:18:34.102
but I am not getting out of the way.

00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:35.585
(Applause)

00:18:35.609 --> 00:18:38.022
But that's just what you have to do.

00:18:38.046 --> 00:18:40.462
(Applause)

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.563
If you can't lead --

00:18:42.587 --> 00:18:44.834
leaders need followers,

00:18:44.858 --> 00:18:49.868
so if I help you up there,
I'm going to ride on your coattails,

00:18:49.892 --> 00:18:52.742
and I can't count
the coattails I've ridden upon.

00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:54.344
(Laughter)

00:18:54.368 --> 00:18:56.018
Feed you good. You'll help me out.

00:18:56.042 --> 00:18:57.132
(Laughter)

00:18:57.156 --> 00:18:59.616
And that's what life is all about.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.679
Everybody can do something,

00:19:02.703 --> 00:19:05.000
but please get involved.

00:19:05.024 --> 00:19:06.206
Do something.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.745
The thing we have to do
in this city, in all cities --

00:19:10.769 --> 00:19:14.420
mommas have to start being mommas today.

00:19:14.988 --> 00:19:16.139
You know?

00:19:16.163 --> 00:19:18.167
They have to start understanding --

00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:20.692
when you bring this child in the world,

00:19:20.716 --> 00:19:22.492
you have to make a man out of it,

00:19:22.516 --> 00:19:24.566
you have to make a woman out of it,

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:26.003
and it takes some doing.

00:19:26.027 --> 00:19:27.965
It takes sacrifice.

00:19:27.989 --> 00:19:31.949
Maybe you won't have the long fingernails,
maybe you won't have the pretty hair.

00:19:32.419 --> 00:19:35.396
But that child will be on the move,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:36.944
and that's what you have to do.

00:19:36.968 --> 00:19:39.130
We have to concentrate on educating

00:19:39.154 --> 00:19:44.143
and making these children understand
what it's all about.

00:19:44.167 --> 00:19:46.263
And I hate to tell you, gentlemen,

00:19:46.287 --> 00:19:48.881
it's going to take
a good woman to do that.

00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:52.988
It's going to take
a good woman to do that.

00:19:53.012 --> 00:19:54.019
(Applause)

00:19:54.043 --> 00:19:55.853
Men can do their part.

00:19:55.877 --> 00:19:58.155
The other part is to just do
what you have to do

00:19:58.179 --> 00:19:59.352
and bring it home,

00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:01.067
but we can handle the rest,

00:20:01.091 --> 00:20:02.900
and we will handle the rest.

00:20:03.229 --> 00:20:05.357
If you're a good woman, you can do that.

00:20:05.381 --> 00:20:06.895
PM: You heard that first here.

00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:08.287
We can handle the rest.

00:20:08.311 --> 00:20:10.046
LC: We can handle the rest.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.054
Mrs. Chase, thank you so much --

00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:13.236
LC: Thank you.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.419
PM: for taking time out from the work
you do every day in this community.

00:20:17.443 --> 00:20:19.601
LC: But you don't know
what this does for me.

00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:22.307
When I see all of these people,
and come together --

00:20:22.331 --> 00:20:25.189
people come to my kitchen
from all over the world.

00:20:25.751 --> 00:20:28.282
I had people come from London,

00:20:28.306 --> 00:20:30.613
now twice this happened to me.

00:20:30.637 --> 00:20:34.653
First a man came, and I don't know
why he came to this --

00:20:34.677 --> 00:20:39.359
Every year, the chefs do something
called "Chef's Charity."

00:20:40.041 --> 00:20:44.732
Well, it so happened
I was the only woman there,

00:20:44.756 --> 00:20:47.276
and the only African-American there

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.195
on that stage doing these demonstrations,

00:20:50.219 --> 00:20:53.813
and I would not leave until I saw
another woman come up there, too.

00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:56.440
I'm not going up -- they're going
to carry me up there

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:58.312
until you bring another woman up here.

00:20:58.336 --> 00:21:00.066
(Laughter)

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:03.137
So they have another one now,
so I could step down.

00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:05.994
But this man was from London.

00:21:06.018 --> 00:21:08.939
So after that, I found the man
in my kitchen.

00:21:08.963 --> 00:21:10.838
He came to my kitchen,

00:21:10.862 --> 00:21:13.148
and he said, "I want
to ask you one question."

00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:16.274
OK, I thought I was going to ask
something about food.

00:21:16.298 --> 00:21:20.314
"Why do all these white men
hang around you?"

00:21:20.338 --> 00:21:22.457
(Laughter)

00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:23.632
What?

00:21:23.656 --> 00:21:25.457
(Laughter)

00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:27.084
I couldn't understand.

00:21:27.108 --> 00:21:29.132
He couldn't understand that.

00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:30.942
I said, "We work together.

00:21:30.966 --> 00:21:33.545
This is the way we live in this city.

00:21:33.569 --> 00:21:36.616
I may never go to your house,
you may never come to my house.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.274
But when it comes to working,

00:21:38.298 --> 00:21:41.059
like raising money
for this special school,

00:21:41.083 --> 00:21:42.893
we come together.

00:21:42.917 --> 00:21:44.195
That's what we do.

00:21:44.219 --> 00:21:47.187
And still here comes another, a woman,

00:21:47.211 --> 00:21:48.790
elegantly dressed,

00:21:48.814 --> 00:21:51.181
about a month ago in my kitchen.

00:21:51.829 --> 00:21:55.718
She said, "I don't understand
what I see in your dining room."

00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:57.936
I said, "What do you see?"

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.711
She saw whites and blacks together.

00:22:00.735 --> 00:22:02.300
That's what we do.

00:22:02.324 --> 00:22:04.046
We meet. We talk.

00:22:04.571 --> 00:22:06.277
And we work together,

00:22:06.301 --> 00:22:08.195
and that's what we have to do.

00:22:08.219 --> 00:22:11.933
You don't have to be my best friend
to work to better your city,

00:22:11.957 --> 00:22:13.638
to better your country.

00:22:13.662 --> 00:22:17.630
We just have to come together and work,
and that's what we do in this city.

00:22:17.654 --> 00:22:19.852
We're a weird bunch down here.

00:22:19.876 --> 00:22:21.098
(Laughter)

00:22:21.122 --> 00:22:23.479
Nobody understands us,

00:22:23.503 --> 00:22:25.090
but we feed you well.

00:22:25.114 --> 00:22:27.361
(Laughter)

00:22:27.385 --> 00:22:31.757
(Applause)

00:22:31.781 --> 00:22:32.793
(Cheering)

00:22:32.817 --> 00:22:33.980
Thank you.

00:22:34.004 --> 00:22:39.404
(Applause)
