00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
Hi! I'm John Green. Welcome to Crash Course
Literature. Today we're going to talk about

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.190
Oedipus. Leo Tolstoy once famously wrote that
"All happy families are alike, but each unhappy

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.900
family is unhappy in its own way." And I certainly
hope that there's no family as unhappy as Oedipus's.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.340
Ancient Greek playwrights really specialized
in the dysfunctional family. I mean, they

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:25.069
had plays about wives killing husbands, parents
killing children, children killing parents,

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.329
siblings killing each other, and they also
wrote tragedies. But it's hard to imagine

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:33.280
a more tragic, dysfunctional family than the
Theban clan that Sophocles writes about in

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.489
Oedipus the King. I mean, except for the Kardashians.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.049
John from the Past: Mr. Green, Mr. Green!
Who are the Kardashians? That sounds exotic!

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:40.420
Is it something from Star Wars?

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.800
Oh yeah, Me from the Past! You don't know
about the Kardashians. Right now, to you,

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.589
the only Kardashian you know is OJ Simpson's
defense attorney.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.530
Anyway, don't worry about it. Just imagine
a green light on the other side of the bay

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.120
that represents the glory you'll never reach.
That's the Kardashians!

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.900
[Theme Music]

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.200
Okay, so Oedipus is King of Thebes, having
solved the riddle of the Sphinx and saved

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.420
the city from destruction. But now a plague
is devastating Thebes, and various oracles

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.490
and bird entrails suggest it's because the
murderer of the old king, Laius, still lives

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.760
there unpunished. Oedipus decides to investigate
the murder, only to discover that -- mind blown --

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.500
HE is the one who killed Laius and
married his queen, Jocasta. THEN he finds

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.170
out that Laius was actually his father, and
Jocasta is his mother, so he's had four children

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.930
with his mom, fulfilling an earlier prophecy,
because bird entrails are never wrong.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.640
It's the old "Accidentally Kill Your Father, Accidentally
Marry Your Mother" plot. It goes way back.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.950
Freud can tell you a lot about it in Crash
Course Psychology.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.649
Anyway, Jocasta hangs herself and Oedipus
gauges out his own eyes with her jewelery,

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.539
then goes into exile. In subsequent plays,
his two sons murder each other and one of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.469
his daughters commits suicide. So... You know,
it could have gone better.

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.590
So for a little context, theater was a really
big deal to the Greeks. I mean, if you were

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.149
a male citizen -- not a woman, not a slave
-- attending it was your civic duty. It was

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.520
sort of like voting, except that it began
with ritual animal sacrifice, so it was really

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.980
nothing like voting. But this civic duty aspect
is interesting, because a lot of the plays

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.600
ask really troubling questions about power
and control and the wisdom of rulers. Like,

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.200
playwrights masked their commentary by setting
plays in earlier, mythic eras or in foreign

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.140
lands, just like Shakespeare did. But they
were quite provocative then, and what's most

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.130
important is that the best of them are still
interesting now.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.560
Three playwrights would each present four
plays: a cycle of three related tragedies,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.840
and then a satyr play, which would be funny and would
often involve enormous phalluses and/or poop jokes.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.780
Citizens would watch play after play while
judges would determine a winner. So it was

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.120
kind of like Sundance or Cannes, but again,
with the ritual animal sacrifice, and there

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.290
was no multi-million dollar theatrical distribution
deals. You know, but there was glory.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.240
Unfortunately, we only have a small portion
of these plays today -- many were lost over

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.960
the millennia, including some that were destroyed
at the burning of the Library of Alexandria.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.320
In Sophocles' day, the cast was made of three
male actors, some of whom took on multiple

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.980
roles, and also a chorus. Playwrights were
typically the director, the composer, the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.970
set designer, and often also the lead actor,
although apparently, Sophocles did not appear

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.290
in his plays because he was, I guess, a terrible
actor.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.200
But the choruses were drawn from the Athenian
citizenry, and generally served as like, stand

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.910
ins for the audience, asserting conventional
wisdom and asking the questions that a typical

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.300
audience member might. The actors wore masks
that were made of linen and hairs, as well

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.480
as enormous robes and platform sandals so you could still see them, even if you were in the cheap seats.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.900
So Sophocles lived throughout nearly all of
the fifth century B.C.E, and he wrote 123 plays.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.800
We have seven. Who knows what kind of
crazy stuff people got up to in the other ones.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.120
The first person to offer literary criticism
of Greek drama was my old nemesis, Aristotle,

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.790
whom you'll remember was wrong about everything.
This was a guy who believed that people were

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.520
naturally born to slavery. Except, he was
actually kind of right about a lot of theatre

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.080
stuff. It pains me to say this, because I
do genuinely despise him, but Aristotle had

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.290
a lot of interesting ideas about story. For
instance, he noticed that in a lot of stories,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.200
the main character has a recognition and a
reversal. He's also responsible for a lot

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.599
of classical ideas about tragedy and comedy,
and Oedipus fits his definition of tragedy

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.479
very well -- probably because it was his favorite
play.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.680
Aristotle defines tragedy as, quote, "An imitation
of an action that is serious, complete, and

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.490
of a certain magnitude." Tragedy is also meant
to evoke both pity and fear. I mean, when

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.450
Oedipus returns at the play's end wearing
a new mask that shows his gouged out eyes,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.770
you feel bad for him; you also feel afraid.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.200
But here's the tricky part. Aristotle wrote
that tragedy should afflict a mostly good

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.219
character who makes a big mistake. I mean,
it can't be about a bad character, because

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.050
then you don't feel any pity. And it can't
be about a perfect character who does everything

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.480
right and still suffers a tragic end, because: one,
that wouldn't be very satisfying; and two, it would

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.220
imply that the universe doesn't reward goodness
and punish evil, which is kind of a terrifying thought.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.200
So instead, it has to be about a good guy
afflicted with a hamartia, or a ha-marsha,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.620
depending on how pretentious you are. This
word is sometimes mistranslated, including

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.189
by the protagonist of my novel, The Fault
in Our Stars -- available in book stores everywhere

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:24.330
-- as a tragic flaw. But actually, it's a
term from archery that means you aim for the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.930
bulls eye, but you miss. Now, I would argue
that in the twenty-five hundred years since

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.289
Oedipus, there have been some very good tragedies
that evoke fear and pity without the argument

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.520
that the universe is interested in the lives of individuals,
but you know, this is the classical definition.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.030
So could Oedipus really... Uh oh, my desk
disappeared. That means it's time for the

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.930
open letter. Hey there, Chewbacca.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.590
An open letter to the tragic hero, a type
of character, of course, exemplified by Chewbacca.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.210
He was a wookie. He was strong. He was loyal.
He was a great man, or at least, a great wookie.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.540
But it was his loyalty, a desirable trait, that also,
ultimately, made him kind of a complicated hero.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.419
I mean, Chewbacca made a blood oath to Han
Solo, so if you mess with Han Solo, Chewbacca's

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.080
gonna rip your arms off. And for those of
you who know the Star Wars universe outside

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.779
the movies, you already know that eventually,
that does prove tragic. Chewbacca, you're

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:20.899
a hero, but it's your heroism that also was
ultimately your undoing. Best wishes, John Green.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.159
So, is Oedipus a good character, and does he make a
great mistake? Well, let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:30.289
So, at the beginning of the play, Oedipus
definitely seems like an A++ king, I mean,

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:35.379
the priest calls him "the first of men in
all the chances of this life." When the priest

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:39.259
comes to tell him about the suffering in the
city, Oedipus says he knows about it already:

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.979
"I have known the story before you told it."

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.840
Oedipus is already worried about what's happening
to his people -- in fact, he's dispatched

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:50.640
his brother-in-law, Creon, to visit an oracle
and find out the source of the pestilence.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.660
And let's not forget that Oedipus has already
saved the city once by answering the riddle

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.449
of the Sphinx; the Sphinx had the body of
a woman, the wings of an eagle, and a really

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.600
bad temper. She had the habit of killing everyone who
answered her riddle incorrectly. So, I mean, you know,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.880
it takes a measure of courage to try to answer the
riddle. He's a good guy; he's a great king, right? Meh.

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:12.460
I mean, when Creon gives answers that Oedipus
doesn't like, Oedipus accuses him of plotting

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.159
against him. He also has some harsh words
for the blind seer, Tiresias, when Tiresias

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:20.849
correctly names Oedipus as the source of the
contagion. When the shepherd is brought to

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.300
Oedipus and resists revealing the truth of
Oedipus' birth, because he knows it will upset

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.669
the king, Oedipus threatens the man with torture.

00:07:27.669 --> 00:07:32.189
Then there's the ambiguity of missing the
mark. I mean, what was Oedipus' error in this

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:36.169
play? Was it killing Laius at the crossroads?
I mean, that's maybe a little bit aggressive,

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:40.419
but Sophocles makes it pretty clear that Laius
had some chariot-era road rage, and Oedipus

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:44.689
was acting in self-defense. Was it sleeping
with Jocasta? Well, that's pretty icky, but

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:49.439
again, not really a choice. She was presented
to him along with the kingdom when he defeated

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:53.819
the Sphinx, and as we've said, he treats other
characters pretty shabbily, but those are

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:58.699
small mistakes, rather than great ones. Maybe
his mistake is believing he can outrun or

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:03.089
escape his own fate, but if you were told
you were gonna murder your father and marry

00:08:03.089 --> 00:08:05.320
your mother, wouldn't you try to escape it?

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.960
Now, maybe you're thinking, "Well if I heard
a prophecy that I was going to be a father-killer

00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:14.719
and a mother-- I would, you know, avoid fights
with older men and sex with older women."

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:19.430
And fair enough, but remember, Laius and Jocasta
had attempted to kill Oedipus -- they received

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:24.229
a prophecy about this, too, so Oedipus was
brought up by the king and queen of Corinth,

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:28.309
who he assumed were his parents. How is it
a mistake to stay very far away from your

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:33.140
parents and in the process, save the city
of Thebes? And if you can't outrun your fate,

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.150
how is your fate a result of your flaws?

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:40.070
So the play depends a lot on ironies. The
guy who seem the smartest is actually the

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:45.030
most ignorant; the man who saved Thebes is
actually the one destroying it; enlightenment

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.190
leads to literal blindness... But that, combined
with the aforementioned ambiguity, is a lot

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.880
of what's made the play so enjoyable to so
many generations of people. We, in the audience,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.240
are aware of all these ironies in a way that
no one on stage is -- at least until the very end.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.580
Remember how Oedipus says, "I have known the
story before you told it"? Well, just about

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.160
everyone in the audience also knows the story
before it's told.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.000
I mean, you probably knew the outlines of
this story before you actually read the play, right?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.580
The gap between what we know in the
audience and what the characters know on stage

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.030
makes us uncomfortable and scared for them,
and it ratchets up the tension.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.380
Oedipus is a detective story where it turns
out, the detective is the murderer, and the

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.530
detective doesn't know it, but the reader
does, so with each new scene, with each new

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.340
clue, the net draws more and more tightly
around Oedipus. Every time a messenger comes

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:39.000
with supposedly good news: "Hey, the King
of Corinth is dead," "Hey, the King of Corinth

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.100
wasn't your father," Oedipus is lead closer
to the truth of his own guilt.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.500
And at several points, Jocasta tries to persuade
Oedipus not to inquire further, but Oedipus

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:52.530
can't help himself. He wants to know the whole
story. For me, at least, that's what's admirable

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.800
about him, and also what's pitiable.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.930
The play asks whether knowing is a good thing.
I mean, Tiresias says: "Alas, how terrible

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:05.440
is wisdom when it brings no profit to the
man that's wise." And Oedipus, at least, personally,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.660
probably would have been happier living in
ignorance, although, then, the plague would

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.410
have continued to devastate Thebes.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.740
So I think the play ultimately suggests that
even though ignorance can be bliss, Oedipus'

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:20.740
search for truth is right and just and brave
and uncompromising, and that's what makes

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:26.530
him great. It's also what ruins his life,
as the critic E.R. Dodds says, "What causes

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:32.270
his ruin is his strength and courage, his
loyalty to Thebes and his loyalty to the truth."

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:37.680
And so, finally, thankfully, I do find myself
disagreeing with Aristotle, because I don't

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:42.610
think that Oedipus was a great man ruined
by a great error. I think the story is more

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:47.820
complicated than that. So, could Oedipus ever
really have escaped his fate? Probably not.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:54.500
I mean, there are occasional examples in Greek myth of gods softening of fate or finding a loophole, but those are rare.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:57.940
So when you read Oedipus, you realize there
are actually two stories: one is about what's

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.730
already happened, and one is about what's
happening now. It's the second one that interests

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:08.020
Sophocles, like, killing the father and marrying
the mother -- that stuff happens in the past,

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.760
offstage. Sophocles concentrates on the choices
that Oedipus freely makes to find the source

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.220
of the plague, even when it means implicating
himself to gouge out his eyes so that he won't

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.360
have to look at his parents in the underworld.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:23.580
So Oedipus can't escape his fate, but he does
have a measure of free will, he does make

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.330
some choices. What's interesting to Sophocles
isn't so much the fulfillment of the prophecy

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.790
as HOW it is fulfilled, and how that affects
the present.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.380
As the critic A.W. Gomme put it, "The gods
know what the final score of the football

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.790
game will be, but we still have to play it."
Ultimately, the victory, Gomme says, "will

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.980
depend on the skill, the determination, the
fitness of the players, and a little on luck."

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.910
Instead of using the play to stage some sort
of fate versus free will debate, Sophocles

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:54.020
is interested in asking questions of both
fate AND free will. I mean, when we see Oedipus,

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.570
we should ask ourselves, "How much control
do we have over our lives? How much do we

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.560
owe to genetics, to privilege, to upbringing,
to accident, to the choices that we do or

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.250
don't make?" And those are relevant questions
today.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.020
Now, of course, not everyone thought that
was the most interesting part of the play.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.240
Like, Sigmund Freud decided that the reason
the play was so successful is because everyone

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.600
suffers from a so-called "Oedipus Complex."
Freud described this in the Interpretation

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:23.850
of Dreams as "the fate to direct our first
sexual impulse and our first hatred and our

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:29.130
first murderous thought against our father."
But, for the record, Oedipus does not have

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:34.250
an Oedipus Complex. His tragedy is about a
man who deliberately tries to avoid killing

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:39.200
his father and impregnating his mother, not
about a man who secretly wants to.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:43.760
But ultimately, what makes Oedipus such a
great play is that it stands up to many readings,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.980
and can inform our lives in many ways. I mean,
is he a great man? Does he make a great mistake?

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:54.400
Does he suffer his fate because of personal
flaws or because of the nature of the universe?

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.140
Those are big, interesting questions, and
it's nice to know that people have been asking

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:02.570
them for millennia. Thanks for watching, I'll
see you next week.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.300
