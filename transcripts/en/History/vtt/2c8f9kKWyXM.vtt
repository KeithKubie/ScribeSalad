00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.170
Where is it at?

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.070
- Right there!
- Hey.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.070
Ay ya ya--
- Ooh, he's pretty.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.470
A red snake.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.800
Boy, that make a good hat band.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.630
Say your prayers.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.900
NARRATOR: A tried and true
tradition in the swamp

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.930
is looking good.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.500
What you gonna
do with that skin?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.930
That looks like-- you
don't want me to tell

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.270
you what that looks like.
[laughing]

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.100
NARRATOR: And for Shelby,
the swamp is a one-stop shop.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.970
That's gonna be
a good one, man.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.330
How's it look?
- Hey, that's pretty.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.830
Look, you put it to
make 'em fit your head.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.330
You wear 'em like
that till they dry.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.830
I thought you was gonna drag
me out here for bull-bull-[bleep

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.900
but it ain't
turning out too bad.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.330
NARRATOR: Now, the
swamp don't just

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.730
provide fashion accessories.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.070
It's got everything you need
for the medicine cabinet too.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.830
You see this?

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.830
It's a medici-mal mushroom.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.700
It means medicine.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.200
NARRATOR: But to get
the very best stuff--

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.600
[yelling]

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.730
NARRATOR: Sometimes you gotta
be crazy enough to go toe-to-toe

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.370
with slithering creatures.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.270
And crazy is a swamp
man's specialty.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.100
Some scientists in New Orleans
looking for some snake venom

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.500
to help people
when they get bit.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.470
Oh!
Oh!

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.170
I'mma catch some
snakes and sell 'em.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.700
Get me some snake money.
What you got?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.870
What is that?
- Some little pincers and a bag.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.170
Oh, it's that thing
to pick up trash.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.870
Yeah.
I'm not gonna touch them snakes.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.170
SHELBY: I'll touch 'em.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.030
NARRATOR: Now, Shelby
and his pal Doug

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.600
have been running the swamp
since they was itty-bitty.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600
- Man, I can't believe you.
- I can't wait, man.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.000
I like catching [bleep] snakes.
- Do you?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.030
Damn right, man.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.970
Man.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.100
NARRATOR: And they
know where they

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.330
can find a hissing pot of gold.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.330
SHELBY: Hold on.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.830
NARRATOR: If they can get there.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.770
SHELBY: Are you all right?

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.400
DOUG: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.170
Just be careful and watch
them big cottonmouths.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.700
DOUG: I'm a little worried
about this, Shelby.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.430
You gonna be all right, man.
I told you.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.700
If it's your time to
die, you gonna die.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.370
Look, look, look!

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.730
We can get the money now!

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.000
Aw man!
- Watch him!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.070
Watch him!

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.570
Did you feel him bite you?

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.030
I've been bit a hell
of a lot of times, man.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.500
I'm damn near immune
to snake venom.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.530
Look!
There, ha!

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.730
Here comes another one!

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.100
[laughing]

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.430
Got another one, Dougie.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.300
[yelling]

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.470
- He got you, didn't he?
- Yeah.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.200
It wasn't bad, though.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.130
Bit the hair off my leg.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.800
Don't be fooling
with no snakes--

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.870
especially kids.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.900
'Cause they will kill
you, sometimes they

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.000
have to cut your fingers
off, cut your arm off.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.870
Here we go!

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.170
Look, look, look, look.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.030
I see a damn rattlesnake
in the damn grass.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.970
That son of a bitch will bite
the [bleep] out of you, man.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.270
He ain't got no venom
in him, but he'll

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.070
bite the piss out you.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.430
DOUG: Watch him!
Watch him!

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.570
NARRATOR: Now, in the swamp
there's a traditional way

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.730
of taking care of a snake.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.930
DOUG: What are you doing?

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.130
NARRATOR: And then-- well,
there's the Shelby way.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.470
His head just come off.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.930
That is crazy!

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.900
[laughing]

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.200
Never seen someone do that.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.900
Damn snake-- look at it!
[gunshot]

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.230
Oh my.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.070
NARRATOR: Now, Shelby don't
always go to such extremes.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.730
There he is!
You got him.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.600
We got him that time!

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.470
Look out!

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.770
Hey, hey, oh, whoa!

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.430
NARRATOR: Sometimes he uses
a lighter touch to keep

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.800
them snakes from a-biting him.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.900
Get him off of me.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.200
Snake bit son of a gun.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.000
Gonna bring him home.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.770
Let's eat it, man.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.770
Come on, bring him with us.
