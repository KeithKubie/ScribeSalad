[music playing]

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:04.421
We're here at Speed Week
at the Bonneville Salt Flats

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:05.880
to check out Turbinator
Streamliner we just finished

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.799
painting after it
got smashed last year

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.176
trying to break the record.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.469
We've been walking
around the flats

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.138
checking out some
sick ass cars trying

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:14.639
to break all kinds of records.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.143
But now it's Turbinator's
turn with our paint job.

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:20.520
I still have not seen this
thing put back together,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.523
and I'm dying to
see it finished.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:28.153
Man, I hope it's just not so
fast that we don't even see it.

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:29.738
RYAN: No, this one,
there they're just

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.322
testing it and feeling it out.

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:33.950
So I don't know what speed
they're going for they're

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.326
just shaking it down early.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.327
MAN: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.290
RYAN: That's it.
That's it.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.124
MAN: Oh, my god.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.213
RYAN: Holy cow.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.215
Look at that thing.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:49.841
MAN: Holy smokes.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.058
RYAN: Moving, look at that.

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.435
MAN: Holy crap, man.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:10.028
RYAN: He's still going.
He hasn't pulled the shoots yet.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:10.612
MAN: Uh-uh.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.243
Amazing.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.495
RYAN: It was so smooth.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:19.871
MAN: Right.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.247
I got to find out how
fast that was, dude.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.415
That was crazy.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:23.917
That sounds like
a plane taking

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:27.378
off, like a jet because it
sounds so far behind it.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:28.671
Yeah.

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.423
Man, that was awesome.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:33.176
I've seen plenty of cars race
before, but nothing like this.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.179
Watching Turbinator go down the
salt flats with our paint job

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.598
on it, man, that makes
me feel really good.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.100
I can't wait to see
this thing up close.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.435
It was unreal.

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:44.646
Hey, look who's here, huh?
RYAN: Rick?

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:45.939
All right.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.357
And Eric, this is
the first time I've

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.108
seen it all put back together.

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:53.530
This thing is so sleek.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.907
When I set out to get
this terminator painted,

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.076
I had two goals
in mind, to stick

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.495
to Team Vesco's
all-American theme,

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.455
and to make it look fast.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.833
I wanted the main colors
to be red, white, and blue,

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.669
but I added a strip of yellow
as well for the Team Vesco

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:09.963
colors, which really
makes it stand

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.422
out against the salt flats.

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:13.466
The main graphic had
to be a bald eagle.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.094
But to avoid making it look
like a slow mail truck,

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:18.680
I had to put my own
speedy spin on it.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.849
So I had Mike work
some mechanical magic.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.394
And now this bird is badass, and
ready to soar through the wind,

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.271
and hopefully take
the Turbinator

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.898
to 500 miles an hour.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.484
Everything you did here on
the side, all that airbrushing.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.861
Yeah.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.320
All this was in theory,
because the car was

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.197
up here while I'm painting it.
- Yeah.

00:02:36.197 --> 00:02:37.949
I had no idea that
it would all really

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.325
work once it was on the ground.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.577
And it really does.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:43.663
I had no idea this
wing was that low.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.374
I think it's six feet longer
than it was in the shop.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:49.002
Yeah, 36 feet is a
little tough to work on.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:51.337
This is the smoothest paint
job we've ever had on it.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:52.714
And it's an eye-catcher.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.299
Everybody loves the
Betsy Ross stitching.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.508
RYAN: Oh, the stitching?

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.301
MAN: The stitching.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.260
Yeah, that's cool.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.094
RYAN: All in the details.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.721
It looks fast.

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:02.348
I hope we can make the car
go as fast as the paint job.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.391
That's the trick, you know?

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.059
So, guys, what is the record?

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:09.981
We have the world wheel-driven
International Record, 458.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.817
The national record at 427.

00:03:12.817 --> 00:03:14.944
We've redesigned
this one to go 500.

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:15.987
That's the whole goal.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.739
It's going to be a challenge.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.783
There's about 11 cars that have
the capabilities of going 500.

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:23.328
So it's going to be an
interesting situation.

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:26.289
We call this
project first to 500.

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:27.624
First to 500.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:28.958
My money is on us.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.335
I didn't realize there
are that many cars

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:31.502
out here going for that record.

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:33.338
One guy says his car gets 550.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:35.256
He's just jumping way up there.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.466
Yeah, he is.

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.217
But he could do it.

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:40.428
Man, Rick, I thank you so much
for giving us this opportunity.

00:03:40.428 --> 00:03:42.764
This is the biggest
feather in my hat so far.

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.223
This is great.
Thank you.

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:45.892
You bet.
- Yeah.

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:47.185
All right, thank you.

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.354
Let's get this baby
on the racetrack.

00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:53.149
After years of being a fan
and reading about Bonneville,

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.235
it's like a dream
to actually be here.

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.279
The Turbinator looked
crazy out there.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:03:59.864
And I'm so proud of our team.

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:03.743
The paint job looked absolutely
stunning on the track.

00:04:03.743 --> 00:04:05.161
We've got to get
back to the shop.

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:07.038
And I can't wait to tell
the guys how she ran.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.748
And I tell you
what, every time she

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:12.710
goes after that 500 mile an
hour record, I'll be watching.
