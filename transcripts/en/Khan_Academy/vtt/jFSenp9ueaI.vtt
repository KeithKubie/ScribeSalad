00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.736
We're asked, how many inches
are in 4 and 1/2 yards?

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:05.110
And we'll do it
a couple of ways.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:06.830
One, we could just say how
many inches are in 4 yards

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.621
and how many inches
are in a 1/2 of a yard?

00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:10.910
And this really
4 plus 1/2 yards.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.170
Or we could convert this
into an improper fraction

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.159
first and then convert.

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.700
But before I even
do that, let's just

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.040
think about how many
inches there are in a yard.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.106
So if I have 1 yard,
we know that there

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:30.020
are 3 feet for
every 1 yard, Right?

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.865
And when you say, why am
I multiplying by 3 instead

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.802
of saying there's 1
yard for every 3 feet?

00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:36.760
And the easiest way to
think about it is you're

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.250
going to have a larger
value over here,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.340
and you're also going to want
to have these units right

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.230
over here cancel out.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.610
So yard is canceling
out with yard.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.817
So you have 1 yard is
equal to 3 feet, which

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.150
is kind of what we already knew.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.370
I'm just showing you how
the dimensions cancel out.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.340
And how many inches
are there per foot?

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.980
Well, we know that there are
12 inches for every 1 foot.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.830
And same logic over here,
inches is a smaller unit

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.574
of measurement so it makes sense
that we're multiplying by 12.

00:01:10.574 --> 00:01:11.990
3 feet is going
to be more inches,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.970
so we're multiplying by 12.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.610
And also these
units cancel out--

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.970
foot in the numerator,
foot in the denominator.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.602
3 times 12 divided by 1
is equal to 36 inches.

00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:24.060
So you might have
already known it.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.143
But this is nice to have
the dimensions cancel out

00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:26.920
like this.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.970
We know that 1 yard
is equal to 36 inches.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.990
Or there are 36 inches
for every 1 yard.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.540
And so we can now
either break this down,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.610
or we can turn this into
an improper fraction.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.670
First I'll just break it down
into 4 yards plus 1/2 yards.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.790
So we could say that
this is 4 yards.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.650
So 4 yards is going
to be equal to-- well,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.030
let's just multiply
it times 36 inches,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.140
36 inches for every 1 yard.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.660
The yards cancel out.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.910
4 times 36 is 120,
plus 24, so that's 144.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.720
So this is equal to 144 inches.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.690
That's just the 4 yards.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.110
And then if we do the 1/2
yards, so 1/2 of a-- I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.410
guess I say 1/2
yard, once again,

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.850
times 36 inches per yard,
the yards cancel out.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.800
1/2 times 36 is going to
be equal to 18 inches.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.510
So 4 and 1/2 yards
is the same thing

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.620
as 4 yards plus 1/2 yards, which
is the same thing as 144 inches

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.960
plus 18 inches, which is
going to give us-- let's just

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.700
add it up over
here on the right,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.770
144 plus 18.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.240
4 plus 8 is 12.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.790
4 plus 1 is 5.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.110
You have this 1 up here, so
it's 6, and then we have a 1.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.072
So when you add them all
together, you get 162 inches.

00:02:59.072 --> 00:03:00.530
The other way to
do this would have

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.680
been to convert this
into an improper fraction

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.980
and then multiply by the unit.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.520
So let's do it that way.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.130
If I have 4 and 1/2 of
anything, really-- so

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.580
let me write 4 and 1/2.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.410
I'm trying to find
a suitable color.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.460
So if I have 4 and 1/2,
this is the same thing--

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.362
4 is the same thing as 8/2.

00:03:18.362 --> 00:03:20.570
This is the same thing-- so
let me write it this way.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.250
4 and 1/2 is the same
thing as 4 plus 1/2,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.930
which is the same
thing as-- if we

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.030
want to have the same
denominator as this 2

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.420
over here or as
this 1/2 over here,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.980
this is the same thing as 8/2.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.700
Or you could say 4/1 is
the same thing as 8/2,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.180
if we want to have a common
denominator, so 8/2 plus 1/2.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.430
Actually, let me write it
that way, just so you really

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.000
understand what we're doing.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.680
4 is the same thing as 4/1.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.750
So it's 4/1 plus 1/2.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.700
If we want to find a
common denominator, it's 2.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.870
So 4/1 is the same
thing as 8/2 plus 1/2,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.190
which is equal to 9/2.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.090
Now, I did it this way,
which takes longer,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.310
just so you really understand
how we converted it,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.680
why it makes-- hopefully
conceptually why it just makes

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.100
intuitive sense, why 4 and
1/2 is the same thing as 9/2.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.810
But if you want a
simple process for it,

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.975
you could just say,
look, 4 times 2 is 8.

00:04:13.975 --> 00:04:15.700
8 plus 1 is 9.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.480
And that gives you that 9
right over there, so 9/2.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.725
So we have 9/2 yards that we
want to convert to inches.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.610
Same process-- times
36 inches per yard.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.760
Yard in the numerator,
yard in the denominator.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.400
We are left with 9/2 times 36.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.070
We could say times 36/1 if we
like, 36 Inches for every 1

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.060
yard.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.470
36-- or the number 36
really is the same as 36/1.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.420
And then we're left with
just inches in our units.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.980
We're just left with inches.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.780
And over here there's several
ways that we can simplify it.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.100
Probably the easiest
way to simplify it is we

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.694
can divide both our numerator
and our denominator by 2.

00:05:03.694 --> 00:05:04.860
So let me write it this way.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.985
I don't want to skip steps.

00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:11.645
So we have 9 times 36 over
2 times 1, or over 2 inches.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:13.770
And we can divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.880
by 2 to simplify it.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.446
They're both divisible by 2.

00:05:18.446 --> 00:05:20.620
36 divided by 2 is 18.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.500
2 divided by 2 is 1.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.310
So we're really just left
with 9 times 18 inches.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.830
We can just multiply 9 times 18.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.360
Let me do it over here.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.990
18 times 9.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.430
8 times 9 is 72.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:41.620
1 times 9 is 9, plus 7 is
16, so we get 162 inches.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.940
So all of this simplifies to
162 inches, and we are done.
