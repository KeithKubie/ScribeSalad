00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:02.190
- [Narrator] In this video,
we are going to give ourselves

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.607
an overview of ancient Egypt,

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:09.527
which corresponds
geographically pretty closely

00:00:09.527 --> 00:00:14.144
to the modern day state of
Egypt in northeast Africa.

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:16.906
Now the central feature
in both ancient Egypt

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:19.833
and in modern Egypt is the Nile River

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:22.962
that you see in blue right over here.

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:26.572
And the Nile River is one of
the great rivers of the world.

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:29.539
It rivals the Amazon
River as the longest river

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.685
and it sources the
tributaries of the Nile Rover

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.421
start even south of this picture

00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:37.742
and the water flows northward

00:00:37.742 --> 00:00:41.442
and eventually its delta
reaches the Mediterranean Sea.

00:00:41.442 --> 00:00:46.012
The delta, which is where
a river opens into the sea,

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:49.505
is called a delta because,
as you can see, these rivers,

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:50.451
you can even see it from

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:51.627
the satellite pictures right over here,

00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:53.593
they start branching up a bunch

00:00:53.593 --> 00:00:56.916
and you have this upside
down triangular region,

00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:58.796
which looks a little bit like

00:00:58.796 --> 00:01:01.633
an upside down Greek letter delta,

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.716
so that's why river delta is called that.

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:05.305
And this one just happens
to be upside down.

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:06.552
If it was flowing the other way,

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:08.432
it would be a right-side-up delta.

00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:12.126
So the Nile River, it
flows from, you could say,

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:16.126
eastern mid-Africa up
into the Mediterranean Sea

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:19.781
and because it has this northward flow,

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:22.953
the southern parts of
the river are upriver

00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:25.680
and they are actually
called the Upper Nile.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.513
So, Upper.

00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:31.406
The Upper Nile is actually
south of the Lower Nile,

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:33.270
of the Lower Nile.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.456
And once again, that's because
the Upper Nile is up river,

00:01:36.456 --> 00:01:39.525
it's also flowing from higher elevations

00:01:39.525 --> 00:01:40.846
to lower elevations.

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:45.039
So as you go south, you get to
higher and higher elevations.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.683
Now, the reason why the
river is so important,

00:01:48.683 --> 00:01:50.315
we studied this multiple times,

00:01:50.315 --> 00:01:52.101
rivers are a source of fresh water,

00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:55.339
when they flood they make
the surrounding soil fertile,

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:57.160
they're suitable for agriculture,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.381
and the Nile Valley is
one of the first places

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:01.731
that we see agriculture emerging

00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:04.340
during the neolithic period.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.190
In fact, human settlement we believe

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.911
was along this Nile River Valley

00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.161
as far as 6,000 BCE or 8,000 years ago,

00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:18.272
and it might have been there
even further back in time.

00:02:18.272 --> 00:02:19.781
And because you have that agriculture,

00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:22.212
it allowed for higher
population densities,

00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:24.271
which allowed for more
specialization of labor

00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:26.170
and more complex societies.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.103
It's not a coincidence
that some of the first,

00:02:28.103 --> 00:02:32.464
that one of the first great
civilizations emerged here.

00:02:32.464 --> 00:02:36.297
Now, the story of the
Nile River, or of Egypt,

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:40.590
and actually they are tied very closely,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.446
even though Egypt is considered
a lot of this region,

00:02:43.446 --> 00:02:47.004
most of the human population,
this is true even today,

00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:51.171
is right along the river,
around that fertile soil,

00:02:53.107 --> 00:02:56.815
where the agriculture actually occurs.

00:02:56.815 --> 00:02:59.315
In fact, this was so important
to the ancient Egyptians

00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:01.307
that their whole calendar, their seasons,

00:03:01.307 --> 00:03:04.042
were based on what the
Nile River was doing.

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:05.746
They had a season called the inundation,

00:03:05.746 --> 00:03:08.365
or the flooding of the river,
which makes the soil fertile.

00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:10.138
They had a season of growth,

00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:12.145
which is now talking about
the growth of the crops

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:14.615
and they had a season of harvest.

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:18.889
And so you had people in this
valley for thousands of years,

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.926
but when we talk about ancient Egypt,

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:23.895
we formally talk about
it as a civilization

00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:25.895
around 3,100, 3,150 BCE.

00:03:30.346 --> 00:03:33.205
And this is where we get to
our timeline right over here.

00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:36.746
So we're talking about right
around there on our timeline

00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:38.029
and the reason why this is considered

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.071
the beginning of the ancient
Egyptian civilization

00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:42.658
is this is when we believe

00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:46.954
that upper and lower
Egypt were first united

00:03:46.954 --> 00:03:50.126
under the king and there's
different names used,

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:52.293
Narmer sometimes or Menes.

00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:57.433
I'm going to mispronounce things

00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:00.561
every now and then and I'm
probably doing it here as well.

00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:04.728
And so he was the king that
unified upper and lower Egypt

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:09.609
into an empire and the
empire, as we will see,

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.880
which lasted thousands of years,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.298
every one of these spaces
is a hundred years.

00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:18.070
We're gonna go over huge time span,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.118
but the ancient Egyptian
civilization is roughly divided

00:04:22.118 --> 00:04:23.785
into three kingdoms.

00:04:24.673 --> 00:04:28.719
You have the old kingdom,
which went from about,

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:31.802
right from about the 27th century BCE

00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:37.081
up to about the 17th century BCE.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.220
You have the middle kingdom
and you have the new kingdom.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.660
And once again, this is
spanning right over here

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.410
over a thousand years of history.

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:53.521
And in between those, you have
these intermediate periods

00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:56.090
where the kingdom or the empire

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.827
was a little bit more fragmented.

00:04:57.827 --> 00:05:00.124
You have in some of these
intermediate periods,

00:05:00.124 --> 00:05:02.774
you have some foreign rule.

00:05:02.774 --> 00:05:06.191
But just to get a sense
of some of what happened

00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:07.550
over this thousands of years,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.161
and I'm kind of laughing in my head

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:13.490
because it's hard to cover
over two, 3,000 years,

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.489
in the course of just a few minutes,

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:17.946
but this will give you a
sense of what ancient Egyptian

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:20.437
civilization was all about.

00:05:20.437 --> 00:05:23.587
Now the kings are referred to as pharaohs

00:05:23.587 --> 00:05:26.779
but as we'll see that term
pharaoh is not really used

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.390
until we get to the new kingdom.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.598
But I will refer to the kings as pharaohs

00:05:30.598 --> 00:05:31.569
throughout this video,

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.871
just to say, hey these
are the Egyptian kings.

00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:37.871
And the old kingdom is
probably most known today

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:41.838
in our popular culture
for what we most associate

00:05:41.838 --> 00:05:45.814
with ancient Egypt and
that is the pyramids.

00:05:45.814 --> 00:05:47.962
And here, right over
here are the pyramids,

00:05:47.962 --> 00:05:49.733
there's the Great Pyramid of Giza,

00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:52.766
which is near modern-day Cairo today.

00:05:52.766 --> 00:05:56.894
This is the Sphinx and they
were built in that old period

00:05:56.894 --> 00:06:01.850
under the Pharaohs Sneferu
and Khufu, right over here

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.850
in the 26th century BCE.

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.200
And we are still trying to
get a better understanding

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.833
of how this was done.

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:12.568
We actually now don't believe

00:06:12.568 --> 00:06:14.644
that it was done by slave labor,

00:06:14.644 --> 00:06:17.270
but instead it was done
during, you could say,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.479
the off season by the peasants
as a form of taxation.

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:24.569
Okay, you're done planting
or harvesting your crops?

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:25.971
Well now that you have some time,

00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:27.966
and this shows actually the
importance of agriculture

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:30.041
for freeing people up, so to speak,

00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:33.386
why don't you help the pharaohs
built these massive tombs,

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:35.036
which I've seen various estimates

00:06:35.036 --> 00:06:36.339
that it might have
taken some place between

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:40.877
10 and 100,000 people several
decades to build each.

00:06:40.877 --> 00:06:42.701
But these are even today,

00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:45.868
these were built over 4,500 years ago,

00:06:46.707 --> 00:06:49.087
are some of the most iconic symbols

00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:51.670
that humanity has ever created.

00:06:52.548 --> 00:06:56.715
And the reason why we know
so much about ancient Egypt

00:06:58.547 --> 00:07:01.368
is that we have been able
to decipher their writing.

00:07:01.368 --> 00:07:03.224
It's a symbolic, they
have these pictographs,

00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:05.335
these hieroglyphics, I'm sure you've heard

00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:06.414
of the word before,

00:07:06.414 --> 00:07:08.492
and for a while we had
no idea what they said.

00:07:08.492 --> 00:07:10.683
We would see these
encryptions in these tombs

00:07:10.683 --> 00:07:13.194
and we had a sense that, okay these tombs,

00:07:13.194 --> 00:07:15.103
especially things like the pyramids

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:16.750
would be for these great kings,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.522
we could tell that it
was a stratified society,

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.407
that nobility had better
tombs than others,

00:07:21.407 --> 00:07:23.433
but we didn't really have a
good sense of what was going on

00:07:23.433 --> 00:07:27.018
until we discovered this,
which is the Rosetta Stone,

00:07:27.018 --> 00:07:29.325
which was discovered in 1799.

00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:32.220
The reason why this is so valuable

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:33.405
is it has the same text

00:07:33.405 --> 00:07:35.966
written in three different languages.

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:38.335
It has it written in the hieroglyphs

00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:40.166
of the ancient Egyptians,

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:43.156
and it has it written in a
later script used in Egypt,

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:45.920
called demotic Egyptian,
and most importantly,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.193
it has it also written in Greek.

00:07:49.193 --> 00:07:52.023
And so historians were able to say,

00:07:52.023 --> 00:07:54.756
okay, we can now start to
decipher what these symbols mean

00:07:54.756 --> 00:07:57.166
because we have a translation of them

00:07:57.166 --> 00:07:58.939
and that's why it's one
of the first civilizations

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:02.276
where we're able to put
the picture together.

00:08:02.276 --> 00:08:06.275
And hieroglyphics are one of
the first forms of writing.

00:08:06.275 --> 00:08:09.437
But let's now go on in our journey

00:08:09.437 --> 00:08:13.778
through thousands of years of
ancient Egyptian civilization.

00:08:13.778 --> 00:08:16.881
Between the old kingdom
and the middle kingdom,

00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:18.944
you have the first intermediate period

00:08:18.944 --> 00:08:20.461
and then you have the middle kingdom

00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:22.471
and then you have the Hyksos,

00:08:22.471 --> 00:08:23.626
which are Semitic people,

00:08:23.626 --> 00:08:25.368
Semitic referring to their language

00:08:25.368 --> 00:08:29.417
being of the same family as
Semitic languages like Arabic,

00:08:29.417 --> 00:08:31.598
or Hebrew, or Aramaic.

00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:33.288
But then you have the new kingdom,

00:08:33.288 --> 00:08:36.455
and the new kingdom is
considered to be the peak

00:08:36.455 --> 00:08:38.366
of ancient Egypt.

00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:40.666
It's really the height
of their technology,

00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:43.903
it's the height of their
military capability.

00:08:43.903 --> 00:08:46.972
And there are several pharaohs
that are worthy of note

00:08:46.972 --> 00:08:48.431
in the new kingdom.

00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:51.348
The first is, he was born Amenhotep

00:08:53.002 --> 00:08:55.794
or he was originally known
as Amenhotep the Fourth

00:08:55.794 --> 00:08:58.793
and then he eventually
names himself Akhenaton

00:08:58.793 --> 00:09:01.751
and Akhenaton means effective for Aton,

00:09:01.751 --> 00:09:04.918
Aton being a significant Egyptian god.

00:09:05.969 --> 00:09:10.468
And the reason why he changed
his name is he decides

00:09:10.468 --> 00:09:13.244
that, okay we have, the
Egyptians have this huge

00:09:13.244 --> 00:09:15.402
pantheon of gods.

00:09:15.402 --> 00:09:17.905
Here is just the some of
them right over here,

00:09:17.905 --> 00:09:21.855
this is the god Osiris, often
associated with the afterlife

00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:25.355
or transition, regeneration, resurrection.

00:09:26.876 --> 00:09:30.883
You have the god Amun here
and his first name Amenhotep,

00:09:30.883 --> 00:09:33.133
it means Amun is satisfied.

00:09:34.548 --> 00:09:36.872
What is considered kind
of the equivalent of Zeus,

00:09:36.872 --> 00:09:37.372
you have the god here Horus

00:09:37.372 --> 00:09:39.060
,

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.074
once again a very significant god

00:09:41.074 --> 00:09:42.830
at different times in Egypt,

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.932
but what was interesting
about Amenhotep the Fourth

00:09:45.932 --> 00:09:47.793
or Akhenaton, whichever
name you want to use,

00:09:47.793 --> 00:09:51.021
is he decided, no, no, no,
I don't like this pantheon,

00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:54.354
this polytheistic religion that we have,

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:57.509
I wanna worship one god,

00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:59.366
and the god that he decides to worship

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:02.755
is really the, you could
consider it the sun god,

00:10:02.755 --> 00:10:06.347
or the sun disc, and
its representation looks

00:10:06.347 --> 00:10:11.134
something like this and
it was referred to as Aten

00:10:11.134 --> 00:10:14.343
and so he changes his name to Akhenaton

00:10:14.343 --> 00:10:17.011
and he actually starts to
try to get rid of evidence

00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:21.485
of these other gods or to make
them a lot less important.

00:10:21.485 --> 00:10:23.115
And so the reason why that's notable

00:10:23.115 --> 00:10:25.399
is this is viewed as perhaps

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:27.584
one of the first attempts at monotheism,

00:10:27.584 --> 00:10:32.569
at least within this ancient
Egyptian civilization.

00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:37.008
He's also noted for giving
a lot of power to his wife,

00:10:37.008 --> 00:10:38.889
to the queen, Nefertiti,

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:41.886
who some people say was second in command,

00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:45.238
or even co-ruled alongside him.

00:10:45.238 --> 00:10:47.978
Now he was also famous
because after his death,

00:10:47.978 --> 00:10:52.145
eventually, his son, King Tut,
Tutankhamen, comes to power.

00:10:54.113 --> 00:10:57.179
And the reason why King
Tut, as he's often known,

00:10:57.179 --> 00:11:00.106
although it's Tutankhamen,
is known is because

00:11:00.106 --> 00:11:04.273
we were able to find his
tombs in relatively good order

00:11:05.474 --> 00:11:09.641
and so he's become a popular
part of the imagination.

00:11:12.064 --> 00:11:13.726
And he's known as a child pharaoh.

00:11:13.726 --> 00:11:15.413
He comes to power when he's very young,

00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:19.561
he dies at 18 and so it's
kind of an interesting story.

00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:23.018
Now, most prominent
amongst all of the pharaohs

00:11:23.018 --> 00:11:24.994
across Egyptian history,

00:11:24.994 --> 00:11:26.680
and this is also in the new kingdom,

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.109
comes a little bit after Tutankhamen,

00:11:29.109 --> 00:11:30.859
is Ramses the Second.

00:11:31.703 --> 00:11:35.870
And Ramses the Second, who
emerges here in the 13th century,

00:11:36.955 --> 00:11:40.626
and he rules for most
of the 13th century BCE,

00:11:40.626 --> 00:11:44.720
he represents really the
peak of Egypt, ancient Egypt,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.549
as a military power.

00:11:46.549 --> 00:11:50.068
He's famous for the Battle at Kaddish,

00:11:50.068 --> 00:11:52.665
which is the earliest battle
where we actually know

00:11:52.665 --> 00:11:55.183
what the tactics and the formations were

00:11:55.183 --> 00:11:59.145
and it was with the also
significant Hittite Empire

00:11:59.145 --> 00:12:03.312
in 1274 BCE, this is an
image drawn much, much later,

00:12:04.546 --> 00:12:05.903
of the Battle of Kaddish.

00:12:05.903 --> 00:12:06.927
The battle, we now believe,

00:12:06.927 --> 00:12:08.434
might have been a bit of a stalemate,

00:12:08.434 --> 00:12:10.861
Ramses the Second wasn't
able to capture Kaddish,

00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:13.835
but has told us a lot
about military tactics

00:12:13.835 --> 00:12:15.925
and strategy and formation of that time.

00:12:15.925 --> 00:12:18.334
Historians today think it
might have been the largest

00:12:18.334 --> 00:12:21.264
chariot battle maybe ever.

00:12:21.264 --> 00:12:24.154
So this was a significant
thing that happened.

00:12:24.154 --> 00:12:28.022
Now, eventually the new
kingdom does collapse,

00:12:28.022 --> 00:12:30.777
as we get to the end of
the second millennium,

00:12:30.777 --> 00:12:33.202
and then over the next
several hundreds of years,

00:12:33.202 --> 00:12:35.154
we're talking about a
very long period of time,

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:38.188
it gets fragmented, you
have several rulers,

00:12:38.188 --> 00:12:41.794
you have the Kushites
rule from the Upper Nile,

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:45.725
the Kushites were in this
area right over here.

00:12:45.725 --> 00:12:47.625
They rule for a brief period.

00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:50.784
The Assyrians, that's a
Mesopotamian civilization,

00:12:50.784 --> 00:12:53.895
they rule for a small period of time,

00:12:53.895 --> 00:12:56.241
and then eventually and we
talk about this in some detail

00:12:56.241 --> 00:12:59.543
in other videos, you have
the Persians take over,

00:12:59.543 --> 00:13:02.902
you have Cambyses, Cyrus the Great's son,

00:13:02.902 --> 00:13:06.342
he's able to rule over,
he's able to conquer Egypt

00:13:06.342 --> 00:13:09.251
and Egypt becomes part of the
Achaemenid Empire for a while

00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:12.611
until the conquering
of Alexander the Great.

00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:14.353
And after Alexander the Great dies,

00:13:14.353 --> 00:13:16.994
one of his generals and
his dynasty takes over,

00:13:16.994 --> 00:13:20.034
Ptolemaic Egypt and now it's
being ruled by foreigners,

00:13:20.034 --> 00:13:22.094
well it's been ruled by
foreigners for a while now,

00:13:22.094 --> 00:13:24.138
but now it's by the Greeks

00:13:24.138 --> 00:13:25.719
and the famous Cleopatra,

00:13:25.719 --> 00:13:27.749
who's considered a pharaoh of Egypt,

00:13:27.749 --> 00:13:29.612
she's actually Greek by blood,

00:13:29.612 --> 00:13:33.068
she's actually the one
that seduced you could say

00:13:33.068 --> 00:13:35.906
Julius Caesar and Marc Antony

00:13:35.906 --> 00:13:38.422
and after Cleopatra's
death, more and more,

00:13:38.422 --> 00:13:42.269
actually eventually it
becomes part of Rome.

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:44.985
So as you can see we
covered this enormous large

00:13:44.985 --> 00:13:46.902
time period in history,

00:13:47.815 --> 00:13:50.876
one of the most significant
civilizations in all of history,

00:13:50.876 --> 00:13:53.450
one of the most famous
poems about civilizations

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.275
and rulers, about Ramses the
Second, the poem Ozymandias

00:13:56.275 --> 00:13:57.792
was named after him.

00:13:57.792 --> 00:14:00.366
You have some of the great
cities of the ancient world,

00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:01.917
Thebes, which was the capital

00:14:01.917 --> 00:14:05.462
during parts of the new
kingdom and the middle kingdom,

00:14:05.462 --> 00:14:07.640
you have Memphis, which was one of the,

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.653
some people say founded by Menes

00:14:09.653 --> 00:14:11.909
and the capital of the old kingdom.

00:14:11.909 --> 00:14:14.862
These were all happening in ancient Egypt.
