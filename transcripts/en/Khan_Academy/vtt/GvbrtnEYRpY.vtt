00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.060
We're asked how many toothpicks
will be needed to

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.120
form the 50th figure
in this sequence?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.010
And they've drawn the first four
figures in the sequence.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.220
This is the first, the
second, the third.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.690
Now, let's see what's
happening here.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.050
So in this first figure, we have
this nice little house

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.510
that they've made out of
toothpicks, and it has one,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.110
two, three, four, five,
six toothpicks.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.910
So the first figure in our
sequence has six toothpicks.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.170
Now, what happens in the
second figure here?

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.010
Well, it looks just like
our first figure.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.510
We have our one, two, three,
four, five, six toothpicks,

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.340
but then they add
some toothpicks.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.890
It looks like they added one,
two, three, four, five,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.650
toothpicks.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.040
So it's 6 plus 5 or
11 toothpicks.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.490
So let me write this down.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:01:00.360
It is the 6 toothpicks plus 5
more, which is equal to 11

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.300
toothpicks.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.580
And then when we go to the third
figure, it looks just

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.510
like the second figure, so it
has the 11 toothpicks, so the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.510
11 toothpicks are one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.360
eight, nine, ten, eleven, just
like the second figure.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.970
And then they add some more.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.160
They add one, two, three,
four, five.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.810
So it looks like every time,
when you draw part of a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.560
another house, because it can
share a wall with the previous

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.240
house or share a toothpick
with the previous set of

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.340
houses, you add five
toothpicks.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.860
So for the third term in our
sequence, we had 11 and when

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.160
we had our second term,
or our two houses, and

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.940
then we add five more.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.040
So to our 50th term, so 11
plus 5 is going to be 16.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.320
And then for the fourth term,
it's going to be 16 plus 5,

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.890
which is equal to 21.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.550
Now, there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.830
You can think about however
many more you are than 1.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.780
So let's say you are in the
nth term of the sequence.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.540
If you are in the nth term,
however more you are than 1,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.280
so if you're the nth term,
you're going to be n minus 1

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.790
more than 1.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.620
If that is confusing, we'll do
it with real numbers, so it

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.320
gets a little bit
more tangible.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:34.010
So the nth term, you are n minus
1 more or greater than--

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.210
I'll just say more-- than 1.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.950
For example, if n is 2,
you are 1 more than 1.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.320
If n is 3, you are 3 minus 1,
which is 2 more than 1.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.230
So however much more
you are than 1, you

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.890
multiply that by 5.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.510
We're 2 more than 1, so we add
10 to the number of toothpicks

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.130
we have here.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.070
We're 3 more than 1 here, so
we add 15 to the number of

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.290
toothpicks we have there.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.090
So you could say that for the
nth term, the number of

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:15.560
toothpicks is equal to the
number you're more than 1, &lt; n

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.730
minus 1 times 5.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.210
That's how much you're going
to add above and beyond the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.930
amount of toothpicks
in just the first

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.880
sequence, so times 5.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.860
n minus 1 times 5 plus the
number of toothpicks that you

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.840
would just have in the
first sequence or

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.150
just this one house.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.850
And we already counted
that: plus 6.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.200
So that's one way to
think about it.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.560
And if this looks complicated,
you just say, well, look, if I

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.060
put a 4 here, I'm 3 more than
1, so 4 minus 1 is 3, so

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.810
that'll be 3 times
5, which is 15.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.335
And then you add the number
of toothpicks in 1 and

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:52.370
then you get 6.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.060
Now another way, and many of you
all might find this easier

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.870
to think about, is even in 1,
you could imagine a term

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.850
here-- let me do it this way.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.170
You can imagine a term here
that they didn't draw.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.360
You can imagine a 0th term.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.360
Let me just draw it here.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.990
Imagine a 0th term, and the 0th
term would just be kind of

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.640
a left wall of the house, or
in this case, the left

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.839
toothpick of a house.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.130
And then the first one, you're
adding 5 toothpicks to that.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.340
In the second one, you're adding
5 toothpicks to that.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.450
And when you think about it this
way, it actually becomes

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.620
a little simpler to think
in terms of n.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.530
Here, you could say, well, the
nth term-- let me do this in a

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.090
different color.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.895
You could say that the nth term
is going to have-- or

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:53.180
maybe we should say number of
toothpicks in nth figure is

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.700
going to be equal to 1.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.320
So in the 0th figure, which I
just made up, you have at

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.560
least 1 toothpick, and then
whatever term in the sequence

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.010
you are, you multiply that times
5 and you add that to

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.010
the number of toothpicks in the
0th figure, so it's 1 plus

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.380
5 times n, which is actually a
simpler way to think about.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.360
The first figure is going to
be that 1 in the 0th figure

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.130
plus 5: 6 toothpicks.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.640
Even in the 0th figure,
it works out.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.510
If you put a 0 here,
0 plus 1 is 1.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.670
If you put the fourth figure
here, 5 times 4 is

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.160
20 plus 1 is 21.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.930
Now let's answer
their question.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.380
We need to figure out the
toothpicks in the 50th figure

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.100
in the sequence.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.900
Well, we just put
50 for n here.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.840
So for the 50th figure, we
could use either formula.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.380
We have 1 plus 5 times 50.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.370
5 times 50 is 250 plus
1 is equal to 251.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.310
And now I said you could use
either formula because they

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.456
should reduce to each other, if
we did our math right or if

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:00.900
we deduced properly.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.160
So this one up here, let's just
verify this is the same

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.660
thing as this over here.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:13.870
If we multiply 5 times n minus
1, we get 5n minus 5, right?

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.290
We just distributed the 5.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.690
And then we have that plus 6.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.240
Negative 5 plus 6 is plus 1.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.740
So it's 5n plus 1
or 1 plus 5n.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:32.480
Either way, your 50th figure
is going to have 251.
