00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.096
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
of Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.090
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.283
Good afternoon and welcome to
the National Book Festival.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.760
On behalf of the Library
of Congress,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.093
we hope you're having a
wonderful day celebrating the joy

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:18.680
of reading here on
the National Mall.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.106
My name is Carlos Lozada.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.673
I'm editor of the Outlook
section at the Washington Post.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.940
[Applause ]

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.806
The Post is a charter
sponsor of the book festival

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.286
and a long time supporter of this
event since it began 10 years ago.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.726
Yes, this is the 10th
anniversary of the festival,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.593
just hoping for many, many more.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.886
I should inform you that the--
this particular pavilion,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.230
the presentations here are
being filmed for the Library

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.303
of Congress' website and archives
and C-SPAN is airing it on Book TV,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.210
so you should all be
on your best behavior.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.910
Please do not sit on the camera
risers located in the back

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.483
and turn off your cellphones.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.130
Also, there are mics on either side
here for questions during the Q

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.656
and A. Our distinguished author
this afternoon is Evan Thomas,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.233
a long time writer and editor
of Newsweek and more pertinent

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.283
of our purposes, the author of
several wonderful books of military

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.663
and political history such as "Sea
of Thunder", "John Paul Jones,"

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.770
"Robert Kennedy: His Life,"
of course "The Wise Men"

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.210
and "A Long Time Coming" about
the election of Barrack Obama.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.843
Evan Thomas is in transition from
Newsweek and is taking up residence

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.043
as a professor of journalism
at Princeton,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.906
was also writing a biography
of Dwight Eisenhower.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.646
The power of Evan Thomas' books and
his ability to really transport us,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.916
the readers, to a place and
time long ago and feel not only

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.360
like we're there in the
chaos of battle with him,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.280
but that somehow we're
seeing it in real time.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.613
Writing in The Post,
Book World back in 2007,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.643
he described the challenge
in this way.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.693
How does a sedentary
Washington journalist

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.376
who has never seen war
learn to write about it?

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.383
I have never heard of
shot fired in anger.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.500
I don't even like roughing
at outdoors very much.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.536
How could I possibly know what
it's like to fight a battle?

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.903
The answer is, I don't.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.606
But by talking to veterans and
reading their letters and memoirs,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.800
I can try to imagine and I
can walk the battlefield.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.310
For the one here who's a fan of his
work, it has been a great pleasure

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.226
to walk those battlefields with
him and it's my great pleasure

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.873
to give you, Mr. Evan Thomas.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.440
[ Applause ]

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.130
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.313
I'm delighted to be here
with all of these readers.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.480
Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Edith
Roosevelt was a loving and tender

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.300
and supportive wife but she
knew when to take her husband,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.473
Theodore down a peg or two after
the Great Battle of San Juan Hill

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.333
when Teddy Roosevelt
charged up that hill.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.536
She went to Cuba herself.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.716
And when she came back, she
said to her husband, "You know,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.350
that hill really wasn't that big.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.150
It was sort of a little hill."

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.086
[Laughter] A couple of
years ago, I went there.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.013
I went to San Juan Hill and
it's big enough if somebody's

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.383
up at the top shooting down at you.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.806
Certainly, for Teddy
Roosevelt, July 1st,

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.780
1898 was what he called the
greatest day of my life,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.410
for somebody who'd been president
of the United States for 7 years,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.330
but for Roosevelt, this was the day.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.336
He got up at 4 o'clock
in the morning.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.526
He put on his Cavalryman's
uniform especially ordered

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.190
from Brooks Brothers.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.656
He tied a bandana to cover the
sun off of his back but also

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.426
because he knew it would stream
out behind him when he ride

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.100
on his-- rode on his horse.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.020
Roosevelt was very good at
public relations and like a lot

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.533
of great men, he always
kept a reporter close

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.440
by to record his events.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.336
In this case, the most
famous reporter

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.276
of the day, Richard Harding Davis.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.110
And Davis reported that as Roosevelt
bounded up that hill on his horse

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.326
with the bullets flying
at him, Davis wrote no one

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.463
who saw Roosevelt, take that ride
expected him to finish it alive.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.856
He was the only man on a horse,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.893
a huge target well
ahead of his troops.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.810
He made it up to the top of the
hill, he rested for a minute,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.963
and he started down the other side.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.296
He shouted out, "Holy
Godfrey, what fun?"

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.376
When he got to the top of the next
ridge, he took out his pistol,

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.630
a Colt 38 and he shot a [inaudible]
Spanish soldier and that night,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.236
he took out his little
diary and he wrote 4 lines.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.576
He wrote, "Rose it for, big
battle, commanded regiments,

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.103
held extreme front
of the firing line."

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.686
And a couple of days later, he wrote
his bestfriend, Henry Cabot Lodge,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.386
"Did I tell you that I killed
a Spaniard with my own hand."

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.156
And Teddy Roosevelt
was a true war lover.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.176
In 1886, when he was
27-year-old gentleman rancher

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.080
out in the Dakota Territory, he
proposed raising "some companies

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.420
of horse riflemen out here in the
event of trouble with Mexico."

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.566
He wrote his friend, Cabot
Lodge who was a congressman back

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.553
in Washington, "Will
you telegraph me at once

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.500
if war becomes inevitable?"

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.033
In 1889, while agitating
for military preparedness,

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.783
he wrote British diplomat
Cecil Spring-Rice, "Frankly,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.060
I don't know if I should be sorry
to see a bit of a spar with Germany,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.803
the burning of New York and a few
other seacoast cities would be a

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.410
good object lesson on the need

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.320
of an adequate system
of coastal defenses."

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.376
Now Roosevelt loved the hyperbole,
but he was apparently serious.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.020
He wrote Spring-Rice, "While we
would have to take some awful blows

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.193
at first, I think in the end, we
would worry the Kaiser a little."

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.300
A few years later, in 1894, he
wrote a family friend, Bob Ferguson,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.573
that he long for "a general
national buccaneering expedition

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.673
to dive the Spanish out of Cuba,
the English out of Canada."

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.960
Roosevelt wanted a war and almost
any war against Mexico or Germany

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.233
or Britain or Spain would do.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:15.030
In 1897, he gave a famous speech
at the Naval War College, he said,

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.616
"All the great masterful races
have been fighting races.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.630
No triumph of peace is quite so
great as a supreme triumph of war."

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.666
Some wars are noble, certainly
necessary, World War 2 was one.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.693
The Spanish-American
War was a war of choice.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.760
In 1898, America was
eager to go to war.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.153
William McKinley, the president
then called for 125,000 volunteers

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.936
and a million and a half men
signed up almost overnight.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.093
The war really did some good.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.826
We did liberate Cuba which
was being oppressed by Spain.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.623
It was at least to the
beginning a splendid little war

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.013
as a diplomatic John Hay called it.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.353
But we got sucked into a
vicious counterinsurgency war

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.210
in the Philippines that
lasted for 4 years.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.496
Most people at the time couldn't
find the Philippines on the map,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.103
but we lost 4000 men there,
roughly the same number

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.196
that we've lost in Iraq so far.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.530
I became fascinated with
the phenomenon of war fever

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.246
when I was writing about the
Iraq War for Newsweek in 2003.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.366
But I've decided to look at it,
I go back a century and I focused

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.020
on 3 individuals who seemed to
embody this, one was Roosevelt

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.146
and I'll come back
to him in a second.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.880
His bestfriend, Henry Cabot Lodge

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.110
who really was America's
first imperialist.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.540
Americans didn't like to
use that word, imperialist.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.666
It was a-- kind of a European word

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.446
and Americans were best
ambivalent about imperialism.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.186
But Lodge was the first to
articulate the vision of America

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.520
as an expansionist power,
as a great naval power.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:56.783
He'd been reading Admiral Mahan
and he saw the United States

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.516
as the natural successor
to Great Britain

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.276
as a dominant keeper of the peace.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.420
I also looked at-- in the--

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:10.533
looked at in the book a flamboyant
newspaper publisher who many

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.490
of you have heard of,
William Randolph Hearst,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.870
a great character in his time.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.396
He claimed credit for
the Spanish-American War.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.806
He was exaggerating as usual,
but he certainly did his best

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.586
to stir the pot and he actually
went to the war himself.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.170
That day at San Juan Hill, he was
about a mile away from Roosevelt.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.203
He got up in the morning, put
on his scarlet tie and his hat

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.676
with a scarlet hat band and his
valet prepared him a picnic lunch

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.550
and he stuffed the pistol on his
belt and went looking for the war.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:44.950
He went to the wrong place.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.656
But 3 days later, he was on
his yacht off of Santiago

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.400
and he was there for the
naval battle of Santiago

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.606
when the American sunk
a Spanish battleship.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:00.456
Hearst took his launched into the
shore, captured 29 Spanish sailors

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.966
and required them to give 3 cheers
for George Washington and Old Glory.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:08.950
He then turned these captives over
to the US Navy and got a receipt

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.303
which he put up on the
wall on his office.

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.570
It was there till day he died.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:16.813
I also wrote about a
couple of interesting dubs.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.593
One is William James, who is a
kind of Greek chorus in my book.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.050
James is a great early psychologist,

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.270
philosopher who understand
the lure--

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.290
he understood the lure of war.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.780
He understood why young men
particularly were drawn to it.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.020
But he knew just enough
to warn against it.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.113
And I bring him up periodically,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:37.713
even Teddy Roosevelt's
teacher at Harvard.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.980
If only Roosevelt had lived--
listened a little bit more closely

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:41.536
to him, history might have turned
out differently, but it didn't.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.156
The other is Thomas Brackett
Reed, a figure that probably most

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.030
of you have never heard of.

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.610
He was in 1898 the second most
powerful man in Washington.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.050
He was the Speaker of House up here.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:55.716
They know called him Czar Reed,

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.516
a very interesting
figure, a very droll wit.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:01.553
&gt;&gt; He once said, "The definition

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.166
of a statesman is a successful
politician who was dead."

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.426
[Laughter] The breakup
with his friendship--

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.243
he was very close friends
with Roosevelt and Lodge.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:13.853
The breakup of that friendship is
one of the tragedies of my book.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.833
Reed could not understand
why the country was

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.920
so eager to go to war in 1898.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:22.780
He thought we had plenty
of problems here at home

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.023
but he was rolled by the war fever.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.196
There was, when he was the speaker
of the house, a riot on the floor

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.716
of the House of Representatives,
fist fights, people throwing books,

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.976
the sergeant of arms
had to come break it

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:37.376
up with the silver [inaudible].

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.826
Reed knew that he was beaten,
brokenhearted, he quit,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.460
became a lawyer, died in
a couple of years later.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.286
All these characters are fascinating
men but the one I wanna talk

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.476
about just for a minute
longer is Teddy Roosevelt,

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.766
somebody who sucks all the
oxygen out of the room as one

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.586
of my reviewers said, and he's
one of history's great characters.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.266
There's a famous photograph
of Lincoln's body--

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.800
Lincoln's casket being
led into Washington Square

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.370
in New York after his death in 1865.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.703
And in the photograph which is in
the book, you can see a big mansion

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:16.666
in one corner, belongs to
Teddy Roosevelt's grandfather.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:19.486
And in a window in the mansion,
you can see 2 little heads.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.793
They belong to Theodore
Roosevelt and his brother Elliot.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.406
And they are not only
watching the president's casket

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.620
but were [inaudible] to really

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.420
to something called
the [inaudible] brigade

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:36.646
which are badly wounded
soldiers often missing a limb

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:39.860
who follow along behind it.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.913
Teddy Roosevelt was obsessed
with wounded soldiers.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.273
As a little boy, he
would dress up in rags

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:45.360
and pretend to be a wounded soldier.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.973
As he grew up, he became obsessed
with this idea approving himself

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.150
in physical danger, testing
himself in boxing and hunting.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.296
He went, after his wife died and
his mother on the same night,

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:00.803
at West to become a big game
hunter and famously said,

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.203
"Black care rarely sits behind a
rider whose pace is fast enough."

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.046
And in his head along way,
Roosevelt became big game hunter

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.333
and he wrote a book
which he rated, game--

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.750
big game by the degree
[inaudible] to the hunter.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.530
Now, [inaudible] to grizzly bear,

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:19.833
but of course the greatest
game is man.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:22.313
And Roosevelt himself had never
had a chance to test himself

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.873
in this great game and combat
and he longed for a war.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.603
He was 39 years old when the
Spanish-American War broke out.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.890
He had 4 children.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:36.316
He's oldest son had-- just
had just a nervous breakdown,

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.996
imagine what it's like to be Teddy
Roosevelt Jr. His wife had had

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.806
serious disease in childbirth
and had almost died and

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.160
yet Roosevelt had to go to that war.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:52.856
Years later, he wrote his military
aid, "When the chance came for me

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:55.980
to go to Cuba with the Rough Riders,

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.733
Mrs. Roosevelt was very
ill and so was Teddy.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:01.213
It was a question of either
would ultimately get well.

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:09.006
You know what my wife and children
mean to me and yet I made up my mind

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.660
that I would not allow even
a death to stand in my way.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.540
That is my one chance to
do something for my country

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.343
and for my family and my one chance
to cut my little notch on a stick

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:23.516
that stands as a measuring
rod in every family.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.160
I know now, that I would have turned

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.126
for my wife's deathbed
to answer that call."

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:32.970
The night before he
enlisted in the Rough Riders,

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:33.733
his boss at the Department
of the Navy,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.666
the Navy Secretary John Long
wrote this in his diary,

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.643
he's writing about Roosevelt.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.173
"He's lost his head to
this unutterable folly

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:44.813
of deserting his post where he
is of most service in running

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:47.886
of to ride a horse, and
probably, brush mosquitoes

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:50.553
from his neck on the Florida sands.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:52.713
His heart is right and means
well, but it is one of these cases

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.806
of aberration, desertion, vain glory
of which he is utterly unaware.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.590
He thinks he is following his
highest ideal, whereas in fact,

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:09.270
as without exception, everyone
of his friends advices him,

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.086
he is acting like a fool.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:16.023
And yet, how absurd all these will
sound, if by some turn of fortune,

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.050
he should accomplish some great
thing and strike a very high mark."

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.783
Well years later, Lodge
went back to his--

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.896
excuse me, Long went back to his
diary and wrote a little message

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.653
in him written, handwriting at
the bottom of the page later,

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:30.380
"P.S. Roosevelt was right and we
as friends were all wrong as going

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.700
into the army led straight
to the presidency."

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:42.156
Now interestingly the war
seems to have lifted some kind

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.776
of burden from Roosevelt.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.060
It's as if the fever broke--
he got over his war fever.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.780
As president, he was-- I
think a great president,

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.330
one of the great American
presidents.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:51.966
He stood up to the trust, he was--

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:54.796
and he was fairly careful
on foreign policy.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:00.003
He did not get us into war,
see, had that famous line,

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.220
"Talk softly but carry a big stick."

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:02.953
But the point is he
never used that stick.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.153
He aimed it a few times
but he never used it.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.853
He was careful and yet again when
he was finished being president,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:12.306
it's as if the fever came back.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:14.523
And when World War 1 broke
out, Roosevelt who was then

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.223
in his late 50s, went to
President Wilson and volunteered

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.753
to raise a division
to go fight in France.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.203
And Wilson, who didn't
like Roosevelt very much,

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:28.940
was weary of this, not about to
make a [inaudible] out of Roosevelt

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:32.326
or make him a hero
again, so he said, no.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.753
And as Roosevelt was
leaving the White House,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:38.450
he said to Wilson's top aid Coronel
E.M. House, "Doesn't the president

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.270
after all-- understand after
all, I'm only asking to die."

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.706
And House who was fed up
with Roosevelt by this time,

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.420
paused and replied, "Oh,

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:52.353
did you make that point quite
clear to the president?"

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.820


00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:56.846
[Laughter] Unable to go himself,
Roosevelt sent his 4 sons,

00:15:59.340 --> 00:15:59.873
they also action, 3 were wounded,
and a lot of action actually.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:04.940
That was a generational thing.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:06.636
Roosevelt felt that every new
generation should experience his

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.310
essential test.

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.043
When his eldest son
was wounded in action,

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.380
he and his wife hurled their
wine glasses into the fireplace.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.973
But then, in July 1918, the youngest
Roosevelt son, Quentin was killed--

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:21.496
shot down and killed when
he was flying his war plane

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.803
against the Germans over France.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.696
And interestingly that Roosevelts
got the axle to the plane

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:31.426
and brought it back to Oyster Bay
and hanged it over the mantle kind

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:35.830
of a ghoulish of this
black bent piece of metal--

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:42.423
kind of a ghoulish monument to
their sons, it's there today.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.400
Roosevelt though was
changed by this.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:45.706
He sat there day after day
pretending to read a book,

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:48.903
mouthing the nickname of
his youngest son, Quentin,

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.843
Quentin, and staring blankly.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.740
The romance of war at long
last had given way to heartache

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.520
and within 6 months,
Roosevelt was dead.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:04.793
War will be with us and there
are times and we'll have

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.120
to fight hopefully as bravely
as all those Roosevelts did.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:11.680
Teddy Jr., that neurotic little
boy that I mentioned earlier,

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:14.623
he was the only general officer
to land in the first wave

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.283
at the day, at Utah Beach.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:19.613
Using a cane, he led an attack on
a German position and won the Medal

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:24.556
of Honor, a medal that his father
had loved before but never won.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.270
Bill Clinton actually finally
gave it to him posthumously.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.896
And so it goes, generation
after generation.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.586
Let me just end with a
couple of thoughts I ran

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.053
into while I was researching
this book.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.410
One is from Paul Fussell,
author of the wonderful book,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.496
"The Great War and Modern Memory."

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:45.563
Fussell wrote, "Every war is ironic

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:45.993
because every war is
worst than expected."

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:48.876
The other is from Robert E.
Lee, "It is well that war is

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.096
so terrible lest we
grow too fond of it."

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:55.673
Thank you very much.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.840
[ Applause ]

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.080
&gt;&gt; Sir.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.546
&gt;&gt; You mentioned Teddy
Roosevelt being a lover of war

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.813
and you titled the
book, "Rush to Empire,"

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.296
did Teddy Roosevelt
have a vision of empire?

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.920
How did he see the United States.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.480
Do you think that he saw the
United States as an empire in a way

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.140
that other presidents and
great Americans didn't?

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.500
&gt;&gt; He did have a notion.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.626
Again, this word empire is not
a word that Americans liked.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.070
That was an old word notion, that's
what the Germans and the French

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:38.810
and the British talked about empire.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:40.810
What they-- they talked
more benignly

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:43.476
about the large policy
and it was expansionist.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.110
It was-- they wanted to
build the Panama Canal

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:47.023
as Roosevelt actually did
during his presidency.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:49.626
They acquired cooling
stations for our new navy

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:52.700
and they annexed the Philippines.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:54.690
But Roosevelt was a good politician
and he knew that there is a lot

00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.810
of ambivalence in this
country about imperialism.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:02.340
There was at that time
and there was brief flurry

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:04.546
of it, but then we pulled back.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:06.640
America has a big isolationist
streak

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:08.786
and we were isolationist again.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.500
World War 1 breaks out,
we go to war again.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.140
But then in the 30's pull back and
there had been this kind of back

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:22.310
and forth, really not until after
World War 2 when we had no choice

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.343
and we were the Pax Americana
that Americans sort of take

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:29.336
on this empire, if you will.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:29.783
Roosevelt interestingly, it wasn't
so much annexant territories

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:33.950
that he thought that
war and adventurism

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:36.650
and new frontiers were good
for the American spirit.

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:39.063
He thought that Americans have
become soft and overcivilized

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:43.196
as he put it and that we needed to
find what he called, the wolf rising

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:46.756
in the heart and that conquest
was good for our country.

00:19:49.810 --> 00:19:49.863
Now, he can sound sort of out there
certainly by our modern standards

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.200
but a lot of people were with him
at this time and there's no question

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.646
that he himself had
this war-like spirit,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.280
whether he was good for the country.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:03.530
&gt;&gt; Again, I think he
was a great president.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:05.230
I think the war likes out of him.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:08.763
I'm sort of glad he got it

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:11.963
out of the system before
he became president.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.683
&gt;&gt; You said that the he never used
the big stick, what about Panama--

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:18.920
getting Panama, didn't
he use our naval force?

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:21.900
&gt;&gt; Well, we never actually
fought a war.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:25.700
&gt;&gt; We staged a phony coup in Panama.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.900
It was pretty outrageous
certainly by modern standards.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.583
We created an instance at--
that let us move in there.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.490
By use of big stick, I mean the
battleships weren't firing guns,

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:37.876
the armies weren't
marching but certainly, we--

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:39.733
as what was the joke,
we took the Panama--

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:41.286
we took the Canal fair and square.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.820
We didn't actually take
it fair and square.

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:45.820
We did it in underhanded
way and that was--

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.086
&gt;&gt; That's like--

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.086
&gt;&gt; That was pretty imperialist.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.686
&gt;&gt; He lifted the big stick
but he never brought it down.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.820
&gt;&gt; Right. He waved the stick
but he never brought it down.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:57.420
&gt;&gt; Did Lodge have a future role
in the Roosevelt administration?

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:05.086
&gt;&gt; Lodge remained the senator and
was a great friend and a source

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:05.470
of wisdom and kind of advocate
for Roosevelt on Capitol Hill.

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.536
Interestingly, they diverged a bit

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.080
as Roosevelt was president,
was more liberal really.

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.313
He wanted to stand up to
the trust in big business.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.140
Lodge was more of like traditional
conservative republican business

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:22.810
oriented type.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:25.013
And the 2, although they always
remained the dearest of friends

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:26.770
and Lodge broke down and
wept at Roosevelt's--

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:30.883
giving the eulogy at Roosevelt's
funeral up here on the Capitol Dome.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.336
On policy grounds, they
were not on the same page.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.580


00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:43.110
&gt;&gt; I've enjoyed your work both
books and especially in Newsweek.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:44.750
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.360
&gt;&gt; And I wondered if you could
comment on the future of Newsweek

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.206
in particular and news
magazines in general?

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.146
&gt;&gt; Sure. Well, Newsweek is-- as
some of you, well probably all

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.023
of you know was sold by the
Washington Post Company this summer

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.990
to a guy named Sidney Harman
who's a 92 years young.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.996
He's actually full of
[inaudible] and energy and I think

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.463
that he's gonna be a
reviving force of Newsweek.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:08.130
I think he's gonna spend some money.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:10.663
I think he's gonna bring
in some good people.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.130
I think Newsweek has got
some good days ahead of it.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.363
&gt;&gt; Let see, which-- I
guess I'm on this side.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.696
&gt;&gt; Questions concerning
Roosevelt's trust busting.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.100
Who held his legislative
supporters during that period?

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.706
&gt;&gt; Roosevelt-- actually
it's interesting,

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.143
we think of him I just
portrayed him as a guy

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.530
who goes charging up the hill.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.483
He was pretty good at
compromise and he did--

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.290
he did not go that far though.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:41.846
You know, he was urged by
the all out progressives

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:44.533
to go all the way and
busted the trust.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.310
He did it slowly, somewhat
carefully.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.240
He showed a kind of restrained
and inability to compromise

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.140
but frankly I wish
that we had today.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.090
He was somebody who actually could
make a deal even though we think

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.023
of him as headlong character.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.343
&gt;&gt; Well, did he have any key
senators or congress people?

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.453
&gt;&gt; I don't think so.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.453
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.586
&gt;&gt; This not my period.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.720
My period is the early period, but
I think that the important thing is

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.320
that he would make-- he was
willing to make a deal with anybody.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.453
&gt;&gt; Do you think Roosevelt
was motivated consciously

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.120
or unconsciously by a political
future like being governor

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.653
of New York when he went off
to Cuba to fight in the war?

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:25.620
&gt;&gt; Well, let me put it this way,
did he have a political ambitions?

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.593
Within 2 days after returning from
Cuba, he was meeting with the head

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:29.390
of the Republican Party in New
York so it was on his mind.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.090
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:36.290
&gt;&gt; And Lodge is writing
him letters saying, "Hey,

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:37.223
you can have anything you want."

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:39.556
So sure, he was politically
ambitious.

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.890
Is that why he went to war?

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.490
No. He went to war to prove himself.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.556
But the politics followed closed
behind and when he ran for governor

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:47.386
that fall on the campaign
train, he had his Rough Riders

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:50.926
with their hats, hoopin'
and hollerin'

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:52.860
and playing happy days
is here again.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.183
He played up that Rough Riders
stuff to the hill and it worked.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.003
&gt;&gt; Thank you sir.

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.540
&gt;&gt; Sir, in your opinion, what
possessed Roosevelt to go

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.286
on that very dangerous
adventure in the Amazon?

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:07.913
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a good question.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:10.503
Roosevelt as a fairly old guy,
went on an possibly dangerous

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:14.856
and really reckless mission.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.790
This wonderful book about it
the called, "River of Doubt."

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:19.700
An unnamed-- up in the Amazon
basin, he almost died there.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.193
He went with one of his sons.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:26.860
His leg became infected.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:27.993
Roosevelt actually
said, "Leave me behind.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.260
Let me die."

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.193
And he said-- son said,
"No, we're gonna have

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.993
to carry you out anyways."

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:35.403
[Applause] "So, you're
coming with us."

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:38.650
[ Laughter ]

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:40.953
&gt;&gt; Do you think that if Roosevelt
had been elected president in 1912,

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.640
we would have entered
World War 1 before 1917?

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:48.323
&gt;&gt; Would we have entered
World War 1 before 1917

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:49.583
if Roosevelt had been president?

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:51.546
Absolutely, as fast
as he possibly could.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.603
He was an early interventionist,
all for preparedness.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:00.636
He and his circle were
constantly agitating to intervene

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.253
on behalf of England and France.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.130


00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:05.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in your book,
"Sea of Thunder,"

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.440
did you have any problem having
access to the Japanese archives?

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:12.176
&gt;&gt; Yes, I-- my book,
"Sea of Thunders"

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.333
about the Pacific War particularly
about the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:16.783
And I tell it from the Americans,
I've-- also from the Japanese side.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:21.790
One reason why you don't
see more of that is most

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.723
of the Japanese archives burned.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.863
There is some stuff and there
are some Japanese scholars.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.983
I went to Japan with my wife.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.610
We spent a lot of time
talking to a--

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.840
really Japanese naval historians.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.146
There is-- there are-- there are
some records of the Japanese fleet.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.140
They are pretty cryptic.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.406
What was more useful to me defines--
I'll actually found some survivors

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.040
of the Japanese Imperial Navy, one
of whom was standing next to one

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.083
of my Japanese heroes
during the great battle

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:52.263
and my wife and I bought him lunch.

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:54.576
He insisted that we
rent the restaurant--

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:56.850
I remember it costs us
400 bucks, so I was hoping

00:25:58.250 --> 00:25:58.716
that this interview
is gonna work out.

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.450
[Laughter] It did.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.916
Japanese sometimes is a little
slow to talk, very formal

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.516
but once you got going, he relived

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:07.310
that battle including taking
off his shoe and socks.

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.890
So he had been-- he was
on the battleship Yamato,

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:15.356
so that I could feel the 27
pieces of the battleship Yamato

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.110
that were still in his leg.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:19.373
That's a bad as close as you can
get to World War 2 these days.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.466
&gt;&gt; Did the Japanese actually burn--
allow the records themselves?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:25.600
&gt;&gt; They didn't-- no,
no, we burned them.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.466
Our bombs burned them.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:29.100
We fire bomb Japan, that was
in a lot of those records.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.633
They didn't burn.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.633
They record-- the Japanese
interestingly are all

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.636
about not being too critical

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:42.713
and so their biographies
are very careful not

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.026
to speak ill of the dead.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.846
They speak very [inaudible]
and it's rather hard to find

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.406
out what the Japanese real--

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.453
really thought about their
own-- their own side.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.026
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.026
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Yes ma'am.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:56.026
&gt;&gt; This will be our last question.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.760
Thank you.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.293
&gt;&gt; How effective do you believe the
tour or the Great White Fleet was

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:02.026
at enhancing our natural security?

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.826
&gt;&gt; Teddy Roosevelt famously put
together the Great White Fleet

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.760
towards the end of his
presidency, sent them--

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.240
the joke was that he got Congress
to appropriate and have called

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.170
to sent them halfway around
the world, knowing they pay

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.180
to bring it back the
[inaudible], if they had to.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:17.993
I'd-- certainly it was a
demonstration of American power.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.940
We showed it a little
bit in the naval battles

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:24.740
at Santiago and Manila Bay.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.313
The Japanese sure noticed when
we arrived there with our fleet.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.566
I think it was announcing

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.396
that America was a great
power on the world stage.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:35.023
And it was a show-- it was
a show of force but I think

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:38.116
that people were paying attention.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.050
I know the British were--
that was the early days

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:43.850
of the special relationship and
I think the British could see

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:47.783
that we were a partner in this
great Anglo-American Alliance

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.163
to rule the seas.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:51.543
I think they probably also suspected
that one day we would replace them.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:54.583
Thank you very much.
