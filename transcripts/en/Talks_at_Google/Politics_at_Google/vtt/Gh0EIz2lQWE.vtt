[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.720
MIKE FARRAH: Well,
thank you for having us.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.940
We're going to start
by showing a video.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.900
We make a lot of them.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.239
We did a big event in
California 49 earlier this year.

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.030
You might have heard
about-- unfortunately,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.090
this was the event where Will
Ferrell got into a car accident

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.180
afterwards.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.920
Thankfully, everyone was OK.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.260
It's a nonpartisan campaign,
and we put together a live event

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.030
with Billy Eichner,
who came up with Glam

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.260
Up the Midterms
and Ron Burgundy.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.950
So we can show you that, and
then we can talk about some

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.060
of the success that
we had with that event

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.180
and what we have coming up
the final six weeks, the home

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.070
stretch.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.962
I hope voting is more
popular than this panel.

00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:49.914
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.374 --> 00:00:54.342
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:54.342 --> 00:00:57.294
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:05.658 --> 00:01:09.316
- Your host for the
evening, Billy Eichner!

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:13.444
- California congressional
district 49 makes some noise!

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.420
[CHEERING]

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.878
The one, the only Ron Burgundy!

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:19.866
[CHEERING]

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.336
- Great to be back here.

00:01:22.336 --> 00:01:26.390
(SINGING) Oceanside,
Oceanside, it's

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.359
right by the side of the ocean.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.400
I recorded that song for
the chamber of commerce.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.230
It reduced tourism by 80%.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.640
- There's more things that
we have in common than things

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.669
that we disagree on.

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:39.210
- Here, here.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.864
- Find someone in
your neighborhood

00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:43.530
and make sure that you're taking
them to the polls on the fifth.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.299
- There are no more excuses.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.090
We are all going to
get out there and vote.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.500
We're going to make sure
our friends go vote,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.550
our families go vote.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.806
- I voted.

00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:54.410
- Never actually voted
in a midterm election,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.650
and that's a huge mistake.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.066
So this year it's
going to change.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.280
- We're going to vote.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.330
- We're all voting.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.930
- And you should, too.

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.370
- I will vote, dammit!

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.330
- And we're going
to turn the midterms

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.406
into the hottest, sexiest
event of the entire year.

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:16.810
That's what Glam Up the
Midterms is all about.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.040
- And that's fantastic.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.020
- Take it for me, Ron Burgundy,
nothing is sexier than voting.

00:02:27.436 --> 00:02:30.364
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:36.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.937
MIKE FARRAH: So
the 2016 cycle we

00:02:37.937 --> 00:02:40.130
had done a campaign
with Judd Apatow,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.550
and we actually got about
a 1 and 1/2 million people

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.770
registered to vote,
mainly in California,

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.940
so we wanted to scale out into
a national campaign, which

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.965
has had its pros and cons.

00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:54.590
But we were really
proud of the success

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.400
that we had down
in California 49.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.700
It led to-- we've been
proud that the content

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.170
that we've made,
the whole premise

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.780
has always been to
actually get action

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.440
and to sign people up to vote.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.450
So a few of the stats--

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.890
we had 4,000 voters sign up
for election alerts, and most

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.970
importantly, 70% of voters
under the age of 35.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.870
We had 14 million social media
impressions, and 500 volunteer

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.540
hours to engage that many
voters, which is actually

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.880
a very high conversion rate.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.160
You guys may not know this,
but in the 2014 cycle,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.530
guess how many
millennials actually

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.990
showed up to the polls?

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.870
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.754
[CHUCKLING]

00:03:37.754 --> 00:03:38.670
KATE LILLY: Two total.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.919
MIKE FARRAH: You're even
more pessimistic than we are.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.085
[CHUCKLING]

00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:43.470
Add 10% to that.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.900
It was 12% of millennials showed
up to vote in the midterms.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.820
And you know, what
we really care about

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.220
is just the democratic process,
and getting as many people

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.710
aware, and understanding how to
vote, making it easy for them.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.640
You know, Billy, who has an
amazing social media presence,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.570
he tweeted out, like, seriously,
why don't people vote?

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.290
And the comments back
were just so discouraging,

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.190
in terms of just pure
apathy, laziness,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.300
being unaware with
what's going on,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.600
not feeling like
their vote counts.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.251
And so we've always--

00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:23.250
with this campaign and
others at "Funny or Die,"

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.140
we've always tried
to figure out how

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.530
to make engaging comedy
that actually gets

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.990
noticed, and breaks
through all the noise,

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.970
so that we can turn
that number around.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.430
Because regardless of if you're
a Republican or a Democrat,

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.030
democracy only works if
people are active in it,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.730
and actively participating.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.040
And so we have our
leanings, but that's not

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.420
the point of the campaign.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.760
The point is to really
engage young people

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.230
and make a difference.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.360
And Kate, you can kind
of speak about what we're

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.920
doing the final six weeks.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.450
KATE LILLY: Yeah, Glam
Up was started with Billy

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.340
and "Funny or Die" because we're
aware that, as an entertainment

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.100
platform, we have a
responsibility as much

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.290
as we can to use that
platform to reach people

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.690
for causes that are important
to our democracy, as Mike said.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.890
So for Glam Up, the point
of every event and video

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.415
that we do is to leverage
views, or leverage

00:05:20.415 --> 00:05:23.880
an exciting invite
to something cool

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.420
with Ron Burgundy
and Billy Eichner.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.050
And instead of
purchasing a ticket,

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.110
and using that money to
fundraise or pay back

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.740
the event, "Funny or Die"
has gone out, fundraised,

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.730
put these events on.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.590
In order to attend
one of those events,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.184
you have to register to vote
or prove that you already

00:05:42.184 --> 00:05:44.850
are registered to vote, and then
you are entered into the event,

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.620
and you get to go see
a cool comedy show.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.890
So we're trying to use
that as an incentive

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.740
to say, hey, registering to
vote and showing up to the polls

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.599
is pretty easy.

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.890
You might never get to see
a show with these two people

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.670
again.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.360
Come and do it.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.830
It's bribery-- no, but it works.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.300
It's really worked for us.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.410
So what we're doing for the
remaining couple weeks--

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.930
we have a big push coming.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.220
We have an event coming
up in Detroit, Michigan.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.560
Detroit is an area
where they've struggled

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.390
to get people out to the polls,
specifically the youth vote.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.190
So Billy will be having some
surprise guests with him,

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.110
performing on stage.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:23.950
And that is October 7th.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.874
And so we'll be specifically
targeting the area,

00:06:26.874 --> 00:06:28.915
and trying to get people
to show up at the event.

00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:31.248
That's in partnership with
the Natural Resources Defense

00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:32.420
Council.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.800
And then we have
three events that'll

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.470
take place in October that are
in partnership with the Human

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.460
Rights Campaign.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.320
So let's see.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.430
We'll be in Phoenix on the 13th
of October, Vegas on the 20th,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.350
and Milwaukee on the 27th--

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:51.190
all three places, again,
being lower number

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.490
of voting districts,
specifically for the youth vote

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.810
in the midterm elections.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.360
And then we're going
to kind of wrap it up

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.350
with a big final push
in Houston, which

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.637
is Gabby Gifford's campaign.

00:07:02.637 --> 00:07:04.720
And we'll be putting on a
big event there as well.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.370
So for Billy-- you know,
Billy is a working actor.

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.010
He's got a lot going on.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.010
But he's doing this out of
the kindness of his heart

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.037
because he knows how important
it is, and carving time out

00:07:17.037 --> 00:07:19.620
of his schedule to show up, as
well as the "Funny or Die" team

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.110
who is producing these
events, to get people out,

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.600
put on a good show, and
in the meantime have

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.706
them register to vote.

00:07:25.706 --> 00:07:27.330
MIKE FARRAH: Yeah,
the only other thing

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.920
I would add that I think is
really cool about the campaign.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.461
You might have
noticed we interviewed

00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:33.960
some local activists onstage.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.490
One thing we
definitely didn't want

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.120
do is just be a bunch of
Hollywood liberals showing up

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.100
in these different
cities and kind

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.730
of just preaching to the
choir, or just berating people

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.330
to vote.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.700
And so it was a
really smart idea

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.800
to engage the local
community, have

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.590
a lot of local activists
onstage talking,

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.690
from their own experience
in the community,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.350
how you can get involved.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.830
Because then it just
feels more authentic.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.910
Because I think there was
backlash in the 2016 cycle.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.580
I think there was
lots of reasons.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.100
And we don't have to
get into all of that.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.177
But I think something
that's really

00:08:10.177 --> 00:08:11.760
important to us is
that if we're going

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.290
to do a national
campaign, and we're

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.050
going to be speaking
to young folks,

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.100
let's not just be people
in our 30s and 40s,

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.000
talking down to them.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.270
But let's really use smart
comedy and smart conversation

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.687
to hopefully inspire them.

00:08:25.687 --> 00:08:27.270
Because if they're
inspired, then they

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.060
can get their friends
inspired, and it

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.039
becomes this groundswell.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.919
Because midterms, if
you think about it,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.260
it's terrible branding.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.189
It sounds like a test that
you're trying to avoid.

00:08:41.189 --> 00:08:45.030
So we try to make it
fun, and sexy, and cool,

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.830
but also really grounded
in the local environment

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.560
so that it's not
just people from LA

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.214
flying in and flying
out, but the conversation

00:08:55.214 --> 00:08:57.630
and the work that we're doing
can then have ripple effects

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.940
throughout the community.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.660
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: Great.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.160
Thanks.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.180
And we will start a
discussion with you,

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.429
a little more about what
you're doing in a little bit.

00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:10.270
I'd like to hear from Kathleen
now more about VoteRiders.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.140
KATHLEEN UNGER:
So hi, everybody.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.660
And thank you Nadine, and
Mike, and Kate, and all of you

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:25.060
who are here and interested
in the very foundation

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.660
of our country,
the right to vote.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:35.590
11% of voting age Americans--
that's roughly 25 million

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.330
eligible voters--

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.420
do not have a current
government-issued photo ID.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.010
And why is that important?

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.960
Because from a voter
ID perspective,

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.330
that's essentially
the kind of ID

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:54.520
that is common to all 35 states
that have these voter ID laws--

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.780
25 million.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.650
Now, you compare that
to the margin of victory

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:04.990
for the year 2000 presidential
election, which was 537.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:14.320
The November 2016 presidential
election was basically 77,744.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.185
I know you all like data, so I
thought I'd be really precise.

00:10:17.185 --> 00:10:18.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.700
OK, so 25 million.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.000
Now, on top of that,
there are many,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.420
many, many millions
of Americans who

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.690
are so confused and
intimidated by these voter

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.400
ID laws that they
won't vote, even

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.250
though they have a valid ID.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:44.080
And on top of this, you've got
a federal voter registration ID

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.530
law that applies in every state,
except for North Dakota, that

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.430
doesn't have voter registration.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.070
Also, in some states, they have
their own voter registration ID

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:54.910
laws.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.040
So there are all these IDs.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.850
It's incredibly confusing
because these laws are really

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.940
actually very
complicated and onerous.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:11.500
And it doesn't help when states
run off the range with it

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.020
as well.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.840
For instance, right
now in Georgia

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.410
they're using a voter
registration form

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.260
that's an old voter
registration form that actually

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:26.470
shows that you need a photo ID
in order to register to vote.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.080
You do not need a photo ID to
register to vote in Georgia.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.370
You need one to vote, but
not to register to vote.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.410
Now on top of this
confusion is the fact

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.260
that the vast majority
of people don't really

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.590
understand that voter
ID is in addition to

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:48.290
and different from
voter registration.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.240
And I'll bet you that almost
everybody in this room

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.690
really doesn't understand that.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.730
I've had all these
conversations,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.920
and at the end of it,
people are still talking

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.580
about voter registration.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:07.090
OK, so the formula
is voter registration

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.280
plus voter ID equals vote.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:17.690
So VoteRiders is the practical
and effective solution.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:25.360
Our mission is to ensure
that voters can actually

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.820
exercise their right to
vote because they have

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.870
an acceptable ID if it's
required in their state,

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.320
and they feel confident
that they have the right ID.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.100
And they feel confident
if their state doesn't

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.150
have a voter ID law,
like in California

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.540
and 14 other states plus DC.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.980
Coming back to this
confusion factor,

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.830
there are poll workers in
every state who are confused.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.260
They're not well-trained.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.670
The voting process
itself is confusing.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.990
But again, all over
California, there

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.990
are poll workers who are asking
people for their voter ID,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.140
and there is absolutely none
required in this state when

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.350
you go to vote.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.140
So what do we do?

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:17.590
We identify, we inform, and
we assist voters all the way

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.880
through the process of
getting their voter ID.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.070
We'll cover the cost of
the underlying documents.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:29.200
We cover the cost and handle
the arranging of transportation

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.050
for people who need it in
order to get to the government

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.780
ID issuing offices.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:40.690
And while we work with hundreds
of organizations all over,

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:46.060
we focus especially
on states that

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.920
have highly competitive
House, Senate,

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:53.560
and gubernatorial races, because
those are really where there's

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.602
a higher voter interests.

00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:56.101
Where there's higher
voter interest,

00:13:56.101 --> 00:13:57.640
these people want
to vote, we want

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.036
to make sure you're
going to be able to vote.

00:14:00.036 --> 00:14:04.200
And we've contributed decisively
in an increase in voters,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:10.280
especially including last
year in Virginia and Alabama.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.830
So here we are in California.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:16.110
There's no state voter ID law.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.820
Why do we care?

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.080
Well, if there's an issue
that you care about,

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.260
it really does matter that
the people who agree with you

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.910
can vote, regardless
of where they live.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.680
And who are these people
who are having problems?

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.050
Who's impacted by
these voter ID laws?

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:39.500
They're primarily those who
do not have a current driver's

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.880
license in their state.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.300
They are older adults who are
no longer driving, if they ever

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:45.800
did.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.390
They have mobility problems.

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.810
They are young adults, exactly
whom we've been talking about.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.300
They're going to school
in another state.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.880
They're riding bicycles.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.590
They're taking public
transportation.

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.745
They're using ride
hailing car services.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.600
And they're people
with disabilities.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.090
One in five Americans
has a disability.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:13.340
Obviously a lot of these
people are not driving.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.740
They are voters of color.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:20.070
And across the board, they
are voters with low income,

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.640
who cannot afford to take
the time off from work,

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:30.260
who cannot afford what can be
really a relatively expensive

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.430
cost of getting the underlying
documents that you need

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.800
in order to get
the free voter ID.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.180
And then they're women.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.520
Because a number of states
require an exact match

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.220
between the name on your
ID and the name of which

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.380
are registered to vote.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.640
So I just want to
highlight three programs

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.580
that we're very excited about.

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:59.240
The first is we've created
these wallet-size voter ID

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.530
information cards
for all 50 states,

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:07.590
in English and in Spanish.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.880
They show the highlights
of what's required.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:15.560
And they are uniquely valuable,
because they are precisely

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.860
accurate.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.120
So this is very
helpful because it lets

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.620
people know what they need.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:25.010
And they put it in their wallet,
and it gives them confidence.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.260
They go into the polling
place, and now they're

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.330
dealing with a
misinformed poll worker.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.000
They take it out, it
gives them something

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.400
to hold onto literally.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.590
So these are great.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.050
And there is an
impact on turnout.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:43.910
November 2016, in
Houston, Harris County,

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.930
our partner Mi
Familia Vota Texas

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.820
distributed our cards while
they canvassed in six majority

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.410
Latino precincts.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.070
After the election,
the Harris County clerk

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:05.280
reported that turnout
countywide had decreased 1%,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.310
but for those six precincts, it
had increased cumulatively 92%,

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:13.369
almost 9% per precinct.

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.319
This really can
make a difference.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.369
So that's one.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:20.540
We're thrilled about this,
and we're distributing them

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.940
by the millions, far and wide.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.040
And they're freely downloadable.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.620
Secondly, we are partnering
with organizations

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.060
that engage in canvassing,
and phone banking, and text

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.060
banking, and tabling.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.130
And what they're
doing is they're

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.150
inserting into their script
a voter ID question which

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.050
we always want to be, do you
have a current driver's license

00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:49.400
in whatever this state is?

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.424
Because people understand
what a driver's license is.

00:17:52.424 --> 00:17:53.840
They may not know
if it's current,

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.740
but they understand
what that is.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.180
Frankly, any other question,
you're going to come across

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.180
people who don't--

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.590
it's not that clear.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.080
So they insert that
question, and then

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.910
anybody who responds
with anything

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.540
other than a resounding
yes, the voter file

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.560
comes to us at
VoteRiders, and we then

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.350
follow up to assist
them to make sure

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.501
that they have the
ID that they need,

00:18:20.501 --> 00:18:22.250
that they've got their
questions answered,

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.900
that they are fully prepared,
fully confident voters.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.140
Lastly, along with our
partner, Democracy Labs,

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:39.170
we have developed a
bilingual VoteRiders chatbot

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:44.160
for devices that use Google
Dialogflow and Google Cloud

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.680
and there are current versions
in SMS, Facebook, and Alexa.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.990
And we will be expanding into
Android phones, and Google

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:57.380
Home, and WhatsApp, and
interactive voice response.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.430
So anyway, I look forward to
your ideas and your questions.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:02.854
Thank you.

00:19:02.854 --> 00:19:04.020
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: Great.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.700
All right.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.880
So much interesting information.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.480
I think we'll start
with Mike and Kate.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.060
Can you talk to us about
comedy and politics,

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.380
and how they
intersect, and what do

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:26.690
you think is the added value
that comedy adds to politics?

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.140
MIKE FARRAH:
Traditionally, comedy

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:30.680
is when you speak to power.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.720
It's a voice that
speaks to power.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:37.220
And I think with the advent of
shows like "The Daily Show,"

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.740
and how the internet
and social media

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.950
has been able to inform
young folks in ways

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.520
that the news never
really got to--

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.520
I grew up watching, like,
Peter Jennings on the news.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:57.950
And now the news, in that form,
is obviously really a dying

00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.960
conversation.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.150
It's a very old demographic.

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:07.220
And I think comedy has done a
very good job both informing

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.290
folks and entertaining them.

00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:11.900
And we've tried to
do it in our own way,

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.020
with "Between Two Ferns"
and Zach Galifianakis.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.340
We did a very effective
episode with President Obama

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.461
around the Affordable
Care Act a few years ago.

00:20:22.461 --> 00:20:23.960
And that was just
really tremendous.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.130
That led to a 40%
increase in young people

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.860
signing up for the
Affordable Care Act.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:32.960
Our point of view
was this was already

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.800
a law that had been passed.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.240
And so we were fortunate to
have a very young audience.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.420
And we had a show that
really connected with people.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:45.150
And to the President and
the White House's credit,

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:48.050
we didn't make it a commercial
for the Affordable Care Act.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:51.440
Really, we don't start talking
about that until about maybe

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.190
2/3 of the way into the video.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.390
And so it's always been
a very effective tool

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.800
if you do it in the right way.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.610
If you in the wrong way, it
can come off really lame--

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.900
KATE LILLY: And preachy.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.175
MIKE FARAH: --or preachy.

00:21:04.175 --> 00:21:06.860
And so I think actually, if
you guys want to stick around

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.200
at the end, we're going to
show a video that we launched

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.900
that Kate produced
that stars Billy

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.940
Eichner and a few
other famous friends

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.740
at the end of the panel.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.020
And that's something we
just released yesterday,

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.342
and it's already just
about at 1 million views.

00:21:21.342 --> 00:21:23.300
And so you'll see,
hopefully, hopefully, you'll

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.400
think it's funny.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:28.280
And hopefully, we
just think it's

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.670
the way that we've always
found traction communicating

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.410
with our audience.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:36.620
It's so important to have
credibility and currency

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:37.520
with young people.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.978
Like we were talking
about earlier,

00:21:38.978 --> 00:21:43.160
if things feel inauthentic or
forced, it's a major turnoff.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.640
And because comedy, so
effectively-- good comedy--

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:51.410
can speak to power in ways that
make complicated things more

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.940
accessible, that's
what we lean into.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.510
KATE LILLY: But just to add--

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:00.159
I want to emphasize the
point that when we make--

00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:02.450
because my role at "Funny or
Die," outside of producing

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:05.660
"Glam Up the Midterms" has
been running a digital team

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:06.620
for the last few years.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.000
And actually, my first day, my
first month was October 2016.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
So we weren't sure
what was going

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.080
to hit us in November of
2016, and as you can imagine,

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.570
that was a journey
to figure it out

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.680
with the team along the way.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.800
But I think it's
really important

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.820
that the writing and the talent
and the message of the video

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.500
is not something that exists
to shroud a call to action.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.160
I think a lot of PSAs come
off as slightly ineffective

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.920
because you can
tell, oh, I'm just

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.420
watching this because they want
me to click this or do that.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.210
When you can actually
provide entertainment,

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:42.920
when you can actually
provide laughs

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.010
because what you're
showing is funny,

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.140
is a good piece of content
that you would go out

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.931
of your way to watch
regardless of if there

00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:51.320
was a message attached or not--

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.280
is when we've really
seen strong success.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.230
It's the correlation
between somebody

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:59.120
really enjoying
something they watch

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.830
and then going and
taking the action

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.330
that you're asking them to do.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.270
It's so much higher
than just, like I

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.280
said, shrouding
what you actually

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.260
want them to do in
something that kind of feels

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.670
like just a cover up.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:13.790
So for us, it's always been
about working with the highest

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.280
quality talent, the highest
quality writers and directors

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.488
to make sure that what we're
putting out to the world

00:23:18.488 --> 00:23:21.170
is truly entertaining
and then is also

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.460
tied into these messages.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.960
NADINE FARID JOHNSON:
You've kind of

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.824
touched on actually my next
question, which just fell.

00:23:27.824 --> 00:23:29.240
I'm asking for all
of you, though.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.210
I'd like to know what you've
learned about messaging

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.410
and what resonates with people.

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.160
How do you bring people
to your site, how

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.080
do you get people to
look at VoteRiders,

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:44.090
for example, or Glam Up or
"Funny or Die," generally?

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:46.704
What resonates?

00:23:46.704 --> 00:23:47.620
KATE LILLY: Giveaways.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.120
[LAUGHS]

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.780
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: T-shirts.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.770
KATE LILLY: Well,
yeah, yeah, swag--

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:59.270
no, I think a lot of what I just
said really comments on that.

00:24:02.996 --> 00:24:04.920
People are much
more incentivized

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.330
when you build trust up
over a period of time,

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.880
which is why I think "Funny or
Die" has had a lot of success.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.540
It's because people look
at us to see something

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.110
that will make them laugh.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.900
And if it has a
message as part of it

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.560
that allows them to laugh and
share it with their friends who

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.650
will also laugh and get that
message, that's really--

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.530
for us, video has been
a really impactful way

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.150
to see people's reactions.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.540
And then, I think,
when we're live,

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.210
when we're doing live events,
the more appealing you can make

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:41.400
something, whether it's cool
talent or something unexpected

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.960
that people aren't--

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.360
When you can say, hey, we're
going to be in Detroit,

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.210
and a Pistons player will be
making a surprise appearance

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.100
doing something
you'll never imagine,

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.510
you can't even believe.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.040
Those are things
that people say,

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.580
I'm willing to go the extra
mile for something I might not

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.184
have done, which is
register to vote,

00:24:58.184 --> 00:24:59.850
just because I kind
of want to see that.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.020
And that's just how we
get our foot in the door

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.360
to do everything else.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.930
So I think it's just,
as much as you can,

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.180
putting out positive
incentives, whether it's

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:12.060
a funny piece of content that
you want to share or something

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.635
that you can physically
take away and experience.

00:25:14.635 --> 00:25:16.200
I gave out ring pops once.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.614
It really went over big.

00:25:17.614 --> 00:25:19.280
MIKE FARAH: Ring pops
are still moving--

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:19.410
KATE LILLY: Yes.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.360
MIKE FARAH: --the market, huh?

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.232
KATE LILLY: Yep.

00:25:21.232 --> 00:25:23.565
MIKE FARAH: She touched on
something I was going to say.

00:25:23.565 --> 00:25:25.500
I think the experience
is so important.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.940
Everyone's so busy.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.260
Everyone has a million shows
that they're supposed to watch.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.040
It's kind of just overwhelming.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.280
And so if you can
kind of crack it

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.860
by having something
really funny,

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.870
kind of in the
zeitgeist, something that

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.630
can rise to the top
and cut through.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.480
And then, whether it's just
that viewing experience or it's

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.230
a live experience, you're
hoping that a young person,

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.200
or any person for that
matter, is taking something

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.160
that makes it stick and
makes it a memorable thing

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.400
and makes that call to action,
whether there is one or not,

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.300
organic to them.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.030
Because they just felt
inspired by the experience.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.130
And so it's hard to do.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.070
And we don't get it
right all the time.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:11.220
But I think the combination
of our track record

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.340
and the talent we work with
and our voice and our ability

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.680
to either add to
the conversation

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.760
or help proactively
start the conversation

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.670
are some of the things
that we lean into.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:26.160
But it's not easy.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.980
We have a good track record.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.930
And what's actually interesting
is, even as we were building

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:33.810
out this national
campaign, it was

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:37.710
really hard to get
traditional political people

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:40.325
to get behind it.

00:26:40.325 --> 00:26:42.360
It was not part of
our business plan,

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.060
but we ended up really
financing the vast majority

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.400
of the entire Glam Up
the Midterms campaign,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.930
because we just
believed in it so much.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.520
But you know, it's a
different industry.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.920
And I think content
and creative,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:59.220
I think people in
the traditional space

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.830
really minimize it more than
they should because they're

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.920
just from a different era.

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.840
And so we're proud of
what we've built out.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.670
But we were actually hoping
to do even more and scale to--

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.730
I mean, at one time we
were talking about 30

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.570
plus districts.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.430
Now we'll end up in
probably seven or eight.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.755
So it's a very good effort.

00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:19.380
But it's definitely
an interesting path

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:22.020
to have these conversations
and make these pitches

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.237
and have really the
case studies behind it

00:27:24.237 --> 00:27:26.820
to show that these things work
in all the different ways we're

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.910
talking about.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.960
And even though we
weren't in Hollywood,

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.090
they just gave us
the Hollywood yes.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.680
Which is, like, oh, it's great.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.030
Let's keep talking.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:38.022
And then they wouldn't
get back to our emails.

00:27:38.022 --> 00:27:39.480
KATE LILLY: I'll
add one thing just

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.610
to respond directly
to your question.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.400
Which is that one big
difference we noticed--

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.460
and this was 2016
turning over into 2017--

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.710
whenever we released
a piece of content

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:53.520
that had some type of call
to action or messaging in it,

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.640
being present to
answer questions--

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.160
so for "Funny or Die,"
that's as simple as if you

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.520
go on our Facebook, you'll
see "Funny or Die" constantly

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:05.790
responds to comments--
being engaged and available

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.530
and not just shouting
something and not

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:12.660
being a presence to answer a
question or follow up on it

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.370
has made a huge
difference for us

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.370
in pushing people
towards doing something.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.666
Because for a long time, our
practice was you kind of just

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:22.290
put it out and you
make the next thing.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.915
You put it out and
make the next thing.

00:28:23.915 --> 00:28:26.700
And ever since we started that
level of engagement-- and kind

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.160
of like with your chat bot,
which I think is brilliant--

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.750
is you are there not just
to yell things at people,

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.480
you are there to engage and
help with any specific thing

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.160
that you might be
wondering about.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.577
KATHLEEN UNGER:
So VoteRiders is--

00:28:40.577 --> 00:28:41.451
[MICROPHONE TURNS ON]

00:28:41.451 --> 00:28:42.200
--sorry, hello.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:50.070
So VoteRiders is really
all about the facts, ma'am.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.700
All right?

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.850
We are voter ID central.

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.970
We focus like a
laser on ID to vote.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:04.200
So the messages
that we put out are

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.050
kind of a combination
of seven days a week.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:12.130
It's all the articles,
what's happening,

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:17.000
what is happening in that world
in every state and nationally.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.240
So people have
come to rely on it.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.430
They know that we
are the authority.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:23.145
Kate mentioned the word trust.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.850
VoteRiders was founded
almost 6 and 1/2 years ago.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:37.420
So people have come to trust
what they learn from us.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.400
They know that they're
always going to get it

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.720
from a nonpartisan perspective.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.070
As a matter of fact, frankly,
I'll go out of my way.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.770
When there's a good
article, I sometimes

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:53.920
change the title of the article
to make it less inflammatory,

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.850
if possible.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.820
You know, if the word
suppression's in it,

00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.071
I'll do whatever I
can to not use that.

00:30:01.071 --> 00:30:01.570
Because--

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.278
MIKE FARAH: I like to
use covert tactics.

00:30:03.278 --> 00:30:05.050
KATHLEEN UNGER: Yeah.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:07.664
It's a dog whistle for people.

00:30:07.664 --> 00:30:09.330
MIKE FARAH: Fake news
is very effective.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:10.163
KATHLEEN UNGER: Yes.

00:30:10.163 --> 00:30:12.700
[LAUGHS] But the
substance is real.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.920
So there's that.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.560
And we also, of
course, are responsive,

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.710
where we're basically
on Twitter and Facebook.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:30.540
And so that's the
most part that we are

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.880
and the voter stories
and all of that.

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:39.880
The last thing I'll
say is that when

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.380
I started this, if you
mentioned voter ID,

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.180
eyes would glaze over.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:50.380
People just didn't know
what that was and frankly,

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.410
didn't particularly care.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:53.680
Now they do.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.490
And it's now right sort of in
the center of the bull's eye.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:03.280
And so VoteRiders is
really on a rocket ship.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.177
So it's really fantastic.

00:31:06.177 --> 00:31:07.510
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: All right.

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.590
I'd like to get some questions.

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:11.932
We have our giant blue box.

00:31:11.932 --> 00:31:15.380
KATE LILLY: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.822
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: It
does need a better name.

00:31:17.822 --> 00:31:19.905
AUDIENCE: You didn't kill
someone today, good job.

00:31:19.905 --> 00:31:20.300
KATE LILLY: Is
that a microphone?

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:20.460
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: Yes.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.900
KATE LILLY: Of course,
it's a microphone.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.400
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.200
AUDIENCE: So one of you
mentioned whether you're

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.430
a Republican or a Democrat.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.580
So I'm interested to know
if you're not one of those.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.540
Because I am not.

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.660
I've never belonged to a party.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.280
And I have a lot
of friends that--

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.141
I actually did vote,
though, because I care.

00:31:38.141 --> 00:31:39.640
But I have a lot
of friends that are

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.420
either independent, third
party, and they're just

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:44.197
really apathetic.

00:31:44.197 --> 00:31:46.030
And so I'm wondering,
what do you recommend,

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:49.750
or what are you doing
to encourage that group.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:54.340
Because I don't really know
how to encourage my friends.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.530
MIKE FARAH: You haven't
tried shaming them yet?

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:57.970
AUDIENCE: Oh, yes, every day.

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.260
KATE LILLY: [INAUDIBLE]
has good tactics.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.182
That's a great question.

00:32:03.182 --> 00:32:03.890
MIKE FARAH: Yeah.

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:04.380
Next question.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.921
KATHLEEN UNGER: If
I could just say--

00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:10.510
when these folks show
their newest video,

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.790
you're going to see
what they're doing

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:17.590
to encourage the nonvoters, OK?

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.300
I think it's
incredibly effective.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.050
MIKE FARAH: It's a
really good question.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.720
And we've tried lots
of different things.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.880
In lots of ways, this hasn't
been good for our business.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.420
It would have been easier just
to not be political at all.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.670
KATE LILLY: Also be apathetic.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:32.800
Yeah.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.883
MIKE FARAH: Just to ignore
it-- everything in life

00:32:34.883 --> 00:32:36.850
is easier if you're apathetic.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.610
But that doesn't
mean life is better.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:41.260
So it's a choice that we made.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.070
And I think, broadly speaking,
we just try and connect

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.350
with people on their level.

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:50.480
And for friends, knowing
what your friends--

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.980
and we try and do it in a broad
way just by comedy that we

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.480
think is quality and that won't
turn that many people off--

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.165
but I think then,
it just becomes--

00:33:00.165 --> 00:33:02.290
that's what we're trying
a lot of different things.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:03.199
We're trying content.

00:33:03.199 --> 00:33:04.240
We're trying live events.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.180
We're trying the local activism.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:08.410
We're trying celebrities.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:12.460
Because you never know what
that guy or girl may respond to.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.830
So we're trying to kind
of present a little bit

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.870
of a portfolio approach
to see what may stick.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.160
Knowing, also, it
may not stick--

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.790
but if we can get that number
up, even just in a modest way

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:29.770
from 12% to higher than 12%--

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:32.864
to me, whether you're a
Democrat or Republican, to me,

00:33:32.864 --> 00:33:34.780
it's just really about
the democratic process.

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.260
KATE LILLY: It's
about the process.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:42.360
MIKE FARAH: And I think it only
works if people are engaged.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.986
And you can see from the current
state of affairs what happens

00:33:45.986 --> 00:33:47.110
when people aren't engaged.

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.600
Or rather, people
were engaged, and this

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.270
is what it got us because some
other folks weren't as engaged.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.550
So it's tricky.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.740
But if you believe in
it, eventually you just

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:05.470
have to say, give
people some options.

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:07.600
See what they respond to.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.960
And then lean into the thing
so that you can manipulate them

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.999
most effectively.

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:13.540
KATE LILLY: I was
going to say that I

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.980
think that's why the campaign
is as nonpartisan as possible.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.409
It's not about go
vote for this person

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:21.969
or go vote for that person.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:24.190
It's just go be
part of the process,

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:26.110
regardless of who you
vote for, regardless of

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.260
if they're one of the two main
parties that are on the ballot.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:32.590
Because not participating
in the process,

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.690
being apathetic to
the process, those

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.080
are the fastest ways-- for one,
for it to go away entirely,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.980
or for two, for the value
of it to keep decreasing

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.500
and to never have the chance
to improve the process, which

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.250
is flawed in so many ways.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.750
So I think that's, for us
at least, we do our best--

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.940
and if you watch any
"Funny or Die" content,

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.670
you'll see that we
try as hard as we

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:56.110
can to be to be nonpartisan.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.030
But we do lean in a
certain direction.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:00.820
But with this campaign,
specifically, it's

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:04.000
all about pushing out the
message of whatever you

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.794
do, go make a point that, by you
filling in a bubble, that you

00:35:09.794 --> 00:35:12.460
are important to the country and
that this process will continue

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.150
to be something that is
unique to us as Americans.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.370
Because we are afraid
of that not being

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:20.540
our future in five to 10 years.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:22.270
KATHLEEN UNGER:
And if I could just

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:29.530
pipe in here, what also we
do is so many people have

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.940
been asking us what can we do.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.770
People not only want
to vote, but they want

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:39.260
to be involved in the process.

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:44.380
So on our website under
the toolbar Get Involved,

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:49.390
you can fill out a
volunteer questionnaire.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:54.340
A couple of key things, areas
in which we're especially

00:35:54.340 --> 00:36:00.370
seeking folks, is for those who
will be virtual phone bankers

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:05.350
or text bankers, who we
will have a short training,

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:08.560
and then you'll be able to
follow up with these leads

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.860
that we're getting from our
partner organizations of people

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.550
who have voter ID questions
or who need assistance.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.880
So there's that, which
is really important.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:24.300
And then there's actually
reaching out to your networks,

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.180
all right?

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:29.530
It's to your networks, and
then asking your networks

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:32.350
to reach out to their
networks, et cetera,

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:37.760
to make sure that people
have the right ID to vote.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.950
You can easily, at
VoteRiders.org in the toolbar--

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:47.896
the second block is something
like Get Your Voter ID.

00:36:47.896 --> 00:36:49.270
You click on that,
and you'll see

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.510
that there's a page
for every state

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:57.070
and DC with our
voter cards on it,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:00.310
along with some
additional information.

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:03.400
Because it could be your
grandmother or your brother

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:09.670
or your niece or somebody in
your network whom you know

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:10.960
you're not thinking of.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.060
Well, yeah, does
my grandmother--

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.125
she's no longer driving--

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.874
is she in a state where
she needs an ID to vote?

00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:27.122
Hello-- good to check that out.

00:37:27.122 --> 00:37:28.705
NADINE FARID JOHNSON:
Other questions?

00:37:32.459 --> 00:37:33.000
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.120
That's too far.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.631
There's no way
I'm gonna do that.

00:37:35.631 --> 00:37:36.889
I'll try.

00:37:36.889 --> 00:37:37.555
KATE LILLY: Hey.

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:38.998
KATHLEEN UNGER: Oh!

00:37:38.998 --> 00:37:41.060
KATE LILLY: Got some
athletes in the house.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.226
AUDIENCE: I heard you mention
that you were focusing

00:37:43.226 --> 00:37:45.000
on seven or eight districts.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.820
Which ones are they, and
how did you choose them?

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:52.410
KATE LILLY: Well, we
worked with our team.

00:37:52.410 --> 00:37:56.610
We have an office that works out
of DC called Funny or Die DC.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:59.910
And we worked with that
team to identify areas

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:03.660
around the US that are
known for having low voter

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.990
turnout in specific
districts and kind of made

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:08.130
a priority list.

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:09.780
And then, from
there, it was just

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.430
about seeing watch
which organizations

00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:13.890
we could partner with
locally to produce

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:17.460
an event or a video that could
geotarget that specific area.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:22.290
So for us, we were in
San Diego, or Oceanside,

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:26.780
which was the video "California
49" that was back in May?

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:27.530
MIKE FARAH: April.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.660
KATE LILLY: April-- we did a
local event in Los Angeles.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.725
We brought everything to
DragCon, RuPaul's DragCon,

00:38:34.725 --> 00:38:37.830
to just help the wider LA area.

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:41.670
We will be in Detroit,
Michigan, which

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.480
is Michigan 11 on October 7th.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:50.280
And then we're hitting Phoenix,
Vegas, Milwaukee, and Houston.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.130
And our hope is to get one or
two more cities on the docket

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:55.576
in October, November.

00:38:55.576 --> 00:38:57.700
KATHLEEN UNGER: And if I
could just mention again--

00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:01.890
so we have VoteRiders voter
ID coalition coordinators,

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:07.690
including in Milwaukee and in
Phoenix and a terrific partner

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.920
also in Houston.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:14.230
So if we can do something
to assist your efforts.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.020
A lot of this is
about partnerships.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.440
That's really key to how
VoteRiders functions.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.300
OK?

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:23.740
I'm in Los Angeles.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.370
Again, California doesn't
have a state voter ID law.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:30.880
But what we do is we bring
our expertise to what

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.530
everybody else is doing--

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.010
so happy to do that.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:36.510
NADINE FARID JOHNSON:
Next question?

00:39:40.938 --> 00:39:42.037
KATHLEEN UNGER: Wow.

00:39:42.037 --> 00:39:43.620
MIKE FARAH: You guys
are used to this.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.328
KATE LILLY: Yeah.

00:39:44.328 --> 00:39:46.180
Did you guys practice?

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:49.140
AUDIENCE: So this question
is more for "Funny or Die."

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:54.060
So you are you planning to
reach out to the ethnic minority

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.540
communities?

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:01.020
KATE LILLY: You know, we're
not specifically targeting

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:03.720
any given majority or
minority community.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.500
It's all really
location based, at least

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.400
for what we've done so far.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.669
I think in general
we try everything

00:40:13.669 --> 00:40:15.960
we can to make sure that the
events or the videos we're

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.285
putting together have
cool, diverse people who

00:40:19.285 --> 00:40:20.910
are representing
different perspectives

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:23.790
and not just coming
from an LA, you

00:40:23.790 --> 00:40:26.610
know, somebody who's from LA or
New York, the coasts, somebody

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.400
who was necessarily
even born in America.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.310
So whether that's a performer on
stage or performer in a video,

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:34.275
that's really been
an effort for us.

00:40:34.275 --> 00:40:37.650
But I think, in general,
our target is a little bit

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.950
broader, which we're saying here
are the districts and cities

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:42.780
that we can focus in on.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:47.010
And some of those cities do have
minority populations in them,

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.260
which is definitely
part of the focus.

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:53.702
But we're not doing anything
specifically, I would say.

00:40:53.702 --> 00:40:54.410
MIKE FARAH: Yeah.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.680
I think company wide, diverse
content and inclusion--

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.810
both in front of the camera
and behind the camera--

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.360
is a huge priority for us.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.940
I think we've always
been a little bit

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.000
ahead of the curve there.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.040
But there's always
room for improvement.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.820
And I think also that the event
that Kate produced at DragCon--

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:15.440
are you guys familiar
with DragCon and RuPaul?

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.689
That was an amazing event.

00:41:16.689 --> 00:41:18.480
KATE LILLY: It was the
best day of my life.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.589
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:21.630
MIKE FARAH: This isn't
the best day of your life?

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:22.620
KATE LILLY: This is number two.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.302
MIKE FARAH: OK.

00:41:23.302 --> 00:41:25.001
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:25.001 --> 00:41:25.500
Yeah.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.080
She did an amazing job,
and Billy did a great job.

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.690
And that was direct
outreach, obviously.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:33.000
You know, there's lots
of different communities

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.870
at DragCon, but it obviously
overly indexes, probably,

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.960
with the LGBTQ community.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:45.240
And I'm certainly not aware of
another content presentation

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.010
and creative
presentation focused

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:49.410
on that community in
the way that we did it

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.420
earlier this year at DragCon.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.890
KATE LILLY: DragCon
was actually--

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.930
we were shocked to find that--

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:57.680
we basically put a
booth up and worked.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.240
We handed out these cards,
which we brought some

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.140
if anybody wants one.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.107
But it's just a "I will vote,
damn it!" commit to vote card,

00:42:04.107 --> 00:42:05.940
with some information
on the bottom on where

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.320
you can go to register to vote.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.630
And we handed them out.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:14.850
And I'd say 75% of the people
I talked to were, like, oh, no.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:15.740
I'm registered.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.240
Don't worry.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:16.830
I'm voting.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:19.410
And so it was interesting to
see such a community of people

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:20.550
who were really--

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:25.230
who, yes, were probably
a minority in some sense,

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.360
at least from the
LGBTQ community, who

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.630
all were very politically aware
and very active and very ready

00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:32.240
to say, I love that
you guys are here.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.280
But I'm already voting.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:33.780
Duh.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:36.815
So it was cool to be
in the middle of that.

00:42:36.815 --> 00:42:38.940
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: It's
confidence inducing, no?

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:39.180
KATE LILLY: Yeah.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:39.679
It is.

00:42:39.679 --> 00:42:41.489
You're, like, oh,
great, perfect!

00:42:41.489 --> 00:42:42.030
Thanks, guys.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.200
Thanks for doing our job.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.866
MIKE FARAH: It's not
all doom and gloom.

00:42:44.866 --> 00:42:47.280
Obviously, there's a lot of
young people that do care.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.410
And sometimes you got
to focus on those people

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:52.960
and just as we've been
saying encourage those folks

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:54.750
and make it a cool thing.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:59.559
And keep the faith.

00:42:59.559 --> 00:43:00.850
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: Question?

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:03.670
AUDIENCE: I have a
question for Kathleen.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:07.600
Where did the name
VoteRiders come from?

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.350
KATHLEEN UNGER: I don't
know if you're all

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:15.350
aware of a group called
the Freedom Riders,

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:18.630
going back to the '60s and '70s.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.440
And so it came from there.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:27.440
But within the name VoteRiders
is actually voter ID -ers.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.641
So it's--

00:43:29.641 --> 00:43:30.890
KATE LILLY: That is brilliant.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.390
KATHLEEN UNGER:
--it has that nice--

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.392
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:43:33.392 --> 00:43:34.100
KATE LILLY: Yeah.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.580
KATHLEEN UNGER: Yeah.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:36.110
Yeah.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:36.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.063
KATHLEEN UNGER: Thank you.

00:43:38.063 --> 00:43:40.400
AUDIENCE: I'm also kind of
curious as to whether or not,

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.191
now that you have this
nice collaboration--

00:43:42.191 --> 00:43:45.050
I'm assuming you weren't in
contact before this event--

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.080
but maybe "Funny or Die"
could do something funny

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.200
that would pull in
the voter ID stuff

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.789
as a collaborative effort?

00:43:52.789 --> 00:43:54.830
KATHLEEN UNGER: Gotta make
it fun, so love that--

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:57.965
MIKE FARAH: We should
have Google pay for it.

00:43:57.965 --> 00:43:59.340
KATE LILLY: Can
anyone greenlight

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.640
that in this audience?

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.598
MIKE FARAH: I think so.

00:44:01.598 --> 00:44:02.860
Let's get Sergei on the horn.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.905
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:05.905 --> 00:44:06.780
AUDIENCE: Here, Matt.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:07.270
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.560
AUDIENCE: Right here,
and then back there.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.330
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:10.530
AUDIENCE: This is
also for Kathleen.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:11.988
So you mentioned
you are partnering

00:44:11.988 --> 00:44:14.090
with a bunch of organizations
across the country.

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:17.090
Have you been partnering with
the major political parties

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.070
and the individual
campaigns to make sure

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:21.361
that their canvassers are
kind of getting the word out?

00:44:21.361 --> 00:44:22.970
Or has it been mostly
grassroots, kind

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:25.176
of nonpartisan organizations?

00:44:25.176 --> 00:44:26.870
KATHLEEN UNGER: So
thank you for asking.

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:31.450
So we do not partner
with partisan--

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:40.040
with candidates and
parties and all that.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.820
The way we handle that
is, if we're in a position

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:49.760
where we have the opportunity
to convey voter ID information

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.090
to someone like that, we do so.

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:57.380
And then proactively,
Google search

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:03.860
for their counterpart and
proactively reach out and tell

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.980
them about our existence
and what we have to offer

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:10.880
and that we'd be
very happy to help

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:18.410
any voters who might wish voter
ID information and assistance.

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:20.300
And just send them our way.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:26.190
So that's how we retain
our complete clean nose

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.139
nonpartisanship.

00:45:28.139 --> 00:45:29.180
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: OK.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.170
One more question.

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:34.030
AUDIENCE: Is it harder for
you to cut through the noise?

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.030
MIKE FARAH: Yeah, it is.

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:37.700
I mean, there is a high
volume of pretty good comedy

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.190
going on around the
current state of affairs.

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:44.840
And also, just the speed and
volume in which things happen

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:45.920
makes it really hard.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.503
KATE LILLY: Using Twitter as a
platform has changed everything

00:45:48.503 --> 00:45:50.205
in terms of a comedy response.

00:45:50.205 --> 00:45:51.540
MIKE FARAH: Yeah.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:53.090
So for a company
like "Funny or Die,"

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.830
we just have to kind
of pick our shots.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:59.810
We'll never have the resources
of an "SNL" or a "Stephen

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:01.985
Colbert Show" or
something like that.

00:46:01.985 --> 00:46:05.690
So it's a combination of social
and digital and live events.

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:09.020
A lot of our television shows--
we produce a show called "I

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.320
Love You, America" with
Sarah Silverman for Hulu,

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:13.310
which is a great--

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:18.440
thanks-- that's a great show
that is all about inclusion

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:22.490
and creating the conversation
between a very divisive country

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.155
right now.

00:46:24.155 --> 00:46:28.190
So I think because we can't
keep up with everything,

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:29.466
we kind of pick our shots.

00:46:29.466 --> 00:46:31.340
And that's some of the
stuff that Kate really

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.670
did a great job of managing
and evolving when we

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:36.759
had a committed digital team.

00:46:36.759 --> 00:46:38.300
It's figuring out
what are the things

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:42.050
that we can do that can kind
of stand out, whether it's

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:45.110
from a casting standpoint,
or a timeliness,

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:47.310
or just for a
social perspective.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.680
We wanted our voice out there.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.550
But hopefully with a
sensibility that didn't just

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:56.670
pile on, but hopefully, set the
tone in a few different ways.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.370
KATE LILLY: We also
changed our tactic

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:02.420
from previous
administrations, where

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.360
the news cycle wasn't so fast.

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.370
A big story would
drop on a Tuesday.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.740
And from our perspective,
you would have time

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.280
to write, cast, shoot,
release by Thursday.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.930
You could get it
done in 48 hours.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.566
But with this
administration, now there's

00:47:17.566 --> 00:47:18.440
a big story at 10:00.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.490
There's a big story at 2:00.

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:20.750
There's a big story at 5:00.

00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:22.820
And so you have
to change tactics

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:24.380
in how you respond to it.

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.560
One of those big pivots
was not worrying so much

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.170
about the topical
comedy response

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.149
that a lot of the shows
that Mike mentioned

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.690
were already set up
to be able to do.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:35.398
Like, they could have
a nightly response,

00:47:35.398 --> 00:47:37.952
or with "SNL" or John Oliver,
could have a weekly response

00:47:37.952 --> 00:47:39.410
to it and just
aggregate everything

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.576
that we had heard that week.

00:47:40.576 --> 00:47:44.750
We decided to do take
our focus towards things

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.450
that were kind of more
broad stroke, evergreen

00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:51.140
issues, or crazy things
about the campaign

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.780
that we could comment
on and make a really

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.500
funny piece of content around.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:59.240
So that was a huge
transition for us.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.140
And something that did
take, I mean, three months.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:05.950
I'd say from
December to March, we

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.880
were, like, how do we do this?

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.140
How do we do it fast enough?

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:09.920
How do we keep up?

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.890
How do we get our
voice out there?

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.470
And the pivot for
us became really

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:17.350
smart, unexpected things that
commented on broader issues

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:17.860
as one.

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.710
And then the other was just
making funny things that

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.050
weren't political because
people needed a break

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.180
and giving them something
else to just come

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.447
and watch and laugh at.

00:48:27.447 --> 00:48:28.780
NADINE FARID JOHNSON: All right.

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:30.140
Thank you all so much.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.630
This has been fantastic.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:34.550
Can we get a round
of applause please?

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.900
[APPLAUSE]
