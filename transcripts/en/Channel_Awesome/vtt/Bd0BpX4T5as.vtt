00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.500
Hello. I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember so you don't have to and welcome to another rendition of WTR, aka, "Was That Real?"

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.200
*Catchy Theme Music*

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.940
This is where we look at TV shows that are forgotten by some, but remembered by others for just how strange they were...

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.360
And I apologize if I don't exactly seem like I'm on top of things. I haven't slept in a bit...

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.400
...I haven't shaven or anything like that. It's just that uh....

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.160
...the character we're gonna talk about today,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.100
I have had a few, uh...

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.640
...run-ins with.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.680
*Doug gets bitten in the unmentionables by an unsettlingly cute teddy bear*

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.680
*Screams in agony*

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.220
Yeah, so when I heard I was gonna talk about his live-action series this week. I just want to take the proper precautions-AIR!!!!

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.220
*Shoots at nothing in particular*

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.949
Like I said, I'm a little on-edge.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.580
As some of you know "Teddy Ruxpin" was a disturbing he** spawn of a toy that was one step away from

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.420
Skynet watching your kid.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.780
It was supposed to be comforting,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.380
But it scared the shizz out of every parent who bought it!

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.380
Even Robin Williams made jokes about it!

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.880
*Robin Williams doing comedy*

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.760
So it only made sense to have this terrifying teddy even MORE alive with a live-action show.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.650
Though to be fair, this is only really a pilot and even then not technically that.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.140
You see they wanted to do a live-action series based on the stories that your robot was reading your kids to bed with.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.460
But, when they shot the first extended episode,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.050
it proved to be too expensive, so they eventually turned it into an animated series and this ran as the ABC movie of the week

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.290
because

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.440
Wouldn't you want to look at this before going to sleep?

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.270
The funny thing about it is that in a strange way, you can see why was so expensive.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.180
I mean, nothing looks realistic per se...

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.610
...but it does look like the toys literally started walking giving our therapists countless hours of employment.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.539
One of the reasons is that they get a pretty big name, and effects, to do it.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.170
Lynette Eklund has practical effects credits under her belt, like "Beetle Juice", "Pee-Wee's Playhouse", the "Jurassic Park" sequels.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.619
"Honey, I Blew Up the Baby", and has even commissioned for some impressive cosplay.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.320
So like I said, the props and designs for a kids show, and what was required at least, are pretty impressive.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.750
But that doesn't mean the show is....

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.180
...well...good.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.100
It starts off in the Realm of Weird when horrifying Mama Bear is singing a song to Baby Teddy.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.179
I think she's literally holding a Teddy Ruxpin doll.

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.110
Mama Bear: Come Truuuuuueeeeeeeee....

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.699
Nostalgia Critic as Mama Bear: Did you enjoy your breaded Goldilocks? Mine was too cold.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.420
*Close-Up of Baby Teddy opening his shnoz and slowly closing his eyes*

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.040
And in case you're wondering, no, she serves no purpose to the story whatsoever!

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.889
We see she has a map and an amulet, but she never does anything with it

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.520
and Teddy says no one in his town or family ever goes on adventures.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.680
He doesn't even mention her giving it to him or anything

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.440
Teddy: Illiads(?) aren't very adventurous.  At least, they haven't been for many generations.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.720
If I had this shizzz the whole time and never utilized it, I'd be pissed!!!!

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.000
Yeah, I'll dedicate my life to you you little *******!!!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.420
I could have been treasure hunting and making millions, but instead I'm raising your dead-eyed ***!!!

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.840
You'd better live out my dreams, you demonic rabbit's foot!

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.980
We cut to 15 years later, where we see Teddy and his caterpillar friend, Grubby

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.340
(Clearly, caterpillar milk has a lot of growth hormones), out to find themselves that treasure, mentioned earlier.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.160
Grubby: You didn't tell me that adventure seeking would be this hard on my feet.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.440
Nostalgia Critic: "I don't know, Davey". (What is that a reference to, anyways?)

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.180
But they come across other rejected "Mario" world characters who try to eat them up.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.900
*SCREAMING IN FEAR*

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.020
Teddy Ruxpin: They're going to catch us!!! Go faster, Grubby!

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.900
Grubby: I'm trying! I'm trying!

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.100
Nostalgia Critic: Well, they WOULD catch you if they didn't just stop at the camera!

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.899
Maybe they saw a salesman selling hands so they can have an activity to do before going to bed.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.900
You'd be pissed off if you were them too!

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.549
But they come across an old man who saves them.

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.340
This is your generic bumbling and fender who's so traditional you could just call him Gimmick.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.680
"You can call meh Gimmick!"

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.200
Nostalgia Critic as Gimmick: These are meh kids, Pawn and Tool!

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.560
But it looks like an evil villain, named Tweeg is also looking for the treasure as his plan to turn buttermilk into gold doesn't seem to be working.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.440
Tweeg: I can't actually make gold out of Buttermilk!):

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440
Nostalgia Critic: I can't imagine why not.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.820
He seems to be the villain in all of this, but much like the mother, he seems entirely pointless.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.980
He's always just off to the side saying, "D'oh!", and "Curses!"

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.280
Even when the heroes are right in front of him, he doesn't seem to do anything of threat.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.800
Gimmick: He is, without a doubt, the world's worst shot!

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.480
*Tweeg sighs a manly sigh of sadness.*

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.960
Nostalgia Critic: He's kind of as ineffective as the Grinch, if he shaved and made the voice of Captain Hook.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.400
"I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN HEH WAHNTED TAH STEEL MAH FORMULAHH!!!"

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.189
Nostalgia Critic: But the inventor uses an airship to travel to the treasure, while these beaked testicles voice their disgust.

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.189
Beaked Spheres: *tsk*I KNEW IT! *tsk* *tsk*

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.039
Nostalgia Critic: Well, THAT seemed needed.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.340
They crash into a tree, where a fairy, who I swear sounds like Judy Garland on quaaludes...

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.459
Fairy Garland: "And I suppose there's no such thing as a big bag of AIR stuck in my tree?!"

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.680
Nostalgia Critic: ...and is it me, or is her knowledge of technological aviation pretty damn advanced?

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.880
Garland Fairy: You DO understand the simple basics of Aerodynamics, don't you?

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.520
In order for your airship to move in any given direction, you must apply a force in an opposite direction, such as in this large manually driven propeller

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.700
then you will have to know something about the effect of wind, and various aspects of navigation.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.940
Nostalgia Critic: Christ, Did you teach at a community college?

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.720
I know, it's like she flies so she would already know something about it, but, then again, she flies!!!

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.549
Why would you need to know anything about it? Oh, well. Maybe this awkwardly long goodbye scene will make up for it.

00:05:51.549 --> 00:05:53.540
Garland Fairy: "BYE!"

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.780
*Seven seconds of awkward waving*

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.440
*Nostalgia Critic becomes unsettled and confused by Disney-esque music coming from ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE!!!!*

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.020
*MORE AWKWARD WAVING!!!!*

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.020
*Nostalgia Critic shrugs in annoyed disbelief at what he is watching.*

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.160
*Aaaand more awkward waving from the Garland Fairy..*

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.300
Nostalgia Critic: Please? The ending to "Return of the King" said "goodbye" faster than this!!!

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.960
But they come across Rock Biters. Turds who decide to put Grubby to work, but place the others in the dungeon!

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.440
Rock Turd Biter: "Put this one to work, and take the other two to the dungeon!"

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.280
Nostalgia Critic: Man, I know that's a prejudice some kind. I just don't know who's supposed to be offended, or why?

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.680
They're locked up with a guy named prince Aaron who is looking for his kidnapped sister.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.780
Because NATURALLY, a prince would do so on his own, and have no qualified professionals for the task.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.280
Prince Aaron: "I've been here for a LONG time!"

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.460
But they escape, and agree to help Aaron find his sister.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.620
This leads us to a giant purple monster who wants to help.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.340
Purple Barney Ripoff: "Did you say 'a PRINCESS'??? How come she's lost?"

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.280
Prince Aaron: "Well actually, she's been kidnapped".

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.320
Purple Barney Ripoff: "Why would ANYONE kidnap a princess??? That's bad!!!"

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:06.060
Nostalgia Critic as Purple Barney Ripoff: "I mean, from a storytelling perspective, it seems so tired and cliche!!!"

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.779
"Hey, Timon! We're on another 'Royal Forest' bloodline again!!!"

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.280
Nostalgia Critic: He advises them to see the wizard, who it turns out, is just a faker using lights and projecting effects,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.180
which leads them to a giant castle, where they dress up like soldiers to save a girl.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.620
*Gee, this sounds like "The Wizard of Oz".

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.070
Think we all know who needs to do some proper suing!

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.940
You gotta get out more.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.680
I love the fact, by the way, that the wizard lets everybody in, EXCEPT the purple monster!

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.320
He doesn't even give a reason!

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.740
Wizard: "YOU stay outside. The rest of you, come in".

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.780
Why is prejudice so bizarrely okay in this world? It's okay. He actually loves purple monsters

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.349
You can tell by this post with him eating purple monster food.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.840
Tweeg also arrives there as, what a coincidence, the treasure is there, too.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.170
Tweeg: "Why does this always have to happen to me????"

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.080
"They're landing"... *smiles in a way that would make any child or parent feel uncomfortable*

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.440
*Uh...whut the frack was that???*

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:06.300
Nostalgia Critic: Did he just howl like a wolf, or did somebody open a box of "Cookie Crisp"?

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.920
They all sneak in to try and rescue the sister.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.680
Gimmick:..."And we've been ordered to take her out of here"...

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:26.000
???????????whatamiwatching???????????

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.399
So in the scene...

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:33.879
I still don't really get it, they connect the medallion, saying only the purest spirit may find the treasure of knowledge

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.249
This leads to a bunch of treasures being revealed,

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.569
But they instead take these crystals that each have a word written on them on them...

00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:43.209
Bravery

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:45.759
Teddy Ruxpin: "Friendshiiiiiiiip"

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:48.009
*Insert reference I don't get but Nostalgia Critic does get here*

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.130
Teddy Ruxpin: "Let's go!"

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.560
Tweeg: "Hey, Alby, where do you suppose they're going? And what are those things that carrying?"

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.680
Nostalgia Critic: Those are excellent questions we are REFUSING to answer. Enjoy what we wrote on our lunch break!!!

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.129
Of course the treasure disappears for Tweeg, because...

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.829
Something about being true to your bull****. I don't know... and they get back safe the brother and sister

00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:14.938
Go home, and Grubby does this uncomfortable hand gesture, and we get another overly long

00:09:14.939 --> 00:09:21.359
goodbye as they sail to Ronald McDonald Land.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.229
Rest your arm, you WEIRD PEOPLE!!!!!

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.940
So, it was...about what you would expect.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:41.479
It's difficult to be hard on it, as it's clearly meant for little little kids and again, for the budget

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.039
they probably had, the puppets are pretty well done, as well as some of the sets...

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.920
...but...it is what it is.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:55.230
A good-meaning, but still creep-inducing show that'll happily haunt your marijuana high for years to come.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:55.730
But at least now you know it existed.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.519
There was probably a fair amount of work that went into it, and it's...

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.349
....moving pictures with sounds. You gotta give it that. It's moving pictures with sounds.

00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:06.529
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, and....

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.049
*whispers* I'm going to leave very quietly.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.300
*Ominous music builds tension as Nostalgia Critic bolts to safety...*

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.100
*"RUN, FORREST, RUN!!!!"*

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:17.980
*Slams Door*

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.080
Nostalgia Critic: Huh. How about that? There was no danger. I was building all that up for nothing!

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.080
*Snickers*

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.800
That's life.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.760
*Are you telling me you built all that up for NOTHING???*

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.260
*I FEEL CHEATED!!!*

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:38.920
*I WANT A REFUND, NOSTALGIA CRITIC!!!*

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.420
*Oh, wait. This video is free. Never mind. Nostalgia Critic, I do respect you, and the jokes I made in this video were all in fun. Well done on this review!!!*

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:04.160
*I love this theme music...it is so cinematic!!!*

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.160
*YES, THEME MUSIC!!! PLAY ON!!!!*

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.080
*This channel really IS awesome!!!*

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.300
Nostalgia Critic: Coming next week is the review of Wild Wild West...

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.490
...Yeehaw...

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:25.990
But you can see it now on your Vessels ad-free early access! just three dollars a month to see tons of people's videos early

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.769
...as well as a bunch of other extra features. Check it out, and get the early scoop!

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:40.690
Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the charity shout out this week!  We are not doing the round Macdowell House. That's also a good charity...

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.380
We are doing Scholarship America. This charity's mission is to mobilize

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:53.000
America through scholarships, and educational support, to make post-secondary success possible for all students.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.780
Their vision is to be the nationally recognized leader in providing private scholarships, and other financial support to make the

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.260
