find both uses for them in both

structured and unstructured data so

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:02.570
structured and unstructured data so
 

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.020
structured and unstructured data so
neural networks have transformed

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.030
neural networks have transformed
 

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.850
neural networks have transformed
supervised learning and are creating

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:06.860
