00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.234
Green: Hi.
Welcome.

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:03.434
I'm Brad Green.

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:05.267
I'm the manager
of Accessibility Engineering

00:00:05.267 --> 00:00:06.801
at Google and...

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:08.267
Rosenthal:
And I'm Erin Rosenthal,

00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:09.701
the Product Manager
for Accessibility.

00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:10.901
Green: Fantastic.

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.567
So we're gonna talk
a little bit about

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.767
what accessibility means
in products

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:17.367
and how we can use features
that are built in

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:19.601
to the platforms
that Google offers.

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:21.133
Erin, can you go
to the next slide?

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:22.934
Okay. So just a couple
of questions.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:24.367
How many of you
have some experience

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:27.634
with accessibility technology
already?

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.567
Okay. A little more than half.
That's fantastic.

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:31.868
How many of you are actually
responsible for building

00:00:31.868 --> 00:00:34.601
accessibility
into your products?

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.267
A couple of us.
Okay, keep your hands up.

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:38.734
How many of you know the
current gaps in your products

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:41.167
and know how to fix them?

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:42.634
Okay. Fair number. Okay.

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:45.634
So that's what we're here
to talk about.

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:48.501
We're gonna, first of all,
talk a little bit about

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:50.968
some--
what users expect

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:52.801
or are looking for
in accessible products.

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.734
And I'll just make a point

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.968
that we're gonna go into
some particular use cases

00:00:56.968 --> 00:00:59.601
but the range of accessibility
is wide.

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:01.534
There are a lot of
different use cases,

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:04.734
ways that we'd like to make
our applications accessible.

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:07.934
What we're gonna talk about
forms a framework

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:10.300
for many different modes
of accessibility, um,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.367
that users can take advantage of
in your apps.

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:15.834
We're gonna talk about
how you build accessibility

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:19.634
specifically in our products
Chrome and Android.

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:22.601
And then we're gonna show you
what tools we have

00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.901
to both build and test
these applications.

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:28.033
We're gonna follow with
some cool demos.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:31.300
We're gonna show you what we
think are inspirational

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.000
applications that show off

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.801
some of the best features
in accessibility.

00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:38.000
Rosenthal: So you're
probably asking yourself--

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.434
granted, most of you
seem to know

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:40.901
a lot about accessibility
already--

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.567
but a lot of people ask,
"Why should I care?

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:44.868
Why should I make
my product accessible?"

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:46.300
Well, there's a number
of reasons.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.467
Number one is actually
it makes financial sense

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:49.868
for your company.

00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:52.701
The government and education
tend to have requirements

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:55.601
for accessibility in the
products that they purchase,

00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:57.300
and they're very large
contracts,

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.367
very large groups that you can
sell your products into.

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:01.934
So it's really important
to make sure

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:03.334
that your products
are accessible

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:05.033
so that you can compete
in that marketplace

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:08.300
and get them as large-paying
customers, right?

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.033
The main reason
that government and education

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:12.767
want products
to be accessible

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:15.968
are so that students
can continue to learn

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.167
and learn alongside
sighted students

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:19.968
and hearing students
in school

00:02:19.968 --> 00:02:24.467
and so that as people grow
and move into the workplace

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:26.534
that they can continue to work
alongside their peers

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:28.667
in companies like ours,
right?

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:31.534
Also, I know for me,

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:33.767
it always helps me
when I work on something

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:36.033
that enables people
to do something

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:37.667
they weren't able
to do before.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:39.167
That feels great,

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.434
and I like working on
accessibility because of that,

00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:43.701
that it's really--it's a good
feel-good thing, right?

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:46.000
You know, so you can see that
people weren't able to do this,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.033
and now they can.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.467
Wonderful.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:51.801
Also, there's a lot of
additional technology benefit

00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:53.267
to making your products
accessible.

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:56.834
A lot of underlying technologies
that you put into your products

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:58.968
will benefit you
in other ways.

00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:01.734
So for example,
with Android,

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:03.701
when we were making it
accessible,

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:05.901
we added a text to speech
engine.

00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:07.834
Well, later that came in handy

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.534
as a way to do
driving directions

00:03:09.534 --> 00:03:11.033
in the maps application.

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.501
We already had
the text engine there,

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:13.801
so it could just
rely on it there.

00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:15.434
Green: That's right, Erin.
As a matter of fact,

00:03:15.434 --> 00:03:17.434
there's a lot of other places
where accessibility

00:03:17.434 --> 00:03:19.300
is kind of like a moon mission.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.534
The technologies we develop

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.501
that are for helping people
access the platform

00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:26.167
are usable to everybody.

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:28.234
Matter of fact,
they help all of your users.

00:03:28.234 --> 00:03:30.000
For example,
in keyboard access,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.601
we as developers, we rely
heavily on keyboard shortcuts.

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:36.400
Adding keyboard access
to your applications

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.133
may be the number one thing
for web apps

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:40.133
that you can do
to make it more accessible.

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:43.167
Not just for folks who might
not be able to use a mouse,

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:44.367
but for everybody.

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:45.467
Like I want a hot key

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:47.634
for almost every one
of the special--

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:50.968
every one of the use cases
that I have in an application.

00:03:50.968 --> 00:03:54.234
There are some technologies
like text to speech

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.634
and speech recognition
that were once thought of

00:03:56.634 --> 00:03:59.601
as exotic interface elements--

00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:00.868
are now becoming commonplace.

00:04:00.868 --> 00:04:02.400
You notice on Android

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.300
I can add a speech
recognition element, um...

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.534
to take input.

00:04:08.534 --> 00:04:10.767
Also on many devices,

00:04:10.767 --> 00:04:13.100
we have the ability
to give vibrational feedback,

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.334
what we call haptics.

00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:15.968
And video game developers
found out

00:04:15.968 --> 00:04:17.367
if they made
the controller vibrate

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:19.667
when different events happen
in the UI,

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:21.868
it becomes a much more
real experience.

00:04:21.868 --> 00:04:24.467
The same is true
for my applications

00:04:24.467 --> 00:04:28.367
when I can give some input
to the user that's not--

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:30.100
doesn't need to be overt.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.834
I can make the device vibrate

00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:34.367
and make it seem like
a real part of my world.

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:36.934
When I caption video streams,

00:04:36.934 --> 00:04:39.734
it not only opens up the video

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:41.701
to folks who can't hear,

00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:43.868
it allows me to do
really interesting things--

00:04:43.868 --> 00:04:45.801
like you can run the captions

00:04:45.801 --> 00:04:47.767
through a service
like Google Translate,

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:49.634
and all of a sudden,
all of the people

00:04:49.634 --> 00:04:51.400
who aren't native speakers

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.167
can now access
the video content.

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:58.133
Customizable UIs,
as one example--

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:00.434
in Gmail, I can set my theme

00:05:00.434 --> 00:05:03.901
and be able to set...

00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:07.267
theme elements, backgrounds,
contrast, colors

00:05:07.267 --> 00:05:10.067
might be kind of a nice thing,
personalization--

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:12.033
adding bling
to my environment--

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:15.734
might be actually
also required for some folks

00:05:15.734 --> 00:05:17.701
who need different contrast,
different colors,

00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:19.868
different magnification
in my application.

00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:22.601
Testability, finally.

00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:25.267
Turns out that if I'm building
an automated test,

00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:28.467
it has a lot of the same needs
that, say, a blind user needs.

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:30.467
Like my automated test
can't use the mouse

00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:33.067
and usually
can't read the screen,

00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:36.067
and so these
accessibility features

00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:40.567
form a very stable API
for me to build

00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:42.434
automated tests against.

00:05:42.434 --> 00:05:43.834
Let's go next.

00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:46.133
Rosenthal: So let's talk
a little bit about the users,

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:48.968
people who use
accessible technology.

00:05:48.968 --> 00:05:51.100
It's really important
for you to understand them

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.000
and how they interact
with your products,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
just like all your other
users, right?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.534
So the main thing
to keep in mind

00:05:57.534 --> 00:05:59.701
are the input and output
technologies that they use

00:05:59.701 --> 00:06:02.367
and making sure that you have
multiple redundant ways

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:04.067
of interacting
with your applications--

00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:06.234
basically not relying
on a mouse,

00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:07.734
not relying on rollovers

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:09.033
to be able to get
to your content.

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:11.133
So main ones to keep in mind

00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:14.200
are for input using
keyboard and voice and touch,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.100
and then some special
purpose displays

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.400
like this Braille display
that we have pictured here

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.033
where you can do corded input.

00:06:20.033 --> 00:06:21.634
And then also for feedback--

00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:23.400
feedback's really vital
so that your user knows

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.734
where they are on the screen

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:26.000
and what
they're interacting with

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.868
at all points in time, right?

00:06:27.868 --> 00:06:29.467
So you should
make sure to have, again,

00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:30.868
redundant feedback as well.

00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:33.567
So not only have speech
but other audio cues

00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:38.100
for when tasks complete or other
notifications are happening,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.767
and also vibration feedback,

00:06:39.767 --> 00:06:41.434
so that you get
that sense of reality

00:06:41.434 --> 00:06:43.000
when you're using the product.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.934
Plus, keep in mind other things
like the Braille display

00:06:44.934 --> 00:06:46.634
that we have here
as another input--

00:06:46.634 --> 00:06:50.267
or output device,
in this case.

00:06:50.267 --> 00:06:52.634
Green: Okay. So we've got
a list of a couple things,

00:06:52.634 --> 00:06:54.000
some sort of rules of thumb

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.334
for making accessible
applications...

00:06:56.334 --> 00:06:58.834
how to think about
what sort of features

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:00.601
I need to pay attention to
as a developer.

00:07:00.601 --> 00:07:02.367
First of all,
I kind of mentioned this.

00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:04.067
Make sure
that all of my use cases

00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:07.367
can actually be completed
without using a pointing device.

00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:09.000
How do I do this?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.901
Well, I unplug my mouse,

00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:12.467
and I try and use
the application.

00:07:12.467 --> 00:07:15.133
Usually, this means
that I'll have implemented

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:17.434
keyboard shortcuts
that I make sure that the--

00:07:17.434 --> 00:07:19.968
if it's a web app,
that the tab order makes sense

00:07:19.968 --> 00:07:21.634
and that I can actually
focus on

00:07:21.634 --> 00:07:23.834
every element on the screen.

00:07:23.834 --> 00:07:27.901
I also want to make sure
that I am managing focus well

00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:29.234
inside my application.

00:07:29.234 --> 00:07:31.968
For example,
if I'm using HTML

00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:34.567
to simulate a modal dialog,

00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:37.033
I wanna make sure that
I'm actually trapping events

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:39.567
so that if the user's trying
to tab through the elements

00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:42.634
that they can't actually
reach the elements

00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:47.133
that are behind my, uh,
my floating dialog box.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.167
If you want more information
on this,

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:51.267
we've got a session tomorrow
which does a deep dive

00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:54.100
on building accessible
HTML applications.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:59.000
Depending on whether I'm on
Android or on the web,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.434
there are several
declarative ways

00:08:01.434 --> 00:08:03.834
that I can tell
assistive technologies

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:05.868
how to interact
with my application--

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:08.634
in the markup in the XML
for my Android application

00:08:08.634 --> 00:08:11.634
or in the HTML
for my web-based application.

00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:13.167
We'll go into a little bit
of this,

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:16.467
uh, and we have talks here
at I/O that go

00:08:16.467 --> 00:08:19.367
much more into depth
on both of these.

00:08:19.367 --> 00:08:21.701
And then lastly,
for me as a developer,

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:25.300
if I'm building
custom controls--

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.968
things that aren't part
of the standard widget set--

00:08:27.968 --> 00:08:30.400
either on Android
or if I'm, you know,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.234
putting a bunch of DIVs together
to look like

00:08:32.234 --> 00:08:35.968
some kind of crazy new control
in HTML,

00:08:35.968 --> 00:08:38.200
I'm gonna have to do a little
bit of extra work

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.400
to add accessibility
support there.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.634
And finally,
uh, I just need to test it.

00:08:43.634 --> 00:08:45.133
Um, it's--it's--

00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:47.868
Uh, it's certainly disappointing
if I make--

00:08:47.868 --> 00:08:49.534
put a lot of--
put some work into

00:08:49.534 --> 00:08:52.000
making my application
to be accessible

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.234
and then find out that
maybe my login screen

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:55.334
is not accessible.

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:56.567
So I want to make sure
that I test

00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:59.801
all the flows with the--
uh, assistive technologies

00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:03.133
that I'm targeting.

00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:04.868
Rosenthal: So what we're really
talking about here

00:09:04.868 --> 00:09:06.467
are creating these
empowering products

00:09:06.467 --> 00:09:07.868
that enable independence.

00:09:07.868 --> 00:09:10.100
These are products that work
out of the box,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.400
are easy to use,
that someone can set up

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.634
on their self--
by themselves,

00:09:14.634 --> 00:09:17.200
and that are really easy
to learn and, um,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.868
provide that good feedback
so that they

00:09:18.868 --> 00:09:20.868
can get familiar
with the environment.

00:09:20.868 --> 00:09:22.934
Um, this is such
a liberating feeling,

00:09:22.934 --> 00:09:24.467
being able to do this
all on your own,

00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:26.000
and it's really the right
thing to do.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.200
Um, also, as Brad said,
keep in mind

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.701
to test your entire product
and not just think of,

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:32.634
like, the main part
of your interface,

00:09:32.634 --> 00:09:34.834
but that from login
through documentation

00:09:34.834 --> 00:09:37.000
and even your help center,
that all of that

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.300
is also accessible.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.067
Green: Okay, I want to take
a little bit of a closer look

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:47.334
at building web applications
and what makes those accessible.

00:09:47.334 --> 00:09:49.667
So if we get
in the way-back machine

00:09:49.667 --> 00:09:52.901
and think back to the '90s
when the web was simple,

00:09:52.901 --> 00:09:55.634
uh, how many of you
used Mosaic?

00:09:55.634 --> 00:09:57.434
Oh, a bunch of us are old.

00:09:57.434 --> 00:09:58.567
Okay, good.

00:09:58.567 --> 00:10:02.667
Um, accessibility
back then, uh,

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:04.267
was a simple problem.

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:05.868
Um, usually app--
uh, you know,

00:10:05.868 --> 00:10:07.067
web pages looked like this.

00:10:07.067 --> 00:10:08.434
It was a bunch of text
and links

00:10:08.434 --> 00:10:09.901
and maybe some images.

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:13.801
And accessibility meant adding
alt tags to images.

00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:15.501
Matter of fact,
lot of us used alt tags

00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:17.367
when my modem was too slow.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.267
I'd turn images off and I'd just
read what the alt tags said.

00:10:20.267 --> 00:10:21.934
But the world has changed.

00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:24.133
Now even our most
simple applications

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:26.801
like Google Search have become
very rich and interactive,

00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:29.567
so that as I'm typing,
Google Search updates

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:31.667
my complete set
of search results.

00:10:31.667 --> 00:10:34.033
So we need to think differently
about how we're providing

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.767
accessibility
to these interactive,

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:38.267
dynamically-updating
applications.

00:10:38.267 --> 00:10:40.300
They've gotten even more complex
and interesting

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.934
with apps like Google Gmail
and Google Calendar.

00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:46.501
Uh, and, uh, like,
you name it.

00:10:46.501 --> 00:10:47.868
There's so many apps out there
who are--

00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:49.634
who have even richer interfaces.

00:10:49.634 --> 00:10:52.300
So, as I mentioned,
one of the first things

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.300
we want to do is make sure
that I can access

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.033
all of the workflows in my
application via the keyboard.

00:10:59.033 --> 00:11:00.701
Gmail, for example,
has a great set

00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:03.567
of keyboard shortcuts
that give me access

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:06.434
to some of the most
common actions.

00:11:06.434 --> 00:11:08.634
Uh, some of the other actions
I'll need to be able

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:11.234
to complete via other
keyboard focusing,

00:11:11.234 --> 00:11:12.801
uh, by tabbing through
the application

00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:16.000
and activating
through the keyboard.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.200
I also talked a little bit
about that there

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.067
is specific markup that
I can add to my HTML page.

00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:23.901
In, uh--
In the web,

00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:25.467
there is a standard
called ARIA.

00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:29.667
And ARIA gives me the ability
to tell assistive technologies

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:31.534
like screen readers
and Braille devices

00:11:31.534 --> 00:11:33.501
how to interact with my UI.

00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:36.200
So in my toolbar example
I have here,

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.033
I've, uh, marked it up
so that my images,

00:11:40.033 --> 00:11:42.567
which are what a, uh--
someone who's using the mouse

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.634
would interact with--
so that if I'm using

00:11:44.634 --> 00:11:47.601
a screen reader,
I can know that that "b"

00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:50.234
up there is not
just an image,

00:11:50.234 --> 00:11:52.234
but it should be interacted
with as a button,

00:11:52.234 --> 00:11:53.601
so that a screen reader
can announce

00:11:53.601 --> 00:11:54.767
that this is a button.

00:11:54.767 --> 00:11:55.868
Matter of fact,
it has a label

00:11:55.868 --> 00:11:57.834
that's specified
by my alt text there

00:11:57.834 --> 00:12:03.734
that this will turn the text
that I have selected bold.

00:12:03.734 --> 00:12:05.200
All right.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.400
So, specifically,
what is Google doing to help?

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.133
Uh, I have a couple
announcements today.

00:12:10.133 --> 00:12:12.467
I'm very excited to talk
about three things.

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:15.200
First, in Chrome, uh,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.300
yesterday, we just blogged
that we are adding support

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:21.267
for some of the major
screen readers on Windows

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:26.534
with JAWS and NVDA on Mac
with voiceover

00:12:26.534 --> 00:12:30.601
and, uh, uh,
and several others.

00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:33.701
On ChromeOS,
you can't actually install

00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:36.834
other software except
via extensions.

00:12:36.834 --> 00:12:38.467
And so we're making available

00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:41.667
a screen reader we call
ChromeVox.

00:12:41.667 --> 00:12:45.200
And we're making it available
to you developers early

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.100
through a download,
so you cannot only use it

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.767
via ChromeOS,
but you can actually install it

00:12:49.767 --> 00:12:52.801
in any version of Chrome
and use it on Windows

00:12:52.801 --> 00:12:56.000
or Mac or Linux so that you
can see what it's like

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.601
to interact with your
application

00:12:57.601 --> 00:12:59.400
using a screen reader.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.601
We'll take a look at this
a little bit closer

00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:02.968
later with a demo.

00:13:02.968 --> 00:13:04.501
And then lastly,
uh,

00:13:04.501 --> 00:13:06.501
we know a lot of you
photon-dependent users--

00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:08.133
'cause you use the screen--

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:11.200
uh, like to see
what things look like.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.167
So we've built an application
called ChromeShades.

00:13:14.167 --> 00:13:16.701
And what ChromeShades does
is it shows you

00:13:16.701 --> 00:13:19.501
what your application looks like
to a screen reader

00:13:19.501 --> 00:13:21.334
and it allows you
to explore your application

00:13:21.334 --> 00:13:23.801
visually but in the
sort of linear fashion

00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:26.667
that a screen reader would
interact with your application.

00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:28.033
We'll take a little
look at that,

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:30.133
and if you want a deeper dive,
please come see us

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:33.367
in the developer sandbox.

00:13:33.367 --> 00:13:36.934
Okay, so, uh,
what does ChromeVox do for me?

00:13:36.934 --> 00:13:38.367
Um, for those of you
who aren't familiar

00:13:38.367 --> 00:13:41.334
with a screen reader, it does
a lot of the same things.

00:13:41.334 --> 00:13:43.667
Uh, provides foken--
spoken feedback

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:45.667
as I navigate
through the application.

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:48.234
It uses ARIA,
which we just looked at,

00:13:48.234 --> 00:13:50.567
and other accessibility
standards.

00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:53.934
And it helps me work with
dynamic web applications

00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:55.701
that we're now seeing,
uh,

00:13:55.701 --> 00:13:58.133
by giving me,
uh, dynamic updates.

00:13:58.133 --> 00:14:02.000
It tells me when things change
on the web page.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.501
So there are some cases where
I want information spoken to me

00:14:06.501 --> 00:14:08.834
and there are some cases
where I don't want,

00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:11.467
uh, kind of the intrusive voice
to come up,

00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:13.234
but I want maybe just some
audio indicator.

00:14:13.234 --> 00:14:15.000
We call these things
"earcons."

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.934
Uh, little sounds
that tell me

00:14:16.934 --> 00:14:18.267
when something has happened.

00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:20.234
For example, when a
web page has finished loading

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:21.767
and is ready for me
to interact with it,

00:14:21.767 --> 00:14:25.200
we'll play a sound rather than
announcing it with speech.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.334
One thing we're doing
differently with ChromeVox,

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:29.601
uh, than we're doing
other places--

00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:30.901
So we looked at ARIA.

00:14:30.901 --> 00:14:33.667
ARIA is a declarative way
for me to specify

00:14:33.667 --> 00:14:35.701
how screen readers can interact
with my app.

00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:37.133
Now, declarative is great.

00:14:37.133 --> 00:14:38.267
It's very easy.

00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:40.067
It's very, uh--
It's not prone to bugs.

00:14:40.067 --> 00:14:42.467
But it doesn't always work
for all cases

00:14:42.467 --> 00:14:43.968
in a dynamic application.

00:14:43.968 --> 00:14:46.167
So we're giving you
the developer

00:14:46.167 --> 00:14:49.434
a, uh, imperative way
to tell it what to do

00:14:49.434 --> 00:14:50.968
through something we call
VoxScript.

00:14:50.968 --> 00:14:53.667
VoxScripts are, uh,
just JavaScript

00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:56.968
written against
a very simple API

00:14:56.968 --> 00:14:59.534
that lets you tell the
screen reader what to do.

00:14:59.534 --> 00:15:02.000
Let's take a look
at what it lets us do.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.434
Couple simple things.

00:15:03.434 --> 00:15:06.267
Uh, number one, I can
position the screen reader--

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:08.934
I can tell it,
"Start reading from this point."

00:15:08.934 --> 00:15:10.133
So for example,
if I've got a--

00:15:10.133 --> 00:15:12.200
like, a toolbar
that goes across the top

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.033
that isn't something that
I always want to interact with,

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:17.634
maybe I'll start
the user reading

00:15:17.634 --> 00:15:19.100
below the toolbar.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.467
I can position it
by passing it the DOMNode

00:15:21.467 --> 00:15:23.434
that I want it
to start speaking from.

00:15:23.434 --> 00:15:25.734
I can also just have
it speak some text

00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:27.133
by calling the speak command.

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:28.467
And then lastly,
we can have it play

00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:31.767
one of our earcon audio
indicators.

00:15:31.767 --> 00:15:33.234
So a couple fun things
to play with.

00:15:33.234 --> 00:15:35.534
So VoxScript bridges
some of the gaps

00:15:35.534 --> 00:15:37.300
we have in our
declarative ARIA

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.934
and gives us ways to--

00:15:38.934 --> 00:15:43.868
to have more direct control.

00:15:43.868 --> 00:15:46.467
All right, so I'm gonna
invite Charles Chen

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:48.634
up to the stage,
and he's gonna give us a demo

00:15:48.634 --> 00:15:50.100
of ChromeVox right now.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.434
We'll get to see
what it looks like.

00:15:51.434 --> 00:15:53.000
Rosenthal: Switching over.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.167
Green: Oh, okay,
actually,

00:15:54.167 --> 00:15:55.400
while Charles
is setting that up,

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.734
I might--
Does anyone have a question

00:15:56.734 --> 00:15:57.901
I can answer right now?

00:15:57.901 --> 00:16:02.667
Please come to the mic.

00:16:02.667 --> 00:16:04.734
man: ChromeVox looks
very interesting.

00:16:04.734 --> 00:16:07.400
I was wondering if,
uh, any--

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.767
if, uh, the GWT team has
actually taken a look at this

00:16:10.767 --> 00:16:14.200
so that we may be able
to work with that

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.000
with widgets that we build
in GWT?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.767
Green: That's a great question.

00:16:18.767 --> 00:16:22.467
Now, so the UI that you saw
we have is, uh--

00:16:22.467 --> 00:16:24.734
The API is via JavaScript.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.067
You can of course call any
of those from JavaScript.

00:16:27.067 --> 00:16:28.434
But it's an interesting
question.

00:16:28.434 --> 00:16:29.801
Like, what could
we automatically

00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:31.601
enable from GWT?

00:16:31.601 --> 00:16:33.334
But come talk to us later.

00:16:33.334 --> 00:16:35.534
Let's discuss further.

00:16:35.534 --> 00:16:37.267
Okay, one more question maybe
and then we'll go to Charles.

00:16:37.267 --> 00:16:38.534
man: I'm from the GWT team.

00:16:38.534 --> 00:16:40.601
Green: Oh, great.

00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:44.033
man: And, uh, we don't have
anything in progress on that,

00:16:44.033 --> 00:16:45.367
but we'd love to talk
to you about it.

00:16:45.367 --> 00:16:46.601
Green: Fantastic.
Okay, good.

00:16:46.601 --> 00:16:48.367
Hey, maybe the three of us
could get together.

00:16:48.367 --> 00:16:49.601
All right, let's switch
to Charles,

00:16:49.601 --> 00:16:52.467
who's gonna give us
a demo of ChromeVox.

00:16:52.467 --> 00:16:53.767
Chen: Thank you, Brad.

00:16:53.767 --> 00:16:55.300
So, uh, if we can switch--
All right, cool.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.701
We've switched.

00:16:56.701 --> 00:16:58.701
So, uh, Erin earlier
was talking about

00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:02.567
how important it is to have
out of the box accessibility.

00:17:02.567 --> 00:17:05.667
And we have this with ChromeVox
on ChromeOS.

00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:07.701
So right now you see
the login screen.

00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:09.200
If I press "control, alt, Z,"

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.200
I can enable ChromeVox.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.167
computer: Accessibility
turned off.

00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:14.934
Chen: It said "turned off"
because it was on before.

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:16.934
So let me go re-enable it
right now.

00:17:16.934 --> 00:17:18.767
computer: Accessibility
turned on.

00:17:18.767 --> 00:17:21.167
Chen: Okay, so now accessibility
is turned on.

00:17:21.167 --> 00:17:22.400
I can start using it.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.434
I'm gonna log into my account
and then

00:17:24.434 --> 00:17:29.100
I'm gonna show you just how easy
it is to do a Google search.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.167
computer: A-a-a-a-a-a-ast--
asterisk.

00:17:32.167 --> 00:17:33.300
Chen: And notice it's saying
"asterisk."

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.868
It's not blurting out my
password, so.

00:17:35.868 --> 00:17:37.634
computer: Signing in.

00:17:37.634 --> 00:17:39.767
Chen: Tells me "signing in."

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.067
Okay.
[electronic tone]

00:17:41.067 --> 00:17:42.501
computer: New tab.

00:17:42.501 --> 00:17:44.501
Chen: Now you heard it
make that noise

00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:46.067
and it said, "new tab."

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:47.534
So that noise is an earcon.

00:17:47.534 --> 00:17:49.300
It's telling me that
the page is loaded,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.000
it's ready for me
to interact with it,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.534
and it told me the title.

00:17:52.534 --> 00:17:53.934
In this case, it's "new tab."

00:17:53.934 --> 00:17:56.033
So let me just do a search.

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.367
So, uh, now this is ChromeOS.

00:17:58.367 --> 00:17:59.767
It's just like Chrome
the browser,

00:17:59.767 --> 00:18:01.434
so if you go
into the URL bar,

00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:04.200
you can type a query and it will
just do a search right there.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.434
So let me do that.

00:18:05.434 --> 00:18:06.801
I'm gonna press "control, L"
to jump

00:18:06.801 --> 00:18:09.567
right into the URL bar,
and I'm just gonna type,

00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:11.167
and let's see what happens.

00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:13.701
computer: Location, text box.

00:18:13.701 --> 00:18:16.534
We--a--
Unselected.

00:18:16.534 --> 00:18:17.734
[electronic tone]

00:18:17.734 --> 00:18:21.200
www.weather, Google search.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.467
Chen: Okay, so it did
a Google search for weather.

00:18:23.467 --> 00:18:25.934
Now this is Google Instant
search.

00:18:25.934 --> 00:18:27.434
So Instant search,
by default,

00:18:27.434 --> 00:18:30.868
draws a little arrow next
to the current result

00:18:30.868 --> 00:18:33.000
that the user is looking at,
and the user

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.634
can use the arrow keys
up and down

00:18:34.634 --> 00:18:36.300
to move through
the search results.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.601
So we looked at that
and we said,

00:18:37.601 --> 00:18:39.734
"This is a wonderful
keyboard-driven interface."

00:18:39.734 --> 00:18:41.567
Like Brad was talking about

00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:43.634
having good keyboard
accessibility.

00:18:43.634 --> 00:18:45.901
And so can we take advantage
of that

00:18:45.901 --> 00:18:47.934
and leverage it and
use some VoxScript to make it

00:18:47.934 --> 00:18:49.801
work even better
and make it just speak

00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:52.100
what the user's currently
interested in?

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.834
So rather than having
something complex

00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:56.033
where the user
has to look at the title,

00:18:56.033 --> 00:18:57.801
look at a snippet,
and then go back to the title

00:18:57.801 --> 00:19:00.000
to activate something,
could we make it

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.367
as simple as just pressing
"down arrow,"

00:19:02.367 --> 00:19:04.501
hearing it, and then just
pressing "enter"

00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:05.801
to go to the page?

00:19:05.801 --> 00:19:07.300
So here's the results.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.734
I'm going to press "down arrow"
and "up arrow" a couple times

00:19:09.734 --> 00:19:11.868
to show how it works.

00:19:11.868 --> 00:19:13.100
computer: Weather current
conditions and forecast

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.100
for the San Francisco Bay.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.133
May--National and local
weather forecast.

00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:20.300
Hurricane, radar and--

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.133
San Francisco weather forecast
and conditions.

00:19:22.133 --> 00:19:24.033
May 10--National
and local weath--

00:19:24.033 --> 00:19:25.501
Weather current conditions
and foreca--

00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:27.567
Weather for San Francisco.

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:30.167
C, 62 degrees Fahrenheit,
vertical bar, degree, Celsius,

00:19:30.167 --> 00:19:31.934
Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri,
sunny, partially clou--

00:19:31.934 --> 00:19:33.267
Chen: Okay.

00:19:33.267 --> 00:19:34.634
And also very important
right there,

00:19:34.634 --> 00:19:36.767
I pressed "control"
to make it stop speaking.

00:19:36.767 --> 00:19:38.567
So, you know,
speech is silver,

00:19:38.567 --> 00:19:40.667
silence is golden, right?

00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:43.267
So, um, as you can see,
it's very easy

00:19:43.267 --> 00:19:46.000
to do a Google search,
very easy to get your results.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.234
You'll also notice
that the text got larger.

00:19:48.234 --> 00:19:50.167
That's because we applied
the CSS style sheet.

00:19:50.167 --> 00:19:53.234
So for low-vision users,
you get not just the audio,

00:19:53.234 --> 00:19:56.501
but you also get the visual
of it getting larger.

00:19:56.501 --> 00:19:58.267
And so with that,
you know,

00:19:58.267 --> 00:20:01.701
that's a really intro--
good intro to how we can

00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:03.901
do something that's complex
with Google search.

00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:06.734
But let's look at something
that's even more complex.

00:20:06.734 --> 00:20:08.300
Let's look at Gmail,
right?

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.000
So Gmail tries to replicate

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.934
a desktop email client
experience

00:20:11.934 --> 00:20:13.734
in the browser on the web

00:20:13.734 --> 00:20:15.901
with just HTML and JavaScript.

00:20:15.901 --> 00:20:17.767
So how can we make that
accessible?

00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:18.901
Can we make that fast?

00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:21.100
Can we make that efficient?
Right?

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.300
And the answer is yes.
Yes, we can.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.467
So, um, again,
we're going to see how

00:20:25.467 --> 00:20:28.300
we take advantage of existing
keyboard shortcuts

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.701
and we make things just work.

00:20:29.701 --> 00:20:31.167
So let me load up my Gmail here.

00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:32.601
[electronic tone]

00:20:32.601 --> 00:20:35.834
computer: W-w-g-m-a-i-l.
Mail.

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:38.868
C-o-m.
Degrees Celsius.

00:20:38.868 --> 00:20:41.100
[electronic tone]

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.567
Chen: Okay, so it's loading.

00:20:42.567 --> 00:20:45.701
[electronic tones]
Okay.

00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:48.267
computer: Mail inbox.
309.

00:20:48.267 --> 00:20:53.033
C-l-c-i-s-l-3-3-g at mail.com.

00:20:53.033 --> 00:20:55.334
Chen: So as you can see,
it told me the title

00:20:55.334 --> 00:20:57.567
and it told me
how many messages I had.

00:20:57.567 --> 00:21:00.601
And so with Gmail,
if you have keyboard shortcuts,

00:21:00.601 --> 00:21:02.634
you can just use the "j" and "k"
keys to move

00:21:02.634 --> 00:21:05.434
through the different threads
of emails.

00:21:05.434 --> 00:21:07.567
You can press "enter"
to open an email.

00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:09.467
And after you've opened
an email thread,

00:21:09.467 --> 00:21:10.868
you can press any key...
computer: Not selected.

00:21:10.868 --> 00:21:12.501
Chen: To go through the, uh--

00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:14.734
to go through the messages
inside the thread.

00:21:14.734 --> 00:21:17.434
So I'm gonna go ahead
and do that right now.

00:21:17.434 --> 00:21:18.801
computer: Unread.

00:21:18.801 --> 00:21:20.901

right square, bracket,

Unread.
Has a blue line.

00:21:28.334 --> 00:21:30.767
Chen: Okay, so I'm gonna
go ahead and open this thread.

00:21:30.767 --> 00:21:32.067
I'm gonna press "enter."

00:21:32.067 --> 00:21:33.534
[electronic tone]
computer: Not selected.

00:21:33.534 --> 00:21:36.601
Chen: Okay, so now it's telling
me nothing is selected.

00:21:36.601 --> 00:21:41.267
I can go ahead and read through
the messages with "N" and "P."

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:43.067

I am developing

See, now that was actually
a very interesting URL.

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:16.934
So I wanted to explore
that more

00:22:16.934 --> 00:22:20.400
and as, um, as Brad and Erin
mentioned earlier,

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.667
with VoxScript you can
sync the screen reader

00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:24.200
to your current position.

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.634
So now I'm on this message.

00:22:25.634 --> 00:22:27.300
Let's say I wanted
to read that in more detail,

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.901
because that was just way
too fast, right?

00:22:29.901 --> 00:22:32.767
So I can use the standard
ChromeVox commands

00:22:32.767 --> 00:22:34.100
to read through.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.767
So on ChromeOS,
this is "search" and "shift."

00:22:36.767 --> 00:22:39.067
And if you're running this
as just an extension

00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:42.033
in your Chrome browser,
then it's "control" and "alt."

00:22:42.033 --> 00:22:45.367
So I'm going to, uh,
read through this message.

00:22:45.367 --> 00:22:48.834
[computer speaking rapidly]

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:51.934
computer:
developer.android.com--

00:22:51.934 --> 00:22:55.434
developer.android.--
Sentence.

00:22:55.434 --> 00:23:01.300
[computer speaking rapidly
and indistinctly]

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:05.167
S-h-a 256.
S-h-a 256.

00:23:05.167 --> 00:23:07.801
Chen: So as you can see,
I can now navigate through it

00:23:07.801 --> 00:23:10.834
in a very fine-grained way
and go through the message

00:23:10.834 --> 00:23:13.200
a word at a time,
sentence at a time,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.000
at any level I would like.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.767
And so with that,
I would like

00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:18.234
to hand it back to Brad.

00:23:18.234 --> 00:23:19.567
Green: Great.
Erin.

00:23:19.567 --> 00:23:20.767
Rosenthal: I think that's
actually me.

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:22.133
computer: Not selected.
Chen: Yeah.

00:23:22.133 --> 00:23:23.467
So can we switch back?

00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:24.567
Rosenthal: Yes.
Green: Thanks, Charles.

00:23:24.567 --> 00:23:25.801
That's awesome.

00:23:25.801 --> 00:23:27.067
Rosenthal: Yeah, thank you
so much, Charles.

00:23:27.067 --> 00:23:28.300
Chen: You want to ask
questions or should I?

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.534
Rosenthal: Um,
so as you can see,

00:23:29.534 --> 00:23:31.234
with ChromeVox
you're able to make, like,

00:23:31.234 --> 00:23:34.200
a desktop-like experience
through your web application

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.133
on ChromeOS, right?

00:23:36.133 --> 00:23:38.501
Um, ChromeVox
and VoxScripts give you

00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:40.934
this unprecedented level
of control

00:23:40.934 --> 00:23:43.634
to make sure that you have this
tight integration that you want

00:23:43.634 --> 00:23:45.801
with the screen reader
so that you can provide

00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:48.067
this seamless user experience
that your users

00:23:48.067 --> 00:23:52.701
have grown to expect
in their desktop applications.

00:23:52.701 --> 00:23:55.434
There's also one more technology
that Brad had mentioned

00:23:55.434 --> 00:23:57.367
that we wanted to show you
a quick screenshot of

00:23:57.367 --> 00:23:58.934
and that's ChromeShades.

00:23:58.934 --> 00:24:01.467
So, um, this is
an extension available

00:24:01.467 --> 00:24:05.067
on our website,
and it allows you to visualize

00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:08.067
what your website
or application looks like

00:24:08.067 --> 00:24:09.667
to someone using
a screen reader.

00:24:09.667 --> 00:24:11.267
Um, as Brad says,
for people who are

00:24:11.267 --> 00:24:12.767
photon-dependent.

00:24:12.767 --> 00:24:15.467
Um, so what it does is
flatten your page

00:24:15.467 --> 00:24:17.701
and show it in the link order
that the person

00:24:17.701 --> 00:24:19.467
who would be navigating
with the screen reader,

00:24:19.467 --> 00:24:21.434
how they would come to it
and how they would end up

00:24:21.434 --> 00:24:22.534
navigating it.

00:24:22.534 --> 00:24:23.834
So in this case,
you see that the buttons

00:24:23.834 --> 00:24:25.367
that are across the top
of the page

00:24:25.367 --> 00:24:27.300
end up being linearized
at the beginning

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.734
of the ChromeShades version
of the page,

00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:32.100
and the "any" button that's
unlabeled in the interface

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.100
is showing up as these green,
rounded wraps.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.767
So clearly we have
some work to do here.

00:24:35.767 --> 00:24:39.234
It's a good thing
we have this tool.

00:24:39.234 --> 00:24:41.267
So let's talk
a little bit about

00:24:41.267 --> 00:24:45.067
accessibility in Android.

00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:48.300
Mobile platforms are fantastic
platforms for accessibility.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.100
There are so many sensors
built in

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.367
that there is this inherent
accessibility

00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:52.901
that's already there.

00:24:52.901 --> 00:24:54.934
These devices are designed
for use

00:24:54.934 --> 00:24:57.601
when being distracted,
when your eyes are elsewhere.

00:24:57.601 --> 00:25:01.367
So that helps people who need
accessible interfaces as well.

00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:03.534
Plus, um,
Android in particular

00:25:03.534 --> 00:25:05.834
is an open and customizable
platform, right?

00:25:05.834 --> 00:25:07.968
So you can choose the device
that works for you.

00:25:07.968 --> 00:25:10.200
You can get one with a keyboard
if you want it.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.133
Plus, also, today,
when we were in the keynote,

00:25:13.133 --> 00:25:14.901
we announced the, uh,

00:25:14.901 --> 00:25:16.667
Android developer platform,
right?

00:25:16.667 --> 00:25:18.467
So you can make, uh,
third-party extensions.

00:25:18.467 --> 00:25:20.167
So with that,
you could make something

00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:23.234
that really is specific
to the disabled users

00:25:23.234 --> 00:25:25.567
in your community.

00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:28.767
So as we said, there's all
these sensors built in.

00:25:28.767 --> 00:25:31.701
So think of them as all these
eyes and ears

00:25:31.701 --> 00:25:34.434
that you can use to make
location aware,

00:25:34.434 --> 00:25:38.000
context aware, and extremely
powerful applications.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.567
Um, the more aware your
application is,

00:25:40.567 --> 00:25:43.100
the less that your users need
to interact with it.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.367
While that might sound like
something you don't want--

00:25:45.367 --> 00:25:47.067
you want them to interact--
you don't want them

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:50.234
to have to get stuck inputting
all this tedious details,

00:25:50.234 --> 00:25:51.634
all this data, right?

00:25:51.634 --> 00:25:53.734
If you can tell them
their location for them

00:25:53.734 --> 00:25:55.067
instead of them having
to figure out--

00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:56.767
Like, right now,
do you know where you are

00:25:56.767 --> 00:25:58.334
if you had to put
in your location?

00:25:58.334 --> 00:26:00.367
No, you'd have a hard time,
right?

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:02.167
So you really would prefer
your phone

00:26:02.167 --> 00:26:06.767
to be able to set that for you,
right?

00:26:06.767 --> 00:26:08.667
So we've written a couple
applications

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:10.467
that demonstrate this
technology.

00:26:10.467 --> 00:26:11.801
Um, both of them,
I think,

00:26:11.801 --> 00:26:14.067
we're demoing over
in our sandbox, by the way,

00:26:14.067 --> 00:26:15.467
if you want to check
'em out yourself.

00:26:15.467 --> 00:26:18.567
Um, this first one is an app
called Walky Talky.

00:26:18.567 --> 00:26:22.701
Uh, this is a interface
to the maps app

00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:25.334
that gives you the ability to
set a start and end point

00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:27.133
and then it'll give you
walking directions

00:26:27.133 --> 00:26:28.634
for the route that you're on.

00:26:28.634 --> 00:26:30.701
Um, then as you're walking
along your route,

00:26:30.701 --> 00:26:33.033
it'll read off whatever
intersection you're at.

00:26:33.033 --> 00:26:35.434
Um, I know for me this would
be incredibly useful

00:26:35.434 --> 00:26:37.734
if I'm just kind of walking
in an unfamiliar area.

00:26:37.734 --> 00:26:40.167
I can only imagine how valuable
it would be if I'm blind

00:26:40.167 --> 00:26:42.767
and would have a difficult time
seeing exactly where I am.

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:45.434
So this application helps build
that confidence

00:26:45.434 --> 00:26:47.334
in your environment
in knowing where you are

00:26:47.334 --> 00:26:49.868
as you're--and that you're
on the right direction.

00:26:49.868 --> 00:26:52.400
Um, also there's this
application called

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.734
Intersection Explorer.

00:26:53.734 --> 00:26:55.634
If you went to the Android talk
earlier,

00:26:55.634 --> 00:26:58.267
you saw a demo of it
and as Ramen explained,

00:26:58.267 --> 00:27:00.868
he wrote this, um,
after getting dropped off

00:27:00.868 --> 00:27:03.267
on the wrong corner one day
on the way home.

00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:05.968
This app, uh,
helps you to understand

00:27:05.968 --> 00:27:09.167
what intersections
or what streets are nearby.

00:27:09.167 --> 00:27:11.067
So, like, if you're traveling
and want to get to know

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:12.968
an area before you
get there and know

00:27:12.968 --> 00:27:16.234
what the general streets are,
you can, um, open up this app,

00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:17.634
set yourself
at an intersection,

00:27:17.634 --> 00:27:19.968
and then drag your finger
in a circle,

00:27:19.968 --> 00:27:22.868
uh, around the intersection
that you're at.

00:27:22.868 --> 00:27:25.167
Um, it will
then vibrate subtly

00:27:25.167 --> 00:27:28.067
when you get to a street
and read off the street name

00:27:28.067 --> 00:27:29.133
and the direction.

00:27:29.133 --> 00:27:30.567
So, like, in this case,

00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:33.100
if I did a circle,
um, from the top,

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.734
it would first say--
it would vibrate a little

00:27:34.734 --> 00:27:37.534
and say, "Howard Street,
Northeast."

00:27:37.534 --> 00:27:38.901
And, um,
that would help me know

00:27:38.901 --> 00:27:42.601
what streets meet up
where I am.

00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:44.033
Green: All right, fantastic.

00:27:44.033 --> 00:27:47.267
So there's several services
that are parallel

00:27:47.267 --> 00:27:51.601
to what we're doing on ChromeOS
and Chrome for Android

00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:54.701
and we've had these in place
actually for much longer.

00:27:54.701 --> 00:27:56.434
There's an accessibility
framework

00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:58.234
that's built up
of a number of APIs.

00:27:58.234 --> 00:27:59.667
We'll talk about
a few of them.

00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:02.234
And there are services
which users can enable

00:28:02.234 --> 00:28:03.667
as part of their preferences.

00:28:03.667 --> 00:28:06.234
So on any Android device,
you can pull it out right now.

00:28:06.234 --> 00:28:08.834
Go to preferences,
accessibility,

00:28:08.834 --> 00:28:11.167
and you get to enable things
like TalkBack,

00:28:11.167 --> 00:28:12.334
which is our screen reader.

00:28:12.334 --> 00:28:14.367
Allows the UI to be announced

00:28:14.367 --> 00:28:16.567
and allows you to navigate
by focusing on elements.

00:28:16.567 --> 00:28:18.501
We have KickBack,
which is the haptic feedback,

00:28:18.501 --> 00:28:23.267
which gives me more of a
realistic, real-world experience

00:28:23.267 --> 00:28:25.701
when I'm interacting with
the different elements.

00:28:25.701 --> 00:28:27.934
Um, and then SoundBack,
which plays the equivalent

00:28:27.934 --> 00:28:29.501
of what we called earcons--

00:28:29.501 --> 00:28:32.234
um, audio non-spoken events

00:28:32.234 --> 00:28:35.300
that tell me when something's
happened in my application.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:36.667
Again, Erin kind of
mentioned it,

00:28:36.667 --> 00:28:38.501
but this is--It's a very
open platform.

00:28:38.501 --> 00:28:40.033
It's all open source.

00:28:40.033 --> 00:28:42.901
Um, but we've made
it particularly

00:28:42.901 --> 00:28:46.033
easy to integrate along
many axes.

00:28:46.033 --> 00:28:48.634
One example is that
we ship a voice

00:28:48.634 --> 00:28:51.133
with the device for doing
text to speech.

00:28:51.133 --> 00:28:54.467
And, uh, it's perfectly good
and functional,

00:28:54.467 --> 00:28:56.701
but if you want a slightly
sexier, sassier voice,

00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:58.901
one that happen--works
in a different language,

00:28:58.901 --> 00:29:00.400
um, or, you know,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.167
one that's just more
to your preference,

00:29:02.167 --> 00:29:03.634
you can go
to the marketplace

00:29:03.634 --> 00:29:05.801
and you can download one of many
different ones

00:29:05.801 --> 00:29:07.000
that are available there,
uh,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.033
written by some of our
application partners.

00:29:11.033 --> 00:29:13.267
Okay, so, uh,
these devices--

00:29:13.267 --> 00:29:14.868
We've talked a little bit about
what we have to do.

00:29:14.868 --> 00:29:17.968
More specifically,
if I'm an application developer,

00:29:17.968 --> 00:29:20.701
to make my application
accessible on Android,

00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:21.934
uh, the first thing--

00:29:21.934 --> 00:29:24.100
If I just use
the standard controls,

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.000
out of the box, they come
with accessibility baked in.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.834
If I label those controls

00:29:28.834 --> 00:29:30.934
by setting their content
description appropriately,

00:29:30.934 --> 00:29:33.634
it will automatically know how
to speak the elements

00:29:33.634 --> 00:29:34.701
when we focus on them.

00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:35.968
Now, users are going to be

00:29:35.968 --> 00:29:38.133
focusing on these in maybe
a couple different ways.

00:29:38.133 --> 00:29:41.567
One is if my device has
a roller ball or a D-pad--

00:29:41.567 --> 00:29:43.968
that sort of directional pad you
see down there on the screen--

00:29:43.968 --> 00:29:48.634
it allows me to set focus
on different elements in my UI.

00:29:48.634 --> 00:29:50.167
The ones that come out
of the box

00:29:50.167 --> 00:29:51.834
automatically know how
to be focused.

00:29:51.834 --> 00:29:56.367
If I'm building my own custom
views however,

00:29:56.367 --> 00:29:59.100
I need to make sure that all
of these controls

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:01.067
are both reachable and
respond to the right events,

00:30:01.067 --> 00:30:03.400
that they could be focused,
and that they will raise

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.868
the appropriate accessibility
events.

00:30:04.868 --> 00:30:06.334
There's some simple APIs.

00:30:06.334 --> 00:30:07.801
We'll show you a link
where to go to

00:30:07.801 --> 00:30:10.100
to look at that
at the end of the talk,

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:12.667
um, and please come to our
developer sandbox

00:30:12.667 --> 00:30:15.968
and we'd love to show you
more about that.

00:30:15.968 --> 00:30:18.200
Rosenthal: So, um,
with that, we want to--

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.334
You remember how earlier
we mentioned

00:30:19.334 --> 00:30:20.434
we were gonna have demos?

00:30:20.434 --> 00:30:21.801
We're gonna bring up
Steve Jacobs

00:30:21.801 --> 00:30:23.868
to show us some demos
of some applications

00:30:23.868 --> 00:30:27.601
that he's written for Android
that are highly accessible.

00:30:27.601 --> 00:30:29.000
Green: And while he's getting
set up,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.467
uh, we could take
another question

00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:32.100
if somebody has one about
what we've just talked about.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.467
Rosenthal: Let me switch over.

00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:34.701
Green: Anyone?

00:30:34.701 --> 00:30:36.467
Jacobs: Well, if nobody
has any questions--

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:38.167
Green: Oh--oh,
we have maybe one.

00:30:38.167 --> 00:30:39.400
No, somebody's escaping.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.467
Okay, good.
Oh, no.

00:30:40.467 --> 00:30:41.968
You're--Okay, good.
Yes?

00:30:41.968 --> 00:30:44.033
man: Um, so, uh, it seems like
a lot of people

00:30:44.033 --> 00:30:45.968
in this room are already
in charge

00:30:45.968 --> 00:30:47.901
of the accessibility
for their companies.

00:30:47.901 --> 00:30:49.801
If you were somebody
who just recognizes

00:30:49.801 --> 00:30:52.901
that everyone should be able
to use whatever you write,

00:30:52.901 --> 00:30:55.601
what would be a good place
to start

00:30:55.601 --> 00:30:57.000
working on accessibility?

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.434
Or a good example of
a very accessible website

00:31:00.434 --> 00:31:03.267
for all sorts of disabilities.

00:31:03.267 --> 00:31:05.334
Green: So a very accessible
website?

00:31:05.334 --> 00:31:06.868
Uh, that's a good question.

00:31:06.868 --> 00:31:08.868
I mean, generally,
simpler websites

00:31:08.868 --> 00:31:11.267
are easier to make accessible.

00:31:11.267 --> 00:31:14.234
Um, there's, uh, I don't know.

00:31:14.234 --> 00:31:16.367
Charles, do you have an example?

00:31:16.367 --> 00:31:18.267
The best example you
could think of?

00:31:18.267 --> 00:31:19.467
[Chen speaks indistinctly]

00:31:19.467 --> 00:31:20.767
Yeah, that's true.

00:31:20.767 --> 00:31:22.601
With ChromeVox,
we have a tutorial.

00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:24.701
It's--It is highly accessible.

00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:26.400
However, it's not particularly
complex.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.868
What I would do is
I'd direct you--

00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:29.868
We've got a tech talk tomorrow

00:31:29.868 --> 00:31:33.601
on building accessible
applications with HTML5,

00:31:33.601 --> 00:31:35.701
where we'll actually
walk you through

00:31:35.701 --> 00:31:38.501
everything you need
to do to build, uh,

00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:40.968
dynamic accessible applications.

00:31:40.968 --> 00:31:43.033
Um, they've got a rich,
uh, application

00:31:43.033 --> 00:31:44.734
that they'll walk you through.

00:31:44.734 --> 00:31:46.000
Cool.
Thanks.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.100
Steve?

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:48.534
Jacobs: Thank you, Brad.
Thank you, Erin.

00:31:48.534 --> 00:31:50.634
Thanks to the audience.

00:31:50.634 --> 00:31:54.033
The question was just asked
about an accessible--

00:31:54.033 --> 00:31:56.501
an example of
an accessible website.

00:31:56.501 --> 00:31:58.267
Building a business case
is important

00:31:58.267 --> 00:32:00.067
if you want to integrate
accessibility

00:32:00.067 --> 00:32:01.534
within your company.

00:32:01.534 --> 00:32:02.934
I'm a businessman.

00:32:02.934 --> 00:32:04.667
I'm in business to make money.

00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:07.400
And I'm in business for
applications to be accessible,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.033
usable, and useful
by as many people

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:11.834
around the world as possible.

00:32:11.834 --> 00:32:14.000
So for right now,
let's not think about people

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.400
with disabilities,
of which there are

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.767
826 million worldwide.

00:32:18.767 --> 00:32:20.801
Let's just
concentrate on, uh,

00:32:20.801 --> 00:32:22.267
people like myself.

00:32:22.267 --> 00:32:24.300
65 years of age and over.

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.968
519 million.

00:32:25.968 --> 00:32:29.367
And 1.2 billion people
who never learned to read.

00:32:29.367 --> 00:32:30.767
How are they gonna access
your apps

00:32:30.767 --> 00:32:32.934
and go shopping
and spend their money?

00:32:32.934 --> 00:32:35.734
That's where accessibility
is powerful.

00:32:35.734 --> 00:32:38.067
Gonna show you two examples
of apps

00:32:38.067 --> 00:32:40.267
that we recently developed.

00:32:40.267 --> 00:32:43.701
The first is, um,
Khan Academy.

00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:48.100
I need to turn on TalkBack's
virtual D-pad.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:51.267
Um, Khan Academy
is a not-for-profit

00:32:51.267 --> 00:32:53.534
educational organization
whose mission

00:32:53.534 --> 00:32:57.834
is to evolutionize education
as we know it in the country.

00:32:57.834 --> 00:32:59.868
Uh, actually, around the world.

00:32:59.868 --> 00:33:02.834
They have about
10 million students

00:33:02.834 --> 00:33:04.734
taking their tutorials.

00:33:04.734 --> 00:33:09.367
They've developed 2,200
short video tutorials

00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:13.000
on subjects such as, uh,
history, math, science,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.501
and so on.

00:33:14.501 --> 00:33:18.868
Using the built in accessibility
that's already in Android,

00:33:18.868 --> 00:33:20.968
if I swipe down the D-pad...

00:33:20.968 --> 00:33:26.100
computer: Math, science,
humanity, science, math.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.934
Jacobs: If I want math
and I hear it,

00:33:27.934 --> 00:33:29.200
I don't have to be able
to read.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.467
I just tap it.

00:33:30.467 --> 00:33:32.067
computer: KhAndroid.
Arithmetic.

00:33:32.067 --> 00:33:33.834
The most basic
of the math playlists--

00:33:33.834 --> 00:33:34.968
Jacobs: Arithmetic.

00:33:34.968 --> 00:33:36.067
computer: Developmental math.

00:33:36.067 --> 00:33:37.434
Jacobs: Developmental math.

00:33:37.434 --> 00:33:38.901
Arithmetic.

00:33:38.901 --> 00:33:41.367
computer: Playlists start here
if you--KhAndroid.

00:33:41.367 --> 00:33:43.000
Basic addition.
Addition. 271,000...

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.400
Jacobs: Let's go
into addition too.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.534
computer: YouTube image button.

00:33:48.534 --> 00:33:50.067
Jacobs: We will now see--

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:52.734
man: We got some practice
adding what we could--

00:33:52.734 --> 00:33:54.200
computer: Alert phone option.
Jacobs: Oops.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.267
computer: Screen off.

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:58.300
[overlapping speech]

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.634
man: We could imagine that
if maybe I had three lemons.

00:34:01.634 --> 00:34:03.400
One, two, three.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.300
And if I were to add
to those three lemons,

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.667
maybe two limes.

00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:08.801
computer: Navigating.

00:34:08.801 --> 00:34:10.133
man: Is it lime or limes?

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:11.400
Let's just--Well--

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.067
Two green lemons
for two more tart pieces--

00:34:14.067 --> 00:34:16.467
Jacobs: We can turn
captions off.

00:34:16.467 --> 00:34:18.801
man: How much tart,
sour fruit do I have now?

00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:20.834
computer: Alert captions.
YouTube.

00:34:20.834 --> 00:34:23.400
Jacobs: Or turn them on.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.701
We can pause the video.

00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:27.767
We can move the video ahead.

00:34:27.767 --> 00:34:31.100
And I'm going
pretty quick here.

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:32.901
Orientation.

00:34:32.901 --> 00:34:35.167
man: It means I have no lemons.

00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:40.400
So 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...
computer: Typing.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.033
man: 5, 6, 7...
computer: Navigating.

00:34:43.033 --> 00:34:45.934
man: 8, 9, 10, 11--

00:34:45.934 --> 00:34:48.267
computer: Back, back.

00:34:48.267 --> 00:34:50.200
Jacobs: Okay.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.601
That's one example.

00:34:52.601 --> 00:34:55.801
And I wanted to thank,
uh, Casey Burkhardt.

00:34:55.801 --> 00:34:58.367
Google had a Google I/O--

00:34:58.367 --> 00:35:01.167
An accessibility
Google I/O contest

00:35:01.167 --> 00:35:02.934
where people submitted code.

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.667
And, Casey Burkhardt,
you're in the audience.

00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:06.667
Hold your hand up.
Thank you.

00:35:06.667 --> 00:35:10.267
You submitted code that our
developers were able to use

00:35:10.267 --> 00:35:12.067
to develop this application.

00:35:12.067 --> 00:35:16.868
Um, sharing code is part
of the DNA of Android

00:35:16.868 --> 00:35:18.367
and the Google culture.

00:35:18.367 --> 00:35:20.601
It is very, very helpful.

00:35:20.601 --> 00:35:23.400
Uh, it reduces costs
significantly,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.434
and when we work together
as a community,

00:35:25.434 --> 00:35:28.734
it's a very good thing from
a business standpoint.

00:35:28.734 --> 00:35:30.567
The second app...

00:35:30.567 --> 00:35:31.834
computer: Clicked.

00:35:31.834 --> 00:35:33.567
Jacobs: I'm going
to demonstrate.

00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:35.067
computer: Alert.
Please wait.

00:35:35.067 --> 00:35:37.701
Jacobs: We've all seen
e-book readers.

00:35:37.701 --> 00:35:39.734
There has been
a lot of talk lately

00:35:39.734 --> 00:35:43.434
about e-book readers that can't
read out loud or that won't.

00:35:43.434 --> 00:35:45.467
This is CoolReader.

00:35:45.467 --> 00:35:47.834
We've simply taken
the open source code

00:35:47.834 --> 00:35:50.601
and our developers added speech
and highlighting

00:35:50.601 --> 00:35:53.200
and extra controls to the app,

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:57.133
all because it's open source and
it's a community of sharing.

00:35:57.133 --> 00:36:00.801
This will give you some idea
of the controls that you have

00:36:00.801 --> 00:36:02.734
just having a touch screen.

00:36:02.734 --> 00:36:04.067
Um, let's...

00:36:04.067 --> 00:36:05.167
computer: For a whole day--

00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:06.467
Jacobs: read backwards.

00:36:06.467 --> 00:36:07.767
computer: For a whole day--

00:36:07.767 --> 00:36:09.868
Indeed, my only wonder was
that he had not

00:36:09.868 --> 00:36:10.968
already been mixed up in--

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:12.834
I was not surprised.

00:36:12.834 --> 00:36:14.767
Jacobs: Or we can read one word
at a time.

00:36:14.767 --> 00:36:16.167
computer: Word.

00:36:16.167 --> 00:36:18.234
Violent.
Kings.

00:36:18.234 --> 00:36:19.467
Sentence.

00:36:19.467 --> 00:36:20.534
Jacobs: Or go back to sen--

00:36:20.534 --> 00:36:21.901
Okay, we're back
to the sentence.

00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:24.334
Let's go into night mode.

00:36:24.334 --> 00:36:25.901
You can see it better.

00:36:25.901 --> 00:36:27.767
We'll go back into day mode.

00:36:27.767 --> 00:36:30.901
We can turn a page
or turn it back

00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:34.000
or increase the size
of the font.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.767
We can do that again.

00:36:36.767 --> 00:36:39.400
Maybe again.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.167
So people who are not
able to read,

00:36:41.167 --> 00:36:42.400
who are learning to read,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.133
learning English
as a second language,

00:36:44.133 --> 00:36:45.667
Young students who want
to be able

00:36:45.667 --> 00:36:48.300
to access resources
like this,

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:50.601
having an interface
that is accessible

00:36:50.601 --> 00:36:52.300
can enable them to do that.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.133
It is very, very powerful.

00:36:54.133 --> 00:36:56.934
So expand your thinking
about accessibility

00:36:56.934 --> 00:36:59.534
beyond disabilities,
if you're narrowly focused

00:36:59.534 --> 00:37:00.868
on disabilities.

00:37:00.868 --> 00:37:03.267
Couple of other features
and then I'll stop.

00:37:03.267 --> 00:37:05.801
Uh, we can go
to the table of contents...

00:37:05.801 --> 00:37:07.000
computer: Alert.
Table of contents.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.267
CoolReader.

00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:09.834
Jacobs: And turn some pages.

00:37:09.834 --> 00:37:11.834
I can dim the screen
if I want to.

00:37:11.834 --> 00:37:13.634
I can brighten the screen.

00:37:13.634 --> 00:37:16.901
There are 20 commands
built into the touch screen

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.300
in 9 little areas.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.400
We actually make
templates that we can put

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.400
over as screen savers
that enable the students

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.868
who are blind
that we work with

00:37:26.868 --> 00:37:29.667
to fully control this
application,

00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:32.534
fully control KhAndroid and many
of the other applications

00:37:32.534 --> 00:37:34.167
we develop.

00:37:34.167 --> 00:37:35.667
Thank you.

00:37:35.667 --> 00:37:36.801
Rosenthal: Thanks, Steve.

00:37:36.801 --> 00:37:38.033
Jacobs: Welcome.

00:37:38.033 --> 00:37:39.234
Rosenthal: Let me switch
back over.

00:37:39.234 --> 00:37:40.634
Green: All right.

00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:41.801
Steve, that's awesome.
That's wonderful.

00:37:41.801 --> 00:37:43.133
So I want to just
kind of reiterate

00:37:43.133 --> 00:37:45.334
a couple of the points
about Steve's demo.

00:37:45.334 --> 00:37:47.868
On CoolReader,
they were using gestures,

00:37:47.868 --> 00:37:50.567
notice, that didn't require
a user to look at the screen.

00:37:50.567 --> 00:37:53.734
A user, no matter where they
started from in their gestures,

00:37:53.734 --> 00:37:55.701
they always kind of knew
how it would make sense.

00:37:55.701 --> 00:37:57.667
Some of them were relative to
different parts of the screen,

00:37:57.667 --> 00:37:59.400
but I didn't need
to see the screen.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.734
And then they provided a lot
of verbal feedback to the user.

00:38:02.734 --> 00:38:05.133
So the user, again,
could know what was going on

00:38:05.133 --> 00:38:07.300
without seeing what was
on the screen.

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.667
KhAndroid is a fantastic example
of rethinking, uh--

00:38:10.667 --> 00:38:12.901
How do I make it possible
for more users

00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:16.734
to use my application by adding
other modes of accessibility?

00:38:16.734 --> 00:38:19.367
Um, and we're really proud that
they were able to reuse

00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:23.801
some of the code from the
developer challenge that we had.

00:38:23.801 --> 00:38:26.100
Rosenthal: So let's talk
a little bit about

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.501
making your products accessible
for people who are deaf

00:38:28.501 --> 00:38:29.901
or hard of hearing.

00:38:29.901 --> 00:38:32.200
Um, as Dr. I. King Jordan said,

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.868
"Deaf people can do anything
but hear."

00:38:34.868 --> 00:38:37.033
Um, and by the way,
Dr. I. King Jordan

00:38:37.033 --> 00:38:39.567
was the first deaf president
of Gallaudet University,

00:38:39.567 --> 00:38:41.400
which was the first university

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.868
for deaf and hard
of hearing students.

00:38:42.868 --> 00:38:45.968
Their entire curriculum is for--
is in ASL.

00:38:45.968 --> 00:38:50.367
Um, so, uh, mobile devices
and deaf communities--

00:38:50.367 --> 00:38:52.300
Um, sorry.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.000
Uh, mobile devices were rapidly
adopted by the deaf community.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.367
I mean, when you think
about it,

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:58.200
um, deaf people do more than
just, you know--

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.868
We do more with our cell phones
than just talk on them, right?

00:39:00.868 --> 00:39:03.300
I, you know, increasingly
use my cell phone

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.534
less and less for phone calls

00:39:04.534 --> 00:39:06.234
and more for other
text-based things

00:39:06.234 --> 00:39:09.133
like text chatting and SMS
and now for things

00:39:09.133 --> 00:39:12.000
like video chatting
and watching videos, right?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.400
So watching videos
with captions

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.501
goes well with that.

00:39:16.501 --> 00:39:19.434
We have, um,
Jaehong Chon here

00:39:19.434 --> 00:39:21.834
from the University
of Washington

00:39:21.834 --> 00:39:24.334
to show us this great
application that they've built

00:39:24.334 --> 00:39:25.934
to customize, uh--

00:39:25.934 --> 00:39:28.267
So you can go ahead
and plug in.

00:39:28.267 --> 00:39:29.400
Chon: Thanks for doing this.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.501
Rosenthal: Wait.
Hold on.

00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:31.734
Some of the great technologies

00:39:31.734 --> 00:39:33.734
that they've built
to help make a great

00:39:33.734 --> 00:39:35.167
video chat experience
for deaf users.

00:39:35.167 --> 00:39:36.801
Chon: Okay, um,
it's my great honor

00:39:36.801 --> 00:39:38.200
to present our work here.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.300
Rosenthal: Do you want to--

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.334
Chon: Yeah, so.

00:39:41.334 --> 00:39:43.200
Rosenthal: There we go.
Switch over.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.501
Chon: Yeah.

00:39:45.501 --> 00:39:46.868
That's okay.

00:39:46.868 --> 00:39:49.033
Just show them after
presenting the slide.

00:39:49.033 --> 00:39:50.234
Rosenthal: Yes, oh, right.

00:39:50.234 --> 00:39:51.467
We're still on slides.
Sorry.

00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:54.033
Chon: Yeah, that's fine.

00:39:54.033 --> 00:39:55.434
Rosenthal: There you go.

00:39:55.434 --> 00:39:56.567
It's over here.

00:39:56.567 --> 00:39:57.834
Chon: Yeah.
Thank you.

00:39:57.834 --> 00:40:00.901
Um, basically,
I'm a Ph student at U-Dub

00:40:00.901 --> 00:40:03.234
to work on Google
as their project.

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.334
It all started
about six years ago,

00:40:05.334 --> 00:40:08.501
and then we conduct a vista last
year, like this picture,

00:40:08.501 --> 00:40:10.801
uh, using, uh,
the old platform.

00:40:10.801 --> 00:40:14.300
So last year, we decided
to move to Android

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.968
to give the same access
to Android Word.

00:40:17.968 --> 00:40:21.267
But the reason is that basically
there are some--

00:40:21.267 --> 00:40:24.501
a system like VRS,
video relay service,

00:40:24.501 --> 00:40:26.400
but it requires high-speed,

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.100
uh, internet service,
to afford them that access.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.400
So it means they cannot
use the system on the go.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.033
So our goal is to provide
the same access,

00:40:35.033 --> 00:40:38.667
um, where they--
wherever they are.

00:40:38.667 --> 00:40:40.934
So we built the video chat
for sign language

00:40:40.934 --> 00:40:44.734
and then working on the cellular
network as well as the wi-fi.

00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:49.067
So the reason choose
the cellular network

00:40:49.067 --> 00:40:53.467
is that we can give
that access everywhere.

00:40:53.467 --> 00:40:55.667
And then so we
optimize something

00:40:55.667 --> 00:40:57.567
to enable the technology.

00:40:57.567 --> 00:41:01.501
So we, uh, investigate
to speed up the encoder

00:41:01.501 --> 00:41:04.167
to enable--to provide
the video code,

00:41:04.167 --> 00:41:07.167
as well as the--
providing low--

00:41:07.167 --> 00:41:10.667
low bit rate to be transmitted
over the network.

00:41:10.667 --> 00:41:15.200
So I've brought
some video here.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.100
So our target bit rate
is 32 bits per second.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.400
On the left top,
there's the original video.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.968
First of all,

00:41:21.968 --> 00:41:24.734
we want it to detect
the skin area.

00:41:24.734 --> 00:41:27.234
And then, uh,
give to us too some blocks

00:41:27.234 --> 00:41:30.300
to be encoded
with a higher bit rate.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.033
So finally, at the bottom,

00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:33.801
there's two different videos.

00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:35.567
The right side,
uh,

00:41:35.567 --> 00:41:39.000
it used that information
to encode--

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.634
to be, um, better quality.

00:41:41.634 --> 00:41:44.467
It means the less to build,
it would be to--relative

00:41:44.467 --> 00:41:46.367
to meet the same
amount of bit.

00:41:46.367 --> 00:41:49.434
And then that bit rate
can be easily transmitted

00:41:49.434 --> 00:41:51.734
over [indistinct]
network.

00:41:51.734 --> 00:41:53.367
Rosenthal: So were you able
to get the demo to work

00:41:53.367 --> 00:41:54.501
or do you want
to show the video?

00:41:54.501 --> 00:41:55.667
Chon: Uh, show the video.

00:41:55.667 --> 00:41:57.000
Rosenthal: Okay.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.133
Chon: So, actually, uh,

00:42:00.133 --> 00:42:01.400
I've asked the people--

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.901
We decided to move
to Android Word,

00:42:03.901 --> 00:42:06.234
so we built the system
from last year

00:42:06.234 --> 00:42:08.801
and then we had the working
system here,

00:42:08.801 --> 00:42:10.834
but because of network issue,

00:42:10.834 --> 00:42:12.567
it is not working
well perfectly.

00:42:12.567 --> 00:42:17.000
So I will show that demo
using the prerecorded video.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.400
I took that video
yesterday night

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.367
with the [indistinct] network.

00:42:21.367 --> 00:42:25.067
So, uh, seems to be better,
but up here, it's not working.

00:42:25.067 --> 00:42:27.667
So please come by
our sandbox booth.

00:42:27.667 --> 00:42:29.334
We're gonna show more
information.

00:42:29.334 --> 00:42:30.467
Thank you.

00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:32.000
Rosenthal: Great.
Thanks, Jaehong.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.200
Chon: Yeah.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.934
Rosenthal: Okay, back to this.

00:42:36.934 --> 00:42:39.367
So, um, to summarize,

00:42:39.367 --> 00:42:41.000
there are some key things
that you can do

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.734
to make your applications
accessible.

00:42:42.734 --> 00:42:45.434
One is to just make sure you
understand your users

00:42:45.434 --> 00:42:48.267
and the use cases under which
they'll be using your products.

00:42:48.267 --> 00:42:50.801
Um, focus on mating--
making products

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:53.467
that enable independence
and have multiple

00:42:53.467 --> 00:42:55.701
ways of interacting so that
you don't end up relying

00:42:55.701 --> 00:42:58.167
on one method
like using a mouse.

00:42:58.167 --> 00:42:59.534
That you have
redundant methods

00:42:59.534 --> 00:43:01.100
like using a keyboard.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.367
Um, make sure that
you provide good feedback

00:43:03.367 --> 00:43:05.534
in your applications
so that your users

00:43:05.534 --> 00:43:07.801
know where they are
at all times.

00:43:07.801 --> 00:43:10.934
And also, think of your entire
end-to-end experience

00:43:10.934 --> 00:43:13.467
from the moment they log in
or even browse your pro--

00:43:13.467 --> 00:43:16.067
Like, to browse your website
to learn about your product,

00:43:16.067 --> 00:43:18.133
to the point where
they're setting it up

00:43:18.133 --> 00:43:20.133
using the settings and,
uh,

00:43:20.133 --> 00:43:22.200
looking up documentation.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.334
Green: That's right.

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.400
So just to leave you with

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.601
a couple points from the talk.

00:43:25.601 --> 00:43:26.767
Our standard toolkits
come with

00:43:26.767 --> 00:43:28.133
great accessibility built in.

00:43:28.133 --> 00:43:29.234
Use them.

00:43:29.234 --> 00:43:31.033
There's a couple things
that, uh--

00:43:31.033 --> 00:43:32.334
We want to make sure
the biggest thing

00:43:32.334 --> 00:43:33.834
you could do is to make sure
that your application

00:43:33.834 --> 00:43:36.033
can be used by
the keyboard alone

00:43:36.033 --> 00:43:38.567
if it's a web app,
or can be focused and used

00:43:38.567 --> 00:43:42.234
by a trackpad or a roller ball

00:43:42.234 --> 00:43:44.934
if it's a mobile application.

00:43:44.934 --> 00:43:46.767
Uh, I want to make sure
that I'm handling

00:43:46.767 --> 00:43:50.100
tab and focus events properly,
whether I'm in Android

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.634
or on the web.

00:43:51.634 --> 00:43:53.968
And then test it in
the type of accessibility

00:43:53.968 --> 00:43:55.300
technology that
you want to target.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:58.367
So download ChromeVox and try
your application out.

00:43:58.367 --> 00:44:00.100
Um, or use the, uh,

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.334
TalkBack
on the Android platform.

00:44:03.334 --> 00:44:04.801
Rosenthal: So there's
a number of ways

00:44:04.801 --> 00:44:06.601
where you can learn
more about accessibility

00:44:06.601 --> 00:44:07.968
while you're here at I/O.

00:44:07.968 --> 00:44:09.767
Um, the first one was
unfortunately a session

00:44:09.767 --> 00:44:11.100
that was earlier today,
which you're gonna

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.834
have to catch on YouTube,
but it was great.

00:44:12.834 --> 00:44:14.067
It was a session
on using Android

00:44:14.067 --> 00:44:16.200
and making your Android apps
accessible.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.234
Tomorrow--
Uh, tomorrow at 12:30,

00:44:18.234 --> 00:44:19.934
we have a session
on YouTube,

00:44:19.934 --> 00:44:23.167
captioning API and speech
recognition and WebVTT.

00:44:23.167 --> 00:44:25.601
And then from 3:00 to 4:00
tomorrow afternoon,

00:44:25.601 --> 00:44:27.434
we have a presentation
on, um,

00:44:27.434 --> 00:44:30.567
making accessible web apps
using HTML5.

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:33.167
Then all day
today and tomorrow,

00:44:33.167 --> 00:44:36.501
we have a developer sandbox
out here on the second floor.

00:44:36.501 --> 00:44:38.067
It's one of the yellow booths,

00:44:38.067 --> 00:44:40.000
for those of you who are
photon-dependent.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.667
Um, there's eight different
stations there

00:44:41.667 --> 00:44:44.901
and you can get a better sense
of all these applications

00:44:44.901 --> 00:44:46.200
and use them yourselves.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.734
Um, the demos will be there.

00:44:47.734 --> 00:44:51.133
And then we also have office
hours right now, actually.

00:44:51.133 --> 00:44:54.501
Uh, started at 3:00
and going until 6:30 today.

00:44:54.501 --> 00:44:56.868
And then tomorrow
from 3:00 to 5:00.

00:44:56.868 --> 00:44:58.834
And those are, again,
on the second floor.

00:44:58.834 --> 00:45:01.067
If you walk around,
there's three little nooks

00:45:01.067 --> 00:45:05.567
and we're in the last one,
um, outside the room at the end.

00:45:05.567 --> 00:45:06.767
Green: Great, okay.

00:45:06.767 --> 00:45:08.033
So to give us feedback,
we would love

00:45:08.033 --> 00:45:09.400
to get your input
on how this talk went.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.334
There's a QR code at the top
or you can just type in

00:45:11.334 --> 00:45:13.067
the feedback link.

00:45:13.067 --> 00:45:15.067
The links for the other things
we referenced

00:45:15.067 --> 00:45:17.634
during the talk,
including how to download,

00:45:17.634 --> 00:45:20.400
uh, ChromeVox and ChromeVis--

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.734
uh, I'm sorry--
and ChromeShades

00:45:22.734 --> 00:45:24.267
are there at the second link.

00:45:24.267 --> 00:45:25.334
Thanks, everybody.

00:45:25.334 --> 00:45:26.367
Please come up to the mics

00:45:26.367 --> 00:45:29.367
if you have other questions.

00:45:29.367 --> 00:45:34.400
[applause]
