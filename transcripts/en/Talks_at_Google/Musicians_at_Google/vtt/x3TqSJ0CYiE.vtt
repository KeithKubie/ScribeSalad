00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.033
Female Presenter: Once again,
the Dodos.

00:30:25.033 --> 00:30:27.967
Thanks so much for making the drive
down to Mountain View.

[applause] 

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.467
So Meric and Logan have kindly
offered to stick around

00:30:33.467 --> 00:30:35.600
for some questions from the audience.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.833
So those of you who want to ask a question
just line up to the microphone here

00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:47.600
and I'll kick it off by first asking why you
guys always get classified as folk music

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.367
when you're so wonderfully loud
and plugged in?

00:30:53.033 --> 00:30:58.867
Meric Long: Well, this is a recent
amalgamation of our band.

00:30:58.867 --> 00:31:07.500
We started out as just acoustic guitar
and one Tom duo, one floor Tom.

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:15.633
Our earlier stuff is I think closer to folk
music but with each successive record,

00:31:15.633 --> 00:31:22.500
we've fallen into the [laughs] the cliché of
strapping on electrics and getting louder.

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.467
Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:24.800
And for those of you who can't see 

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.833
I just want to make sure everyone took
note of the wonderful percussion,

00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:32.600
foot percussion going on with Logan.
[laughs]

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.000
The tambourine on the foot.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.433
[applause] 

00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:39.100
Logan Kroeber: Give it up for old Tambi.
[audience laughter]

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:39.800
Audience Member: Tambi.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.100
Female Presenter: [laughs] So how did
that come about?

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.267
Just lack of arm space?

00:31:44.267 --> 00:31:50.133
Logan Kroeber: I just wanted to look at it.
[laughter]

00:31:50.133 --> 00:31:55.633
On our first record, there was a song
we had done live

00:31:55.633 --> 00:32:01.333
and I was doing something with my hands
and I didn't have a tambourine to hit.

00:32:01.333 --> 00:32:02.800
So I put it on the floor.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.067
And at first I would stomp on it with no--

00:32:07.067 --> 00:32:09.500
nothing to fix it to my foot
and that didn't work very good.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.433
So I would actually duct tape it
to my foot every show

00:32:12.433 --> 00:32:17.867
and that was stupid so
[audience laughter] I made a shoe.

00:32:17.867 --> 00:32:21.367
Female Presenter: Any plans for a custom
version of that coming out soon?

00:32:21.367 --> 00:32:24.800
Logan Kroeber: If there was demand.
[laughter]

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.133
I'd be happy to put my name on it.

00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:29.000
Female Presenter: So on your new record,
'No Color',

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.933
you feature the lovely vocals
of Neko Case.

00:32:32.933 --> 00:32:37.433
How did that collaboration come about?

00:32:37.433 --> 00:32:41.567
Meric Long: We were toying with her band,
The New Pornographers, over the summer

00:32:41.567 --> 00:32:45.167
and she lost a poker bet.
[audience laughs]

00:32:45.167 --> 00:32:50.633
Meric Long: So she had to come sing
on our record. [audience laughter]

00:32:50.633 --> 00:32:52.200
Female Presenter: Any plans
to do more with her?

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:57.167
Or have the Dodos perform
on her next record?

00:32:57.167 --> 00:33:04.467
Meric Long: There was some talk of that
but we're just waiting for that phone call.

00:33:04.467 --> 00:33:05.367
Desperately.

00:33:05.367 --> 00:33:07.500
[laughter] 

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.867
Female Presenter: But she sings
a lot of songs though.

00:33:08.867 --> 00:33:11.967
So it must have been a pretty good bet.

00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:20.067
Meric Long: Yes because it was,she came in
for two days and just like went wild and yeah.

00:33:20.067 --> 00:33:25.300
I think she sang on more stuff but--

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:27.633
it happened so fast
[laughter]

00:33:27.633 --> 00:33:29.033
Female Presenter: Cool.
Lucky.

00:33:29.033 --> 00:33:31.200
Let's take a question from the crowd.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.733
Is there some,yep.

00:33:34.733 --> 00:33:36.000
Male #1: Yeah.
On the new record,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.667
it seems like you guys have
a much heavier guitar sound.

00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:43.033
Could you maybe explain 
why that came about?

00:33:43.033 --> 00:33:50.700
And also could you explain the genesis
of the new album title, 'No Color'?

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.333
Meric Long: Question 1, the one of
the things that we wanted to make sure

00:33:55.333 --> 00:33:58.933
we did on this record was
have lots of time to record.

00:33:58.933 --> 00:34:01.567
Because in the past,
it has been just like go in,

00:34:01.567 --> 00:34:04.433
record the songs as fast as possible.

00:34:04.433 --> 00:34:08.700
And one of the by-products of
that was sort of sitting around

00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.600
with a bunch of pretty finished songs

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.533
but wanting to add something else.

00:34:13.533 --> 00:34:17.200
And there having just a bunch
of electric guitars lying around.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.333
So I ended up playing a lot of that

00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:25.767
and it was actually, 
it was super great and fun for me.

00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:30.300
Because like I actually started out on
the electric guitar and I had forgotten that

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.167
'cause I had been playing acoustic
and focusing on that for so long

00:34:33.167 --> 00:34:37.233
that I had forgotten that
I even knew how to play it.

00:34:37.233 --> 00:34:41.033
During the process of doing that,
twiddling knobs and working with pedals,

00:34:41.033 --> 00:34:45.833
I stumbled upon the sacred Billy Corrigan tone

00:34:45.833 --> 00:34:51.267
and I was really,that ended up being
streamlined to most of the songs.

00:34:51.267 --> 00:34:57.267
And we just added more and more guitars and
ended up with whatever you hear.

00:34:57.267 --> 00:35:02.967
And the album title I will defer to him.

00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:05.333
Logan Kroeber: Question 2.

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:09.000
I--

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.133
when we play certain songs,
like we just played 'Fools'.

00:35:12.133 --> 00:35:15.267
'Fools' to me is blue in my mind when I play it.

00:35:15.267 --> 00:35:16.300
Right?

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.800
And so [laughter]

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:24.333
There's lots of other songs that we play that I
have imagery or colors that I associate with it.

00:35:24.333 --> 00:35:27.533
And when we were doin' 'No Color', 

00:35:27.533 --> 00:35:29.267
we were towards the end
of the mixing process.

00:35:29.267 --> 00:35:31.567
We were listening to the songs every day.

00:35:31.567 --> 00:35:36.800
And I had imagery and colors for the songs
but it was all just like gray.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.667
Ashy and kind of like a campfire
that burned out kind of look

00:35:41.667 --> 00:35:44.833
and I told everybody over dinner one night.

00:35:44.833 --> 00:35:49.167
And it sounds bad when you say,
it's like, 'Oh. "The Season" is red.

00:35:49.167 --> 00:35:52.133
Or "Long Form is orange".'
Or whatever.

00:35:52.133 --> 00:35:55.600
And it's like everything here is gray.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.300
It sounds kind of bad
but it is just what it was

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.900
and Meric and I were driving
back to San Francisco

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.700
after we finished the record
and we were just talkin',

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.567
'What should we name it?'

00:36:05.567 --> 00:36:11.633
And we were trying to come up with a good
way to encapsulate that phenomenon

00:36:11.633 --> 00:36:15.767
and that was the best we could come up with.

00:36:15.767 --> 00:36:17.600
Male  #1: Thank you.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.633
Female #1: So you've
also lost the vibraphone on this record.

00:36:21.633 --> 00:36:27.067
And I wanted to ask how that's
affected the time and the travel

00:36:27.067 --> 00:36:32.233
on your current tour and
what that must have been like?

00:36:32.233 --> 00:36:36.433
I actually saw you guys in an airport once
and you were waiting [laughs].

00:36:36.433 --> 00:36:38.300
And I thought,
'Oh yeah. The vibraphone.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.233
How do they get that
from show to show to show?'

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:45.333
Meric Long: We're,well,
I'm sure our vibraphonist is happy

00:36:45.333 --> 00:36:50.333
that he doesn't have to pack that up
and put it together every night anymore.

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:57.100
It's,we just got this like portable vibraphone
that has like 30 pieces

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.467
and you have to put it together.

00:36:58.467 --> 00:37:03.333
And it wasn't the most practical
choice of instrument

00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:08.733
but we sort of [laughs] really wanted to have
vibraphone in the band for whatever reason.

00:37:08.733 --> 00:37:13.733
And yeah, we,that's--
I mean it's nice that we don't--

00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:17.333
our set up's a lot more simpler now.

00:37:17.333 --> 00:37:21.367
But that was one of those things that also sort
of happened during recording the new record.

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:26.000
We were just-- started to take off
stuff and mix stuff differently.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.500
And by the end of the record being done,

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.133
we had an entire record
with no vibraphone.

00:37:32.133 --> 00:37:37.000
So that's why it's not here.
[laughter]

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.800
Female Presenter: So you're from the Bay Area.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.333
You're from San Francisco and
you've been described as 'music nerds',

00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:44.933
'San Francisco music nerds.'

00:37:44.933 --> 00:37:47.800
Now that you're here at Google
with all the other nerds,

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.900
can you speak to the use of technology 

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.800
either in promoting your music
or putting out your music?

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.167
Creating music?

00:37:59.067 --> 00:38:01.933
Meric Long: I recently
purchased a Nintendo DSi.

00:38:01.933 --> 00:38:05.200
[audience laughter]

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:10.300
and [laughs] in between long hours
of Mario Brothers,

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:15.333
I've actually discovered or Chris,
the other guitarist,

00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:21.633
Hi, he lent me a game that's
like a Korg synthesizer

00:38:21.633 --> 00:38:23.367
that's pretty amazing actually.

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:26.467
And I've been looking for another
copy of the game

00:38:26.467 --> 00:38:30.600
so we could have two Nintendo DSis up here 
and just plug in the amps

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:35.267
 and just have part of
the show where we just play video games.

00:38:35.267 --> 00:38:36.267
[laughter]

00:38:36.267 --> 00:38:38.267
But it's hard.
It's really hard.

00:38:38.267 --> 00:38:41.200
It's a hard game to find.

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.633
Female Presenter: Anybody has
any tips after the show?

00:38:43.633 --> 00:38:44.467
Another question.

00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:45.667
Female #2: Sure.

00:38:45.667 --> 00:38:47.200
First of all, thanks so much for coming.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.633
That was really fun.

00:38:48.633 --> 00:38:51.200
Related to the question about
being from San Francisco.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.033
Welcome back and welcome home.

00:38:53.033 --> 00:38:56.967
I wonder if you guys have your favorite San
Francisco or Bay Area spots that you visit

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:59.433
when you're in town?

00:39:01.167 --> 00:39:03.200
Meric Long: Uhh.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:05.500
Hello.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.133
Food wise?
[laughs]

00:39:07.133 --> 00:39:08.767
Female #2: Anything wise.

00:39:08.767 --> 00:39:11.867
Meric Long: The first thing
I'm gonna do when,

00:39:11.867 --> 00:39:14.833
we're actually going down to L.A.
and coming back.

00:39:14.833 --> 00:39:19.400
When I come back the first thing I'm doing is
probably gonna go to Mission Chinese Food

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.733
and get my fill of Ma Po Tofu.

00:39:24.733 --> 00:39:27.000
That's all I got.
[laughs]

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.233
[audience laughter]
That's all I do when I'm here.

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:31.967
Logan Kroeber: That place is pretty good.

00:39:31.967 --> 00:39:35.633
I haven't had the Ma Po Tofu
'cause it's really spicy supposedly.

00:39:35.633 --> 00:39:39.033
It's got three little flaming buns next to it.

00:39:39.033 --> 00:39:40.500
[audience chuckles]

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.333
Meric Long: [laughs] You will.
You will pay.

00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:45.333
Female Presenter: No burritos?

00:39:45.333 --> 00:39:46.000
Burritos?

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.867
Logan Kroeber: Burritos for sure.

00:39:49.867 --> 00:39:52.300
I've been more on this Colombian kick.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:57.533
There's a place that's across from
the Mission Street City College Campus

00:39:57.533 --> 00:39:59.300
that's right across the way.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.900
And I've been going there and getting like,

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.900
they make like fresh soup
and papusas and stuff.

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:08.567
That's where I'm gonna go.

00:40:08.567 --> 00:40:11.333
Female Presenter: I wanted to ask
a question about the latest video

00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:15.667
because it's a little different than videos
I've seen of the Dodos in the past.

00:40:15.667 --> 00:40:17.567
You must have performed.

00:40:17.567 --> 00:40:20.333
And this video in particular is very dramatic.

00:40:20.333 --> 00:40:22.767
If you wanna maybe describe it a little bit

00:40:22.767 --> 00:40:27.800
and how that came about starring
in your video for Black Night.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.967
Meric Long: We have the director right here.

00:40:30.967 --> 00:40:32.100
Logan Kroeber: All right.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:36.400
I'm gonna try and keep this brief.
[laughs]

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.767
On that same car ride where we were
talkin' about namin' the record 'No Color',

00:40:40.767 --> 00:40:47.567
I also unleashed all my video ideas on Meric
that I'd been stockpiling for the past year.

00:40:47.567 --> 00:40:51.300
And for those who haven't seen the video,

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:57.067
it's a,like, it's kinda like blood sport,
Van Damm type of vibe.

00:40:57.067 --> 00:40:59.767
Well, that's how it originally started.

00:40:59.767 --> 00:41:03.933
But it was originally, originally just
gonna be me and Meric in a boxing ring

00:41:03.933 --> 00:41:06.700
with like a three round match.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:10.200
And I'm glad we decided
[laughs] not to do that.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:16.167
Shirtless on camera for five minutes
is not the best.

00:41:16.167 --> 00:41:18.100
So instead we went the blood sport route,

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.800
got a bunch of our friends involved
to be sort of different,

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:26.967
sort of like fighting characters,
stereotypes, and I don't know.

00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:28.400
It was an insane experience.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:37.700
I've never tried to sort of put a creative idea in
visually or like motion picture into action before

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.600
and it's like,it's kind of addicting
that I really want to try again

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.067
'cause it didn't turn out 
how I wanted to exactly.

00:41:46.067 --> 00:41:51.300
Like the thing in my head was not the same
as what is on YouTube right now.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.467
Female Presenter: Yeah.
What's missing?

00:41:53.467 --> 00:41:54.267
Logan Kroeber: Blood.

00:41:54.267 --> 00:41:55.733
[laughter]

00:41:55.733 --> 00:41:56.833
Logan Kroeber: We shot it in black and white

00:41:56.833 --> 00:41:59.667
and supposedly you can use
chocolate syrup as fake blood

00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:01.400
when you are shooting in black and white.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:06.833
And we ran out of time and we didn't
get to do any of the actual contact.

00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:10.600
We just shot a bunch of like the people
pacing around, you know what I mean?

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.067
There's supposed to be some payoff.

00:42:13.067 --> 00:42:15.833
Female Presenter: Wow.
[laughs]

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:17.533
Next question.

00:42:19.033 --> 00:42:21.067
Male #3: I just want to say
thanks again so much for coming.

00:42:21.067 --> 00:42:23.267
It is awesome to see you guys here.

00:42:23.267 --> 00:42:26.100
So keeping the San Francisco
line of questioning.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.567
You guys obviously got your start
in San Francisco.

00:42:28.567 --> 00:42:32.867
And I'm curious now that
you guys have gotten a lot bigger

00:42:32.867 --> 00:42:35.033
and have toured around the country,

00:42:35.033 --> 00:42:38.533
just sort of how you kind of got
your beginnings in San Francisco.

00:42:38.533 --> 00:42:41.567
How the San Francisco music scene
compares to other music scenes

00:42:41.567 --> 00:42:42.633
you've seen around the country.

00:42:42.633 --> 00:42:47.567
And sort of what that transition like process
has been from being relatively unknown

00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:53.667
to getting a break here and there and
kind of how your life is different?

00:42:53.667 --> 00:42:55.133
Logan Kroeber: What was
the first place you played?

00:42:55.133 --> 00:42:55.800
Solo.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:01.867
Meric Long: Ahh. There's a place,
there's a restaurant called,

00:43:01.867 --> 00:43:03.200
I don't remember actually.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.800
Logan Kroeber: The one that you played
at every week?

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.200
Meric Long: Yeah.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:05.967
No.
Once a month.

00:43:05.967 --> 00:43:07.267
Meric Long: Solstice.
There you go.

00:43:07.267 --> 00:43:10.467
There's a restaurant called Solstice
and that was my first gig.

00:43:10.467 --> 00:43:14.100
They gave me a hundred bucks to play
for two hours

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:20.767
while people were stuffing their faces
and [laughs] and then I just started,

00:43:20.767 --> 00:43:26.067
I started playing a lot of the songs
from our first record

00:43:26.067 --> 00:43:27.733
and writing and playing out.

00:43:27.733 --> 00:43:32.767
And then we started doing
shows together and then we,

00:43:32.767 --> 00:43:38.033
the first sort of like tour we did was,

00:43:38.033 --> 00:43:41.433
our manager at the time,
she was a good booking agent,

00:43:41.433 --> 00:43:44.867
like that's one thing that she could
do really well was book us a tour

00:43:44.867 --> 00:43:46.667
and so we would just like,

00:43:46.667 --> 00:43:51.767
we both had jobs that were really like lenient
with us taking some time off which was good.

00:43:51.767 --> 00:43:54.833
And we would just tour across
the country like literally playing

00:43:54.833 --> 00:44:01.567
to four or five people every night
in some crappy bar.

00:44:01.567 --> 00:44:04.667
But I think, but after doing that for a year, 

00:44:04.667 --> 00:44:07.867
we ended up recording a record
and writing songs on the road

00:44:07.867 --> 00:44:15.300
and that record became 'Visitor' and
that was sort of our first breakthrough.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:20.000
Our first record that we put out with the label
that got some attention and got reviewed.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.967
And what was the secondpart
of your question? [laughs]

00:44:28.267 --> 00:44:29.367
Female Presenter: One more question

00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:30.700
Male #4: I don't see a merch table.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.833
I do see a table but there's
no merchandise on the table.

00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:35.933
Do you,are you selling
anything here like records?

00:44:35.933 --> 00:44:37.067
Meric Long: We can.

00:44:37.067 --> 00:44:39.933
Male #4: You can?
[laughter]

00:44:39.933 --> 00:44:45.633
Logan Kroeber: There'll be a parking lot party
[laughter] in twenty minutes.

00:44:45.633 --> 00:44:47.967
Male #4: In twenty minutes.
Okay.

00:44:47.967 --> 00:44:51.733
Female Presenter: Well thanks again
for driving down here and again,

00:44:51.733 --> 00:44:53.500
tonight's performance is at the Fillmore,

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.667
the Reading Rainbow, for those of you
who want to see a double dose of the Dodos.

00:44:57.667 --> 00:44:58.633
Thank you so much.

00:44:58.633 --> 00:44:59.600
[applause]

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.867
Meric Long: Thanks

00:45:01.867 --> 00:45:02.733
[applause]
00:45:02.733,00:00:00.000
