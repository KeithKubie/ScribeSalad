00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.900
Our visit to Mohammed caused quite a lot of trouble

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.320
after the foreigners had left, he and his large family had to move

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.220
to his brother's house to get away from the neighbours' questions

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.940
Mohammed doesn't want anyone to know why the journalists had come to film

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.040
at a poor Kabul resident's house

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.720
Mohammed will never let on that behind his back,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.740
his neighbours call him a mada-posht

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.880
one who has only daughters

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.000
In traditional Afghan society, it's hard to find a more shameful nickname to give a man

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.360
Having seven daughters and no sons in a patriarchal society is quite a social stigma

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.420
10-year old Amena was given no choice

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.260
Her father made her become a bacha posh

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.640
Every Afghan woman must have a man beside her

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.280
if not a husband, a son will do

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.540
Abos asked for a ball for his birthday

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.260
He'll soon turn 9

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.700
And football is his favourite game

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.900
Abos is her name outside of the home

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.420
within the family, her name is Fazilya

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.700
Their mother dresses the younger sister as a boy too

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.600
Abos and her grandfather are the only members of the family

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.100
who can venture freely outside their backyard

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.740
This time the mother has sent her daughter to the local hairdresser

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.620
because the family has been invited to a neighbour's wedding

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.040
Girls like Asiya are called "bad boys"

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.260
She's a troubled teenager

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.600
in the girls' school in Kabul, both teachers and fellow students complain about her

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.820
she behaves like a boy and only has to cover her head like all the other girls when she's in class

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.100
Asiya is a rare type of bacha posh

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.720
it was her own decision to dress like a boy

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.820
she has a brother so her family isn't lacking an heir

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.620
Asiya likes the freedom that boy's clothes give her

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.180
Freedom that her female friends can't enjoy

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.240
20-year old Najla works as a secretary at a firm selling anti-cellulite products

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.200
Out of respect for her boss and colleagues, she covers her head in the office

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.280
But just after the daily call to prayer, she finishes her work day

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.380
Changes to her usual clothes

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.540
which passersby find shocking

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.000
and hurries to the other end of Kabul

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.620
to a place everyone knows her as Coach Tofan

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:09.580
Afghanistan's only Taekwondo school for girls is covertly hidden away in a basement

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.700
and doesn't ever advertise itself.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.400
When the training session ends, close to sunset

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.220
Tofan covers her head again

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.720
and goes to night school.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.460
Girls dressing as boys is an Afghan tradition

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.640
It's concealed but not taboo

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.740
but when bacha-posh girls come of age

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.860
they go back to dressing as girls

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.860
and their parents try to marry them off usually to a relative

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.520
Tofan is a rare exception who refuses to start a family and have children

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.720
She wants freedom

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.800
and in Afghanistan, only the men have that

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:13.820
We arranged to meet Najla at her home the next morning

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.940
but as we reached her doorstep, she called to say she didn't want to be filmed anymore

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.680
The foreigners visiting her work place had alerted the firm's owner

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.080
from whom Najla keeps her second name and double life a secret.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.300
The brave taekwondo fighter was afraid

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.900
Abos only went to school for a year before the family ran out of money

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:59.380
Now the bacha-posh can only attend the madrasah, a religious school

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.400
After school, there'll be a party

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.400
Abos is turning 9

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.220
For her birthday, she receives the long-awaited ball

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.120
The neighbours' children, boys and girls are all invited

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.740
Dressed in a boy's shalwar kameez

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.580
Amena goes to the city every day to sell water

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.200
Outside of her father's hearing, she confesses that she hates the job

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.840
It's hard to hide from passersby that she's actually a girl

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.560
Two years ago there was some hope for Amena's parents

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:13.260
Mohammed's wife gave birth to a boy

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:18.060
The family of modest means had only two months to celebrate the birth of an heir

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.020
before tragically the baby died.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.220
Amena's mother can't have more children now

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.660
meaning that the girl will have to remain a boy for a few more years.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:48.580
Asiya and her friend visits Kabul's most western and fashionable shopping centre to buy clothes

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.720
Passersby might easily think they're brother and sister

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.180
maybe even a couple

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.440
Places where no one asks Asiya if she's a boy or a girl are few and far between

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.720
Asiya is fully aware she is defying the ultra conservative Afghan social norms

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.740
She also knows her protest would not have been possible without her parents' approval

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.440
Near the end of our visit, Asiya invites us to her home

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.300
She promised to introduce us to her parents.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.220
Asiya had tried to trick us

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.700
We later learnt it was because of her parents

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.300
They refused point-blank to be filmed and forbade her

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.800
But because she's a bacha-posh

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.580
She can decide for herself

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.380
and choose her own destiny
