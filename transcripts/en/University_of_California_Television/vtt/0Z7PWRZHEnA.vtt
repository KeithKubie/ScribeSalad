00:00:11.248 --> 00:00:14.415
(gentle guitar music)

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:25.942
- We salute innovators who
push the limits of science,

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:29.502
changing how we see the
world and ourselves.

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:32.040
Growing up, Sally Ride read
about the space program

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.205
in the newspaper almost
every day and she thought

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:37.288
this was the coolest thing around.

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:40.260
- [Tam] The President
decided that Sally deserved

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.576
a Presidential Medal of Freedom.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.889
- As the first American woman in space,

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:49.564
Sally didn't just break the
stratospheric glass ceiling,

00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:51.235
she blasted through it.

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:55.630
- And Obama also decided
that I should be the one

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.353
to accept the award, which also was like,

00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:01.229
"Oh my gosh, what is
going on in our world?"

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.631
Finally, you know?

00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:06.316
Don't need to be secretive
about who I really am any more,

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:09.533
and I just wished that
Sally could experience

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.400
what I experienced.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.506
- Tam O'Shaughnessy,
accepting on behalf of

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:17.849
her life partner, Dr. Sally K. Ride.

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:20.099
(applause)

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:29.232
- For the United States of America

00:01:29.232 --> 00:01:31.710
I christen thee Sally Ride.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.422
May God bless this ship
and all who sail in her.

00:01:35.422 --> 00:01:37.319
(bottle crashes)

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.486
(applause and cheers)

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.729
The ship is just sort
of drop dead gorgeous.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.432
So I'm happy and I also have to say that

00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:04.229
when I see Sally's name
various places around the ship

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.052
my heart does something,
it's a weird feeling.

00:02:07.052 --> 00:02:10.291
So it's happiness and a
little bit of sadness, too.

00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:12.124
It still gets me, wow.

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:21.375
(cheerful music)

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.622
We both grew up in Southern California.

00:02:29.622 --> 00:02:32.614
My memory is meeting Sally
in Redlands, California

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:35.409
when I was 12 and she was 13.

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.615
We were good friends during
the junior tennis days,

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:41.130
and both of us traveled
back East and of course

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.910
up and down California playing the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.835
junior tennis tournaments.

00:02:44.835 --> 00:02:48.347
Then Sally went off to
college, she was at Swarthmore

00:02:48.347 --> 00:02:50.742
for about a year and a half and then

00:02:50.742 --> 00:02:55.727
started to commit to physics,
and then went to Stanford.

00:02:55.727 --> 00:02:58.097
I played on the circuit
for almost four years

00:02:58.097 --> 00:03:02.976
and then when I left I went to
work in Northern California.

00:03:02.976 --> 00:03:06.238
Sally was in school at
Stanford, so then we reconnected

00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:08.542
and would go running in the Stanford hills

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:10.643
and play tennis in the morning before work

00:03:10.643 --> 00:03:12.414
and that sort of thing.

00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:16.085
I really wanted to study
biology, so I moved to Atlanta.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:19.021
A few months later is when Sally was

00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:23.667
eating scrambled eggs in
the Stanford Student Union

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:26.365
and looked at the student
newspaper and saw that

00:03:26.365 --> 00:03:29.164
NASA was, for the first
time, recruiting women

00:03:29.164 --> 00:03:31.252
to become astronauts.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:32.845
- The moment I saw that
ad I knew that that's

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:33.784
what I wanted to do.

00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:36.275
I ripped it out of the
newspaper and I literally

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:38.192
applied that afternoon.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.990
It turned out a lot of other
people did the same thing.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.823
(laughter)

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:44.046
There were about 8,000 of us who applied

00:03:44.046 --> 00:03:47.381
to that opportunity, and
it was the first time

00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:50.919
that they were admitting women
into the astronaut corps.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.669
Out of that group, NASA
picked 35 of us to be

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.296
the first class of astronauts
specifically selected

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:02.402
for the space shuttle program.

00:04:02.402 --> 00:04:06.654
- They called them the 35 new guys, TFNGs.

00:04:06.654 --> 00:04:09.757
There were six women, the
very first women who were

00:04:09.757 --> 00:04:12.724
kind of officially astronauts.

00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:14.807
It was the class of 1978.

00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:18.650
Everybody kind of trained
together and learned about

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.621
the space shuttle, all of its system.

00:04:21.621 --> 00:04:25.135
When you're in space,
how everything works.

00:04:25.135 --> 00:04:28.267
Then Sally got a really
key assignment which was

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:31.244
to help design and build the robotic arm.

00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:34.057
So she got noticed there.

00:04:34.057 --> 00:04:37.290
Then because of that she was named CAPCOM,

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.613
and the CAPCOM is the only person down in

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:44.482
Mission Control in Houston
that speaks to the astronauts.

00:04:44.482 --> 00:04:46.270
- And we appreciate all
that, I think that gave us

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.453
a lot of good data.

00:04:48.453 --> 00:04:50.974
- So it was a critical role, and Sally got

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:53.560
very high marks and got noticed for just

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.850
how cool she was under pressure,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.899
how kind of concise she was
in speaking to the astronauts,

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:01.732
and relaying messages.

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:07.251
No one knows for sure how
the decision got made,

00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:11.255
but the rumor is that she just
sort of did things so well,

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:13.781
and also she was very easy going.

00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:16.370
So she was very easy
actually to get along with.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.571
So all those things
turned into Sally being

00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:23.024
the one named as the first American woman

00:05:23.024 --> 00:05:26.210
to fly in space in 1982 sometime.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.055
Then her crew worked
together for about a year

00:05:29.055 --> 00:05:33.825
and then she flew in June
1983, her first flight.

00:05:33.825 --> 00:05:37.992
- [Reporter] Now Dr. Ride,
during your training exercises

00:05:39.201 --> 00:05:43.197
as a member of this group,
when there was a problem,

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:46.217
when there was a funny,
a glitch, or whatever,

00:05:46.217 --> 00:05:49.002
how did you respond, how do
you take it as a human being?

00:05:49.002 --> 00:05:51.335
Do you weep, what do you do?

00:05:52.912 --> 00:05:57.733
- (laughs) Why doesn't anybody
as Rick those questions?

00:05:57.733 --> 00:06:00.316
(crowd laughs)

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:04.719
(laughs)

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:06.527
I don't think that I react any differently

00:06:06.527 --> 00:06:09.065
than anybody else on the crew does.

00:06:09.065 --> 00:06:10.504
- [Reporter] Do you feel
that the coverage that

00:06:10.504 --> 00:06:12.755
has been given has been disproportionate

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:17.449
with regards to the first
American woman in space?

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.553
- I think that it's maybe
too bad that our society

00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:25.092
isn't further along and that
this is such a big deal.

00:06:25.092 --> 00:06:28.925
But I guess if the
American public thinks that

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.816
it's a big deal then
it's probably good that

00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:35.360
it's getting the coverage
that it's getting.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.248
I think it's time that
we get away from that

00:06:37.248 --> 00:06:40.068
and it's time that people realize that

00:06:40.068 --> 00:06:44.833
women in this country can do
any job that they want to do.

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:47.449
- Every astronaut during
the space shuttle days

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.157
was allowed to invite
50 friends and family.

00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:53.395
I didn't get to see Sally
'cause Sally was in quarantine,

00:06:53.395 --> 00:06:57.362
but I got to experience the launch and

00:06:57.362 --> 00:07:01.636
be in the stands with Sally's
mother and father and sister.

00:07:01.636 --> 00:07:03.886
It was quite an experience.

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:16.435
- On launch day there
was so much excitement

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:19.444
and so much happening around us.

00:07:19.444 --> 00:07:23.611
In the crew quarters, even
on the way to the launch pad,

00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:28.101
going up the launch pad,
looking up and seeing

00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:32.268
this huge rocket that kind
of sounds like an animal.

00:07:34.007 --> 00:07:36.780
You can kind of hear the
gurgling and the hissing,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.079
and it sounds like it's alive.

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:42.768
There's so much going on,
and of course it's all new.

00:07:42.768 --> 00:07:47.615
The training really doesn't
prepare you for launch morning.

00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:50.334
I spent an enormous amount of effort

00:07:50.334 --> 00:07:52.667
just trying to stay focused.

00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:59.998
- [Launch Control] T minus
10, nine, eight, seven, six,

00:07:59.998 --> 00:08:03.845
we go for main engine start,
we have main engine start,

00:08:03.845 --> 00:08:05.928
and ignition and liftoff.

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:11.952
Liftoff of STS-7 and America's
first woman astronaut

00:08:11.952 --> 00:08:15.035
and the shuttle has pulled the tower.

00:08:19.114 --> 00:08:23.483
- That was my first chance
to strap into a rocket

00:08:23.483 --> 00:08:27.080
on the launch pad and
go from a standing start

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.663
to 17,500 miles an hour
in eight and a half

00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:35.135
really fast minutes.

00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:38.471
- When the rockets fire, Sally realized,

00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:43.415
and all the astronauts know,
she couldn't control anything.

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:47.332
When the rocket fuel
ignites, it has to explode

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:51.374
and do what it's gonna
do until it burns out.

00:08:51.374 --> 00:08:53.291
There is nothing to do.

00:08:54.455 --> 00:08:56.674
- Once the space shuttle's engines cut off

00:08:56.674 --> 00:08:59.249
and we were in orbit around Earth,

00:08:59.249 --> 00:09:01.753
it's my first chance to unbuckle,

00:09:01.753 --> 00:09:04.519
float weightless in the space shuttle.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:05.789
Weightlessness, by the way, is something

00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:07.265
that I recommend to all of you.

00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:08.374
(crowd laughs)

00:09:08.374 --> 00:09:10.737
It's just fun, there's
no other word for it.

00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:12.505
Then of course it was also my first chance

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:15.269
to float over to the
window and take a look down

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:19.436
at the really spectacular
view of the Earth below.

00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:25.372
- She saw this fuzzy thin
blue line and she was like,

00:09:27.183 --> 00:09:28.990
and then she instantly realized that was

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.407
Earth's atmosphere, and it was a surprise

00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:36.998
how little, how thin,
how fragile it looked.

00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:39.703
That moment in space really made her

00:09:39.703 --> 00:09:42.029
kind of a true environmentalist.

00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:45.347
She just realized that our
atmosphere, Earth's air,

00:09:45.347 --> 00:09:48.353
is all that protects
us from the blackness,

00:09:48.353 --> 00:09:52.520
the vacuum of space and
whoa, we better protect it.

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.896
- [Controller] And
Challenger is back home,

00:10:01.896 --> 00:10:03.519
back to Earth.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:06.269
(crowd applauds)

00:10:08.618 --> 00:10:12.952
- She flew her second
mission October of 1984,

00:10:12.952 --> 00:10:16.894
and she was a seasoned
astronaut on that one.

00:10:16.894 --> 00:10:18.435
Then she was assigned a third flight

00:10:18.435 --> 00:10:20.515
and started training for that flight.

00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:24.630
Then NASA sent her across the
country to give talks to kids

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.395
and corporate leaders
and teachers and so on.

00:10:27.395 --> 00:10:29.941
So she started coming to Atlanta and

00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:33.467
we resumed our friendship,
and then over time

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:37.634
it turned into something
else, it became romantic.

00:10:38.979 --> 00:10:40.146
That was 1985.

00:10:41.005 --> 00:10:43.322
So anyway, Sally was assigned her third

00:10:43.322 --> 00:10:45.753
space shuttle flight, she came to visit me

00:10:45.753 --> 00:10:49.221
from Houston in Atlanta for my birthday.

00:10:49.221 --> 00:10:53.613
Then she was actually
flying home on January 28th

00:10:53.613 --> 00:10:56.332
and the pilot told Sally
that the space shuttle

00:10:56.332 --> 00:11:00.790
Challenger had exploded and
that all lives were lost.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.623
They were her friends.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.805
It was also the flight
with the first teacher

00:11:08.805 --> 00:11:10.846
to fly in space, Christa McAuliffe.

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:15.013
So it was a national major
heartbreak and disaster.

00:11:19.937 --> 00:11:24.104
Immediately after the space
shuttle Challenger blew up,

00:11:25.098 --> 00:11:30.045
NASA stopped all operations,
'cause they needed to.

00:11:30.045 --> 00:11:32.033
Ronald Reagan was our president.

00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:36.200
He selected Sally to be
on the investigation team,

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.204
the Rogers Commission, to
figure out what went wrong

00:11:40.204 --> 00:11:44.168
and to fix it, make sure
it never happened again.

00:11:44.168 --> 00:11:47.567
And NASA decided to open
up an office of exploration

00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:49.775
and headquarters in Washington D.C.

00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:52.348
So once again Sally was
the one chosen to be

00:11:52.348 --> 00:11:55.848
the first director, and
her experiences in space

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:59.042
and seeing the Earth from
above actually kind of

00:11:59.042 --> 00:12:02.410
fed into the very first
report that she led

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.297
the study group and the analysis of,

00:12:04.297 --> 00:12:06.044
it's called the Ride Report.

00:12:06.044 --> 00:12:09.295
Then in the meantime she
realized it was gonna take NASA

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:12.900
a long time to kind of get going again.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.129
Sally loved to fly, she
wanted to go in space,

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:17.200
she didn't really want
to just be an astronaut

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.881
on the ground doing other
work, important work,

00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:22.653
but it didn't interest her.

00:12:22.653 --> 00:12:26.722
So she decided to start
thinking about returning to

00:12:26.722 --> 00:12:29.821
the university world as a professor.

00:12:29.821 --> 00:12:32.502
And UCSD just said we'll
make you a full professor,

00:12:32.502 --> 00:12:35.199
you'll have tenure,
and we expect you to do

00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:37.310
good work in physics again.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.721
And Sally was a California
girl and so she decided

00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:43.898
UCSD was the perfect place for her.

00:12:43.898 --> 00:12:47.067
I was back in the South and
I had started a PhD program

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:49.670
at University of Georgia in ecology.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.779
But we had done a long
distance relationship

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:55.946
for four years, and it was
really hard on both of us.

00:12:57.654 --> 00:13:01.025
So I joined Sally in 1989, the same year

00:13:01.025 --> 00:13:02.692
she started at UCSD.

00:13:12.445 --> 00:13:14.604
Sally had written one
children's science book

00:13:14.604 --> 00:13:17.577
with her best friend from
high school, Sue Okie,

00:13:17.577 --> 00:13:19.167
To Space and Back.

00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:22.299
It's about the space shuttle
and how you go to space

00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:25.083
and some of the physics and so on.

00:13:25.083 --> 00:13:28.261
We decided that we wanted to try writing

00:13:28.261 --> 00:13:30.721
children's science books together.

00:13:30.721 --> 00:13:33.837
We just learned a lot
about how to write them,

00:13:33.837 --> 00:13:35.450
how to choose the photographs,

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.898
how to think of the illustrations to help

00:13:37.898 --> 00:13:39.693
young people learn the science,

00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:42.121
and we just really enjoyed doing that.

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:44.520
By that time I was a
professor, she was a professor,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.304
so we had kind of nine
to five jobs and then

00:13:47.304 --> 00:13:50.849
we'd do it in the
evening or weekends also.

00:13:50.849 --> 00:13:54.793
We started noticing the
articles and the reviews

00:13:54.793 --> 00:13:59.054
about how American kids
do in math and science,

00:13:59.054 --> 00:14:01.505
and we were just kind of appalled.

00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:05.849
So in 2001 Sally and I
and three of our friends

00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:07.797
started Sally Ride Science.

00:14:07.797 --> 00:14:11.380
Our goal was put together
programs for kids

00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:15.482
and teacher training for teachers,

00:14:15.482 --> 00:14:19.248
and then also keep writing
books but on a bigger scale

00:14:19.248 --> 00:14:22.242
that would be engaging,
exciting, but accurate

00:14:22.242 --> 00:14:26.692
in all areas of biology,
chemistry, physics,

00:14:26.692 --> 00:14:30.224
climate change, all the
topics across the board

00:14:30.224 --> 00:14:32.949
that kids need to learn.

00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:35.184
We started to bring in revenue through our

00:14:35.184 --> 00:14:37.329
Sally Ride Science Festivals,

00:14:37.329 --> 00:14:41.398
one-day events on college
campuses across the country.

00:14:41.398 --> 00:14:44.070
Then we started publishing our books

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.327
and we just kind of kept boot strapping

00:14:46.327 --> 00:14:51.240
everything we could, and
in March 2011 we were just

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.854
getting ready to launch
our big book series

00:14:53.854 --> 00:14:55.879
with wonderful teacher guides and

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:57.461
teacher training and so on.

00:14:57.461 --> 00:15:00.924
So we went to San
Francisco, we had a party to

00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:02.960
announce our books.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.748
Sally and I actually
took a cab to the party

00:15:05.748 --> 00:15:08.356
and I noticed in the cab that Sally looked

00:15:08.356 --> 00:15:11.113
a little yellow, and she had said earlier

00:15:11.113 --> 00:15:13.292
she didn't want to eat
dinner, she didn't feel good.

00:15:13.292 --> 00:15:16.379
So we flew back to San
Diego the next morning.

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:18.722
We took a cab from the
airport, dropped Sally off

00:15:18.722 --> 00:15:21.472
at her doctor's office near UCSD.

00:15:22.554 --> 00:15:25.199
I had the cab take me home, get the car,

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:28.058
come back to the doctor's
office, I parked the car,

00:15:28.058 --> 00:15:31.270
and I'm getting out and walking
into the doctor's office

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.563
and Sally's coming out.

00:15:32.563 --> 00:15:36.901
I can just tell by her face
that something's bad wrong.

00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:39.901
And her doctor, Dr. Lopez, she said,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.788
"Lopez says I have a mass in my pancreas

00:15:44.788 --> 00:15:48.095
"and we're going right now
to radiology up the hill,

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:51.012
"UCSD Medical, to have a CAT scan."

00:15:52.615 --> 00:15:56.946
And we were driving over kind of in a fog.

00:15:56.946 --> 00:15:59.942
We were both just in shock.

00:15:59.942 --> 00:16:03.200
I just remember thinking that oh my God,

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.181
our lives are gonna be different because

00:16:06.181 --> 00:16:09.218
he said you have a mass,
and he also said that

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:12.134
it was very likely she
had pancreatic cancer.

00:16:12.134 --> 00:16:16.727
So we heard the C word and
from the time she was diagnosed

00:16:16.727 --> 00:16:20.477
until the day she died
it was like 17 months.

00:16:26.666 --> 00:16:28.942
Shortly after Sally
died I'm in the office,

00:16:28.942 --> 00:16:31.683
doing my work, learning
how to be a good CEO,

00:16:31.683 --> 00:16:34.883
and my assistant comes over and says

00:16:34.883 --> 00:16:36.400
you have a telephone call, and she said

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.578
it's the Secretary of the
Navy, Secretary Ray Mabus.

00:16:40.578 --> 00:16:43.821
I said okay, well I'll take that call.

00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:47.442
So I said hello to
Secretary Mabus and he said

00:16:47.442 --> 00:16:51.966
the Navy was building two
brand new research vessels

00:16:51.966 --> 00:16:54.513
and they were naming
one after Neil Armstrong

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:56.956
and they wanted to name the second one,

00:16:56.956 --> 00:17:00.265
the other one, after Sally,
and what did I think of that?

00:17:00.265 --> 00:17:04.049
And I just said wow, it's
a research vessel, right?

00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:05.050
It's not a war ship?

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.829
'Cause she wouldn't like that.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.937
And he said yes, and I
said that's fantastic.

00:17:08.937 --> 00:17:11.897
Then he told me it was gonna
be operated by Scripps.

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:14.387
Then he said there's one
other thing I want to ask you,

00:17:14.387 --> 00:17:18.207
would you be kind enough
to be the ship sponsor?

00:17:18.207 --> 00:17:20.617
He explained that the
research vessel Sally Ride

00:17:20.617 --> 00:17:23.755
is the first academic
research vessel ever named

00:17:23.755 --> 00:17:25.519
after a woman.

00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:30.160
So most ship sponsors
are the wives of the man

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.221
whose name is honoring the ship.

00:17:33.221 --> 00:17:36.627
So he said, we think it's
appropriate as Sally's partner

00:17:36.627 --> 00:17:38.896
for you to be the ship sponsor.

00:17:38.896 --> 00:17:41.229
I was just kind of in shock,

00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:44.184
I mean I was just kind of blown away.

00:17:44.184 --> 00:17:47.894
It's like, wow, don't ask
don't tell really is history.

00:17:47.894 --> 00:17:49.644
This is unbelievable.

00:17:52.388 --> 00:17:54.989
Sally would have loved that moment.

00:17:54.989 --> 00:17:58.394
And Sally would love that
this is a research vessel,

00:17:58.394 --> 00:18:01.258
state-of-the-art, and
just would be so excited

00:18:01.258 --> 00:18:03.311
about the research that's gonna be done in

00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:05.144
the next 30, 40 years.

00:18:06.408 --> 00:18:08.964
- A new ship like Sally Ride comes around

00:18:08.964 --> 00:18:13.218
once every 40 years, so this
is a remarkably big deal

00:18:13.218 --> 00:18:14.878
for people here at Scripps,

00:18:14.878 --> 00:18:18.759
and I would say for Americans
and American scientists.

00:18:18.759 --> 00:18:21.466
When we go to sea, we can
do any kind of science.

00:18:21.466 --> 00:18:24.243
We can do geology, chemistry, physics,

00:18:24.243 --> 00:18:27.271
atmospheric physics, we
study everything from

00:18:27.271 --> 00:18:31.200
the very inside of the
Earth to up in the heavens.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.952
So many of the things
that affect us on land

00:18:33.952 --> 00:18:35.995
have their roots in the oceans,

00:18:35.995 --> 00:18:40.824
from global climate change
to the fate of pollutants

00:18:40.824 --> 00:18:44.153
to the food that we eat,
even the air that we breathe

00:18:44.153 --> 00:18:46.799
relies on a healthy ocean.

00:18:46.799 --> 00:18:49.906
We have to understand
what's going on out here.

00:18:49.906 --> 00:18:53.323
Ships like Sally Ride make that possible.

00:18:54.296 --> 00:18:57.809
- I love the new ship smell and all the

00:18:57.809 --> 00:19:00.126
top-of-the-line equipment that we have.

00:19:00.126 --> 00:19:02.671
It's also really exciting
that it's named after

00:19:02.671 --> 00:19:06.764
Dr. Sally Ride, she is a great
legacy here in San Diego,

00:19:06.764 --> 00:19:10.104
being a female scientist,
getting to go to space,

00:19:10.104 --> 00:19:11.230
be an explorer.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.940
I always wanted to be an explorer and

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:16.131
I still feel like a modern-day explorer

00:19:16.131 --> 00:19:17.978
whenever I go out to sea.

00:19:17.978 --> 00:19:20.695
- So Sally flew in space
when you were one year old.

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:22.721
- Yep, exactly, she was there.

00:19:22.721 --> 00:19:26.545
- Sally loved science, she loved research.

00:19:26.545 --> 00:19:29.274
That's what this vessel is all about is

00:19:29.274 --> 00:19:32.018
pushing the envelope, trying
to learn more and more

00:19:32.018 --> 00:19:35.454
about the oceans, about how
the atmosphere and oceans

00:19:35.454 --> 00:19:39.475
interact and work together,
and she would love that.

00:19:39.475 --> 00:19:42.599
But it's also about role
models and providing

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:45.948
more and more opportunities for girls,

00:19:45.948 --> 00:19:49.216
for people of color, she loved all of that

00:19:49.216 --> 00:19:51.433
and devoted her life to
it through our company

00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:53.956
and many other things she did.

00:19:53.956 --> 00:19:57.200
Then because she was a professor at UCSD

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.534
she was also the Director
of the California

00:19:59.534 --> 00:20:02.299
Space Institute and she had an office

00:20:02.299 --> 00:20:05.676
overlooking the Pacific at Scripps.

00:20:05.676 --> 00:20:09.059
Then I think the final cool
piece is Margaret Leinen.

00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:12.309
Margaret's a renowned oceanographer but

00:20:13.356 --> 00:20:15.221
not very many women have been able to be

00:20:15.221 --> 00:20:18.290
the head of Scripps
Institution of Oceanography.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.904
So that's so cool, too.

00:20:20.904 --> 00:20:25.020
It's just all of this coming
together, it's perfection.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.770
(cheerful music)
