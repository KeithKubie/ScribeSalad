00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.130
records dumped out there into the open
space and and this might be the biggest

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140
space and and this might be the biggest
 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.460
space and and this might be the biggest
such leak ever so I mean really how bad

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470
such leak ever so I mean really how bad
 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.970
such leak ever so I mean really how bad
is it I think there's to some extent an

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980
is it I think there's to some extent an
 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.460
is it I think there's to some extent an
over reaction in the sense that we've

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470
over reaction in the sense that we've
 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.770
over reaction in the sense that we've
had occasional breeches like this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780
had occasional breeches like this
 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.500
had occasional breeches like this
perhaps not exactly this magnitude but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510
perhaps not exactly this magnitude but
 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.110
perhaps not exactly this magnitude but
large breaches and those repeated

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120
large breaches and those repeated
 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.140
large breaches and those repeated
occurrences so it's something that we

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150
occurrences so it's something that we
 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.260
occurrences so it's something that we
sort of come to expect that you're going

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270
sort of come to expect that you're going
 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.459
sort of come to expect that you're going
to be to hear about large password

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469
to be to hear about large password
 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.639
to be to hear about large password
database is being compromised and linked

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649
database is being compromised and linked
 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.830
database is being compromised and linked
into the Internet so why is it bad why

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840
into the Internet so why is it bad why
 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.279
into the Internet so why is it bad why
is it a bad thing brokers well obviously

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289
is it a bad thing brokers well obviously
 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.039
is it a bad thing brokers well obviously
for the company that lost the password

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049
for the company that lost the password
 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.059
for the company that lost the password
database it's it's an embarrassing event

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069
database it's it's an embarrassing event
 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.489
database it's it's an embarrassing event
and it's also an inconvenience for the

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:29.499
and it's also an inconvenience for the
 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.020
and it's also an inconvenience for the
users because they're going to force the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030
users because they're going to force the
 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.910
users because they're going to force the
users to sort of recover the accounts

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920
users to sort of recover the accounts
 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.679
users to sort of recover the accounts
it's really I had to change mine yeah

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689
it's really I had to change mine yeah
 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.929
it's really I had to change mine yeah
right and I made some users might have

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939
right and I made some users might have
 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.669
right and I made some users might have
difficulty doing this so they might they

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679
difficulty doing this so they might they
 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.770
difficulty doing this so they might they
will probably lose the number of

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780
will probably lose the number of
 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.370
will probably lose the number of
customers on that after that event and

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380
customers on that after that event and
 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.840
customers on that after that event and
so there's a big impact to the company

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850
so there's a big impact to the company
 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.669
so there's a big impact to the company
involved but for the users there's also

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679
involved but for the users there's also
 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.419
involved but for the users there's also
a big impact because many users have a

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429
a big impact because many users have a
 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.069
a big impact because many users have a
small number of passwords that they

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079
small number of passwords that they
 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.239
small number of passwords that they
reuse across sites and so what is going

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249
reuse across sites and so what is going
 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.099
reuse across sites and so what is going
to happen is once the developers crack

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109
to happen is once the developers crack
 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.139
to happen is once the developers crack
this passwords and they have the

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149
this passwords and they have the
 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:02.999
this passwords and they have the
association bit of the username to the

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009
association bit of the username to the
 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.230
association bit of the username to the
password they can attempt to compromise

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240
password they can attempt to compromise
 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.050
password they can attempt to compromise
the counts in other sites using those

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060
the counts in other sites using those
 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.780
the counts in other sites using those
credentials right but the passwords were

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790
credentials right but the passwords were
 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.060
credentials right but the passwords were
encrypted so shouldn't we be safe

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070
encrypted so shouldn't we be safe
 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.750
encrypted so shouldn't we be safe
so if it actually depends a lot on the

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760
so if it actually depends a lot on the
 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.150
so if it actually depends a lot on the
type of encryption that was used so for

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160
type of encryption that was used so for
 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.220
type of encryption that was used so for
instance when you have encryption or

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230
instance when you have encryption or
 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.950
instance when you have encryption or
hash and it doesn't involve salts then

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960
hash and it doesn't involve salts then
 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.440
hash and it doesn't involve salts then
techniques such as rainbow tables which

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
techniques such as rainbow tables which
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.600
techniques such as rainbow tables which
is it's a highly parallelizable

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610
is it's a highly parallelizable
 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.700
is it's a highly parallelizable
technique so attackers can for instance

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710
technique so attackers can for instance
 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.400
technique so attackers can for instance
run jobs in any cloud service and a

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410
run jobs in any cloud service and a
 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.340
run jobs in any cloud service and a
crack a very large percentage of the of

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350
crack a very large percentage of the of
 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.410
crack a very large percentage of the of
the database after given some amount of

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420
the database after given some amount of
 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.380
the database after given some amount of
time so this is really bad stuff and you

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390
time so this is really bad stuff and you
 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.300
time so this is really bad stuff and you

enough but our recommendation would be
 

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:03.530
enough but our recommendation would be
don't do it get out of the password
