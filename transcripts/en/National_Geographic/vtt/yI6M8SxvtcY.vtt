- Our activism is
continuing to evolve

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:09.375
in the next phase of
Where Love Is Illegal,

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.245 line:0%
is enduring to leverage
our storytelling skills

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.249 line:0%
so we can further
amplify the voices

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.452 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
of LGBTQI+ communities
around the world.

00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:23.356 align:start size:84% position:16%
And we're doing just
that in Jamaica.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:27.260 align:start size:97% position:3%
Last month we were recording
stories of survival.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.294 align:start size:97% position:3%
So for the photo-interested
people here,

00:00:29.294 --> 00:00:31.930
we shifted here from the 4x5",

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.767
this is now 8x10" that we use.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:37.837 align:start size:88% position:13%
I just make my life
more and more difficult.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:42.008 align:start size:97% position:3%
But we asked everyone to
write their own testimonies.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.149
But we sort of also moved
up with technology as well,

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.352
and rather than
just writing them

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.354
and me photographing
their testimonies,

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:57.123
we asked people to read
them and I filmed them.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:01:01.060 align:start size:97% position:3%
So in the spirit of having,
of amplifying voices,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.129
we're gonna listen to Mo.

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:07.700
- Hi, my name is Monique.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.302
I like to be called Mo.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:14.474
I am an out member of the
Jamaican LGBTQ community.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:20.479 align:start size:94% position:6%
Jamaicans are very
intolerant and homophobic.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.049
Nonetheless, I live
my life fearlessly.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.021
It takes a lot of courage
to live an openly gay life

00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:32.025 align:start size:97% position:3%
in a place like Jamaica
where people are so violent

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.626
towards gay people.

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.064 align:start size:84% position:16%
To be honest, I'm
always on the alert,

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:39.799
and really on the defensive,

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.470 align:start size:84% position:16%
because when you
have a predominantly
male look like I do,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.574
you can never tell when
you may become a target.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:51.443
I'm always cognizant of that,

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:54.780
and ready to go in defense mode.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.715
I really love Jamaica;
it's a beautiful place.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.384
It's my homeland.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:03.021
I just wish it were a safer
place for LGBTQ Jamaicans

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:05.558
to live, love, laugh, be happy,

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:09.195
and to be free to be who we are.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.540
- So, given that we
are Witness Change,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.745 align:start size:97% position:3%
and the change part is an
important part of what we do,

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:30.216
we know that recording these
nice stories is not enough.

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:32.151
And so we asked ourselves,

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:36.823
what more can we do, other
than just document stories?

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.591
So this next phase, also
is about working closely

00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:42.262
with LGBTQ groups on the ground.

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.798
So we decided to do, in
addition to portraits,

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:48.134 align:start size:88% position:13%
we have started to do
workshops in the country

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:51.371
where these stories
are being recorded.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.139
And we're working with
the communities there

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.343
with the aim that we
hope that we can have

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.645
stories start to come
from the community

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:03.182 align:start size:84% position:16%
and not just be
about the community.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.853
So, furthermore, there's
more story-making, right.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:10.856 align:start position:0%
And we still need to have those
stories make a difference.

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:13.759
So I sat with the LGBT
activists and we talked

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:18.330 align:start size:97% position:3%
about how can these stories
make an impact locally?

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.801
So we brainstormed about
different ideas of how

00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:24.904 align:start size:84% position:16%
story-making can
impact on the ground

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:27.006
and came up with an idea.

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:31.911
So, many times when I was
working in Jamaica, people,

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:34.413
the reoccurring theme
was this conversation

00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:36.816
about navigating safe places.

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.354
And I didn't know what
that meant at the time,

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.489
but they explained to me.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.124
So they talk about,
there are places

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:49.628 align:start size:97% position:3%
that they can literally, where
they fear for their lives.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.598
And they describe this
dangerous mob mentality

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.300
where one of two
things will happen

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.770
if they face abuse
in the street, which
is regularly, sadly.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.138 align:start size:84% position:16%
So either they'll
have someone call out

00:04:00.138 --> 00:04:02.307
homophobic or transphobic abuse,

00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:04.710
and everyone will fall silent.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.980
Or, worse, people join in and
you have this mob mentality

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.617
where things escalate and it
becomes very, very dangerous.

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:16.155 align:start size:97% position:3%
But what there is not, is
people standing up for them.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:18.491
So there's that on one hand.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.893 align:start size:94% position:6%
The other thing which they
complained about a lot

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:24.364 align:start size:94% position:6%
is that 10 years ago,
Time magazine did a story

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:29.168 align:start position:0%
naming Jamaica as the most
homophobic country in the world.

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:33.205 align:start size:97% position:3%
Ten years later, they're
still pretty pissed about it.

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:36.476 align:start size:94% position:6%
And so they would explain
to me that actually

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:39.178 align:start size:81% position:19%
there are many
allies in Jamaica.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:42.214 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's just that they too
don't want to come forward

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:44.784
because they face
ridicule as well.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.686 align:start size:88% position:13%
So they wanted to
create a campaign where

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:49.421
they could use the
stories they write

00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:51.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
in the form of a
letter and photographs,

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:54.961
in order to interact
and engage allies,

00:04:56.295 --> 00:05:00.099 align:start size:84% position:16%
and directly request
that these allies

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.368 align:start size:84% position:16%
find a pledge to
take a stand for them

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.504
when they need their help.

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:08.941 align:start size:94% position:6%
So we're in the very
early stages of this work,

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.944
but what I'm going to
do is share with you

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:15.114
one story written by Christina.

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.749
The line is rubbish, she
recorded it on her phone

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.051
from Jamaica and sent it to
us, it was very kind of her.

00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:21.487
But what's really
interesting is that

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.155
not only is it a
request for allies,

00:05:23.155 --> 00:05:25.190
but she's coming
out in this letter

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.226
to some of her close friends.

00:05:27.226 --> 00:05:30.630 align:start size:84% position:16%
And listen to her,
already in her letter,

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:35.101 align:start size:84% position:16%
she knows what
they're going to say,

00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:37.770
and she's already sort of
preempting the argument.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.941 align:start size:97% position:3%
So it's interesting to hear
how she expresses that.

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.446
- [Christina] By the
time you read this,

00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:49.982
I will have told you
that I am bisexual.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:53.185 align:start size:88% position:13%
To be completely
honest, I cannot predict

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.921 align:start size:97% position:3%
how you will be responding,
or what thoughts

00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:58.157 align:start size:84% position:16%
will be running
through your minds.

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:01.494
You're probably asking, why
is your friend bisexual?

00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:03.896
What can you do to
change how I am?

00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:05.797
Will she ever be happy?

00:06:05.797 --> 00:06:07.867
What will everyone else think?

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.801
The first thing I
want you to know

00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.671 align:start size:84% position:16%
is that I have
always been bisexual.

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:14.540
This is not a temporary phase

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:18.143 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it is not something I
ever chose or decided to be.

00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:20.712
I've thought about it a lot,

00:06:20.712 --> 00:06:22.948
and as best as I can remember,

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:26.786 align:start size:94% position:6%
I first knew I was
bisexual at age 10 or 11.

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:30.389
But even years earlier,
I knew I was different.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.125 align:start size:94% position:6%
I am completely convinced
that being bisexual

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:35.827 align:start size:84% position:16%
is the way I was
born, and nothing you

00:06:35.827 --> 00:06:39.232
or anyone else ever
did made be bisexual.

00:06:40.632 --> 00:06:43.168 align:start size:84% position:16%
My natural orientation
and preference

00:06:43.168 --> 00:06:46.605 align:start size:97% position:3%
is towards men and women, and
as for it being a choice,

00:06:46.605 --> 00:06:50.643
my only choice, as I see
it, has been whether to be

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:53.112 align:start size:81% position:19%
open and honest
about my feelings,

00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:56.549
or to continue to
deny and hide them.

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:59.551 align:start size:88% position:13%
Being bisexual is
simply part of who I am,

00:06:59.551 --> 00:07:01.954 align:start size:94% position:6%
and a part I've been
longing to share with you

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:03.722
for quite some time.

00:07:03.722 --> 00:07:06.459 align:start size:94% position:6%
The question of telling
you has been without doubt

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.128 align:start size:84% position:16%
the ultimate pressing
issue on my mind

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.797
for quite a few years.

00:07:11.797 --> 00:07:13.699 align:start size:84% position:16%
I knew it was
something that would

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:15.867
eventually have to be done.

00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:18.003
Of course, there was
always the possibility

00:07:18.003 --> 00:07:20.105
that I could just
never tell you,

00:07:20.105 --> 00:07:23.676
and keep that part of my life
permanently hidden from you.

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:27.246 align:start size:94% position:6%
For one, you are too close
and too important to me

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:32.017 align:start position:0%
for me to keep such an important
part of my life from you.

00:07:32.017 --> 00:07:34.386
Up till now, I have by default

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:37.723 align:start size:84% position:16%
excluded you from
this part of my life,

00:07:37.723 --> 00:07:39.992 align:start size:94% position:6%
but it has become
painful to keep something

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:42.261
so important to me
hidden from you.

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.129
I love and appreciate you,

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:46.799
Trishann, Krissann, Shantile,

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:49.068
and I want to give
you the opportunity

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:52.003
to share this part
of my life with me.

00:07:52.003 --> 00:07:54.373 align:start size:94% position:6%
I would really appreciate
your continuous

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:57.043
love and support to
cushion the blows

00:07:57.043 --> 00:07:59.979 align:start size:88% position:13%
and discrimination
from the wider society,

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.281
and to stand with
me and publicly say

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:05.284 align:start size:94% position:6%
you will support me
despite me being bisexual.

00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:07.853
My greatest fear is to
be rejected by the people

00:08:07.853 --> 00:08:10.423
I expect to be there for me,

00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:13.158 align:start size:84% position:16%
so I am really hoping
that you don't.

00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:17.095 align:start size:88% position:13%
I want you to
remember, Trishann,
Krissann, and Shantile,

00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:20.666
that I'm the same person
today that I was yesterday.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:23.535 align:start size:84% position:16%
I still want to
enjoy being with you,

00:08:23.535 --> 00:08:26.071 align:start size:94% position:6%
only now you know a
little bit more about me.

00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:29.608
And we now have before us
a tremendous opportunity

00:08:29.608 --> 00:08:33.245
to become closer than
we ever have been,

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:37.449
a chance to share all my hopes
and aspirations for my life.

00:08:37.449 --> 00:08:41.219 align:start size:97% position:3%
I still love you and will
always love you just the same,

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:43.589
and I hope you will
be there for me.

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.258
Will you be my ally?

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:51.664
- So here's our group in
Jamaica, and they and we

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:55.835 align:start size:97% position:3%
are very excited about making
this project a reality.

00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:59.972 align:start size:84% position:16%
So despite the success
that we have had as

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.508
Where Love Is illegal in
disseminating and sharing

00:09:02.508 --> 00:09:04.477
these voices and
amplifying voices,

00:09:04.477 --> 00:09:07.479
one of our continuous
struggles is funding.

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.416 align:start size:97% position:3%
So this is the one and only
plug I'm going to make tonight

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:13.285 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that is, we need
$15,000 to make this happen,

00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:15.721
and if anyone is feeling
particularly generous,

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:17.189
please let me know.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:21.260
We're a registered charity, and
a 501(c)(3), tax-deductible.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:24.096 align:start size:81% position:19%
We'll make good
use of your money.

00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:29.935
So we keep moving on
with this idea that

00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
if we can create locally
produced anti-stigma campaigns,

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:36.175
that's a really effective way

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:38.611 align:start size:84% position:16%
that we can be
using storytelling.

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:42.714
So next week on Wednesday,
I'll be going to Tunisia

00:09:42.714 --> 00:09:45.818
where this work will continue.

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:49.488
The other thing that I
want to point out is that

00:09:49.488 --> 00:09:51.623
most of this work that
we've been doing so far

00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:53.425 align:start size:84% position:16%
has been in
developing countries,

00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:57.096
and most of this work
has been done in the 75

00:09:57.096 --> 00:10:00.132 align:start size:88% position:13%
countries where same-sex
acts are illegal.

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:04.303
But we are acutely aware
that the struggle goes on

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:09.842
in many countries around the
world, including this one.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:13.346 align:start size:88% position:13%
And we are aware because
we read the news,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.550 align:start size:94% position:6%
but also we're aware
because many of the people

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.986
who share their stories
with us, people like CJ,

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:24.290
are from here in this country.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:27.793 align:start position:0%
So the next country after
Tunisia is, the next chapter is,

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:31.196 align:start size:94% position:6%
we would like to do Where
Love is Illegal USA.

00:10:31.196 --> 00:10:35.467 align:start size:97% position:3%
There's been some really
great gains in this country,

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:38.170
but those gains are fragile.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.541 align:start size:97% position:3%
And we think it's really
important that LGBTQI+ voices

00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:45.577 align:start position:0%
continue to be heard in a
significant way in this country

00:10:45.577 --> 00:10:49.749 align:start size:97% position:3%
so that we don't risk having
those gains disappear.

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:53.919 align:start size:97% position:3%
Not only that, while there are
gains, there's also massive

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:57.522 align:start size:97% position:3%
progress still in many,
many areas for many people.

00:10:57.522 --> 00:11:01.593 align:start size:97% position:3%
So we think, in particular,
we want to be able

00:11:01.593 --> 00:11:05.998
to make some strong work about
transgender people of color,

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:08.934
and homeless youth,
and other issues,

00:11:08.934 --> 00:11:11.704 align:start size:81% position:19%
and other very
vulnerable groups.

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:15.541
So, okay, second plug:

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.242
if you're interested
in doing anything on

00:11:17.242 --> 00:11:19.011 align:start size:84% position:16%
Where Love is Illegal
USA, let me know.

00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:21.747
We need funding
for that as well.

00:11:26.418 --> 00:11:29.088
So we're proud of the
work that we've done,

00:11:29.088 --> 00:11:31.556
but we also recognize that
it's just been a beginning.

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:34.627 align:start size:97% position:3%
And we know it's just a
beginning because most days

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:37.896
we receive messages from
people around the world

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:40.699
sharing their experiences.

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:42.967
And we actually feel like
we're in a desperate rush

00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:45.303
because we know that every day,

00:11:45.303 --> 00:11:47.639
today, this week, last
week, and next week,

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:51.710
every single day, people are
dying because some consider

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.815
who they are or who they
love to be unacceptable.

00:11:57.116 --> 00:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately, our intervention
was too late for B.

00:12:02.454 --> 00:12:06.791 align:start size:97% position:3%
B died just three months after
this photograph was taken.

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:09.495
He wasn't executed or murdered

00:12:09.495 --> 00:12:11.397
like many others
in his situation.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:13.466
He was killed by poverty.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.703
So you have to understand that
to be LGBT in many countries

00:12:17.703 --> 00:12:19.270
is to be desperately poor.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.906 align:start size:88% position:13%
It means to be thrown
out of schools and jobs,

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:23.742
abandoned by families,
forced to flee abuse,

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:27.480
and so many end up on
the margins of society.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.084 align:start size:88% position:13%
I met B in the tin
shack that was his home

00:12:34.953 --> 00:12:36.988
in Cape Town, South Africa.

00:12:36.988 --> 00:12:39.658
He fled to Cape Town from Kenya.

00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:44.429 align:start size:84% position:16%
I sat with him on
this tiny little bed

00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:47.332
with my arm around him,
trying to comfort him

00:12:47.332 --> 00:12:52.037
as he wept about the man
he dreamed of marrying,

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.973
a man who was now dead.

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:57.542 align:start size:97% position:3%
He told me about his
relationship with this man,

00:12:57.542 --> 00:13:00.278
he told me how it was
a first-sight love.

00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:03.449
And he told me about the
apprehension of introducing

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:06.251
his partner to his family.

00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:09.154 align:start size:94% position:6%
And he told me about
running away from the mob

00:13:09.154 --> 00:13:12.157
at his engagement party who
were intent on killing them.

00:13:12.157 --> 00:13:15.794 align:start position:0%
And he told me about his fiance
being stabbed in the chest.

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:19.598
And he wept because
he was heartbroken.

00:13:19.598 --> 00:13:21.733
And he wept because he was
too poor to pay his rent

00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:24.303
and would be evicted any day.

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.371
And he wept because
he saw no future.

00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:29.107
And in the end, this
lovely man died because

00:13:29.107 --> 00:13:31.743
bigotry had made him too
poor to be able to afford

00:13:31.743 --> 00:13:34.013
the medical care he needed.

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:37.749 align:start size:94% position:6%
One of his friends
informed me of his death,

00:13:37.749 --> 00:13:40.585
and he told me that there
was nothing to remember

00:13:40.585 --> 00:13:44.757
B by, except for his story,
and he begged that I tell it

00:13:45.757 --> 00:13:47.660
so that we would remember B

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.396 align:start size:81% position:19%
even if it was
only a sad memory.

00:13:51.563 --> 00:13:54.032
So here I am telling
you about B, like I do

00:13:54.032 --> 00:13:57.636
whenever I get the chance
to talk about this work,

00:13:57.636 --> 00:14:00.672
in the hope that his
memory will survive

00:14:00.672 --> 00:14:02.107
and the tragic story of his life

00:14:02.107 --> 00:14:05.211 align:start size:84% position:16%
can serve to save
the lives of others.

00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:09.314 align:start size:94% position:6%
As sad as B's story is,
the more sad thing is that

00:14:09.314 --> 00:14:11.650
there's thousands like B.

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.186 align:start size:84% position:16%
But that doesn't
have to be the case.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.388 align:start size:88% position:13%
I believe that we cannot
care less for people

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:19.224 align:start size:97% position:3%
because they are further
away, or a different religion,

00:14:19.224 --> 00:14:22.861 align:start size:88% position:13%
nationality, skin color,
gender, or sexuality.

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:25.430 align:start size:84% position:16%
With witnessing
comes responsibility,

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.601
and with privilege
comes obligation.

00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:29.801
And none of us,

00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:32.971
lesbian, gay, trans,
bi, intersex, straight,

00:14:32.971 --> 00:14:36.475 align:start size:84% position:16%
none of us are free
until we are all free.

00:14:37.943 --> 00:14:40.345
The survivors whose stories
I've shared with you tonight

00:14:40.345 --> 00:14:43.449 align:start size:88% position:13%
told them in the hope
that people would listen

00:14:43.449 --> 00:14:46.718
and their lives, and the lives
of people in their community,

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:48.854
would become more free.

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:50.655
For many, it was the
first time they shared.

00:14:50.655 --> 00:14:54.092
And for many it was their
first step into activism.

00:14:54.092 --> 00:14:57.929 align:start size:88% position:13%
D and O shared their
story because they hoped

00:14:57.929 --> 00:15:00.532
people would hear their voices.

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:03.368
Before they were attacked,
they were not activists.

00:15:03.368 --> 00:15:07.139
Appearing in this photo
was their first act to

00:15:08.273 --> 00:15:11.143 align:start size:84% position:16%
defy those who would
deny their love.

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:15.681
This young Russian
couple were attacked

00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:19.985
because they dared to walk
in the street holding hands.

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.221
They wrote their testimony,

00:15:24.756 --> 00:15:25.924
but they wrote it

00:15:25.924 --> 00:15:27.459 align:start size:84% position:16%
as a dialogue
between each other,

00:15:27.459 --> 00:15:30.729
a paragraph each describing
the night as it occurred.

00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:33.031 align:start size:84% position:16%
But something
unexpected happened.

00:15:33.031 --> 00:15:35.601 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's this
testimony of violence

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.269
turned into a love letter.

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:39.972
And I'm going to read
you the end of it.

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:43.142 align:start size:84% position:16%
It ends with O reading
to her partner,

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:50.249
"After the attack, I
felt even more strongly

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:53.151 align:start size:94% position:6%
"how dear D is to me,
and how scary the thought

00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:55.854
"that I could lose her.

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:58.323
"The worst thing that
I felt was an absolute

00:15:58.323 --> 00:16:02.561 align:start size:97% position:3%
"inability to protect the
one I loved, or even myself.

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:05.430
"Yes, now I look
back on the street

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.198
"and look at every passing male

00:16:07.198 --> 00:16:09.701
"as a possible source of danger.

00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:12.971
"But every time now,
when I'm in the street,

00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:16.040 align:start size:94% position:6%
"when I take her by the
hand, I do it consciously.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.443
"It is my choice.

00:16:18.543 --> 00:16:19.945
"D, hold my hand.

00:16:21.513 --> 00:16:24.583
"This is my reward
for your courage."

00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:31.823
In the course of this
social media campaign,

00:16:31.823 --> 00:16:36.295 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of
people have liked and followed.

00:16:36.295 --> 00:16:39.431
In places like this,
forsurvivors like this,

00:16:39.431 --> 00:16:41.599
that barely-conscious
action is like a hand

00:16:41.599 --> 00:16:44.803 align:start size:97% position:3%
reaching out, offering
support, and a sign that says

00:16:44.803 --> 00:16:46.237
that you're not alone.

00:16:46.237 --> 00:16:49.140 align:start size:94% position:6%
A sign that says, I
acknowledge your courage.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.311 align:start size:97% position:3%
It says, who you are is
natural, normal, and moral.

00:16:53.311 --> 00:16:57.749
You deserve to be seen,
and you need to be heard.

00:16:57.749 --> 00:17:01.386
It is in these stories that
have the silenced heard,

00:17:01.386 --> 00:17:03.755
and the hidden seen,
that we can connect.

00:17:03.755 --> 00:17:06.724
We can connect online,
we can connect through

00:17:06.724 --> 00:17:09.694 align:start size:84% position:16%
brave organizations
fighting for equality,

00:17:09.694 --> 00:17:11.930
and we can connect through here.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.366 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it is in that connection
that there is a chance

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:18.270
that just maybe, maybe
there is a bit of future.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.973 align:start size:94% position:6%
A future where no one
needs to cover their face

00:17:21.973 --> 00:17:25.143
or change their name
or hide who they are.

00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:27.445 align:start size:94% position:6%
A future where
everyone's story matters,

00:17:27.445 --> 00:17:30.849 align:start size:84% position:16%
and a future where
love is never illegal.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.187
I'm very grateful to be
given this opportunity

00:17:35.187 --> 00:17:36.989
to talk to you tonight,
because you've helped me

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:40.058
to fulfill my promise to
the people whose stories

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:41.727
I said I would tell.

00:17:43.461 --> 00:17:46.965 align:start size:84% position:16%
Today I act as
their intermediary.

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:50.735
They allowed me to photograph
them and record their words

00:17:50.735 --> 00:17:53.004
in the hope they would be heard.

00:17:53.004 --> 00:17:54.473
I'd like to thank
you for listening.

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:55.507
Thank you.

00:17:55.507 --> 00:17:57.009
(applause)
