00:00:00.278 --> 00:00:02.845
Welcome to the Khan Academy

00:00:02.845 --> 00:00:05.311
we are honored that you have joined us

00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:07.546
and what I hope to do is just give you a walk through

00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:10.129
to think about how you might want to use the site.

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.206
So, first of all you might know exactly what

00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:13.894
you want to learn about, you might say wait

00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:15.845
I kind of wonder what a derivative is.

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.599
So you can do a search right over there

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.865
and there all sorts of exercises and videos

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.665
that deal with derivatives. For example,

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.665
you could go to the derivative intuition

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.465
exercise and you would see this thing

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.865
right over here which makes you think about

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.732
well what's the slope of the tangent line

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.865
at any of these points? And when you do it,

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.532
you're essentially plotting, plotting,

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.799
the derivative. Or you might say, well no,

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:03.132
I actually want, I actually want an explanation

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:03.332
of what a derivative is. Maybe you've already done

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.732
the derivative module. So, you might want

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.865
to look at a calculus proof or look at some

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.865
type of what a partial derivative might be.

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.999
And you click there and you would actually go

99:59:59.999 --> 100:00:02.932
to the video. So, that's if you kind of know
