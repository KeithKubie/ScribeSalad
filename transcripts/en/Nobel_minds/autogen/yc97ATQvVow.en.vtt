notic Chinese times and we noticed that

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:25.610
notic Chinese times and we noticed that
 

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:29.019
notic Chinese times and we noticed that
many of the Nobel prizes in physics or

00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:29.029
many of the Nobel prizes in physics or
 

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:32.069
many of the Nobel prizes in physics or
chemistry during the decades have been

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079
chemistry during the decades have been
 

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:35.319
chemistry during the decades have been
awarded to the findings related to

cancer biology or physiology this this
 

00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:45.280
cancer biology or physiology this this
year's and so my question is could I ask

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:45.290
year's and so my question is could I ask
 

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:52.990
year's and so my question is could I ask
if how why why are this phenomenon sub

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000
if how why why are this phenomenon sub
 

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.129
if how why why are this phenomenon sub
increasing this years and what would the

00:16:57.129 --> 00:16:57.139
increasing this years and what would the
 

00:16:57.139 --> 00:16:59.920
increasing this years and what would the
Nobel Prize Committee suggest in the

00:16:59.920 --> 00:16:59.930
Nobel Prize Committee suggest in the
 

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.069
Nobel Prize Committee suggest in the
future thank you I think we'll ask close

00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:03.079
future thank you I think we'll ask close
 

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:04.600
future thank you I think we'll ask close
Gustafson to comment on that

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:04.610
Gustafson to comment on that
 

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:09.730
Gustafson to comment on that
so I there is no sort of real intention

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:09.740
so I there is no sort of real intention
 

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.280
so I there is no sort of real intention
from our side to sort of focus on on

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:12.290
from our side to sort of focus on on
 

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.240
from our side to sort of focus on on
these subjects that you

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:14.250
these subjects that you
 

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:17.150
these subjects that you
bring up I could be true if you go back

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:17.160
bring up I could be true if you go back
 

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.829
bring up I could be true if you go back
to that there could be some pattern

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839
to that there could be some pattern
 

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.360
to that there could be some pattern
there I think it has to do with the fact

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:20.370
there I think it has to do with the fact
 

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.670
there I think it has to do with the fact
that you know Alfred Nobel he wanted a

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:22.680
that you know Alfred Nobel he wanted a
 

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.650
that you know Alfred Nobel he wanted a
price that was for the greatest benefit

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:24.660
price that was for the greatest benefit
 

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.170
price that was for the greatest benefit
of humankind so it had to have

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:27.180
of humankind so it had to have
 

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.440
of humankind so it had to have
consequences for for for for people for

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:30.450
consequences for for for for people for
 

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.170
consequences for for for for people for
humans and I think that because we're

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:33.180
humans and I think that because we're
 

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.480
humans and I think that because we're
always looking at both brilliant science

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:35.490
always looking at both brilliant science
 

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.340
always looking at both brilliant science
but also brilliant science with with

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:37.350
but also brilliant science with with
 

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:39.770
but also brilliant science with with
sort of consequences and maybe that's

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:39.780
sort of consequences and maybe that's
 

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.750
sort of consequences and maybe that's
why you can see that some of the prices

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760
why you can see that some of the prices
 

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.480
why you can see that some of the prices
are related to the area which you allude

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:44.490

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.880
significant their discoveries are I'd
say very significant but I can start a

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:15.890
say very significant but I can start a
 

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.570
say very significant but I can start a
chance to say something more the first

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:19.580
chance to say something more the first
 

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.590
chance to say something more the first
half the significance one significant is

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600
half the significance one significant is
 

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.260
half the significance one significant is
that you can now use enzymes to speed up

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:26.270
that you can now use enzymes to speed up
 

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.260
that you can now use enzymes to speed up
in principle any reaction you want using

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:29.270
in principle any reaction you want using
 

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:32.140
in principle any reaction you want using
these protocols and you can derive

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:32.150
these protocols and you can derive
 

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.040
these protocols and you can derive
enzymes that we place previous toxic

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.050
enzymes that we place previous toxic
 

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:39.700
enzymes that we place previous toxic
catalysts in industrial processes so I

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:39.710
catalysts in industrial processes so I
 

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.500
catalysts in industrial processes so I
think it has a very huge significance

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:41.510
think it has a very huge significance
 

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.920
think it has a very huge significance
and the second half makes it possible to

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:44.930
and the second half makes it possible to
 

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.970
and the second half makes it possible to
derive fully human antibodies using the

you can use very small amounts in
 

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:09.060
you can use very small amounts in
treatment so perhaps if I had safer

they are really the workhorses in our
 

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:23.570
they are really the workhorses in our
bodies because in the body some of the

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:23.580

proteins we have or other organizers

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740
proteins we have or other organizers
 

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.160
proteins we have or other organizers
have are enzymes that speed up chemical

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.170
have are enzymes that speed up chemical
 

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.040
have are enzymes that speed up chemical
reactions but there are reactions we

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:31.050
reactions but there are reactions we
 

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:34.100
reactions but there are reactions we
want to do in chemical synthesis or to

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:34.110
want to do in chemical synthesis or to
 

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.310
want to do in chemical synthesis or to
produce fuels that those enzymes can't

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320
produce fuels that those enzymes can't
 

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:42.110
produce fuels that those enzymes can't
do so we have to improve them enzymes

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:42.120
do so we have to improve them enzymes
 

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:47.660
do so we have to improve them enzymes
produced by Francis Arnold this year the

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:47.670
produced by Francis Arnold this year the
 

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.000
produced by Francis Arnold this year the
price and that is to make the enzyme

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.010
price and that is to make the enzyme
 

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.880

they react as they do today
 

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.590
they react as they do today
and the other half is about improving

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600
and the other half is about improving
 

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.360
and the other half is about improving
binding protein so these are produce

00:26:59.360 --> 00:26:59.370

Spira logical processes by this means
 

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.850
Spira logical processes by this means
for example antibodies and this

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860
for example antibodies and this
 

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:10.450
for example antibodies and this
technique can then be used to produce

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:10.460
technique can then be used to produce
 

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.930
technique can then be used to produce
human antibodies again

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:12.940

so to say use you were talking about

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980
so to say use you were talking about
 

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.890
so to say use you were talking about
evolution and when we think about

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:28.900
evolution and when we think about
 

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:33.360
evolution and when we think about
natural evolution you think it's often

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:33.370
natural evolution you think it's often
 

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.420
natural evolution you think it's often
described as a combination of chance and

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:36.430
described as a combination of chance and
 

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:39.870
described as a combination of chance and
necessity is this what they do yes this

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880
necessity is this what they do yes this
 

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.910
necessity is this what they do yes this
is I would say a combination of chance

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:41.920
is I would say a combination of chance
 

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.090
is I would say a combination of chance
and necessity but also quite a big

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:45.100
and necessity but also quite a big
 

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:47.370
and necessity but also quite a big
element of thinking because what they

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:47.380
element of thinking because what they
 

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.830
element of thinking because what they
have done is to really speed up the

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840
have done is to really speed up the
 

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.560
have done is to really speed up the
evolution this nature has had billions

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:52.570
evolution this nature has had billions
 

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.830
evolution this nature has had billions
of years but now you want the process to

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840
of years but now you want the process to
 

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.350
of years but now you want the process to
be possible in maybe a few weeks or a

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360
be possible in maybe a few weeks or a
 

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:01.340
be possible in maybe a few weeks or a
year or something in the laboratory

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:01.350
year or something in the laboratory
 

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:05.070
year or something in the laboratory
random experiments and then picking up

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:05.080
random experiments and then picking up
 

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.400
random experiments and then picking up
the right parts of it yes I would say in

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:08.410
the right parts of it yes I would say in
 

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:10.710
the right parts of it yes I would say in
nature is what a random process because

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720
nature is what a random process because
 

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.570
nature is what a random process because
the mutations happen by chance may be

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:12.580
the mutations happen by chance may be
 

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.840
the mutations happen by chance may be
due to UV radiation or something whereas

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:15.850
due to UV radiation or something whereas
 

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.490
due to UV radiation or something whereas
in the laboratory it was a combination

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:17.500
in the laboratory it was a combination
 

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.980
in the laboratory it was a combination
of knowledge based so you have to you

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:19.990
of knowledge based so you have to you
 

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.660
of knowledge based so you have to you
have to have some idea of which

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:21.670
have to have some idea of which
 

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.910

positions to bury but then you add a

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:23.920
positions to bury but then you add a
 

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.080
positions to bury but then you add a
random mess on top of that so the

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:28.090
random mess on top of that so the
 

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.690
random mess on top of that so the
biggest difference would be that you

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:30.700
biggest difference would be that you
 

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.220
biggest difference would be that you
know what goal you have while in nature

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:34.230

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.110
actually the risk may be you know I
would say made you has no goal but what

would say made you has no goal but what
 

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.820

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.960
doses you can use much lower doses you
can even use them cutaneous on the skin

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:40.970
can even use them cutaneous on the skin
 

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:42.669
can even use them cutaneous on the skin
you don't have reject them so there are

00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679
you don't have reject them so there are
 

00:32:42.679 --> 00:32:44.510
you don't have reject them so there are
many advantages we know

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.520
many advantages we know
 

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.299
many advantages we know
so what do you thing is next was what is

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:47.309
so what do you thing is next was what is
 

00:32:47.309 --> 00:32:51.380
so what do you thing is next was what is
the vision for the future the vision for

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:51.390
the vision for the future the vision for
 

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:52.700
the vision for the future the vision for
the future thing I think we were just at

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:52.710
the future thing I think we were just at
 

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:54.919
the future thing I think we were just at
the start I think we will see many more

00:32:54.919 --> 00:32:54.929
the start I think we will see many more
 

00:32:54.929 --> 00:32:57.710
the start I think we will see many more
enzymes that catalyze bonds that we had

00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720
enzymes that catalyze bonds that we had
 

00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.660
enzymes that catalyze bonds that we had
no clue that an enzyme could actually do

00:32:59.660 --> 00:32:59.670
no clue that an enzyme could actually do
 

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:02.480
no clue that an enzyme could actually do
one of the latest examples from honors

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:02.490
one of the latest examples from honors
 

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:04.700
one of the latest examples from honors
lab or enzymes that catalyze the

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:04.710
lab or enzymes that catalyze the
 

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.980
lab or enzymes that catalyze the
formation of carbon silicon bonds and

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:06.990
formation of carbon silicon bonds and
 

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:09.470
formation of carbon silicon bonds and
these are bonds you don't find in nature

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480
these are bonds you don't find in nature
 

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.020
these are bonds you don't find in nature
and there is no natural enzyme but she

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:12.030
and there is no natural enzyme but she
 

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.210
and there is no natural enzyme but she
managed to take one and evolve it to

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220
managed to take one and evolve it to
 

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.640
managed to take one and evolve it to
form these kinds of bonds that are

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:16.650
form these kinds of bonds that are
 

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.470
form these kinds of bonds that are
important for making materials for

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480
important for making materials for
 

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:23.720
important for making materials for
example thank you very much sir little

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:23.730
example thank you very much sir little
 

00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:41.880
example thank you very much sir little
clean set for being here

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:41.890
