00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:17.233
- [John F. Kennedy] The most important
topic on earth: peace.

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.395
What kind of a peace do I mean?

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:23.097
The kind of peace that makes
life on earth worth living.

00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:26.107
And the kind that enables
men and nations to grow,

00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:30.304
and to hope, and build a
better life for their children.

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:32.424
Not merely peace for Americans,

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:34.548
but peace for all men and women.

00:00:34.548 --> 00:00:37.133
Not merely peace in our time,

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.092
but peace in all times.

00:00:39.092 --> 00:00:43.005
For in the final analysis,
our most basic common link

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.469
is that we all inhabit this small planet,

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.510
we all breathe the same air,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.202
we all cherish our children's future,

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:53.035
and we are all mortal.
