00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.930
So "mom guilt" is unfortunately kind of universal.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.650
A lot of women blame themselves first and
foremost when life doesn’t feel in balance

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.180
or in check, in terms of managing career and
family and home.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.710
And it’s really, really – it’s not reasonable
to expect that anybody would have that balance,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.460
given the lack of respect that our country
shows for new parenthood.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.690
Now, that said, I don’t mean to blame the
victim, but it’s something that we can kind

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.810
of control.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.789
So when I did the research for my book I interviewed
and surveyed more than 800 new parents.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:46.579
And what I found when I looked at the transcripts
of the longer, deeper interviews is that the

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.579
word “guilt” popped up again and again
and again.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.360
Only what I was actually sort of surprised
to see is that it meant really different things

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.809
to different mothers.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.420
So there were some mothers who felt really
guilty leaving their baby to go back to work

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.309
and leaving the baby in someone’s care who
they felt like maybe was not quite as capable

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.790
as they would be themselves of loving the
baby.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.660
There were other people who actually felt
guilty because they loved being back at work.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.300
And I experienced both of those feelings.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.450
When I went back to work after having my first
son and my second, my husband was in his medical

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.450
residency.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.110
There was no real choice for me to make about
the income that our family needed.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.690
And so I didn’t feel terribly conflicted
about going back to work.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:34.040
It just felt like it was too soon and it was
not in the most supportive cultural circumstances

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.540
that I would have wanted.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.070
So what I say to women is, first of all, guilt
implies that you’ve made some sort of wrong

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.070
decision.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.960
That there’s some other “better, less
guilty” working mom out there who you should

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.030
aspire to be like.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.310
But erase that idea, because every single
mother out there will admit to feeling guilt

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.340
in one way or another, right?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.850
So if it is just a lowest common denominator,
let’s just erase it and treat for whatever

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.330
feeling we actually have.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.850
If you feel regretful, if you feel conflicted,
if you feel overwhelmed, if you feel unsupported,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.740
let’s solve that problem rather than writing
something off universally as “mom guilt”.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.170
You don’t really hear people talk about
“dad guilt,” and I would actually really

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.930
welcome that conversation, and I think dads
would actually quite like to be a part of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.930
that conversation.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.390
But it feels kind of antifeminist actually
to just call all of this conflict that we

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.520
have about this transition back to work after
baby—to call it “mom guilt”.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.010
And it’s something that’s perpetuated
if you don’t acknowledge sort of the reasons

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.720
for why you’re having these feelings early
on, they snowball and they can make it harder

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.200
and harder for women to stay in the workplace.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.230
We know that 30 percent of professional women
drop out of the workplace within a year of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.430
having a baby.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.900
Even in the most progressive couples, even
in couples that came into their couplehood

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.469
saying, “We’re going to be equal partners,”
if mom is learning everything in that time

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.879
about how to care for the baby—and mom also
probably is part of this generation that I’m

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.400
part of too where we want to achieve everything
as women—We feel we deserve it and we do

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.420
to be great at everything and to find answers
and solutions.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.469
And so we’ve become sort of professional
perfectionists at parenting.

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.040
But dad’s off at work and we’re learning
how to do that.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.099
And then when mom goes back to work and both
parents – and I’m being binary about it

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:27.450
but it is obviously for partners as well,
same sex partners, when you come home at the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.810
end of the day guess who knows how to do everything?

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.810
Mom.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.549
And guess who wants everything done her way?

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.549
Mom.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.659
And there’s a term for that, and it’s
called “gatekeeping.”

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.379
And there are a number of studies that show
that if dad has time alone with the baby or

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.560
the partner has time alone with the baby after
mom goes back to work and is able to take

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.749
intermittent leave—you know, so just say
even a month at home taking care of the baby

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:57.629
and learning some of these things on the ground—that
it actually sets up a much better balance

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.299
that continues through forever, essentially.

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.389
There’s a study that shows that fathers
who take parental leave ultimately have better

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.060
relationships with their teenage children,
which is amazing.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.379
And you think about who’s a teenager now,
who that study was done on, and these are

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:15.169
pretty progressive dads back then.

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.340
And yet I’m really glad we can learn from
them.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.960
We don’t stop necessarily to look back and
assess and see that sometimes being a little

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.699
more long lensed about it, realizing that,
you know, offering a parent an additional

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.550
two months of paid leave will make all the
difference in the world.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.430
We also, of course, have a huge gender parity
problem.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.110
There’s an amazingly convincing study that
shows that for every month of parental leave

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.990
that a father takes, the mom’s lifetime
earnings increase by seven percent, which

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.910
is incredible.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.150
And yet when we look at who is actually taking
leave, of course, I mean I don’t even need

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.780
to tell you this: Mothers take longer leave
than fathers—globally, but more so in the

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.660
United States than anywhere else.
