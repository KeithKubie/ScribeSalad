00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.760
I've decided that, in order to sell more merch, I should do a face reveal wearing some of it. So are you ready?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.500
Here we go!

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.400
Boom.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.700
New minimalist and Cold War merch available now

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.980
and get the new limited edition Churchill character pin

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.240
before it sells out.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.140
With more characters coming in the future

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.920
Link in the description down below.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.540
The year is 1917.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.560
Fighting rages on the eastern front of the First World War.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.180
Both Germany and Russia are on the brink of collapse.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.580
- Soldier, I need you to bring me this man.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.420
- Got it.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.500
- Found him, sir.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.880
- Wha-... who ... no...

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.180
- Not LennON!

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.400
- LenIN! The Russian communist! What! Why would I need a Beatle?! Lenin! The Russian communist! He was exiled to Switzerland!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.540
- You know what? I'll do it myself.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.680
- Who wants to start a revolution?!

00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:01.620
*Ussr Anthem starts to play*

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.240
OverSimplified: The Cold War

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.200
The Germans put Lenin on a train and sent them all the way back to Russia, hoping he and his mates would create an internal crisis.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.900
And create an internal crisis they did.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.000
The government was overthrown and Lenin was in charge.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.300
He immediately pulled out of the First World War, made the country Communist,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.000
started a three-year long civil war, got shot,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
broke the economy, caused a famine, and then he died.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.400
On his deathbed, he said,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.020
- "Hey, man, tell whoever's in charge of giving people jobs not to let that jerk Stalin become the next leader.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.940
"By the way, who did I put in charge of giving people jobs?"

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.680
- "That would be Stalin, sir."

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.100
- (dies)

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.769
Stalin was a rising force in the Communist Party.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.729
He still had some opponents but conveniently, all of them were arrested or disappeared.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.039
So that was lucky. And so Stalin took over.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.940
He implemented his five-year plans which transformed the country from an agriculture-based economy

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.989
to an industrial one. And like Lenin before him he reigned with terror

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.119
Anyone who dared criticize or oppose him would either be killed or left to rot in the horrendous

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.199
Soviet war camps. Then a short man with a silly mustache tried to take over the world,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.050
punch the Russians all the way to Moscow, and then the Russians, with some help from their faithful ally, the winter, punched them all the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.389
way back to Berlin. At this point, being allies, America, the UK and the Soviet Union were good chums.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.019
They held a couple of conferences near the end of the war to decide what would happen next

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.760
- Hey Stalin, after all your trials and tribulation, you must be pretty happy to be standing here in Berlin.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.010
- Tzar Alexander made it all the way to Paris.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.070
- Uhhh

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.200
- Hey, uh, just give me a second.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.040
Hey man, I think something's up with Stalin.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.080
- I know, right? What should we do?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.240
- Shall I tell him about the bomb?

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.840
-Yeah, tell him about the bomb. That will scare him.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.398
- Sooo we got this crazy new big A-bomb that can destroy an entire city in one go.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.080
- Yes, my spies told me already.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.380
Oh wait, I meant to act surprised.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.880
WOW! THAT'S AMAZING!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.460
- He already knew! How?!

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:52.960
- Ummm

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.780
- Am I sure I want to send nuclear secrets via unsecure, public, coffee-shop Wi-Fi? AM I EVER!

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.760
- Dude, use a VPN.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.160
- And speaking of VPNs... If, like me, you take Internet safety seriously

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.340
Then you need Nord VPN. Nord VPN hides your online

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.000

Say, for example,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.640
you wanted to watch a certain OverSimplified video that for some reason has been blocked in your country.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.360

So again, that's nordvpn.com/oversimplified, also in the description box down below.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.320
Now, where were we?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.480
Oh, yeah.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.100
Does the 'A' stand for atomic or ass?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.700
Then America dropped their big 'A' bomb on Japan and WWII officially came to an end.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.640
- Hooray! We won!

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.880
Okay, so now it's time to establish the New World Order.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.440
Stalin, you're in charge of Eastern Europe.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.600
Now, we want you to let them all hold elections.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.540
- Oh, yes, of course. Elections.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.900
- And these elections will be free and fair, right?

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.880
- Certainly. Free and fair. Definitely free and fair.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.860
Communist, Communist, Communist, Communist, Communist, Communist.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.860
If that's not free and fair, I don't know what is.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.680
Throughout Eastern Europe, Soviet puppet governments were established as a buffer zone between the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.420
USSR and the West, with Churchill proclaiming an Iron Curtain had descended across the continent.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.300
The relationship between the old allies was deteriorating fast.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.060
Over the next few years the British intervened in the Greek Civil War

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.660
to prevent a communist takeover.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.740
In Turkey the Russians began demanding more control of Turkey's c-axis rats, which prompted the U.S.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.140
to send their largest battleship to Turkey for a friendly visit after World War two Iran was now occupied by both the Soviets and the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.060
British with an agreement to both pull out

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.600
Once the war was over the British pulled out Stalin was like you know what?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.260
I think I might stick around.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.940
All in favor of kicking Russia out of Iran?

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.420
You want to know something

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.160
You guys suck. Pressure from the UN forced the Soviets to leave

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.000
and with the establishment of NATO, the Soviets had no doubt that the West was out to encircle and destroy them.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.640
And America announced the Truman Doctrine.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.360
In which they basically said "Those guys are not cool, cannot be trusted

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.040
And we will do everything we can to prevent the spread of Communism around the world"

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.940
Many view this moment as the official declaration of the Cold War.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.860
Back in Europe...

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.500
Everyone was living in a post-apocalyptic void brought on by the Second World War.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.760
Cities reduced to rubble, not enough food

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.440
It was terrible. This is great the more they suffer the more likely it is they'll turn to communism!

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.260
Dude, you're really messed up. Whats wrong with you?

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.080
My father used to punish me severely.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.120
America realized what was going on, and quickly made a move.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.280
Under the Marshall Plan; They sent 12 billion dollars to Western Europe for its economic recovery.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.200
The countries of Stalin's Eastern Bloc looked on with envy.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.780
- Hey Czechoslovakia. You want to come get some economic aid?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.380
- Yeah, but I have to check with my mom first

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.560
- Sorry America...

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:03.780
- I can't come

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.040
This was a full-on economic battle raging between capitalism and communism in Europe.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.720
If the Western nations developed faster and better than the East, that would be a defeat for Stalin.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.020
So he set up his own rival economic recovery plan

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.340
Which he called comic-con, and he also set up Cominform which gave him more political control over the Eastern Bloc

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.380
But nowhere did this economic battle rage harder than in the city of Berlin.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.060
Got over a hundred miles behind Soviet lines

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.220
The city had been divided up between the Allies

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.940
and the western segments were still under Western control.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.140
East Berliners could travel freely to West Berlin, see the economic prosperity and think

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.800
"Hmmm...

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.040
Maybe this communism thing ain't so great after all.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.380
I'm gonna have fun tonight!"

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.600
- You're home late.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.320
- oh

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.540
- Stalin I was just out with my friends.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.200
- Friends?!

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.700
You stink of capitalism! You're out engaging an imperialist debauchery again

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.980
I swear Ivan, I can't keep doing this

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.500
Stalin wanted the West out.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.560
So he said "Hey, guess what?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.040
I'm blockading all of your supply routes to West Berlin. What are you gonna do about it?"

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.880
"I suppose we'll just fly the supplies in."

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.020
"Alright Truman, you win this round"

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.560
The Berlin Airlift was an incredible undertaking and a major success for the Western Allies.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.200
And Stalin ended his blockade of West Berlin.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.980
His aggressive actions worried the West, but not as much as this did

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.140
*A-Bomb Exploddd*

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.980
The Soviet Union had developed their very own atomic bomb.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.040
The USA no longer had a nuclear monopoly.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.300
The world now knew that if a major war broke out between the two superpowers

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.860
It would be more destructive than anyone could imagine.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:43.240
So it was comforting when Stalin came out and said that war between the Soviet Union and the West was unlikely. Oh wait inevitable

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.049
He said it was inevitable. Hey, you know who I haven't checked in on in a while my good friend, China

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:54.259
Whoa, what happened to you? What happened to them was a full-blown civil war that had been going on since 1927?

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:56.839
The People's Liberation Army under the leadership of Mao Zedong

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:03.709
Successfully defeated the Republic of China who fled to Taiwan that now communist China and the Soviet Union signed a mutual defense treaty

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:08.329
This was terrible news for the West but wait. There's more after the Second World War

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.639
Korea was divided along the 38th parallel in the north the Soviets set up a communist regime in the south

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.719
America set up an anti communist regime both were led by very sweet looking old men

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:19.500
But don't let that deceive you they were both

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:26.029
Ruthless dictators and both dreamed of reuniting Korea under their own regime now that he had the bomb Stalin was feeling a little more cocky

00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:31.309
And he finally gave Kim permission to attack the North launched a surprise invasion of the south on June 25th

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:38.479
1950 with Soviet aid the North Koreans steamrolled through taking Seoul in just three days and replacing one ruthless dictator with another

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:45.050
The UN were freaking out and quickly created an emergency force made up of troops from 16 countries to defend the south the West still

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:47.359
Held to son and made landings at Incheon near Seoul

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.149
they pushed the North Koreans out of Seoul replacing the ruthless dictator that I replaced the first realistic hitter with the same ruthless dictator that

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:55.339
are previously been replaced by the new ruthless dictator and the

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:01.219
West then continued all the way up the Korean Peninsula at this point China was getting worried that the UN may just keep going the

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.019
U.s. Had sent this guy to lead the operation after winning the Pacific theater of World War two General Douglas

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.419
MacArthur's head was big and his balls were bigger

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.979
He reassured President Truman that there was absolutely no way at all that the Chinese would ever get involved

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.409
Meanwhile half a million Chinese troops were crossing into Korea Neukom. No Newcomb. No

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.160
Oh, come on, you're fired the u.s. Considered the nuclear option

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.089
But now that the Soviets also had the bomb they didn't want to risk all-out global destruction

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:28.969
The Communists pushed the West right back almost to the exact same spot

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.600
They it all started from and they ended up in a stalemate where they remained until both sides

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.259
Finally agreed to work towards the peace settlement in 2018 back in America

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:39.738
Americans decided they wanted a new president who would be tough on communism

00:09:39.739 --> 00:09:43.909
So they elected famed World War two General Eisenhower who is really hard to draw

00:09:44.429 --> 00:09:45.509
it's

00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:48.438
1953 hey stone, how you doing? Oh, he's dead

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.479
He had a cerebral hemorrhage and his reign of terror

00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:55.608
Kinda came back to bite him in the ass because he had imprisoned all of his best doctors and those that were left were too

00:09:55.609 --> 00:09:59.959
Terrified to treat him the new leader Nikita Khrushchev called a meeting and said hey guys

00:09:59.959 --> 00:10:04.998
You know how Stalin was imprisoning and murdering herself for doing basically nothing. Yeah. He was kind of a jerk

00:10:05.699 --> 00:10:10.248
I'm really not sure how this is news to you. Khrushchev went on a campaign of desalinization

00:10:10.859 --> 00:10:12.749
statues of stone were taken down

00:10:12.749 --> 00:10:19.189
Stalingrad was renamed and Khrushchev announced that he wanted the Soviet people to be happy and would allow greater freedom in the Soviet Union

00:10:19.189 --> 00:10:20.399
So how did that work out?

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:27.768
Well an uprising in East Germany was brutally suppressed a revolution in Hungary was brutally suppressed and demonstrations in Poland were brutally suppressed

00:10:28.169 --> 00:10:31.939
Although he did finally allow some mild reforms back in the Soviet Union

00:10:31.939 --> 00:10:37.099
He permitted more cultural expression, but then began banning stuff based on his own personal tastes modern art

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:42.259
looks like a child urinated on canvas band jazz music sounds like the feeling of needing to fart and

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.269
Your poetry is really depressing

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.849
How could anyone in the Soviet Union be depressed your band?

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:51.649
Khrushchev wanted the Soviet people to be happy but not like that or that or that

00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:59.149
Young people began enjoying a boring Western pop culture Sun remove that disgusting imperialist apparel at once. Shut up dad

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:00.720
You can't tell me what to do

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.220
What would you look at that turns out he can tell me what to do

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.859
The West had initially liked the cut of Khrushchev's jib

00:11:06.859 --> 00:11:08.609
But world events soon soured relations

00:11:08.609 --> 00:11:15.499
Even more the two sides were spying on each other a whole lot throughout the Cold War the KGB had spies and informants in nearly

00:11:15.499 --> 00:11:18.918
Every aspect of Western life and government so much so that whenever the u.s

00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:24.709
Tried to send spies into the Soviet Union the KGB were usually ready to arrest them on this spot members of the Manhattan Project

00:11:24.869 --> 00:11:29.829
Aided the Soviet Union in acquiring the bomb some American officials believe they on the wrong side

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.129
I'll sell you three secrets for five million dollars. Okay, go ahead

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.249
The Allies are digging a tunnel under East Berlin to tap your communications

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.030
There's an American agent living at this address in Moscow and sometimes when I'm home alone

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.269
I like to put on my wife's dresses sit in the corner and cry for hours

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:51.300
Very interesting in America fear took hold during the Red Scare and the McCarthy trials American values imploded as fear of communism

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:57.989
Collided with freedom of thought and expression and communist kind of became a buzzword thrown around to describe anything people didn't like Hollywood

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.300
communists your next-door neighbor's dog

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.549
communist when the grocery store cashier asks

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.450
If you need a bag when you clearly can't carry ten tons of bacon aids in your hands communists

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.729
But one area in particular where the US had an edge over the Soviet Union was in its espionage technology in particular

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.750
You to spy planes flew across Russia carrying out surveillance from the skies

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:21.599
There was a nasty incident in 1961 when while we shut down and Khrushchev was furious who the hell is this?

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.540
He's up. Very naughty high-altitude weather enthusiasts (lol)

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.000
why does he have a gun in a poison needle because

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.020
He's up. Very naughty high-altitude weather enthusiasts (lol)

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.949
But much to America's concern the Soviet Union appeared to be ahead in the space race

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.740
Everyone freaked out when Russia launched the world's first satellite

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.740
And then they actually sent a man into space

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:49.019
Even worse there also appeared to be a missile gap in the Soviets favor and Khrushchev was so confident that even allowed the u.s

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:55.499
To set up a technology exhibit in Moscow attended by a certain Vice President Richard Nixon. Check this out. We have color TV

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.070
Yes, but we've been to space and can obliterate you with our massive nuclear arsenal

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:06.179
Check out this vegetable peeler tensions increased further when both sides upgraded their atomic bombs to hydrogen bombs

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.430
And after West Germany was allowed to join NATO in 1955 Khrushchev set up the defense of Warsaw Pact

00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:15.449
Strengthening the military ties between the Soviet Union and it's satellites States in

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.409
1960 Americans decided they wanted a new president who would be tough on communism

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.279
So they elected John F Kennedy the Soviet Union was advancing its technology

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:26.759
But it was also bleeding its coffers dry and all of the money was going towards the military

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:31.049
Not the people life under communism was still as hard as ever and Berlin

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:39.089
Remained a thorn in the Soviet side the contrast between the economically prosperous West and the struggling East was clearer day-by-day and East Berliners were

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:43.439
Still able to freely travel to the West now many of them were deciding to stay there

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:49.830
Millions defected to West Germany via West Berlin causing Eastern factories to lose workers and taking a heavy toll on the economy

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:58.140
Soviet leaders decided this couldn't continue any longer first Khrushchev tried this leave West Berlin or else or else what or else?

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:04.679
I'll be really mad at you. Yeah, no, we're gonna stay. Listen man. West Berlin is ours East Berlin is yours

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:10.020
That's just how it is. Kennedy felt pretty good about a show of American resolve. But wait a second. Did you catch that?

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.120
Let's reply it. Uh

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:21.560
Kennedy just told cruise shop that the USA wouldn't interfere in what the Soviets did with their section of Berlin

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.220
So Khrushchev came up with a new idea

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:27.360
We're gonna build a wall and it's gonna be a big beautiful wall and it's gonna keep out all the Mexicans

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.360
*Whisper* No, Sir that's wrong its going to keep in the east Berliner's.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.160
Oh, sorry. It's gonna keep in all the Mexicans on

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.660
August 13th

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:40.860
1961 Berliners woke up to find their city divided into two with barbed wire and guards blocking the border between East and West

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.060
Over time a wall was constructed throughout the city families were torn apart

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.930
Thousands would risk their lives

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:53.219
Escaping over the wall and hundreds would die trying to the despair of Berliners the West were unable to do anything about it

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:58.560
But the wall did put on full display the failure of the communist system as Kennedy said democracy is not perfect

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.920
but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in as

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.689
Part of the agreement between the two sides US diplomats were still allowed to travel to East Berlin

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.520
But suddenly East Berlin crossing guard started givin them the business and Kennedy was like nah

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:17.969
in October the US rolled tanks up to the crossing point at Checkpoint Charlie as a show of strength the Soviets did the same and

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:23.279
The two were in a standoff, they stayed like that for sixteen hours and the world braced for nuclear Armageddon

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:27.989
Thankfully them Kennedy called Khrushchev directly and was like, hey man, this is getting way too hot

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:31.318
How about you back your tanks up by an inch and we'll do the same. Sounds good. Okay

00:15:31.319 --> 00:15:34.589
How about you back your tanks up by another inch and we'll follow suit. All right

00:15:34.589 --> 00:15:39.208
*Drink tea*

00:15:39.209 --> 00:15:43.378
*Wall been smashed*
