&gt;&gt; Hi YouTube, this is Aysegul Ildeniz, the
Regional Director for Intel- in Africa. I

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.000
think role models are extremely important.
We are Intel try to role model particularly

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.020
in the area of education. What we are trying
to show to the rest of the world is every

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.350
kid deserves the opportunity to use a PC and
technology and they can do wonderful things

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.460
with it. This is why Intel is so dedicated
to incorporating PC into the education space

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.450
and this is why we have trained over 600,000
teachers in this region alone to make sure

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.730
they actually train those students the 21st
century skills and they become role models

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.579
for the students and their communities and
actually show that they are ahead of the game

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.880
just like in the rest of the world. They can
bring that goodness of technology and make

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.100
sure they educate our kids for the future
the right way.
