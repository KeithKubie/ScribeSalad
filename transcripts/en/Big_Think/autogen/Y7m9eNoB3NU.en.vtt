00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.560
Emotional intelligence refers to how well
we handle ourselves and our relationships,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.730
the 4 domains.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.930
Self-awareness, knowing what we’re feeling,
why we’re feeling it, which is a basis of,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.330
for example, good intuition, good decision-making.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.460
Also, it’s a moral compass.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.440
Say, in part, is self-management, which means
handling your distressing emotions in effective

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.880
ways so that they don’t cripple you, they
don’t get in the way of what you’re doing,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.219
and yet, attuning them… to them when you
need to so that you learn what you must.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.519
Every emotion has a function.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.749
Also, [marshalling] positive emotions, getting
ourselves, you know, involved, enthused about

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:58.159
what we’re doing, aligning our actions with
our passions.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.840
The third is empathy, knowing what someone
else is feeling.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.730
And the fourth is putting that altogether
in skilled relationship.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.990
So that’s what I mean by emotional intelligence.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.550
There’re many definitions out there.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.280
The part of the brain, it turns out, that
supports emotional and social intelligence

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.360
is actually the last circuitry of the brain
to become anatomically mature.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.420
And because the neuroplasticity of the brain
shapes itself according to repeated experiences,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.450
so my argument is, hey, we should be teaching
kids regularly overtime, in a systematic way,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.490
self-awareness, self-management, empathy,
and social skill.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.140
In fact, there, now, enough programs and they’ve
been around enough in schools that they’re

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.110
about to publish a huge meta analysis, looking
at hundreds of schools and kids that had the

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.140
program versus those that don’t.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.000
Guess what?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.490
All anti-social behavior, you know, disruption
in class, find that… it goes down 10%.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.830
Pro-social behavior, liking school, well-behave,
up 10%.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.960
Academic achievement scores, up 11%.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.860
So it really pays.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.800
Executive function, which is mediated by the
prefrontal lobe, both helps you manage your

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.910
emotions and helps you pay attention.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.610
So as kids learn these skills, they also learn
learning… basic learning skills.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.450
I think that the fact that that was an argument
was one thing that caught people’s attention.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.269
Then, there was a little chapter on… called
managing with heart, which argued that leaders

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.760
who were sons of a bitch were actually defeating
the company’s own mission.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.900
And I think that made a lot of people happy
because they work for people like that.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.090
I don’t know…

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.090
Some people gave it to other people because
they thought they needed help in this domain.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.409
I’m sure there’re a zillion reasons why
people like the book.

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.739
I hope more.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:01.040
I know IQ has been going up for a hundred
years as children encounter more sophisticated

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.560
cognitive environment as they grow.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.389
I don’t know that we’re becoming more
emotionally intelligent.

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:16.489
I like to hope we would but I think that the
number of intergroup wars going on, the intergroup

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:24.830
hatred going on, the, you know, levels of
familial abuse, in other words, indicators

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.900
of emotions out of control in dangerous ways
don’t look that great, which is why I’m

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.190
a very strong proponent of getting these social,
emotional learning programs in every school

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.190
worldwide.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.650
Well, I get asked that question in a different
way, which is, are women more emotionally

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.650
intelligent than men?

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.870
And you have to remember that emotion intelligence
is a range of abilities, self-awareness, emotional

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.969
self-management, empathy, social skills.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:58.129
Women tend to be better than men on average
at empathy, particularly emotional empathy,

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.409
sensing in the moment how the other person
is feeling and also, at social skills, at

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.150
keeping things feeling good between people
in a group.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.160
Men, on the other hand, tend to be better
on average at self-confidence, particularly

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.459
in group, and at managing distressing emotions.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.840
But what’s very interesting is if you look
at leaders who were in the top 10%, there’s

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.520
no difference between the men and the women
on any of those variables.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.669
In other words, you have a whole human being.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:36.360
So I would say that on average, there probably
are differences men and women in this domain

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.680
of ability.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.770
But as people develop their skills, as people
become more effective, they pick up strengths

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.830
in areas that they need.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.820
Well, I think that emotional intelligence
as a universal but it looks different in different

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.460
places.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.360
You know, Japan has a very rigid set of rules
of social interaction, lots of subtleties.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.030
Americans typically blender in to the Japanese
system, don’t get what’s going on.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.621
And, you know, it’s embarrassing but they
wouldn’t recognize, necessarily, emotional

00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:13.810
intelligence in Japanese setting.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.300
Brazil is a very different culture.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.530
It’s very outgoing, you know, kind of like
an Italian culture.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:30.360
And so, it will look different there but I
think the fundamentals are the same.
