[Captions by Y Translator]
There are a lot of things
you can capture on camera

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.660
that looks even cooler
if you can slow it down.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.300
Well today, we're going
to take some gallium metal.

00:00:06.313 --> 00:00:08.650
We're going to freeze it
extra cold in liquid nitrogen,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.720
and then we're going to smash

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.740
it to see what that looks
like in super slow-mo.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.920
[Music]

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.235
Guys, I'm here with Todd
and Joe from Kuma Films,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.800
and they have some better
camera equipment than we do.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.760
And so they're going
to help us out

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.040
with a little experiment today.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.280
Guys, you want to explain
a little bit about

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.816
what you've got going on here.

00:00:31.816 --> 00:00:33.750
So this is a Phantom
high-speed camera.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.138
The specific model
is the VEO 640s,

00:00:36.138 --> 00:00:39.650
and it can shoot upwards
of 50,000 frames a second.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.660
So pretty slow.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:42.980
That is absolutely insane.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.740
So we've got our gallium,
we've got some liquid nitrogen,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.140
and I want to see these things
explode just beautifully.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.740
All right, let's take
our little gallium Lego man,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.812
and send him on an adventure.

00:00:53.812 --> 00:01:01.220
[Music]

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.760
Everyone's ready?

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.900
3, 2, 1.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.600
[Music]

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.720
That's beautiful.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:20.160
[Music]

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.080
3, 2, 1.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.900
That's gonna look good.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.080
[Music]

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.900
Oh, that's so perfect.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.820
I love watching
like the cracks appear

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.140
before it explodes.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.451
But then like you see
the speed of your hammer,

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:39.111
like all that is actually slow.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.620
Yeah.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.655
All right, those two shots
were really cool.

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:44.152
We've got more of
these little gallium Lego men,

00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:46.208
and we're going to do
pretty much the same thing,

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:47.380
but we're going to try
to zooming in,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.120
and just like ultra macro shot,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.600
where the the guy
is filling the whole frame.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.660
[Music]

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.320
3, 2, 1.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.540
[Music]

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.600
Oh man, most of his body is
apparently intact somewhere.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.200
I saw a very
large chunk fly off.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.520
Oh, here it is.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.080
[Music]

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.900
Look, it's his toes.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.480
Lego man toes.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.160
3, 2, 1.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.460
[Music]

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.400
I do love the massive
amounts of destruction.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.100
The hammer does a pretty
good job of shattering these,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.572
but we do want to try something
with a little bit more speed,

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:36.200
and see how that works out.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.700
We've got a Han
Solo in carbonite.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.560
This is going to be
really easy to hit.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:47.880
[Music]

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.000
3, 2, 1.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
[Music]

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.940
Oh, wow!

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.740
Yeah.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.400
That was beautiful.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.560
[Music]

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.400
That well and truly

00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:08.806
exploded, so much more
than I thought it was,

00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:10.706
and I'm very happy
with the result.

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:11.992
That looks really cool.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.440
[Music]

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.140
All right, smashing stuff

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.354
with a hammer has been
pretty great so far.

00:03:22.354 --> 00:03:24.190
Now, I've just got
a mild steel rod,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.150
and I'm going to see
if I can just whip right

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.500
through it because I'm curious
what will happen.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.832
So our poor little
R2D2 is gonna...

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.242
He might not make it.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.320
3, 2, 1.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.060
I don't know what
the impact was.

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:39.309
So I want to see like,
did I just clip it?

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:41.060
Did I actually like
hit the middle of it?

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.540
[Music]

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.680
Yeah, I just clip the top
of his head and cracked it open.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.400
That's why I didn't go flying.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:04:01.760
[Music]

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.660
3, 2,1.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.800
[Music]

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.540
Just for a little bit of fun,

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.750
we are taking our camera
off of the tripod,

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.280
and we're trying for a little
bit of a parallax effect.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.080
3, 2, 1. Go.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.980
Might have been
a tiny bit early,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.980
but I think you
still got pretty good.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.640
[Music]

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.740
3, 2, 1.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.320
Yeah, that one got
stopped for a second.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.040
It's much more solid chunk.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:57.980
[Music]

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.720
Awesome stuff.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.540
Thank you to Todd
and Joe from Kuma Films.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.277
Guys, if you have any other
stuff you want to see us film

00:05:03.277 --> 00:05:04.300
in super slow motion,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.900
let us know down
in the comments.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.104
We love working with these guys.

00:05:07.104 --> 00:05:08.320
You should go check
out their channels.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.480
They've got some awesome stuff.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.900
We put out a call

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.500
for you guys to send
him some questions.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.826
We've gathered a bunch
of those up,

00:05:13.826 --> 00:05:15.420
and now we're going
to be answering some of them.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.400
Mr. Manvi.
Manvi?

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.540
Mr. Manvi?

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.840
Would like to know,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.580
"Which is the
most longest project

00:05:23.632 --> 00:05:25.688
that TKOR has done so far,

00:05:25.688 --> 00:05:30.660
and can we expect another big
project coming sometime soon?

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.380
Such as the real-life treehouse
with the pulley system project."

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.980
Oh, good question.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.740
The longest project,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.040
dehydrating milk takes like,
took like three or four

00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:43.291
days to just let
it dehydrate all the way,

00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:46.138
but it wasn't like Hands-On
working and stuff.

00:05:46.138 --> 00:05:48.284
You could talk about
the failed moss video.

00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:48.850
Oh.

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.232
We at one point wanted to do
a test about moss graffiti.

00:05:53.232 --> 00:05:55.671
If you've ever
researched Moss Graffiti,

00:05:55.671 --> 00:05:57.971
you'll find about
a trillion pictures

00:05:57.971 --> 00:06:01.423
that are just like these cool
designs made out of moss.

00:06:01.423 --> 00:06:05.322
There's instructions and recipes
of how to make moss graffiti,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.040
and like 99% of them are fake.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.120
Like they didn't do it.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.600
So they have a recipe
of it like, get some Moss,

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.820
get some milk,
get some dirt,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.831
blend that all together,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.680
and add some corn syrup,
and then paint that on.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.159
And if you water
that twice a day

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.379
while give you just
the right amount of sun

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:24.648
and shade, you'll get...

00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:25.840
It's...
None of it.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.640
It's not true.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.974
Almost everyone has faked it.

00:06:27.974 --> 00:06:31.709
There's lots of videos out there
where people show doing this,

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:32.532
and it's fake.

00:06:32.532 --> 00:06:33.757
Or they-- I've seen several

00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:35.499
where they literally
like put a tripod,

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:37.500
and you can see
where they've painted it,

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.250
and it's just like brown goo.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.450
And then they just CGI it green,
like, oh look,

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.550
it's our time lab,
but it was not a time lab.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:46.098
They're just like,
and now it's green,

00:06:46.098 --> 00:06:48.350
because maybe that would work,
but it doesn't.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.040
It doesn't work.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.040
There are a couple ways you
can do real moss graffiti.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.040
A lot of those pictures
that are on Pinterest are

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.180
from a couple of artists
who would take sheets of moss,

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:00.476
usually real moss.

00:07:00.476 --> 00:07:02.636
Sometimes artificial
moss or dead,

00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:04.142
dried and painted moss.

00:07:04.142 --> 00:07:05.209
They would take sheets of it,

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:06.496
and they would
carefully cut it out,

00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:07.600
and then they would glue it on

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.900
so it looked like the moss
had grown like that.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.750
But really, it was just
stuck on in place.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.950
And then, I did see one user

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.973
who found a method
where you take I think glue

00:07:17.973 --> 00:07:19.235
and shredded cotton,

00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:21.186
and you attach that to a board,

00:07:21.186 --> 00:07:24.366
and then you take like
moss seeds mixed with some dirt,

00:07:24.366 --> 00:07:26.250
and you put
that into the cotton,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.711
and the cotton
holds enough water,

00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:29.350
and it holds the
seeds and everything,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.220
and he got it to kind of work.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.340
But it's a little unruly
if I'm remembering correctly.

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:35.675
Like the moss just
starts growing everywhere,

00:07:35.675 --> 00:07:36.976
and leaves the boundaries

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.840
of whatever you tried
to draw or write.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.080
So yeah, we tried
Moss Graffiti and I did it.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.433
I tried like three different
types of moss with three or four

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:48.333
different recipes of moss,

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:52.344
and so I had like 20
like samples of moss,

00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:55.120
and every single day
for two months,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.000
I watered it,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.840
and they were in a place
with a little bit of sun

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.586
and a little bit of shade,
and like nothing.

00:08:00.586 --> 00:08:04.150
Like not even the tiniest
little sprout grew out of that.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.532
And I'm not saying
it's completely impossible,

00:08:06.532 --> 00:08:08.375
because maybe there are places
that would work.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.380
Maybe there are other types
of moss that would work better.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.240
Maybe if you live
somewhere like Seattle,

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.460
where it's just humid
and damp all the time,

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.440
because it's always raining,
it would work a lot better.

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.594
But that, we tried
that for like two months,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.660
and got nowhere with it,

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.780
and I was hoping I could show
maybe one of them worked,

00:08:24.782 --> 00:08:26.630
and I even tried like coming
with my own recipe

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.598
that I thought seemed

00:08:27.598 --> 00:08:29.350
like it was the best
of all the worlds,

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.450
and then the ants
like eat it or something.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.702
I don't know what happened,
but it was just...

00:08:33.702 --> 00:08:34.752
Every day I'd go out,

00:08:34.752 --> 00:08:36.452
and like less of it
would be there,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.580
and I don't know where it went.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.300
But Moss Graffiti,

00:08:39.305 --> 00:08:43.250
so if anyone out there has
really truly done Moss Graffiti,

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.583
and it works, something,

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:47.390
I mean something you
can dip a paint brush in,

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.550
paint it on a wall,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.134
and then water it,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.240
and will grow as moss,
you let us know,

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.100
and we'll do a video on it.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.102
Send you 25 bucks.

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:56.292
In terms of expecting

00:08:56.292 --> 00:08:58.645
another big project
coming sometime soon.

00:08:58.645 --> 00:09:01.550
We've always got big projects
that we want to do,

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.272
but big projects are
so time consuming,

00:09:04.272 --> 00:09:06.743
which was what part of
what makes them big,

00:09:06.743 --> 00:09:08.050
and we love doing them.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.173
But one big project can easily
take up weeks of time,

00:09:12.342 --> 00:09:14.283
and we put out
five videos a week.

00:09:14.283 --> 00:09:16.040
And so if I do a big project

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.800
that's going to take two
or three weeks of my time to do,

00:09:18.802 --> 00:09:21.450
that means I have
to somehow build a stockpile

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.333
of like 15 more videos,
and that's hard to do.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:28.050
So there are different sizes
of videos coming all the time.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.320
I don't have an estimate

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.650
for when we could do
the real life Treehouse.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.327
Although I would love too,
that sounds super fun,

00:09:34.327 --> 00:09:36.576
I don't currently have
a good tree for that.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.250
That's one of
my limited factors.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.773
Guys, if you've got
other questions you

00:09:39.773 --> 00:09:41.499
want to see us answered
while we're doing this,

00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:41.948
let us know.

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:42.960
We want to hear it from you.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.140
Guys, that's it for today,
but that's not all.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.482
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:48.918
That box up at the top will take
you directly to our last video,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.120
and you should go
check that out.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.337
The other box will show you

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.520
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.540
and if you haven't subscribed
to our Channel yet,

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.383
I don't know what you're waiting for,
hit this bomb to get in the club,

00:09:57.383 --> 00:09:59.032
and that way, you'll
never miss out on a video.

00:09:59.032 --> 00:10:00.253
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.340
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.020
Talk to you then.
