00:00:00.252 --> 00:00:02.292
Let's do this again,using once again

00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:04.424
our election example.

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:06.919
This time with four parties--A, B, C, and D.

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:08.818
And here the election outcomes

00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:11.659
party A received 175,000 votes,

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:16.911
party B 50,000, party C 25,000, party D 50,000.

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:18.932
In most democratic parties, you don't find

00:00:18.932 --> 00:00:22.567
such a distribution that one party takes the vast majority,

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:25.020
but say that's the case for our country.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.897
If I now draw a pie chart, let us assume

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:31.264
that we try to graph party A first,

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.761
then B, C, and D--as indicated over here.

00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:38.430
Please check exactly those boxes that define

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.375
the separator from one party to the next.
