CORY DIERS: Hi.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.750
I'm Cory Diers and I'm a
software engineer at Google.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.250
I work on a developer
library called

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.770
Blockly, which makes it easy
to build block programming

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.030
experiences.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.130
In this video, we'll
cover what Blockly is

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.787
and how to use it in your app.

00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:14.370
Blockly includes all
the pieces needed

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.710
for defining and rendering
blocks in a drag and drop

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.380
editor.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.880
Each block represents
a bit of code

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.880
that a user can easily snap
together like puzzle pieces.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.770
Typically, the
Blockly UI includes

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.350
a workspace, where users
assemble their code,

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.110
and a toolbox, where
they can get new blocks.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.840
The library then generates
syntactically correct code

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.030
in the language of your choice.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.110
Blocks are a fun way for
users to interact with code.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.860
Blockly can be used
with physical devices,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.680
like robotics, toys,
or home automation,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.410
or entirely digital
applications, like animation,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.410
teaching programming,
or even video games.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.860
Anything you can code with
text, you can code with blocks.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.320
But Blockly itself
isn't a language.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.970
The code generated
by the blocks still

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.530
needs to be run somewhere.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.660
For that, there are
several options.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.650
Blockly includes generators for
JavaScript, Lua, Python, Dart,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.940
or PHP.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.730
So anything that can be run
on one of these languages

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.439
can run the generated code.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.480
Developers have also
created their own generators

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.063
for other languages, including
some non-programming languages,

00:01:14.063 --> 00:01:16.830
like legal documents
or music notation.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.980
So now that you have an
idea of what Blockly is,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.200
we'll talk a bit more
about how to use it.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.000
The basic steps are--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.700
add the library to your
app; design your blocks

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.390
and write code generators
for them; test and iterate.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.779
Blockly has libraries
for web, iOS and Android,

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:34.070
so you can add it to your
app, no matter which platform

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.180
you're targeting.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.030
Check the description for
links to the developer docs.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.330
They include in-depth set-up
instructions for each platform.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.040
Once you've got the
demo blocks working,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.050
it's time to build some
blocks of your own.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.330
The Blockly Developer
Tools provides a UI

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.700
for creating and
trying out blocks.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.709
If you prefer, blocks can
also be defined in JSON.

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.500
Be sure to consider
your audience carefully

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.150
when designing your blocks.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.830
For example, a block that
reads "repeat five times"

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.270
may be more understandable
for a novice than a block that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.970
reads "for int i equals 0,
i less than 5, i plus plus."

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.470
The Developer Tools
can also define

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.330
which blocks are
shown in the toolbox

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.490
and can be used for
quick prototypes.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.551
Speaking of prototypes, don't
forget about user testing.

00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:18.800
If you've designed your
blocks in the Developer Tools,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.600
you can try out the
look and feel or even

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.700
print them to use in
a paper prototype.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.530
It's always hard to know when
users will run into trouble.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.610
So testing blocks out early is
critical to a successful app.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.520
You can even start testing
before you've written any code.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.853
There's a lot more that can
be done with Blockly than we

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.220
have time for it in this video.
