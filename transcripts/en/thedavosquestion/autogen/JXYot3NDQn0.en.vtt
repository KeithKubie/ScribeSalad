India become a superpower it's a tough
trajectory but I think you have a lot of

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309
trajectory but I think you have a lot of
 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.879
trajectory but I think you have a lot of
advantages number one you have a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889
advantages number one you have a
 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.860
advantages number one you have a
population to them people coming up

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
population to them people coming up
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.320
population to them people coming up
which everybody knows is going to be the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330
which everybody knows is going to be the
 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.060
which everybody knows is going to be the
heart of the energy of the country and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070
heart of the energy of the country and
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.099
heart of the energy of the country and
of innovation in the country if you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
of innovation in the country if you
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.080
of innovation in the country if you
manage this upcoming population and

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
manage this upcoming population and
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.090
manage this upcoming population and
manage to channel those energies

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100
manage to channel those energies
 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.650
manage to channel those energies
appropriately into innovation

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
appropriately into innovation
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.890
appropriately into innovation
entrepreneurship etc and you create the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900
entrepreneurship etc and you create the
 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.019
entrepreneurship etc and you create the
structures the innovation frameworks

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
structures the innovation frameworks
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.749
structures the innovation frameworks
that can allow this to be sustainable

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759
that can allow this to be sustainable
 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.069
that can allow this to be sustainable
then I think you have a very realistic

then I think you have a very realistic
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.510
then I think you have a very realistic
shot of becoming one of the world

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
shot of becoming one of the world

superpowers you're already on the way

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
superpowers you're already on the way
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.040
superpowers you're already on the way
with a phenomenal growth rate but that's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
with a phenomenal growth rate but that's
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.049
with a phenomenal growth rate but that's
not enough you need to create a lot of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059
not enough you need to create a lot of
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.700
not enough you need to create a lot of

super powers have been able to do for

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340
super powers have been able to do for
 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.990
super powers have been able to do for
themselves such as the United States and

that's more based on innovation science

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
that's more based on innovation science
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.450
that's more based on innovation science
and technology base innovation I think

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
and technology base innovation I think
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399
and technology base innovation I think
is particularly important and channeling

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
is particularly important and channeling
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.170
is particularly important and channeling

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
the energy of your youth which you're
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.619
