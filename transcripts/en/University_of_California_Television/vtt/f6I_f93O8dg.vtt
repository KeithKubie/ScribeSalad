00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.250
- [Narrator] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.393
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:15.537
(upbeat music)

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.930
- So I think that any time you give a talk

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.400
the title of which begins
with The Future of,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.270
you should approach it
with a certain degree

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.870
of trepidation.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.070
Predicting the future is a
dangerous thing to try to do.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.270
Now in my normal work, in the stuff

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.360
that I work with on a day
to day basis, I am used to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.480
working with instrumentation
that looks like this.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.180
In order to prepare today's talk, however,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.012
I've had to familiarize
myself with a different kind

00:01:18.012 --> 00:01:20.950
of instrumentation. (laughs)

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.870
And what I'm gonna try to do today is

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.540
gaze into my crystal ball a little bit

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.760
and give you my sense of what the future

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.040
of planetary exploration might hold.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.440
I will begin with stuff that
I feel pretty confident about

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.130
because it's gonna happen soon

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.970
and the plans are well underway,

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.280
and then as I get further
and further into the talk,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.350
I'll wave my arms more and
more and you should all

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.583
get more and more skeptical as I do that.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.430
I'm gonna start with
Spirit and Opportunity,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.270
with the Mars exploration
rovers, as Imka mentioned,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.930
the rover Opportunity
is still going strong.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.323
Still doing good things.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.247
We landed way up here
near Endurance crater,

00:02:05.247 --> 00:02:09.080
drove 21 months to Victoria crater,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.450
spent two years exploring there

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.650
and since then we've been striving

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.633
to reach the rim of Endeavor crater.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.730
This shows the route that we followed,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.240
landing site Endurance, Victoria.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.993
Here's where we are today,
there's the rim of Endeavor.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.350
Now this shows the
rover's current location

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.010
right there, we have wandered into a field

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.750
of small impact craters, four of them.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.710
Their names are Faith 7,
Sigma 7, Friendship 7,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.176
and Freedom 7 after 4 of the
spacecraft that were used

00:02:49.176 --> 00:02:51.520
during Project Mercury.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.530
These pictures just came down today.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.530
This is from our current location
looking east at Freedom 7,

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.280
looking west at the smaller
crater of the 2, Friendship 7.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.640
You can see these are very fresh craters,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.470
they're rough, they're rugged.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.400
They formed fairly recently,
they haven't eroded away much.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.000
Now it's about the future,
so where are we going next?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Where we're going next is
the rim of Endeavor crater.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.360
And the reason we've
picked it, here's a picture

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.660
from orbit that shows what the
rim of endeavor looks like.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.620
The really interesting
thing on this slide, though

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.110
is that wiggly black curve there.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.640
That wiggly black curve
is an infrared spectrum

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.640
obtained from orbit of the
rocks on the rim of the crater.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.330
And what we've done here is match it up

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.280
against three different curves of minerals

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.180
that we've looked at in the laboratory.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.630
And you notice that these
dips in the spectrum

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:55.920
line up beautifully.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.633
These minerals are clays.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.840
These are clay minerals,
and clay minerals form

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.750
as a consequence of the
action of liquid water.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.810
Now I made the case yesterday

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.570
that there has been a lot of water

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.340
at the Opportunity landing site.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.516
And the rocks we've been driving around

00:04:16.516 --> 00:04:19.170
show compelling evidence
of the action of water.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.400
But when you look at the minerals

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.220
that we've been driving around on,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.140
they are largely sulfate salts

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.980
and when you work through the chemistry,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.120
what that tells you is that the water

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.890
that was involved in forming
those rocks was very acidic.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.530
It had a PH of three or two or one.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.010
So people run around saying
water on Mars, water on Mars,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.970
well what we really found
evidence for so far,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.690
with Opportunity, is evidence
of sulfuric acid on Mars.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.200
And that's kinda nasty stuff
if you're a microbe, okay.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.700
Of most sorts, however,
clay minerals like these,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.260
those form under neutral PH,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.050
under more normal watery conditions

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.580
and so what this evidence points to

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.140
is rocks in the rim of this crater

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.540
that are fundamentally different

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.670
from anything we've seen
before with this rover

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.920
after over seven years
of driving it around

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.810
and that point to conditions

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.430
more suitable for life, possibly

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.750
than anything we have found so far.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.600
So here's the road ahead.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.410
Today, this is our position
on day 2585 of the mission,

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.660
this is the path going
forwards, four kilometers to go.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.700
Three kilometers to go,
two kilometers to go,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.290
one kilometer to go, and
then here's where we make

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.020
our first landfall, if you will.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.990
The places that we're approaching, this

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.600
large piece of the rim
here, we named it Cape York.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.110
This gap between it and
the stuff to the south,

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.230
we called Botany Bay.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.850
All of these are places that they're named

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.980
after places that were
discovered by James Cook

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.850
on his expedition of circumnavigation
in the ship Endeavor,

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.030
which is what the crater is named after.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.720
So this is the path forward.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.850
We're doing

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.030
typically 100-150 meters per drive.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.150
And we drive typically
three or four days a week.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.640
I'll leave it to you to do the math,

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.320
but if the wheels don't fall
off, we're gonna get there.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.370
It won't be too long.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.650
The view when we get there
should be spectacular.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.200
This is a perspective view
that shows the topography,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.397
the color code shows
how steep the slopes are

00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:34.280
and anything that's red
would be very challenging

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.670
for the rover, anything that's black

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.730
would be deadly for the rover.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.750
Here's Cape York, here's Botany Bay.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.330
We're out here someplace,
we pull up to this spot

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.150
and the view across this
crater's gonna be spectacular.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.210
I can't wait to see it.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.350
One of the things that we're debating

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.810
is do we spend a lot of time on Cape York,

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.380
which is a little thing,
or do we head south

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.220
for the bigger things.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.350
This is a place called Cape Tribulation.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.252
And man, the view from the top of that

00:06:57.252 --> 00:07:00.073
would be fantastic, so we'll see.

00:07:01.012 --> 00:07:03.240
This is the view looking
off in the distance,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.610
that's Cape Tribulation right here,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.330
Cape York is over that direction,

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:11.330
so like Islands rising
out of a sea of sand,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.210
these things are beckoning to us.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.943
And in the months ahead,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.333
if the rover survives, we'll get there.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.280
Okay, here's another prediction
I'm fairly confident about,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.140
the Cassini Mission.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.773
Cassini's a fantastic mission.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.200
It is an orbiter, currently
orbiting the planet Saturn.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.220
This is a beautiful picture of Saturn,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.790
with the sun shining
through the planet's rings.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.640
Recently, NASA has approved what they call

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.470
the Cassini Solstice Mission,
this is a seven year long,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.586
seven years, seven year long extension.

00:07:48.586 --> 00:07:51.050
In a sense, it essentially
doubles the mission lifetime

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.750
of the Cassini mission.

00:07:54.797 --> 00:07:57.930
Among the events that will
take place during the extension

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.320
is 54 more flybys of Titan.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.180
Titan is this enormous moon of Saturn,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.430
I'll be talking about it much
more later on in the talk,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.990
it's got a dense
atmosphere, it's got clouds.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.900
The only way you can
really map the surface well

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.150
is with radar, so there'll
be 54 more opportunities

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.110
to use Radar to gaze through the clouds

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.660
and map more of the surface.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.000
Another place that I'll be talking about

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.200
later in the talk is Enceladus.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.760
Enceladus is tiny

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.580
little moon of Saturn,
it's only 500 kilometers

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.370
in diameter, it's bizzarre to think

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.680
that a moon that small would
show geological activity,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.390
yet there are literally geysers erupting

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.570
from the south pole of Enceladus.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.990
And the Cassini spacecraft
will fly by Enceladus 11 times

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.990
and on some of those, it will actually fly

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.150
through the plumes of stuff
coming out of those geysers

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.380
and make more measurements
of what it is made of.

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.500
So the Cassini is going to
continue and is going to continue

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.490
to do great science.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.780
Messenger, this is a really exciting one.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:06.120
Messenger is a mission that
just literally weeks ago

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.310
was inserted into orbit around Mercury.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.480
Until Messenger's arrival at Mercury,

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.140
the only spacecraft mission
to Mercury had been flybys

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.460
by the Mariner 10 spacecraft
back in the mid 70s.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.560
Mercury's a tough place to get to,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.850
it's tough to get to
because you have to go deep

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.460
into the sun's gravity well,

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.957
it's tough to get to
because it's just hot there.

00:09:28.957 --> 00:09:31.490
You'll notice that the spacecraft

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.630
is basically equipped with
a giant parasol, okay.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.550
This is a sun shade to keep it cool.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.280
Anyway, it has gone into
orbit around Mercury,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.744
it has just begun to
turn on its instruments

00:09:41.744 --> 00:09:43.720
and start to map the planet.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.210
Let me just show you one very cool picture

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.782
that came down fairly
recently from Messenger.

00:09:48.782 --> 00:09:51.317
They're calling this a spider crater.

00:09:51.317 --> 00:09:53.684
Silly names like that are the
ones that scientists make up

00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:55.150
to describe things when they don't

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.600
actually understand them yet.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.840
But here's an impact
crater, and it's got this

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.810
fantastic pattern of grooves
radiating out from it.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:05.570
Now what's going on here?

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.550
Did the crater make the fractures?

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.610
Or did the crater form
and weaken the crust

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:14.870
and then later the fractures developed?

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.027
Or were the fractures already there

00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:18.770
and the crater just luckily
happened to land on top of it?

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.200
Don't know.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.370
But this is just an example of the kind of

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.940
really spectacular
image data that's coming

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.440
out of Messenger, it
also has spectrometers,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.077
will map the surface, tell us what the

00:10:29.077 --> 00:10:31.060
planet's crust is made of.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.250
And we're looking forward
to a long and successful

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.463
orbiter mission around Mercury.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.330
Okay, so those are venues
that are currently in flight.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.010
Let me talk about one
that hasn't launched yet,

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.640
but is getting close to it.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.716
This is an extremely ambitious mission,

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:52.350
called MSL, the Mars Science Laboratory.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:56.453
And this is another
rover that will follow up

00:10:56.453 --> 00:11:00.620
to the discoveries made
with Spirit and Opportunity.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.500
It has a fantastic new scientific payload,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.840
I'll tell you about that in a minute.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.300
And the way this thing lands

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.083
is both fascinating and terrifying.

00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:13.010
It's shown up here at the upper left

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.370
and this is what's called a sky crane.

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.000
If you were at my talk yesterday,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.630
I described how Spirit
and Opportunity landed

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:21.950
and it was this terribly
complicated scenario

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.130
where we had airbags that
would bounce on the surface

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.280
and then deflate and then
the lander would open up

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.327
and turn itself right side up

00:11:28.327 --> 00:11:30.550
and there were all
these mechanical things,

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.460
unfoldings that had to happen
in order to make it work.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.680
And what I always wished was we could just

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.840
take the rover and put it
on the surface, you know.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.900
And not have to go through
all that rigamarole.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.070
That's what this thing does,
but it's a little scary.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.590
It comes in with a heat shield,

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.945
just like Spirit and Opportunity,
it deploys a parachute,

00:11:47.945 --> 00:11:49.890
just like Spirit and Opportunity.

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:53.334
And then what pops out of
the aeroshell is this thing.

00:11:53.334 --> 00:11:55.660
And it's a two-part spacecraft.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.840
The top part that you see there

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.800
is called the decent stage,
and then here's the rover.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.450
And it flies like this, there's a cable.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.350
It's called a sky crane,
because it is a crane

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.180
and there are rocket motors
that are firing up here

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.060
and it's lowering this
thing on a rope. (chuckles)

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.570
And it flies down together

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.700
and if there's winds in
the Martian atmosphere,

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.220
it compensates for all those
and the wheels touch down.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.140
It senses touchdown, fires
some explosive devices,

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.640
they cut the cables free.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.240
The decent stage flies away
and the rover's sitting there

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.533
in the soil, six wheels
in the dirt, ready to go.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.343
If it all works.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.040
We're all very excited and
very nervous about this.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:41.560
The rover is big.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.100
It's about the size of a Mini Cooper.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.200
One of the things that you'll
notice in this depiction of it

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.250
is that there are no solar arrays.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.240
With Spirit and Opportunity,
we are dependent

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.420
on solar power for our electrical power

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.215
and we are dependent on lucky wind gusts

00:12:55.215 --> 00:12:57.390
to clean the solar arrays off

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.600
if we wanna keep getting power.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.330
This thing has a big lump of plutonium 238

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.830
on the back end of it.

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:04.920
And that's what's called

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.910
a radioisotope thermoelectric generator

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.582
and that provides a steady
source of electrical power.

00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:13.520
Our rovers were designed
to last for 90 days

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.640
and we're lucky that they've
lasted six or seven years.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.163
This thing is designed from
the outset to last for years.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.130
It's big, as I said.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.423
The wheels are like this,
it's a very large vehicle.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.810
It carries a very complicated,

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.470
very sophisticated science payload.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.260
I won't take you through
the whole payload,

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.820
I'll just talk about
this one instrument here.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:36.713
It's called SAM.

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.040
Here it is, just that instrument,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.680
is almost as complicated
as Spirit and Opportunity.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.730
It's a phenomenally complex instrument

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:49.220
and what it does is it is able to detect

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.340
organic molecules at the
parts per billion levels

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.260
in Martian samples.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.390
So we can reach out with this device here.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.330
Drill into rocks, take
that powdered rock sample,

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:06.060
put it into this device and
search in ancient Martian rocks

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.560
for the building blocks of life.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.100
This is going to be a
very exciting mission.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.780
We don't know where we're
gonna land this thing yet.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.410
There are four candidate landing sites,

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.580
all of them are very exciting.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.010
Here are two of them.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:22.694
One thing that characterizes
all of those landing sites

00:14:22.694 --> 00:14:25.230
is that they all have clay mounds,

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.300
they were chosen for that reason.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.290
This business of finding
clays is terribly important.

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:34.530
Now Spirit and Opportunity
were built by good friends

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.010
and colleagues of mine,
people who I respect and love

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.280
and I've worked with for years.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.763
Those same people are now
building the MSL rover.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.360
And what I am determined to do

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.670
is to get to the clay minerals at Endeavor

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.600
before they get to the
clay minerals at this site

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.530
with that rover.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:54.300
I don't know if we'll make it
or not, but we're gonna try.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.080
Anyway, the landing sites are fantastic,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.560
some of them have fixed
sequences of layered sediments.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.350
This is one that clearly
has a delta deposit

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.570
where water has flowed into a crater

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:09.160
and deposited these deltaic sediments.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.970
This is gonna be a fantastic mission.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.570
And it's one that we're
all very excited about.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.750
New Horizons has launched
and it's on its way to Pluto.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.910
New Horizons is in the
interesting scenario

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:26.290
where its target was a
planet when it launched

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:30.540
and by the time it gets there,
it's not a planet anymore.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.605
I'm sure many of you
are familiar with this

00:15:32.605 --> 00:15:36.390
debate over whether Pluto should
be called a planet or not.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:38.750
I mean, the real answer is that Pluto

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.469
is one of a family of many objects

00:15:41.469 --> 00:15:43.800
and if Pluto could be considered a planet,

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.470
then all of those other objects

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.800
should be considered planets as well.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:50.586
So from a logical, scientific perspective,

00:15:50.586 --> 00:15:54.290
it sort of makes sense to
not consider Pluto a planet.

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.840
Personally, I'm a bit of a traditionalist,

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.610
when I grew up there were nine planets

00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:59.980
and I don't see why Pluto couldn't have

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.300
just been grandfathered
in on a technicality, but

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.420
anyway that's where it stands.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.960
And it's gonna fly by Pluto and
it's gonna be very exciting.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.750
Okay, so those are some of the missions

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.320
that are in the works.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:14.343
Now let's talk about what comes next.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.010
In convention that one of the things

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.870
that I've spent the last
couple years working on,

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.606
is this thing we call a Decadal survey.

00:16:22.606 --> 00:16:25.500
This is requested by NASA.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.830
It's carried out by the
National Research Council.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.240
It involves inputs form
hundreds and hundreds

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.581
of planetary scientists across
the country and overseas.

00:16:35.581 --> 00:16:38.300
People here at Berkeley were
very much involved in it

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.090
as were many other places.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:45.090
And it lays out a plan of
exploration for the coming decade.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.880
In our case, it was for
the decade from 2013-2022

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.348
so now what I'm gonna do, is
I'm gonna take you through

00:16:53.348 --> 00:16:56.910
some of the missions that were recommended

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.310
by the Decadal Survey,

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.706
both for the next decade and
for the decade beyond that

00:17:02.706 --> 00:17:05.560
so the crystal ball's getting
a little cloudier here,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.912
but we're still kinda doing okay.

00:17:07.912 --> 00:17:12.912
Now in the process of
generating the recommendations,

00:17:12.993 --> 00:17:16.720
of recommending missions
for the Decadal Survey,

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.410
we studied a large number
of planetary missions.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.887
28 different missions,
we studied in detail.

00:17:24.887 --> 00:17:27.840
And this part of the job
was one of my favorite parts

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.770
of the whole thing.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.880
One of the things that I
love about planetary missions

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.140
is the part of the process I
call the blank sheet of paper.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.970
When you've got literally
a blank sheet of paper

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.940
in front of you, an idea
for something you wanna fly

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.670
and you get together a
bunch of smart people

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.665
and you start to design a mission.

00:17:43.665 --> 00:17:46.599
And it's a fascinating, exhilarating

00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:49.350
very complicated part of the job.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.020
And we sort of got to do the
blank sheet of paper thing

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.290
about 28 times over in the
course of doing this study

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.320
and then of course, once
we'd studied those missions,

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.160
we had to pick the few
best ones to recommend.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.500
But here's just a list
of all the missions.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.970
And I'm not gonna read
all of these to you,

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.720
but I'll go through a few of them.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.210
Mercury Lander, just what it sounds like,

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.570
follows on after and lands on Mercury.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.700
This Venus in Situ Explorer,
that's a Venus Lander.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.760
Venus Mobile Explorer, that's
lander that lands on Venus,

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.970
takes off, and then goes and lands again.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.480
Lunar South Pole Aitken
Basin Sample Return,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.100
there's a huge impact basin
on the far side of the moon.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.020
Remember all the Apollo landings
were on the lunar near side

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.810
because the astronauts
needed to talk to Earth.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.800
But on the other side of the moon,

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.920
there's a huge impact basin
that punched completely through

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.373
the lunar crust and down
into the lunar mantle.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.214
And so if you can go to
the other side of the moon,

00:18:44.214 --> 00:18:47.610
land by that impact basin and get ejected

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.626
from that basin, you could get
pieces of the lunar mantle.

00:18:50.626 --> 00:18:52.950
It's a way to actually get inside the moon

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.450
and then you bring those back.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.825
Bunch of Mars missions.

00:18:57.825 --> 00:19:00.270
I'll talk about several of these,

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.220
the Mars sample return is certainly

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.498
the most complex and
ambitious of all of them.

00:19:06.498 --> 00:19:09.680
Outer solar system, Europa.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.680
Europa is this moon of Jupiter
that has a crust of ice

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.160
and probably an ocean of
liquid water under that ice.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.070
That makes it a tremendously
important target.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.030
I'll talk about that mission
in a lot more detail.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.300
Io, Io is another moon of Jupiter,

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.360
it is the most geologically,
most volcanically active body

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.830
in the solar system.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.240
Saturn Probe, this puts an entry probe

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.340
into the atmosphere of Saturn.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.496
When Cassini went to
Saturn, there was an orbiter

00:19:42.496 --> 00:19:44.620
and there was an atmospheric probe

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.260
but that atmospheric
probe went into Titan.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.550
It went into the atmosphere
of Titan, one of the moons.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.470
We have never put anything
into Saturn's atmosphere.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.310
And this one would fill
the gap in that knowledge.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.343
Titan Lake Lander.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.250
It's a boat, there are lakes
of liquid methane and ethane

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.560
on Titan and this would actually

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.883
go sailing in one of those lakes.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.870
These are some cool ones, Uranus Orbiter,

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:12.703
Neptune Orbiter and Probe Missions.

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.750
There are basically three kinds of planets

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.980
in the solar system, there
are the terrestrial planets,

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.110
the rocky worlds, Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.510
We've done a lot with those.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.050
There are the gas giants,
the two big gaseous planets

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.260
made mostly of hydrogen and helium,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.050
that's Jupiter and Saturn, we've done

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.300
the Galileo misison of Jupiter,

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.460
the Cassini mission of Saturn.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.950
And then there are the ice
giants, Uranus and Neptune

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.930
and they're made of very different stuff

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.210
from any of those other planets.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.980
And in contrast to those other planets,

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.730
all we've ever done
with Uranus and Neptune

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:47.270
is 2 flybys back with
the Voyager 2 mission,

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:50.000
using early 70s technology.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.933
So there's enormous potential
for new discoveries here.

00:20:55.009 --> 00:20:56.540
And then you get to the smaller bodies,

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.620
return a sample from an asteroid,

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.540
land on an asteroid,

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.210
very interesting object called Chiron,

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.510
this is an object that's
out between the orbit

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.640
of Saturn and Uranus, nothing else like it

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.890
in the solar system.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.040
Comet surface sample return,

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.530
return a sample from the
surface of a comet nucleus.

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.340
So 28 missions, great fun studying them,

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.770
the hard part was picking the best

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:23.160
from this to recommend for flight.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.570
So let me talk to you now about some

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.440
of the recommended missions.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.403
This is one, it's called
a Mars Trace Gas Orbiter.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:33.800
Recently there's been a
very interesting discovery

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.930
that's been made regarding
the Martian atmosphere.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.210
Shown in this picture
here, these are mostly

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.963
earth based observations
and what they have shown

00:21:41.963 --> 00:21:46.963
is evidence for methane
in the atmosphere of Mars.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:52.670
Now what's unusual about that
is that if you ask yourself

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.560
how long will a methane molecule last

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.610
in the Martian atmosphere?

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.520
The answer is measured in
years, or 10s of years,

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.353
or maybe like 100 years,
it's very very short.

00:22:04.353 --> 00:22:06.460
Those molecules don't last long

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.960
because they're easily destroyed

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.840
by ultraviolet radiation and
lots of ultraviolet radiation

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.620
hits the top of the Martian atmosphere.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.110
So if we're seeing, we're
really seeing methane

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:17.880
in the atmosphere and what
that says is that there

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.880
is some active source of methane

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.463
at or below the Martian surface.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.593
What makes methane,

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.963
cows make methane, it's probably not cows.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.570
Various forms of microbial
life make methane,

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.360
in fact it's microbes inside the cows

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.130
that make that methane.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.483
And then volcanoes can
make methane as well.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:47.770
But what this says, this
observation is saying

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.584
that if this is correct, Mars is either

00:22:50.584 --> 00:22:55.584
volcanically or
biologically active or both.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.930
And so this is a mission with a spacecraft

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.900
that would be built by
the European Space Agency

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.850
with NASA, providing most
of the science payload

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.280
and the launch and would
follow upon these observations

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.330
and try to identify the
specific sources of methane

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.830
and its detailed concentrations
in the atmosphere.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:19.230
Beyond that, one of NASA's
programs of planetary exploration

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.250
is a program of missions, it's called

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.040
the New Frontiers program.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.227
That mission to Pluto that I described

00:23:25.227 --> 00:23:28.410
is the first of the
New Frontiers missions.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.410
And the way New Frontiers works is

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:36.080
we recommend a small list, a short list

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:41.080
of potential missions and
then groups of scientists

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.320
get together, team up, write proposals

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.710
for missions that can cost
up to like a billion dollars,

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.120
and one of those missions gets selected

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.150
from those proposals,

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.450
so it's a competitive selection

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.013
among a limited number
of candidate missions.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.940
New Horizons, the Pluto
mission is the first,

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.720
there's a mission called Juno
that's gonna go to Jupiter

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.875
that's the second New Frontiers mission.

00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:07.920
There's a third one that's in the process

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.320
of being selected right now and we said,

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.180
okay, NASA should pick two
more New Frontier missions

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.470
the fourth and the fifth
one in this coming decade.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:18.763
We recommended that the fourth one,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.140
so the next one selected
in the coming decade

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.173
should be chosen from among these five.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.530
Of all those mission
candidates that I talked about,

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.820
these were some of the
ones that bubbled up

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.000
to the top, just based
on their science return.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.720
Comet Surface Sample Return.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.680
I'll show you this one in a
little more detail in a moment,

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.985
returning samples from
the surface of the comet.

00:24:39.985 --> 00:24:43.301
There's lunar sample return
mission from the lunar far side,

00:24:43.301 --> 00:24:45.500
getting inside the moon.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.080
The Saturn Probe Mission.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.910
Trojan Tour and Rendezvous.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.713
There are these objects
called Trojan asteroids

00:24:51.713 --> 00:24:55.340
that are the same orbit
around the sun as Jupiter,

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.400
they share Jupiter's orbit.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.351
And they're 60 degrees ahead
of or 60 degrees behind

00:25:01.351 --> 00:25:05.252
Jupiter at that planet's Lagrange
points, as they're known.

00:25:05.252 --> 00:25:07.680
And this was a mission that
would go ahead and explore those

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.700
and then here's that Venus lander misison.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.100
So what w recommend,
these are the top five,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.160
and we recommended that if
none of these things have flown

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.720
by the time NASA makes its selection,

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.690
that the fourth New Frontiers mission,

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:24.560
selected sometime around 2015 or so,

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.450
should be chosen from
these five and we leave it

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:30.750
up to the competition that
will be held to decide

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:33.450
which one will actually go,
and the best mission wins.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.230
Then another, oh, five or so years later,

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.670
NASA should pick another one

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.700
and which one should
they pick, it should be

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.620
whatever's left over from those five,

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:48.020
and then we're gonna throw
two more into the mix.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.380
One is the Io mission, this is a mission

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.240
that would orbit Jupiter
and do many flybys

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.560
of this violently active volcanic moon.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.650
And then a lunar geophysical network.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:02.550
Now you might say, well wait a minute,

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.100
we put a bunch of geophysical stations,

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.250
seismometers on the moon back on Apollo.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.390
Didn't we?

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.760
Yeah, but again, all the Apollo landings

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.710
were on the near side of
the moon, which means that

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.920
all of those seismomenters are
on the same side of the moon.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.280
That's not a good way to find out

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.490
about the deep interior of the moon,

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.440
you want to have them
distributed over the lunar globe.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.963
And so this is a mission
that would do that.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.900
So those are the recommended
moderate cost missions.

00:26:33.147 --> 00:26:35.920
Now we get to the good stuff.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.290
The expensive ones, oh.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:38.540
Forgot about this one, yeah comets.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:39.440
I promised you I was gonna tell you

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.230
about one of these missions.

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.730
This is what comet nuclei look like.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.660
Comet nuclei are tiny little things,

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.910
a few kilometers in
size, these are a couple

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.160
that we have flown by.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.080
The thing that's great about comets

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.470
is not just that they're photogenic,

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:55.220
it's what they're made of.

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.780
And here's a list of some
of the constituent molecules

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.870
of comets, the things
that stream off of a comet

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.740
when they get close to the sun.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.370
And you see things like water,
okay that's interesting.

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:10.380
We need water for life, we need water,

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:12.659
water is what makes up our oceans,

00:27:12.659 --> 00:27:14.930
much of the water on earth
may have come from comets,

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.380
but you also find things like methane,

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.850
there's ethane up there, there's

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:23.010
complex hydrocarbons, ammonia, cyanide,

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:25.040
there's all sorts of
interesting things in comets.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:30.040
The building blocks of life on Earth

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.050
were probably in large measures

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.923
delivered to Earth initially from comets.

00:27:36.809 --> 00:27:39.213
There are molecules in your body

00:27:39.213 --> 00:27:42.880
that got to Earth by being
delivered from comets

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:47.180
and so this is a way to study
our planet's building blocks

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.120
and the building blocks of life.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.973
It's a complicated mission.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.620
This is what the spacecraft looks like.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.140
Comets go pretty far from the sun.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.200
And you wanna actually encounter a comet

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.690
when it's far from the sun
because when its far from the sun

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.810
is when it's cold and
that's when you don't have

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.120
a lot of stuff streaming off of it.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.570
But when you go far from the sun,

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.200
you need great big solar
arrays for electrical power.

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.330
This thing would hover
above a comet nucleus,

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:19.000
go down to the surface and then
use kind of a spinning brush

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.650
to brush material off of the surface

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.250
and suck it into a container.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.680
The container would then be launched

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.560
on a trajectory that would ultimately

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.110
bring it back to Earth,
it's a complicated mission.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.240
Okay, now we get to the flagships,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.990
the really expensive missions.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.262
The highest priority flagship mission

00:28:36.262 --> 00:28:39.480
that we recommended for the coming decade

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.480
is to begin the process of
returning samples from Mars.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.840
We have gotten to the point
now where our understanding

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.150
of Mars is so good, that we can identify

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.410
the right places to go
on the Martian surface

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:55.760
to bring back the most interesting rocks

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.650
and despite the fact that we can build

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.948
fantastic instruments,

00:28:59.948 --> 00:29:02.650
and take them to the
Martian surface with rovers

00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:05.710
like MSL, the best instrumentation

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:08.150
is always gonna be the
stuff that's back on Earth.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.650
Because when you get
these rocks back to Earth

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.700
and you can use very
sophisticated analysis techniques,

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.440
you can find out things about these rocks

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:19.812
that you could never ever hope to do

00:29:19.812 --> 00:29:21.723
on the planet's surface.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:25.610
So Mars sample return has sort of been

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.540
the holy grail of Mars
science for a very long time.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:33.310
And what this program does
is it breaks the process

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:36.460
of sample return down into three parts.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.723
Three successive missions,
here's how the scenario goes.

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:45.141
The first mission, which we
recommend to fly in 2018,

00:29:45.141 --> 00:29:47.940
goes to the Martian
surface before the rover,

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.290
a little bigger than
Spirit and Opportunity.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.120
That rover drives around
an interesting site,

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.587
selects samples, collects
them, and places them into

00:29:55.587 --> 00:29:59.350
a container, a sample cache.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.970
Which is then on the Martian surface.

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.680
And that's all it does.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.770
They're gonna come back eventually,

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.350
but what that first mission
does is simply collect

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.363
the right samples.

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:13.410
The second mission then
sends another vehicle

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.810
that lands close to that sample cache.

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.907
A little rover goes over,
gets the cache, brings it back

00:30:19.907 --> 00:30:23.634
and sticks it into the
nosecone of a little rocket,

00:30:23.634 --> 00:30:25.725
cranks it up to a vertical position,

00:30:25.725 --> 00:30:29.740
shoots that sample cache
contained in a spacecraft

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:33.452
the size of a coconut
into orbit around Mars.

00:30:33.452 --> 00:30:36.700
So now that coconut sized
spacecraft is orbiting Mars.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.213
Now a third mission, stay with me on this.

00:30:41.383 --> 00:30:45.120
A third mission comes and
in the vastness of space

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.070
around that Mars, finds
that coconut, gathers it in,

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.380
places it into a return
capsule and sends it

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:54.793
on a trajectory back
to Earth where it lands

00:30:54.793 --> 00:30:57.610
in the desert of Utah with a thump

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.030
about 25 years from now.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.360
And the samples come back to Earth.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.263
It's a hard thing to do, folks.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.764
The way you would land
would be, again, using this

00:31:09.764 --> 00:31:14.409
terrifying sky crane system,
this is the descent stage

00:31:14.409 --> 00:31:17.150
that's been developed for
the Mars science laboratory.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:21.570
Now this mission, when it
was originally proposed to us

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:24.460
on the Decadal Survey,
was a joint enterprise

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:29.460
between NASA and ESA, they
would actually land two rovers

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:35.070
at the same site, one NASA
rover, one ESA, European rover.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.690
This is what the NASA
rover would look like,

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.110
it's name right now is MAX-C,

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:43.730
which stands for Mars
Astrobiology Explorer

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:45.270
with Cacheing, I think.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.880
And it drives around, it's got this

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.110
fiendishly complicated
thing on the front end of it

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:51.690
that collects the samples
and puts them in the cache

00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.950
and that's the job of this rover.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.190
The European rover and
the original concept

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.140
was called ExoMars.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.520
And the highlight of
ExoMars was that it carries

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.001
a drill that is able to
drill one to two meters

00:32:06.001 --> 00:32:11.001
down below the Martian surface
and get samples from there.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.170
Very exciting pair of missions.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:16.290
What we found, when we
studied them together,

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:21.070
however was that flying two
rovers was simply too expensive.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.440
The cost to NASA of
flying these two rovers

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.400
was gonna be $3.5 billion,
which was just too much.

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.760
So what we recommended was that
NASA needs to work together

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.930
to simplify that mission and right now

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.480
the two agencies are
collaborating trying to find a way

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.630
to take those two rovers and
combine them into just one.

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:42.550
And reduce the cost of
the mission substantially.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:47.050
But the idea is that first
mission creates a sample cache.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.790
Then here's the second mission,

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.696
it too carries a little rover.

00:32:50.696 --> 00:32:53.977
This is called a fetch rover
because it's job is to go fetch

00:32:53.977 --> 00:32:56.719
the catche, brings it back.

00:32:56.719 --> 00:32:59.980
Puts it into the nose
cone of this rocket here

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.670
called the Mars Ascent Vehicle.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.413
And that blasts that
precious coconut into orbit.

00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:07.790
And here's the coconut collector mission.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:10.830
There's the sample cache
right there, orbiting Mars.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:14.560
And this orbiter goes and
fetches it, catches it,

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.187
puts it into this sample return canister

00:33:17.187 --> 00:33:19.251
and sends it back to Earth.

00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:21.300
When it gets back to Earth, it goes

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.230
into a sample receiving facility.

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:27.460
This is what the sample
return canister looks like,

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.340
the thing that's gonna come back to Earth

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.610
and if you look at that for a minute,

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:36.280
you see the heat shield, you
see the sample return canister,

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.690
you see some cushioning
material around it.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.446
Notice what's missing?

00:33:40.446 --> 00:33:42.203
There's no parachute.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.730
There's no parachute, why
isn't there a parachute?

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:50.390
Well the answer to that is that
people, rightly so I think,

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:55.230
are concerned that you
don't want to inadvertently

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:59.490
release Martian materials into
the terrestrial environment.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:02.621
Now not too many of us
believe that there are

00:34:02.621 --> 00:34:07.380
dangerous organisms that are
gonna be brought back from Mars

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.852
and be inside this capsule,
but you shouldn't be reckless

00:34:09.852 --> 00:34:13.080
about such things and so you are required,

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:16.240
quite sensibly to build a capsule

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.270
that is so rugged that even
if no parachute deploys,

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.020
when it hits the ground,
it will not break,

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.220
it will not fracture the samples,

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.840
it will not release the samples

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.190
so if you've got a sample
container that's tough enough

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:30.129
to not need a parachute,
don't fly a parachute.

00:34:30.129 --> 00:34:33.338
So it actually doesn't have
one, it lands pretty hard.

00:34:33.338 --> 00:34:34.543
But that's the idea.

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.863
Alright.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.863
This one's a real
favorite of mine, Europa.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:47.773
Europa is, as I said
it's a moon of Jupiter.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.880
It's roughly the size of the Earth's moon.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.360
We know from its density
that it must be made

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.570
mostly of rock and metal.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:01.060
And yet its surface is made of ice.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.830
It's made primarily of
water ice and it is laced

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:07.820
with this intricate,
complex pattern of fractures

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.850
that suggests that that
icy shell has been deformed

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:15.143
and fractured and cracked
in various complex ways.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.460
If you ask yourself what does
Europa look like on the inside

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:24.090
there are both theoretical calculations

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:27.230
and observations from
the Galileo spacecraft

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:28.640
that suggest very strongly

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.930
that it looks something like this.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:33.520
You have a small metallic core,

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:38.360
you have a big mantle if
you will of rocky material,

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.624
and then when you get
close to the surface,

00:35:40.624 --> 00:35:44.700
here's that rocky material,
there's the crust of ice

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.080
but both the calculations
and the observations suggest

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.515
that this icy crust is pretty thin

00:35:51.515 --> 00:35:56.515
and beneath it lies an ocean,
an ocean of liquid water.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.980
And what that means if it's true,

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:03.200
is that there are two
kind of accessible oceans

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.500
in the solar system, we've got one

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.850
and Europa's got the other.

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.440
That's a tremendously exciting thing,

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.430
because again, water is
a necessity for life.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:16.400
Now another necessity for
life is some form of energy.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.150
So you might ask yourself well, okay sure,

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.350
there's an ocean there, but
if you wanna have organisms

00:36:21.350 --> 00:36:24.570
live in that ocean, what
are they gonna live off of?

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.910
What's their energy source?

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:29.900
Ice is opaque enough that
you can't expect sunlight

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.020
to shine down through that
stuff and have photosynthetic

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.680
organisms living in that ocean, okay.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.070
That's not gonna work, 'cause this ice

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.600
might be 10 kilometers thick
or something like that.

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.130
But see this red stuff here?

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.478
What that's representing
is the idea that inside

00:36:47.478 --> 00:36:52.135
this rocky mantle,
temperatures are high enough

00:36:52.135 --> 00:36:55.620
that you can get undersea volcanism,

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.900
that you can get volcanic
activity taking place

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.450
on Europa's seafloor.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.173
And we know that on Earth's seafloor,

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.410
volcanic activity and
the hydrothermal vents

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:12.540
that are associated with
that support complex

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:19.600
biological activity that
is fundamentally energized.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.960
That derives it metabolic
energy from the planet's

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.690
internal geophysical heat.

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.510
So Europa and this environment right here

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:36.410
is one of the most compelling
places in the solar system

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.913
to look for evidence of life.

00:37:39.917 --> 00:37:41.420
And that's a hard thing to do.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.630
And we're not gonna send
a submarine the first time

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:45.900
we go to Europa.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.500
We don't know how to do that.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.593
The big question is how thick is the ice?

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.690
Where are the thin spots?

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:55.500
But see the idea is that
you would fly a mission

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.610
that would contain a number,

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:57.730
it would carry a number of instruments.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:00.763
One of the most exciting
is a long wavelength radar.

00:38:02.227 --> 00:38:05.050
And the way we have mapped the thickness

00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:07.430
of the Greenland ice sheet,
of the Antarctic ice sheet,

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.500
and mapped the rock
underneath is by using radar

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.870
at long wavelengths that can
see through kilometers of ice.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.080
Well the same thing will work on Europa.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.620
And you can use that system
to look through that ice,

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.370
find the thin spots, find the place to go

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.660
with a lander mission or
with a submarine mission.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.994
So this is a very very exciting mission.

00:38:26.994 --> 00:38:29.980
The cost estimates for this
one came out very high.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.020
It came out at $4.7 billion,
which was the number

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.020
that broke my heart.

00:38:36.537 --> 00:38:37.700
And we're looking right now, very hard

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.600
at ways to make that less expensive

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.950
but still get the job done.

00:38:45.213 --> 00:38:49.530
Uranus and Neptune, another
one of our recommended missions

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:51.190
is the Uranus orbiter and probe.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:56.010
This is like a Cassini
mission, or Galileo mission

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.860
to Uranus and it would go to Uranus,

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.270
it would put an orbiter into
orbit around the planet,

00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:06.070
multiple flybys of Uranus,
moons, good observations

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.190
of the rings, and then a probe that would

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.090
go into the planet's atmosphere.

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.230
Now why, you might ask,
Uranus instead of Neptune?

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.770
You know either one would be great.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:17.750
They're both gonna be fantastic.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.510
The reason that we recommended Uranus

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:25.510
for the coming decade is
that when you simply look

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.130
at the spacecraft trajectories
that are necessary

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.200
to get from Earth to these planets,

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.950
the spacecraft trajectories
that go to Uranus

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:34.690
in the next decade are just more favorable

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.050
than the ones that go to Neptune.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.060
Also Neptune requires
some special technologies

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:41.380
including one called
aerocapture, where basically

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:43.880
you drag the spacecraft
through the planet's atmosphere

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.030
to slow it down.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:46.980
But Uranus does not.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.290
Which makes Uranus easier to do.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:50.940
But either one of those,
Uranus or Neptune,

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.750
could be a fantastic mission
for the decade to come

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.850
or the one after that.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.090
Here's another good one, Enceladus.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.847
This is that crazy little
icy moon of Saturn.

00:40:04.847 --> 00:40:08.980
500 kilometers in diameter,
tiny little thing.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.313
But there are these prominent fractures

00:40:12.313 --> 00:40:14.990
near the south pole of Titan.

00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:18.250
And erupting from those fractures

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:21.680
are these plumes of material.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.150
And there's fantastic
stuff in those plumes.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:28.880
The Cassini spacecraft has
flown through those plumes

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.843
and has measured the composition
and there's lots of water.

00:40:31.843 --> 00:40:34.820
But there's also methane,
there's ammonia, there's CO2,

00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.140
there's complex organics.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:40.927
There's interesting stuff going
on down inside of Enceladus.

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:43.830
Now Cassini flies through it occasionally,

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:47.783
but the idea here would
be to send an orbiter

00:40:47.783 --> 00:40:52.783
to Enceladus that could really
study that moon in detail,

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:55.890
that could do many many
flybys through the plume

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:59.660
that would have a very
sophisticated payload

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.500
that is specifically aimed at
really studying those plumes

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.450
and learning what they
tell us about conditions

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:09.513
down inside of Enceladus.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.650
Titan, fantastic place.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.450
Titan is roughly the size
of the planet Mercury.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:22.330
It's a moon of Saturn
that's made mostly of ice,

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:24.630
has a dense atmosphere,
the atmosphere is made

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:28.050
mostly of nitrogen, same
thing that is the primary gas

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:29.840
in the Earth's atmosphere.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.630
The atmospheric pressure
at the surface of Titan

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.480
is 50% higher than the
atmospheric pressure on Earth,

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.150
it's a dense atmosphere.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:42.150
It's got cloud cover, a
haze of hydrocarbon smog.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.310
There's methane in the atmosphere of Titan

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:47.760
and when you shine ultraviolet
radiation on methane,

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.790
what happens again is
the molecules break up.

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:51.230
But on Titan there's so much of it

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:54.920
that they can recombine
into more complex organics

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.100
and it makes this smog
that obscures the surface,

00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:01.360
but when you use radar
to look through that smog

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:03.630
you find this complicated icy surface

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:06.810
and then what you find is
that Titan actually has

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:11.810
a hydrological cycle, it rains
on Titan, there are rivers.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.303
There are lakes, but
the fluid in the rivers,

00:42:14.303 --> 00:42:16.550
but the fluid in rivers,
the fluid in the lakes,

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.803
the fluid in the rain is not water,

00:42:18.803 --> 00:42:21.560
it's liquid methane and ethane.

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.500
And it produces these phenomenal features

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.190
with dendritic valleys

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:27.920
and these very familiar looking things

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.223
and yet the fluid is methane and ethane.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.450
So we looked at a mission
that would study these

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:35.630
in comprehensive detail.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.560
You can do some kinda
cool things on Titan.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:42.970
You can put a little boat into the lake.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:45.210
You can fly a balloon in the atmosphere.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.832
You can fly an orbiter around the planet,

00:42:47.832 --> 00:42:50.140
around the moon with radar.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.413
This mission costed out at $6.7 billion,

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.990
which was even more
expensive but this is one

00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:00.253
that has great potential for the future.

00:43:02.695 --> 00:43:07.695
Now that was a mission that
would try to do a comprehensive

00:43:08.048 --> 00:43:11.070
study of Titan, understand
the hydrological cycle,

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.070
understand the climate,
understand the geophysics.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.230
A different approach is to say look,

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.200
this is a very complex interesting object,

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.160
but the most interesting
thing is the lakes

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.330
so let's just go there.

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.320
So this is a mission that we looked at

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.980
that was just targeted at Titan's lakes,

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:31.570
and you can see our
radar picture that shows

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.903
some of these lakes here.

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:36.900
This picture, you've gotta
sorta stare at this for a minute

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:38.941
to realize what you're looking at.

00:43:38.941 --> 00:43:41.954
This is a picture of the spacecraft.

00:43:41.954 --> 00:43:46.630
And this image is taken
from, I'll say underwater.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.840
Looking up at the surface,
now it's not water,

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.273
it's liquid methane, but here is the boat.

00:43:52.178 --> 00:43:55.740
The underside of the
boat, you an see Saturn

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:59.250
hanging in the sky.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.170
But this is looking up at
the underside of the boat

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:05.201
and here's the little
submarine that it just dropped

00:44:05.201 --> 00:44:08.580
to go down to the bottom of the lake.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.910
And it consists of two pieces.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:15.600
One of which is heavy,
dense, negatively buoyant

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.040
and the other is positively buoyant.

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.590
And this thing has all
sorts of cool stuff on it.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.790
My favorite instrument
here is a rain gauge.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.250
You know, that's not
something you usually put

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.420
on a spacecraft, but this would
actually have a rain gauge

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:30.580
on the boat to look at how much rain,

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.920
methane rain falls out
of the sky of Titan.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.770
And this sort of shows
the mission profile,

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:37.330
this is a little bit hard
to read but basically

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:40.110
what this thing does is the
boat lands at the surface

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:42.920
and then it releases the submarine.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.210
The submarine is in two parts

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:46.100
and when those two parts
are joined together,

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:49.070
it's negatively buoyant,
in other words it sinks.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:51.630
And it drops slowly to the bottom

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:54.630
and it sits there for a
while making measurements

00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:57.990
at the bottom of a methane lake on Titan.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:00.680
Makes its measurements for a
while and then once it's done,

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.560
it fires a little
explosive squib right here

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.260
that cuts the top part
free from the bottom part.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.950
The top part is positively buoyant.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:12.560
It floats and so now it
drifts back up to the surface,

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.150
comes up to the surface
and transmits its data

00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:18.600
to a spacecraft orbiting Titan

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.603
which then relays it back to Earth.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:23.160
If you don't think this is cool,

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.630
I don't know what to do.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:29.360
What I just described to
you is probably a good,

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.900
easily 25 years, 25 or 30 years

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.783
worth of planetary exploration.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.540
It's expensive stuff.

00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:40.228
We've worked very hard to come up

00:45:40.228 --> 00:45:43.610
with realistic cost
estimates for these missions.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:44.820
The missions that are expensive

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.843
we are working really hard to
bring the costs of those down.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:52.560
But carrying out these
missions will require

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.700
significant funding.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.650
And the funding needs to stay
steady or go up a little bit

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:59.470
going forward to kind of do the program

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.020
that I've laid out for you.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:05.170
Now in recent months, we have received

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:08.820
from the Obama administration, projections

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.660
going forward for funding
for planetary exploration

00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:14.720
in the United States
for the next five years.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.050
The funding that's recommended
for fiscal year 2012,

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:21.000
here's the number for 2010, $1.3 billion.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
For 2012, it's $1.488
billion, that's a good number.

00:46:27.038 --> 00:46:29.590
That's a number that's
consistent with the plan

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.250
that I laid out for you, that's a number

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:33.640
that will allow us to do

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.370
these exciting missions going forward.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:39.563
But then it falls off a cliff.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.570
The projected numbers from
the Obama administration

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.620
go $1.36, $1.32, $1.27,

00:46:48.748 --> 00:46:52.330
$1.18 in fiscal year 2016.

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:54.050
And this does not account for inflation,

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:56.270
so it's actually worse than this.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:47:00.120
The buying power is going
down even more sharply

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:01.650
than what I've described here.

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:03.620
Now these are

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.540
the word that they use in Washington DC

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:09.810
to describe this budget is notional.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:12.070
I find that an amusing
word, but the idea is

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:13.550
this is a real number, everything else

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:15.253
is a shot across our bow.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.587
It's telling us that this is
what we the administration

00:47:20.587 --> 00:47:22.810
intend to carry out.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:25.010
Now of course, the budget
has to actually be enacted

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:28.860
by the congress and it's signed
into law by the president.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.069
And there's some in
congress who look at this

00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:35.480
and see the demise of
planetary exploration

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.120
in the United States.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.930
If this budget happens, then
the inexpensive missions

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:41.763
that I mentioned,

00:47:41.763 --> 00:47:43.600
like the New Frontiers
missions that I talked about,

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.550
those we can still afford.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.830
But the flagship missions,
sample return, Europa,

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.923
Uranus, none of that can happen.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.820
The multi-billion dollar,
even the billion dollar,

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.420
two billion dollar class
missions, they go away.

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.583
The United States can't do them anymore.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:03.130
Now this is what the Obama administration

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:07.163
has proposed, Congress has to act on this.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.480
The people in congress are
our elected representatives

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.370
and if you feel strongly

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.730
that we should be continuing

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.980
to do a program of robotic
planetary exploration

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:24.518
that keeps this country at
the forefront of that field

00:48:24.518 --> 00:48:26.620
with samples coming back from Mars

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.460
and orbiters to Europa,

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.890
now would not be a bad time to let

00:48:31.890 --> 00:48:34.580
your congressional representatives know

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:35.950
that a budget like this

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.973
is one that's gonna take
us out of that business.

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:42.870
I however remain optimistic.

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:47.450
I believe that ultimately, we are gonna

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.350
do missions of the sort
that I just described,

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:53.360
and that when you look in the decades

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.850
down beyond that, here's
where I'm waving my arms

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:59.230
and speculating that
even better things await.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.370
So let me just describe for you

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:04.220
a few kind of really longer term things

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.290
that I'd love to see happen.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:10.693
One of them is returning
samples from Enceladus.

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:15.280
I mentioned that mission that
would fly through the plumes,

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.990
here's one where you produce a collector,

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:22.830
this is a material that you
can put out in the breeze

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.240
and you can fly through
one of these plumes,

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.080
the plume particles impact
it, they get decelerated

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.130
by this collector and then you send

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:31.940
the whole thing back to Earth.

00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:33.610
You don't actually have
to land on Enceladus,

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:36.000
you just collect the material.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.700
That would be a fantastic mission.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.430
Another one, obviously, is humans to Mars.

00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:47.160
Now sending humans to Mars has
been 30 years in the future

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.380
for the last 30 years, so it's
gonna be at least 30 years

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.860
before this happens, but despite the fact

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:56.720
that you can do marvelous
things with robotic explorers

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.890
on the Martian surface,
the best exploration

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:02.420
and I believe the most
inspiring exploration as well

00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:04.740
is ultimately gonna be done by humans.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.470
And I think sending humans to Mars

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:10.630
is something that should
and will lie in our future.

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.630
And I think personally that Mars

00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:14.870
is a much better target
for human exploration

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:16.520
than the moon or asteroids,

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.230
because frankly, the moon or asteroids

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:20.250
you can do pretty well with robots.

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.500
Mars is so complicated that humans

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.090
can really contribute there.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.669
I'm not sure if they
would wanna drive around

00:50:25.669 --> 00:50:26.570
in something that looks like this,

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:29.104
but they can do a good job.

00:50:29.104 --> 00:50:32.980
Finally, this is one of my real favorites.

00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:35.880
You know I've often said
that if I could figure out

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.410
how to do submarines on Europa,

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:41.030
I wouldn't be messing
around with rovers on Mars.

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:45.040
This is a fiendishly complex mission.

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.550
You need to go deep into
Jupiter's gravity well

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:50.870
and land on the surface of Europa.

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.540
Europa lies deep in
Jupiter's magnetic field

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.850
and so your spacecraft
is subjected to punishing

00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.830
charged particle radiation.

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:02.860
Somehow then, you have to drill or melt

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.900
your way down through, oh I don't know,

00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.010
10 kilometers of ice

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:10.020
and then release into this water column,

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:12.313
which might be 100 kilometers deep,

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:17.000
a free swimming autonomous vehicle

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.290
that's able to somehow
navigate its way down

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:22.160
to the bottom of the ocean,

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.610
find whatever interesting
stuff lies there,

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.670
collect data about it and then somehow

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:31.020
get that information back, transmitting it

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:33.390
to this thing, which
transmits it to the surface,

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:35.040
which transmits it to an orbiter,

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.623
which transmits it to Earth.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.210
I wanna see this mission happen.

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:43.070
I'm trying to get lots of exercise,

00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:45.880
eat healthy foods, I'm gonna
have to live a long time

00:51:47.926 --> 00:51:49.060
to see this mission happen.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.520
But I truly hope that it will.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.990
The big question of course, then is what

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:56.120
will all of these missions discover,

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.182
my answer is, I don't know,
you've gotta ask this guy.

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:01.010
Thank you very much.

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:03.260
(applause)

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:09.938
- [Man] First thing I wanted to ask about

00:52:09.938 --> 00:52:12.166
is the sample return mission.
- From Mars?

00:52:12.166 --> 00:52:13.343
- [Man] Yeah.

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:19.670
Why is it still being considered
to do the analysis on Earth

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.170
rather than at the space station,

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.293
given the possibility of contamination?

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:28.600
- Bunch of reasons for that.

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.670
I think probably the most important one

00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:34.130
is that we really do know how to deal with

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:35.623
the contamination problem.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:40.280
The contamination problem is very similar

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:42.210
to ones that phase
people were working with,

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:46.336
various disease agents
an that sort of thing.

00:52:46.336 --> 00:52:49.190
There are facilities that
can contain such things

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.980
so it's a tractable problem.

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:54.220
You can put much, much,
much better instrumentation

00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:56.160
into laboratories on
Earth than you can put

00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.333
in the space station.

00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.900
And it just sort of puts off the problem.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.470
I mean if you contaminate
the space station,

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:02.970
then what do you do?

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:07.560
So doing it on Earth is the
sensible place, I think.

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.110
- [Man] And I've read that there is,

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.520
it's thought that there
may be a liquid ocean

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.660
underneath ice crusts on
Ganymede and Enceladus

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:19.180
as well.
- Enceladus and Ganymede

00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:22.430
both possibly, I think
Enceladus it's more likely

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:25.760
just sort of little liquid zones.

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.110
Ganymede, quite possibly but the reason

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.130
that Europa is more
attractive than Ganymede,

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:31.600
is that on Ganymede that ice crust

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.560
is really, really, really thick.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.458
It's much more accessible on Europa.

00:53:35.458 --> 00:53:36.540
- [Man] Thant's what I thought, thank you.

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:38.190
- Sure.

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:39.580
Hi.

00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:41.980
- [Man] One of the problems
of prolonging space travel

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:46.740
for humans is that it's
detrimental to their bodies.

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:48.145
- Yes it is.
- And I wish you could talk

00:53:48.145 --> 00:53:51.950
a little bit about that.
- Sure.

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:54.870
Spaceflight is tough on
human bodies in several ways.

00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:58.490
One is that long term
exposure to microgravity

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:01.760
results in redistribution
of a variety of fluids

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.340
and electrolytes in your body

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.423
and one of the consequences of
that is bone decalcification.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:09.940
A lot of the work that's
going on in the space station

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.630
right now is to develop
countermeasures for that

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:15.190
and those are moderately
effective, so I think

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:18.020
it takes seven months to get to Mars,

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:20.130
we can probably solve that problem.

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:21.980
Another serious problem is radiation.

00:54:23.675 --> 00:54:27.150
And solar flares can produce
intense radiation bursts

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:29.950
that could be very
detrimental to human health.

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:32.950
Both on their way to Mars
and on the Martian surface.

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:35.180
The way to deal with that is shielding.

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.710
You just need a lot of mass
between you and the sun.

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:40.500
The thing about these solar flares is

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.380
you can sorta see them
coming, the particle flecks

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.010
just don't travel at the speed of light,

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:46.430
you find out that this thing is coming

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:49.230
and as long as the astronauts
have someplace to go hide,

00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:50.340
they're gonna be okay.

00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:53.160
The way you hide on a
spacecraft on the way to Mars

00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.210
is if you carry with you
some significant mass

00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:56.560
that you use for shielding

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.790
that you would take mass that's
good for something else too,

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.360
like water or something and then you have

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.750
a little small place where you can go

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:06.030
to keep yourself safe
until the flare is over.

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:08.080
On the Martian surface
it gets a little easier,

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:10.705
becasue basically what you do
is you build a storm cellar

00:55:10.705 --> 00:55:13.890
okay, you dig a hole
beneath the Martian surface

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.529
and as long as you're a meter or two down,

00:55:16.529 --> 00:55:19.813
you're gonna be okay when
a solar flare happens.

00:55:19.813 --> 00:55:22.330
But it is a serious problem and one

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:24.590
that could be very detrimental
to astronaut health

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:26.510
unless the appropriate
shielding is available.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:29.620
- Hi you mentioned a lot of exploration

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:33.484
on Mars, specifically towards craters.

00:55:33.484 --> 00:55:36.310
Why are you looking only at craters,

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:37.170
like why is that a big deal?

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:39.560
- Oh yeah, the reason
that we focus so much

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.487
on the impact craters with
the rover Opportunity.

00:55:42.487 --> 00:55:44.620
The reason for that is simple.

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:47.880
The rocks that we've
been driving around on

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.800
for the last seven years
are sedimentary rocks

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.843
and they're a bunch of horizontal layers.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:57.790
And they're very flat lying
and the surface itself

00:55:57.790 --> 00:56:00.960
is very flat too, so as you're
driving along that surface,

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.740
you're basically just
seeing the same rocks

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:05.320
over and over and over again.

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.990
What you want to do is have the capability

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:08.250
to get down below the surface.

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:10.370
Now we don't have a drill, okay.

00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:12.670
We didn't bring a backhoe, we have no way

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:15.350
of digging a hole, but what we can do

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:18.400
is rely on the holes that
nature has dug for us

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.170
in the form of impact craters.

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:21.970
So the beauty of these impact craters

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:25.360
is that they provide
access to other layers

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:27.220
in that stack of sediments,

00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.800
each of which represent a different page

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:31.750
in the Martian history book.

00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:34.060
And so we're able to
study those other rocks

00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.090
by going to craters.

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:36.980
That's the reason we do it.
- Great, thank you.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:37.813
- Sure.

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:39.803
Hi.

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.030
- I have a question about there's
some limited private funds

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:46.243
going into space exploration, do you think

00:56:46.243 --> 00:56:50.790
that that will effect the
economy of space exploration

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:53.553
in the longer term or is
it just a Martian thing?

00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:59.240
- The private funding that's
being invested in space

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:04.240
right now is almost all
money that is intended

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:08.520
to return a profit to the investors.

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.301
There are a couple of examples,
one is Virgin Galactic.

00:57:11.301 --> 00:57:14.950
And they have built a
spacecraft that will be able

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:18.673
to take passengers, I mean
it's not orbiting the Earth,

00:57:18.673 --> 00:57:20.950
it's just a ballistic trajectory

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:23.320
where you have maybe 15
minutes of zero gravity

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.700
going over the top, but
you get to the fringes

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.830
of space and back again
and people can pay,

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:30.122
I forget what the going price is,

00:57:30.122 --> 00:57:34.150
it's the border of
$10,000 to go on that ride

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.490
and the company makes money.

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:38.780
Another great example is SpaceX.

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:42.380
This is a company I have a lot
of enthusiasm and respect for

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:46.120
and this is a company that's
a privately owned company

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:49.450
started by Elon Musk, the
same guy who started PayPal.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:52.590
And they are developing rockets called

00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:55.776
the Falcon family of rockets,
Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy

00:57:55.776 --> 00:58:00.776
that they hope and I hope will
be able to deliver payloads

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:04.214
to Earth orbit for paying customers

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:07.670
at a much lower cost than
we typically now spend

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:10.550
for our Delta rockets
and our Atlas rockets

00:58:10.550 --> 00:58:13.020
from some of the more
traditional aerospace companies.

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:17.520
So we are now beginning
to see private enterprise

00:58:18.691 --> 00:58:23.450
really start to be major
players in the space business,

00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:25.250
but all of the examples that I know of

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:28.880
rely on a sound business model
that has paying customers

00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.250
lined up and ready to pay
real money for those services.

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:36.400
Finding people who were
willing to pay lots of money

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.423
for data from Uranus,

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:42.360
rocks from Mars, that's a little tougher.

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.860
So there are some things that I think

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:45.260
for the foreseeable future,

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:48.368
we have to rely on the
government to take care of.

00:58:48.368 --> 00:58:50.230
- Thank you all for coming.
- Thank you.

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:53.474
- And Steve, thanks for
an exciting talk again.

00:58:53.474 --> 00:58:56.057
(upbeat music)
