00:00:01.026 --> 00:00:04.729
Data Scientists,
Machine Learning and AI Experts

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:07.832
are the most sought-after professionals
in the Silicon Valley and the world.

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.033
Do you know what they 
have in commom?

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:10.538
They all know Python.

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:14.247
Udacity created a quick course
for learning Python programming,

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:16.937
with an emphasis
on Data Analysis.

00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:18.999
Python is a simple
and objective language.

00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:20.895
It's easy to code
and easy to learn.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.163
It allows you to build
robust, high-level solutions.

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.760
That's why companies like
Google, Facebook,

00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:27.238
Spotify and Netflix

00:00:27.313 --> 00:00:28.992
use Python
to create products,

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:30.635
insights and new businesses.

00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:35.015
Today, it is the most used language
in the top universities for learning programming.

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:37.150
It's the 5th most popular language
among programmers

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:39.414
and the preference
in the Data Science market.

00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:41.611
In the Data Foundations I
Nanodegree program

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:43.767
you'll not only
learn the basics of Python,

00:00:43.842 --> 00:00:46.274
such as structure, variables,
conditionals, loops,

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:48.365
but also everything on the
Data Analysis libraries,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.100
which enables you
to do Data Science.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.126
What makes
this project special

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.779
is that you'll use everything
you'll learn in a real project

00:00:55.854 --> 00:00:57.708
and you'll get feedback
from an expert,

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.395
explaining what's good
and what needs improvement.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.925
All this practical knowledge
will make a real impact on your career.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.570
Sometimes we're so used
to doing repetitive tasks

00:01:07.645 --> 00:01:10.611
that we forget that
programming and tech are there

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:12.631
to help our everyday jobs.

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:14.376
Python is perfect
for making analyses

00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:15.806
in a quick and precise way.

00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:18.832
Say goodbye to spreadsheets
and to the hours spent with Excel.

00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:21.233
Sign up for our Data Foundations I
Nanodegree program

00:01:21.308 --> 00:01:24.001
and take your first steps into the world
of Data Science, Machine Learning

00:01:24.076 --> 00:01:25.687
and Artificial Intelligence.

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:29.304
