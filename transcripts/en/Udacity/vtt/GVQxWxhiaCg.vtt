00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.460
In the ADT solution, we're going to have components for lines for characters,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.820
we're even going to treat the circular shifter, instead of being a verb,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.960
it's going to be the circular shifts data structure and there's an operation for

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.990
computing the circular shifts.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.600
And similarly for the alphabetized versions of things.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.580
So we try to make everything into a data structure,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.320
the components into data structure, and

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.710
then have operations for computing the values in that data structure.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.310
We have input components, like before, output components like before, and

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.600
a master controller that invokes the other components.
