00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.140
When I say “work,” what’s the first
thing that comes to mind?

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.749
Maybe a cubicle? Or a briefcase?
Or that history exam that’s coming up soon?

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:15.260
But if you’re a physicist, work has a very specific meaning -- one that has very little to do

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.550
with spreadsheets or the fall of the Roman
Empire.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.029
Today, we’re going to explore that definition
-- and how it connects to one of the most

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.570
important principles in physics: conservation
of energy.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.230
We’ll also learn what physicists mean when
they talk about another concept that comes

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.670
up a lot in daily life: power.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.490
So let’s get to…work.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:42.990
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.629
So far in this course, we’ve spent most of our time talking about forces, and the way they make things move.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.629
And you need to understand forces before you
can understand work.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.429
Because work is what happens when you apply
a force over a certain distance, to a system --

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.189
a system just being whatever section of the universe you h appen to be talking about at the time.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.420
For example, if you’re using a rope to drag
a box across the floor, we might say that

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.860
the box is your system, and the force you’re
using to pull on it is an external force.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.840
So, let’s say you’re pulling on this box-system by dragging it straight behind you, so the rope is parallel to the ground.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.320
If you use the rope to pull the box for one
meter, we’d say that you’re doing work on the box.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.110
And the amount of work you’re doing is equal
to the force you’re using to pull the box,

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.790
times the distance you moved it.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.540
For example, if you pulled the rope -- and
therefore the box -- with a force of 50 Newtons,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.460
while you moved it 5 meters, then we’d say
that you did 250 Newton-meters of work on the box.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.720
More commonly, however, work is expressed
in units known as Joules.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.540
Now, sometimes, the force you apply to an
object won’t be in exactly the same direction

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.640
as the direction in which the object is moving.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.040
Like, if you tried to drag the box with your hand higher than the box, so that the rope was at an angle to the floor.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.000
In that case, the box would move parallel to the floor, but the force would be at an angle to it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.360
And in such an instance, you’d have to use one the tricks we learned back when we first talked about vectors.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.820
Specifically, you must separate the force you’re using on the rope into its component parts:

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.220
one that’s parallel to the floor,
and one that’s perpendicular to it.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.280
To find the part of the force that’s parallel to the floor -- that is, the one that’s actually pulling the box forward --

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.140
you just have to multiply the magnitude of the force by the cosine of the rope’s angle to the ground.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.670
You’ll remember that we typically designate
an angle in a system as theta.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.840
So, to calculate the work you did on the box,
you just multiply the horizontal component

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.580
-- or F times the cosine of theta -- by the
distance you moved the box.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.540
That’s one way physicists often write the
equation for work -- they’ll set it equal

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.430
to force, times distance, times the cosine
of theta.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.040
And that equation will fit any scenario that involves a constant force being applied over a certain distance.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.020
But what if the force isn’t constant?

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.380
What if, say, you started out pulling hard
on the box, but then you started to get tired,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.230
so the amount of force you exerted on the
box got smaller and smaller the farther you dragged it.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.370
To calculate the work you did in that case,
you’d have to count up the amount of force

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.220
you applied over each tiny little bit of distance.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.180
And if you’ve watched our episodes on calculus,
then you know that there’s a faster way

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.140
to add together infinitely tiny increments:
integration.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.340
So, to find the work done by a varying force,
you just have to integrate that force relative

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.500
to the distance the object moved. Which would
look like this.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.920
But force-times-distance is only one of the
ways that physicists measure work.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.980
Because, you know how we just said that Joules are
the units of work?

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.450
Well, Joules are often used as the units for
something else: energy.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.950
And work uses the same units as energy,
because work is just a change in energy.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.200
It's what happens when an external force is applied
to a system and changes the energy of that system.

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.819
In fact, that’s one of the ways to define
energy -- it’s the ability to do work.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.200
There are all different kinds of energy, but in this episode, we’ll mainly be talking about two of them:

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.000
kinetic energy and potential energy.
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.970
When the box was resting on the ground, we’d
say that it had no kinetic energy.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.020
But once you applied a force and it started
moving, it did have kinetic energy.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.599
And the energy of the box changed, which means
that you did work on it.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.060
More specifically, the kinetic energy of an object is equal to half of its mass, times its velocity squared.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.459
If this looks familiar, that’s because it
comes from applying both Newton’s second

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.569
law and the kinematic equations to the idea
that work is equal to force times distance.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.019
So, if the box had a mass of 20 kilograms,
and at some point while you were dragging

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.690
it, it reached a velocity of 4 meters per
second, we’d say that its kinetic energy

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.070
at that moment was 160 Joules.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.430
Then there’s potential energy, which actually
isn’t what it sounds like.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.210
Potential energy isn’t potentially energy
-- it’s potentially work.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.180
In other words, potential energy is energy
that could be used to do work.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.680
One common type of potential energy is gravitational
potential energy -

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.880
- basically, the potential energy that comes
from the fact that gravity exists.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.300
If I hold this book a meter above the ground,
we’d say that it has gravitational potential energy.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.700
Because if you let it go, then gravity is
going to do work on the book.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.800
Gravity exerted a force that moves it to the ground.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.180
Once the book hits the ground, though, we’d
say that its gravitational potential energy

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.140
is zero, because gravity can’t do work on
it anymore.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.900
Calculating gravitational potential energy
is easy enough:

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.880
it’s just the force of gravity on the object
-- so, the object’s mass times small g --

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.600
multiplied by the object’s height.
Or mgh for short.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.880
Which means that, just by knowing that this
book’s mass is about a kilogram, and that

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.550
it’s a meter above the ground, we can calculate
its potential energy: which is 9.8 Joules.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.860
Another type of potential energy that shows
up a lot is spring potential energy.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.260
Despite its name, this is not a seasonal thing --
and yes, I really made that joke.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.000
Rather, it’s the type of potential energy that’s
specific to springs!

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.580
The force of a spring is equal to the distance
by which it’s either compressed or stretched,

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.419
times a constant that we write as k.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:48.600
This equation is known as Hooke’s law, after British physicist Robert Hooke, who came up with it in 1660.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.199
Now, the constant, k -- also called the spring
constant -- is different for each spring,

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.260
and it’s a measure of the spring’s stiffness.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.760
And the equation makes total sense, if you
think about it:

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.560
The further you push on the spring, and the
stiffer it is, the harder it will resist.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.440
You even can test this out for yourself by taking apart a clicky pen and playing with the spring inside.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.360
By combining Hooke’s law, with the idea
that work equals force times distance,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.540
we can find the potential energy from a spring:

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.720
it’s half times k times the distance squared.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.900
For example: if you have a spring with a spring
constant of 200 Newtons per meter, and a block

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:26.360
is compressing it by half a meter, then the
potential energy of the block would be 25 Joules.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.440
So, when something does work on a system,
its energy changes.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.389
But how that energy changes depends on the
system.

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:35.750
Some systems can lose energy. These are known
as a non-conservative systems.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.650
Now, that doesn’t mean that the energy that’s
lost is literally disappearing from the universe...

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.000
And it doesn’t have anything to do with
the system’s personal politics, either.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.780
It just relates to one of the most
fundamental principles of science:

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.479
that energy can neither be created or destroyed.

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.179
But systems can lose energy, like when friction
from the box dragging on the floor generates heat.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.020
For non-conservative systems, you can still talk about their kinetic energy or potential energy at any given moment.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.120
But conservative systems let you do much more
than that.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.580
A conservative system is one that doesn’t
lose energy through work.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.360
Say, a simple pendulum.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.860
When the pendulum is at the top of its swing,
it stops moving for a brief moment as it changes direction --

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.700
meaning that its kinetic energy, at that point, is zero.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.210
But it has lots of potential energy, because
the gravitational force can do work on the

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.949
pendulum, pulling it down until it reaches
the bottom of its swing.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.529
At the bottom of the swing, that potential
energy becomes zero,

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.140
because gravity can’t pull the pendulum down anymore.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.120
But now the pendulum has lots of kinetic energy,
because it’s moving through the swing.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.460
And it turns out that, at any given point
in the pendulum’s motion, its kinetic energy

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.449
and its potential energy will add up to the
same number.

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:46.369
If its potential energy increases? Its kinetic energy will decrease by the exact same amount, and vice versa.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.180
So, now that we know how to define work, we
can use that definition to help explain another

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.380
common term that physicists have a very specific meaning for: power.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.760
Or, more specifically, average power.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.420
Average power is defined as work over
time, and it’s measured in Watts,

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.080
which is just another way of saying Joules per second.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.580
Basically, it’s used to measure how much energy is converted from one type to another over time.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.400
So, remember that box you were pulling?

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.380
We figured out that you did 250 Joules of
work on the box when you moved it 5 meters.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.289
If it took you 2 seconds to move the box,
then your average power output was 125 Watts.

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:21.900
You’re basically a lightbulb!

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.189
Now, we can also describe power in another
way, by putting two different facts together:

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:29.169
One, that work is equal to force times distance.

00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:32.760
And two, that average velocity is equal to
distance over time

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:38.320
Knowing this, we can say that power is the net force applied to something with a particular average velocity.

00:08:38.329 --> 00:08:43.860
If you moved the box 5 meters in 2 seconds,
then its average velocity was 2.5 meters per second.

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.140
And we already said that you were pulling
the box along with a force of 50 Newtons.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.300
So, the force you were using to pull the box,
times the box’s average velocity, would

00:08:51.309 --> 00:08:54.929
also give you an average power output of 125
Watts.

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:59.280
The two equations for average power are
really describing the same relationship;

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.340
they’re just using different qualities to do it.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:05.440
We’re going to be talking about power a
lot when we discuss electricity in later episodes.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.779
It’s the best way to calculate how
energy moves around in a circuit.

00:09:08.779 --> 00:09:12.099
But that’s a story for another day. For
now, our work is done.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.340
Today, you learned the two equations we can use to describe work, and that energy is the ability to do work.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.110
We also talked about kinetic and potential
energy,

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.660
and how they play into non-conservative and
conservative systems.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.410
Finally, we found two different equations
for power.

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.540
