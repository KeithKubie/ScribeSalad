00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.100
Running a marathon is tough.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:09.540
But what about running one in space?

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.170
But how hard can that be?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.610
Hello moon walkers, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.820
Astronauts in space live in a whole different
world.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.970
And one of the biggest differences, besides
probably the lack of oxygen, is the lack of

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.970
gravity.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.380
Thanks to this we have some pretty cool images
of suspended water bubbles and astronauts

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.630
walking on the ceilings of space shuttles.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.120
But, the microgravity present in space also
poses some challenges - namely, the impact

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.239
it has on an astronaut's body.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.020
We don’t really notice, because we’ve
habituated, but on planet earth, our body

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.210
is constantly working out.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.239
Gravity pulls us down and our muscles and
bones must resist that tension to keep us

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.730
upright and moving - sorta like mini workouts.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.139
But, in space, this tension virtually disappears.

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:59.359
Which is really bad, because muscles can atrophy
and bones can lose density.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.690
Just like muscles, bones are living tissues
that need exercise to stay healthy.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.000
This is why on average NASA astronauts spend
2.5hrs per day working out in space.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.470
But it looks a bit different from what we
see here on earth.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.450
Pushups, jumping jacks, running, or anything
really that doesn’t involve equipment, just

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.610
doesn’t work for them.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.330
They use special exercise machines.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.710
The three main ones at the International Space
Station are the Colbert, Cevis, and Ared.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.310
The Colbert, named after this guy, is actually
short for Combined Operational Load Bearing

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.930
External Resistance Treadmill.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.460
It is basically a treadmill but astronauts
must be harnessed in place.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.060
The Cevis or Cycle Ergometer with Vibration
Isolations and Stabilization System is like

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.350
a bicycle, but because without gravity you
can’t sit down, astronauts stand and strap

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.800
their feet to pedals.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.170
Lastly, the ARED or Advanced Resistive Exercise
Device resembles a weight training machine

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.170
which can be used for things like deadlifts,
calf raises and squats through a piston-driven

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.740
vacuum cylinder and flywheel system.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.060
All of these modifications are necessary because
objects lack any weight and regular lifting

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.620
would be way too easy.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.319
So does this mean all regular exercise is
easier in space?

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.839
Not, exactly.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:15.881
Zero gravity does mean that the lack of resistance
might make it easier for astronauts to lift

00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:18.480
things that would weigh hundreds of pounds
on earth.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.180
But here’s the thing.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.799
While in space your body fluids, sort of just
float all around your body.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.129
Without gravity there is nothing to pull blood
down below the heart to your legs and toes.

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.049
The vast majority of blood just hangs out
around the heart and head.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.489
So astronauts have less plasma and red blood
cells to carry oxygen to their muscles.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.439
This is a problem for things like running
or burpees because the lack of oxygen can

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.469
cause dizziness, and therefore impede performance.

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:49.910
Still, despite the hours spent working out
everyday with specialized equipment, astronauts

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.609
bodies take a toll.

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.340
On average, NASA reports that they suffer
decreases of 11 to 17% of their muscular strength

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.900
and about 10% of their muscle endurance.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.919
Their bone density also tends to decrease
about 2 to 7%.

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:09.299
And according to an International Space Station
scientist, about 80% report feeling lightheaded

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.430
shortly after returning to earth.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.590
This is largely why scientists have multiple
studies underway to figure out how to improve

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:43.340
exercise in space and diminish the negative
health effects 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.189
of spaceflight.
