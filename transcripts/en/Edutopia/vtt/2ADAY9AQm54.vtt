00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:03.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Put your hand up if someone
in your family comes from somewhere else

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:06.166
in the world and has
come to live in London.

00:00:07.056 --> 00:00:09.266
Could you turn to the person next to you

00:00:09.386 --> 00:00:10.976
and have a discussion
about this talking point?

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:14.816
&gt;&gt;Student: I think Stratford
is a better place to live

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:17.166
because they're not against
anyone and it's--

00:00:17.166 --> 00:00:18.796
&gt;&gt;Student: Can I just clarify you?

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:20.706
What do you mean by, like, against?

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:22.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Oracy is the
keystone to everything

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:25.606
that happens in the curriculum.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:28.926
There are such high expectations
for talk

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:32.706
and it does really make a difference
in the children, how articulate

00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:33.976
and how confident they are.

00:00:41.046 --> 00:00:43.296
&gt;&gt;Peter: The vision of School Twenty-One
is to prepare young people for the world

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:45.136
that they're going to go into
in the twenty-first century.

00:00:45.686 --> 00:00:49.636
I think one of the biggest barriers to
the students we serve really getting

00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:53.086
on in life is lack of
good communication skills.

00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:58.976
We need to elevate speaking to the
same level as reading and writing.

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:00.356
&gt;&gt;Milo: So we have a vote.

00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:04.466
&gt;&gt;What makes me enjoy talking the most
is that everybody's listening to you

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:09.606
and you're like, part of the world,
and you feel respected and important.

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:13.826
&gt;&gt;Alexia: When I'm talking, they're
listening to what I'm saying,

00:01:13.826 --> 00:01:18.816
and sometimes they give me questions,
or then maybe I give them questions.

00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:23.726
&gt;&gt;Beccy: Every child within this school
is expected to speak in every lesson,

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:27.796
in every opportunity throughout their
school day, and try and create lots

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:31.746
of different context for young people
to hone their skills as speakers.

00:01:32.136 --> 00:01:37.096
&gt;&gt;Amy: So what I want us to do now is
have a discussion about different kinds

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.046
of culture, and I want
us to discuss this:

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:42.236
some cultures are better than others.

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:45.816
&gt;&gt;I think every teacher, if you say to
them, "Do you talk in your classroom?"

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:47.436
of course they're talking
in their classroom.

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:50.286
But what's different here
is the deliberateness of it.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:53.106
&gt;&gt;Beccy: Every teacher needs
to have that toolkit of things

00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:56.506
that they can draw on to bring
effective talk into their practices.

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.616
&gt;&gt;Amy: We've done a lot of
work introducing sentence stems

00:01:59.656 --> 00:02:03.036
that children can use for different
situations, so for agreeing

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:07.556
with somebody, for disagreeing politely
with someone, for challenging someone.

00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:10.976
&gt;&gt;And while we're doing that, I want
you to make sure that you're using some

00:02:10.976 --> 00:02:15.806
of the sentence stems, so you might say,
linking to someone's points or build

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:18.846
on something that somebody has said.

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:23.436
&gt;&gt;Student: Building on there,
I agree, because maybe--

00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:24.726
&gt;&gt;Amy: The thing that's
had the biggest impact

00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:27.866
on my practice is probably
discussion guidelines.

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:33.046
&gt;&gt;We are going to be discussing
why beliefs were important,

00:02:33.176 --> 00:02:35.756
or why they weren't important
in ancient Greece.

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:39.566
Could anybody remind me about
any of our discussion guidelines?

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:44.106
&gt;&gt;Student: One of them is when
someone's not contributing,

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:48.856
you have to invite them by asking
them a question, or saying their name.

00:02:48.996 --> 00:02:51.126
&gt;&gt;Amy: Excellent, why
would you do that, Aram?

00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:53.136
&gt;&gt;Student: Then everyone has an idea.

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.456
&gt;&gt;Amy: Everyone gets to
share their idea, don't they.

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:55.836
Well done.

00:02:55.836 --> 00:02:59.366
&gt;&gt;So discussion guidelines were created
in conjunction with the children.

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:01.266
These are the five of six key things

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:02.956
that we think make a
really good discussion.

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:06.986
I've been able to take a step back
and I think that the children take

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:09.976
on a larger role within the classroom.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:11.916
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it
should be Ares and Athena,

00:03:11.916 --> 00:03:13.176
because they're both the god of war.

00:03:13.466 --> 00:03:17.026
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, but to challenge you
Debar, there are lots of fishermen--

00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:20.406
&gt;&gt;Amy: So another key way of
promoting oracy in the classroom is

00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:22.956
to think carefully about
the groupings that you use.

00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:25.766
So whether you're getting
them to talk in pairs

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:27.506
or in trios, or in larger groups.

00:03:27.816 --> 00:03:30.556
&gt;&gt;Beccy: Sometimes it's best
to have students in threes.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:34.506
Sometimes we look at how they can stand
in the traverse, opposite each other.

00:03:34.836 --> 00:03:37.976
Each of those different
groupings enables a different type

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:38.936
of conversation.

00:03:43.296 --> 00:03:43.756
&gt;&gt;Students: If you see inside them,

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:44.766
we're all human beings
and we're all people.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.376
&gt;&gt;Beccy: Our oracy program
is comprehensive.

00:03:46.376 --> 00:03:49.326
It has to be seen in maths
and science and those subjects

00:03:49.326 --> 00:03:51.396
that traditionally haven't
had a talk focus.

00:03:51.396 --> 00:03:53.696
&gt;&gt;Kate: There are twenty-four
cookies altogether.

00:03:53.906 --> 00:03:58.076
&gt;&gt;Students: There are
twenty-four cookies altogether.

00:03:58.076 --> 00:03:59.716
&gt;&gt;Kate: There are three children.

00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:00.236
&gt;&gt;Students: There are three children.

00:04:00.236 --> 00:04:02.956
&gt;&gt;Kate: Alright, let's see if Alexia--

00:04:04.206 --> 00:04:10.176
&gt;&gt;I would say that I'd always encouraged
talk in my maths lessons before,

00:04:10.846 --> 00:04:14.836
but what's changed is that I really
plan very carefully for talk,

00:04:14.836 --> 00:04:18.746
and also I structure the
talk very explicitly.

00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:21.506
&gt;&gt;Okay, so we're going to
go and do our talk task.

00:04:21.686 --> 00:04:26.336
&gt;&gt;The talk task, they get to practice
what they've done in the new learning,

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:29.346
and they're talking through
what they're doing.

00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:34.066
So it's about developing their
vocabulary and language of explanation.

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:35.786
&gt;&gt;Alexia: We were talking
about fractions.

00:04:35.786 --> 00:04:37.776
We'd done four circles,
and then we needed

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:38.976
to share twenty-four in each group.

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:41.726
&gt;&gt;One, two, three, four, fix, six.

00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:41.956
Your turn.

00:04:41.956 --> 00:04:44.396
&gt;&gt;We were using sentences to help us.

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:50.676
&gt;&gt;Students: Twenty-four shared equally
between four children is equal to six.

00:04:51.396 --> 00:04:52.976
&gt;&gt;Alexia: Let's do another one.

00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:57.756
&gt;&gt;Peter: There are lots of
different reasons why we get students

00:04:57.756 --> 00:04:59.026
who may not feel it's
almost their place to speak.

00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:02.666
So for all those reasons,
oracy is an issue of equality,

00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:04.956
of equity, of social mobility.

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:09.666
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Wow, I heard some pretty
amazing discussions going on just now.

00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:12.396
So let's get some feedback
from some groups.

00:05:12.586 --> 00:05:13.986
&gt;&gt;Beccy: Because of the focus on oracy,

00:05:14.236 --> 00:05:17.776
we've seen our students become
much more confident in their ideas.

00:05:18.296 --> 00:05:21.876
By creating the context and the
opportunities for them to speak,

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:25.556
they've just flown, and become
eloquent, engaging speakers.

00:05:25.606 --> 00:05:26.016
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Hayden?

00:05:26.386 --> 00:05:33.826
&gt;&gt;Hayden: We came to a decision and
said that we disagree with the text.

00:05:34.136 --> 00:05:37.246
Everyone is unique, everyone's the same,

00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:40.136
but they do their things
in different ways.
