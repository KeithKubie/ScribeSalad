&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.200
Welcome to The Kluge Center
here at The Library of Congress.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.220
The Kluge Center is right
through those doors over here,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.880
where we have at The Kluge
Center scholars in residence

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.310
at both the postdoctoral level,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.290
as well as more established
scholars, such as Ivan Krastev

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.940
who is our Chairman of
the panel here today.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.130
I'm John Haskell, the
Director of The Kluge Center.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.410
This panel is part of
a series that we do

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.260
that we call Conversations
on the State of Democracy,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.150
and we're very glad you're here.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.050
Avail yourself of the sodas
and the water and snacks,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.920
and I think we're in for
a very interesting panel.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.540
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about how Ivan fits in here.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.890
As you can see from
our materials,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.990
he's the Kissinger Chair
in International Relations

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:06.730
and Foreign Policy here
at The Kluge Center.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.810
He is the seventeenth
holder of that position.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.180
The Kissinger Program
was originated by friends

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.800
of Henry Kissinger back at the
beginning of The Kluge Center

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.450
in 2000 and they endowed a
Chair for which we are grateful.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.270
If you don't have a sense,
I know many of you are here

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.280
because you do have a
sense of Mr. Krastev

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.750
and the other panelists,
but I want to make it clear

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.730
that whenever I talk
about the fact

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.040
that The Kluge Center has
Ivan here for a couple

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.260
of months this year and a couple
more months next year people

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.200
are impressed.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.290
He is known as perhaps
the authority on populism

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.610
and liberal democracy in Europe
and Russia, so he's here,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.000
he's set-up this panel,
and I'm just going

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.340
to tell you a little
bit more about him.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.540
He is the Chairman of the Center
for Liberal Studies in Sofia,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.960
Bulgaria and the permanent
Fellow of the Institute

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.540
for Human Sciences, IWM, Vienna.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.830
Ivan is going to lead a
conversation with the panelists

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.270
and then there'll
be an opportunity

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.570
for questions from you.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.870
Take it away.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.610
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Thank you very much.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.760
One of the most beautiful things

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.690
that Kissinger has ever said
is he said when people say

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.910
that they don't need
introduction don't do this

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.220
to them because they
take part in these things

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.840
for the pleasure of
being introduced.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.350
So, of course, I'm not
as kind of spectacular

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.030
as this introduction was, but
it was a really great privilege

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.160
to be here and only somebody
who has not been part

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.360
of The Kluge Center doesn't
know how beautiful it is.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.970
The people that you see on the
panel and some of the people

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.190
that you see in the room are
part of a strange project

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.450
that we started two
or three years ago,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.610
and I'm basically going
to introduce it in order

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.150
to understand why we're
here and what we are doing.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.930
There is a famous story
saying that the actor,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.420
the Hollywood kind of megastar,
Cary Grant, once was invited

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.350
to a charity cocktail
in Hollywood,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.240
but he has forgotten
his invitation.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.230
And there was this very
tough lady on the entrance,

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.750
and he said I should enter,
where is your invitation?

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.250
He said, sorry, I
have forgotten it,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.730
and she said, you cannot enter.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.800
And he said, but
I am Cary Grant.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.420
And she looked at him and said,
you don't look like Cary Grant.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.460
And he said, nobody
looks like Cary Grant.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.670
Ah. And this is quite important
because when we started one

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.510
of the things that we can
be very much interested

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.730
in was there was all this
talk about liberal order.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.280
The liberal order never looked

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.190
in the way basically this
course can be writing about it.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.390
Nobody looks like Cary Grant.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.430
But at the same time some years
ago when basically all the talk

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.760
about the crisis of liberal
order started we figured

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.480
out that this course on
the hypocrisy of the West

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.220
on the wild side, but
also the Western discourse

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.280
on the hypocrisy of
others is becoming the very

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.890
central discourse.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.920
And what is quite important
is that attacking somebody

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.790
for being hypocritical is
the way basically to attack

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.590
without offering an alternative.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.650
You are attacking all the
time people for standing

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.580
up to their own ideals or values

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.900
so you don't need basically
to do anything else.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.270
So then the Center for Liberal
Strategy was a great support

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.240
from the Robert Bush
Foundation, we decided to do one

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.700
of those projects that
people are not doing anymore.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.220
To connect the very
interesting group of people,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.380
a mixture of policymakers,
policy intellectuals, academics,

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.500
and we decided to visit four
countries in which the discourse

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.970
of hypocrisy is central

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.520
to the way they comment
on foreign policy.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.040
Russia, basically
very much talking

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.190
about the power revolutions
and to the native expansion.

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.020
Turkey, very much
centering on the relations

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.520
with the European Union.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.670
Iran, because of
the nuclear deal.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.010
And also being interested
in Greece

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.620
because during the European
crisis there was a lot of talk

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.930
about the bailout plan and was
basically Brussels hypocritical

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.480
in the way it was
treating these countries.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.130
On the other side, the West
itself was very much kind

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.960
of unhappy with the hypocrisies
of the regimes which likes

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.570
to talk like democracies,
so liberal order

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.920
but at the same time
the deal was

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.850
that they had been
faking it all the time.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.020
So what we have been doing is
was a lot of serious meetings,

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.400
but I'm talking about
meetings, 30, 40 people,

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.080
and trying to cover the
whole political spectrum,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.260
members of government, both
Russia, Turkey around members

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.450
of the opposition,
academic think tanks.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.700
And then we came here
because interestingly enough,

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.600
nevertheless that people
basically can be very critical

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.620
to what is happening
in the US when it comes

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.680
to foreign policy
there is one thing

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.200
that the current administration
cannot be accused of

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.150
and this is being hypocritical.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.140
In a certain way you
have a very strong talk

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.050
about interests only, most of
the policies are not justified

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.500
on a value level, and for
us the question was how much

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.030
words matter.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.410
And our starting assumption is

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:26.390
that policy is not simply
what governments do,

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.750
but also how they
justify their policies.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.510
And even one and the same
act of the government,

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.110
being justified differently
is a different policy.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.700
And this for us was a trite
way basically to make sense

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.370
of the transformation
of the world.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.330
So what we are going
to do, we're not going

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.430
to present what is
interesting about this project,

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.080
we're going to end
up with a report

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.140
with much more interesting was
to keep the diversity of views.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.400
When we talk about the crisis
of liberal order we are going

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.940
to present four different
points of view based

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.720
on the four different
types of a crisis.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.650
In a certain way everybody
talks about the crisis

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.800
of liberal order on
institutional level,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.590
value levels, but for every
person this is also the crisis

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.710
of certain contacts
that you know best.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.050
So I'm going to start
with Robert Cooper,

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.350
which is probably one

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.010
of the most legendary
European diplomats and author,

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:23.650
he wrote one of the classical
books of the self-understanding

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.180
of the way the European Union
was working throughout the

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.490
banking of nations.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.340
He has been the Foreign
Policy Advisor to Tommy Blair

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.400
and that he left because he was
not supporting the war in Iraq

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.630
and he was the Foreign
Policy Advisor

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.360
to Javier Salona [assumed
spelling] and then

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.660
to Crattie Ashton
[assumed spelling].

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.080
And from this point of view he
and his view of BREXIT is going

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.450
to be the first thing
of the way we are trying

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.480
to introduce how
there is the kind

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.440
of a local crisis we are
experiencing, what is changing.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.740
Robert?

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.040
&gt;&gt; Robert Cooper: Right.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.340
Thank you.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:04.280
So I'm going to say a few words
about where BREXIT came from,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.000
about the referendum campaign
and about the consequence

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.600
of the UK leaving
the European Union

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.230
for the International Order.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.990
First of all, where
did it come from?

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.650
Well, I'd be quite honest
because I'm not paid

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.280
by anybody so I say what I like.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.610
It came from the
Conservative Party.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.490
Conservative Party had a
problem, it had a problem

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:33.590
for a long time with
the European Union,

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:35.890
and it became quite serious for
David Cameron [assumed spelling]

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:42.320
and he decided to go above the
Party by having a referendum.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.870
Actually, Harold Wilson did the
same thing back in the 1970s

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.240
with a different result.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.620
And so the Conservative
Party is a kind

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.770
of institution in
long-term decline.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.350
It used to have three
million members

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.960
and now it's somewhere
below 100,000,

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.990
so it's actually a increasingly
pathetic organization,

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.410
but it's one of the two
increasingly pathetic

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.330
organizations that runs
our country in Britain.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.940
And David Cameron used
to go around saying,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:16.560
the people of Britain are
demanding a say on Europe.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.590
Actually, the people of
Britain didn't care that much,

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.210
they were interested in
education, in housing,

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.880
they were wondering why their
salaries would remain static

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.310
whereas those of the bankers

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.300
who had ruined the
country were racing ahead.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.510
They were wondering about
all those normal things,

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.990
they weren't that problemed with
the European Union, however,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.930
they then held the
referendum campaign

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.090
and everybody became bothered
with it and have never ceased

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.390
to be bothered with
it ever since.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.740
It's the way in which you may
be friends when you start a war

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.520
with a country, but by the
end of the war it's guaranteed

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.820
that you've got enemies.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.380
And so the referendum
created the problem,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.530
it didn't solve the problem
for the Conservative Party,

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.770
but it transferred the
problem to a higher level.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.110
And instead of ruining the
Conservative Party they decided

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.680
to ruin the whole country.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.510
That's the kind of
proximate cause

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.270
of the referendum
was the problem

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.680
in the Conservative Party.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.880
The longer run cause
was a general failure

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.090
of the government and
all responsible people

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.460
to explain the European
Union properly.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:38.310
Now it's very difficult, it
has become increasingly visible

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.720
because this is a very
complicated gigantic

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.710
in a way enterprise
and institution,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.310
and actually what's
happening now it makes clear

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.920
that almost nobody
understands it completely.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.840
I worked there for 10 years and
I discover new things every day

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.500
that I didn't know about it.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.330
About like, for example,
that if Britain leaves

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.000
without an agreement
the airports will close

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.370
because no planes will have air
worthiness because they come

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.690
from the European Union.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.630
Thousands of things
like that will stop.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:18.910
It's a sort of, it's hidden,
but it's much more important

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.730
than anyone understands.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.520
So it was out of the
Conservative Party's problem

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.820
and general ignorance.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:34.070
And then the referendum campaign
made extraordinarily good use

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.200
of the ignorance, indeed,
it used the ignorance

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.990
by telling an enormous amount
of people wanted to leave,

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.000
telling an enormous
amount of lies.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.510
Very direct, visible,
traceable lies,

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.060
but they got away with them.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.210
Even government ministers
demonstrated

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:50.250
that they didn't know
about the European Union,

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.590
and people didn't know sort

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.260
of as usual there was
an immigration element,

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.560
what role is foreigner,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.570
particularly what role is
European foreigners doing here?

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.200
And people thought
several things

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.170
about the European immigrants,
and Britain is full of them,

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.800
this makes London
much more colorful.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:18.920
They thought that these people
were responsible for the decline

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.930
in the social services
because they were arriving

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.460
and making use of
the social services,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.800
which they hadn't paid for.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.540
It's not true, actually the
immigrants were mostly young

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.210
people, they were healthy,

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.150
they didn't use the
healthcare system,

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.780
they were not contributors

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.050
to the social services,
so that wasn't true.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:44.500
Another bit of ignorance,
you ask people in Britain

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.080
where does foreign investment
come from in Britain?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:54.400
And they'll tell you, well,
about they say I think,

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.440
they normally guess that
about 30% comes from the EU,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:03.750
that's a mistake, it's
actually 63% comes from the EU.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.230
They think about 30%
probably comes from the USA,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.770
that's wrong, it's actually 17%.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:15.860
They think that --
no, sorry, it's 23% --

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:21.310
they think that 17% comes from
China, the answer is it's less

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.170
than 1% comes from China.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:28.640
Overwhelmingly investment in
Britain that's foreign comes

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.190
from the EU, and that
means that supply chains go

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.060
across national boundaries,
having no customs controls

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.300
and things like that, having
completely open market

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.150
for the EU is absolutely
essential

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.670
for the British economy.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:52.850
So the campaign was
full of lies.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.180
And the campaign also took
place at a rather unlucky moment

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.480
because of complaints
about immigration,

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.050
which were mostly not
justified, but this took place

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:07.090
at the moment when there was
a vast migration crisis going

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.780
on in the eastern Mediterranean

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.530
as a consequence
of the Syrian war.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.710
Migration crisis was nowhere
near Europe, but it was all

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.630
over the TV screens, so that
was another bit of bad luck.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.060
And then there was a bit
of sloppiness on the part

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.040
of the government in the way

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.010
in which the referendum
was organized,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.470
but I leave that aside.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:28.790
Now what about the
consequences of BREXIT?

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.820
Assuming if it's going to
happen, I assume that it's going

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.400
to happen, although I'm
not absolutely certain

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.090
because I had never seen
such chaos in Britain before.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:43.160
Anything is possible at the
moment, but the likely result is

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.660
that the UK leaves, that will
leave the UK isolated, weakened,

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:52.520
impoverished, but actually
is bad for the liberal order

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.010
because the UK is
a liberal country

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:58.090
and it's played a useful
role in what I think

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.270
of as the liberal order,
which is essentially NATO

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:03.590
and the European Union
and then you've got one

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:07.180
or two slightly less
important add-ons, like the IMF

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.610
and the WPO and the UN, which
doesn't function that well,

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:17.240
but basically the West
is the liberal order.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.200
And the UK isolated, angry,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.240
quarreling with its
neighbors is not a good thing

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.540
for liberal order.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.470
And then a final remark on
what is the liberal order?

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.770
I think another definition

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:29.870
for the liberal order is
it's what's brought us peace

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:35.000
for 70 years in all
kinds of different forms.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.620
NATO, and when I think of NATO
bringing peace I'm thinking

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:45.060
of the cold war, but not just of
the cold war, peace between East

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.580
and West, I'm thinking
of peace within Europe.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:56.560
The fact that before NATO
every country in Europe looked

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.240
at their military and
compared it with the military

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.390
of their neighbor,
and Britain used

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.220
to run something called
the two Navy standard.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.140
We wanted to have a
Navy that was equal

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:10.980
to the next two countries.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.360
Sometime the end of the 19th
Century we stopped counting the

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.950
USA because we knew
we couldn't compete,

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.170
but so everybody compared
themselves to their neighbors.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.610
Under NATO nobody does
that unless they complain

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.200
about the Germans not
spending enough on defense.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.770
So NATO is a powerful part
of what has brought peace

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.370
for 70 years and
the European Union.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.360
There are two ways of
making, of having peace.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.800
One is to be very powerful,
balance of power to the left.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.130
The other is to have
good political relations

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.430
with your neighbors.

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:46.430
And the European
Union is intended

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.910
and systematically does that.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.590
Now people will tell
you today, well, peace,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.600
who cares, that's all old hat.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.830
Now I was sort of
brought up with Joan Baez,

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:05.230
so I take this more seriously,
but actually what people

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:12.300
in Britain forget is that we had
a low intensity war which went

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:16.480
on for 20 years or
more in Ireland

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.950
and we do have a land border.

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.780
We think we're an island, but
we don't, we have a land border

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.070
with the Republic of Ireland.

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:25.550
And a condition of
the peace settlement

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:31.040
in Ireland is called the Good
Friday Agreement by most of us

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.290
and in Northern Ireland
called the Belfast Agreement,

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.790
always a bad sign that when
they have different names

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.220
for the same thing.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:44.390
But the background condition
of that was membership

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.150
of the European Union, that
you didn't need to have,

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.880
on the one hand that you didn't
need to have a border in Ireland

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.550
so that those who
wished to could live

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:58.490
in the united Ireland as,
indeed, in morph if you wished

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.090
to you could have a
Republic of Ireland passport,

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:05.180
but that's very important.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.590
And I can develop
a scenario in which

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:13.910
if you recreate the border you
can recreate what they called

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:16.960
the troubles, but which was
actually a low intensity war.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.390
It's perfectly possible.

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:23.610
the second way in which the
European Union helped end the

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:29.990
war in Ireland was it put Dublin
and London for the first time

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:35.050
in a community together where
they cooperated and dealt

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.870
with each other not as
a former colonial power,

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:42.860
the former colonial
victim, but as equals

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.980
and that was also
essential in the Irish peace.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.600
So when people tell you the
European Union is a peace

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.200
project it's not nonsense, and
the weird thing is that Britain,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.210
which is a primary beneficiary
of this, hasn't noticed it

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:00.320
until now, they still
don't understand it.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.580
They, I refer to my fellow
countrymen, I should say.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.910
so that's, I'm sorry,
there's much more to say

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.210
and I've gone too far.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.510
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Thank you very much.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.660
I was listening, and if I
remember rightly during the 20th

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:14.030
Century there is only one year

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:18.380
in which a British soldier
has not been killed in a small

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.500
or a big war outside of the
territory of the United Kingdom.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.080
And, by the way,
this year is 1968.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:30.900
But from Britain we are going
to move to the United States.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.750
And for most of us coming here
and we had a lot of meetings

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.180
for the last three days,

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.950
the biggest problem is you
have two kinds of schools

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:40.250
of thoughts in Europe today.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.960
There are people who are seeing
the changes in the United States

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:48.080
as kind of a car accident,
something happened,

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.690
there was a major kind
of accident in 2016,

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.570
but they are going to
return back to the normal

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.210
so we should wait for four,
eight, I don't know, 12 years

00:19:58.210 --> 00:20:01.040
and then basically everything
is going to be the way it was.

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:06.800
And there was a people who
said, and I'm much closer

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.730
to this school, is that the
current President didn't create

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:12.730
the wave, he's surfing on it.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.210
There was a major
transformation,

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.020
there was a certain type of
a foreign policy consensus

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.900
that did not fit to the
public consensus there,

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.050
there are certain changes
that are going to survive,

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.070
nevertheless, of who is
going to come to power.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.970
And from this point
of view for us one

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.470
of the most interesting
questions was what are these

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:32.710
changes, what are the
emerging consensuses

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.040
of the way the United States now
views the world, keeping close

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.720
with the fact that
it's not simply

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.680
about American foreign
policy but also

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.650
about very much polarized
domestic political space.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:46.720
And now I'll go to Rosa
Brooks here basically

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.060
to give her take
and how she sees it.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.140
&gt;&gt; Rosa Brooks: Goodness,
that's a tough task,

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:59.090
explaining American
politics and foreign policy.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:07.830
So, as Ivan said, this project
is about hypocrisy and the role,

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:11.230
negative and maybe
positive, that hypocrisy plays

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.070
in the discourse about the
liberal international order.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.290
And maybe I should
just start by saying

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.990
that not only is Donald
Trump not a hypocrite,

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:23.620
he may be many things, right, he
may be lying, he may be corrupt,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.800
he may care only about his own
interests, but partly for all

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.740
of those reasons it's hard
to call him a hypocrite.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.360
He doesn't pretend to be
anything other than what he is.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.900
I think the American people

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:40.030
and American policymakers are
also really hypocritical insofar

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:45.760
as hypocrisy implies, charges
of hypocrisy imply a level

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:52.120
of self-awareness and a
willingness to blink your eye

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.390
at contradictions and
self-serving behavior.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:59.670
I think that the flaw in
American foreign policy and,

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:02.030
indeed, American
internal politics is

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.110
that we are entirely capable

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.860
of fully believing multiple
contradictory things at once

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.210
and we tend to truly believe
all the contradictory things.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.850
I think that when it comes

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:16.070
to both the liberal
international order, itself,

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.910
and when it comes to
Americans' understandings

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.430
of our own country and our own
politics there are these central

00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.460
contradictions in it that
we have never resolved

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.740
and we have lived for 70
plus years telling ourselves

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:34.640
that perhaps we don't have
to resolve them and trying

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.940
to pretend that they
don't exist.

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:38.050
And here's what they
are, let me start

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:40.330
with the so-called liberal
international order, right?

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.790
Think about the contradictions
that are at the heart

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.390
of the UN charter system that
emerges after World War II.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:51.580
We have on the one
hand a profound

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.760
and quite revolutionary
commitment to the idea

00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:01.550
of universal rights, universal
rights possessed by individuals,

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:06.860
not by virtue of their belonging
to a particular state or group,

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.770
but simply by virtue
of being human.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.150
And from that notion of
individual human rights,

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.400
universal human rights that
everyone possesses simply

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.430
because they're human we get the
notion of self-determination,

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.120
which is of course an extension

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.550
of the deeply American
commitment

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:30.980
to democratic governance,
that individuals,

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.870
that governments have
legitimacy only insofar

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.360
as they rest upon the
consent of the individuals

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.680
that they are governing.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.900
So we have this commitment
to individual rights,

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:47.150
which leads us to commitment to
self-determination and arguably

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.340
to democratic forms
of governance and

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.220
yet at the same time of
course the UN charter, itself,

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.660
enshrines a commitment to
maintaining the status quo,

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:01.070
the post-World War II status
quo in all kinds of ways,

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.620
including maintaining the
states that emerge out of that,

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.930
maintaining the power
structure that emerges

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.920
out of World War II,
specifically looking

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:14.040
at the permanent members
of the UN Security Council

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.680
with their veto power and
so forth, and a commitment

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.410
to non-interference,
to non-intervention

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.910
that says states do not
get to and are prohibited

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:29.560
from intervening in the
internal affairs of one another.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.850
So that's, and the trouble is

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.980
of course those two things don't
actually fit very well together.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:40.390
If you posit that
individuals have rights

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:45.180
to self-determination and to
free expression and to all sorts

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.920
of other things and
you posit that states

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.700
and international organizations,
such as the United Nations,

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.770
have a responsibility to
protect and defend the rights

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:58.380
of individuals and the
aspirations of peoples,

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.970
and then you also say, oh, but
by the way you can't interfere

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.010
in the status quo and by
the way a system which says

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:07.760
that five states have
permanent veto power

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.390
in the Security Council not

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.480
because a democracy
chose those states,

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.550
not because they have the
majority of the people,

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.600
but simply because,
because, just because.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:21.290
You can't sustain that,
there's no possible way

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.790
to square those things
completely, and so you have

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.530
to either pretend the
contradiction doesn't exist,

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:31.550
or in contrast to
hypocrisy I think, as I said,

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.720
the American failing
is to manage

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.590
to maintain a very high
level of cognitive dissonance

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.010
in which you just have
two separate little boxes

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:40.310
in your head.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.590
You have one box that says
commitment to individual rights

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.740
and self-determination and
democracy, and another box

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.710
that is a much more realist
kind of box, you know,

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.280
in international relations terms

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.100
that box says leave well
enough alone, power matters,

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.250
historical structure matters,

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:01.960
sorry stability trumps
individual rights

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.670
and universalist aspirations
all the time and you have

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:07.690
to keep those in
two separate boxes.

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.530
And so when you're talking
about one you mean it,

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.480
and when you're talking
about the other you mean it,

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:16.520
and if you're American you
keep those boxes so separate

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.820
that you don't actually have

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.200
to be confronted
with the difference.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.750
If you're not American you're
far more inclined to say, hey,

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:25.220
wait a second, you know, hold
on, how can you believe both

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.550
of those things at once?

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.770
To which the answer is that
again unless you're very good

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.970
at cognitive dissonance you
can't, and I think the roots

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:36.230
that tension gives rise around
the globe to a tremendous amount

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:40.110
of anger, to charges
of hypocrisy and so on.

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:43.480
When it comes to
American internal politics

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.360
in many ways we remain a country
that ourselves are sort of torn

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.780
between those two impulses,

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.320
the impulse towards saying
every individual matters,

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.850
it's individual rights that
matter, and the impulse to say,

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:58.340
no, it's power and
concentrations of power

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.980
that matter more and
stability matters more.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.880
And I think that in some ways
when we look at the election

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.800
of 2016, when we
look at what's going

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.390
on in the US right now we're
very much seeing a conflict

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.930
between a vision of
America that is very much

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:18.010
about the protection of rights
and universalist principles

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:22.080
versus a discourse that says,
nope, nope, it's about power,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.940
it's about stability, it's about
protecting the prerogatives

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.470
of those who either hold power
and want to keep it or used

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.400
to hold power, have
recently lost it

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.370
and would like to have it back.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.900
And I do think that a lot of
the support for the election

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.680
of President Trump has come
from that sort of second,

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.090
that latter group, who are
saying it's about power

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:46.660
and who keeps it
and whether those

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.800
who lost it recently
can get it back again.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.570
There, too, you know I
don't think it's so much

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:56.270
about hypocrisy, but it's
about these competing visions

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.770
which most of us would
deny that we have,

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:02.680
and we deny that we have them,
we deny that they're competing.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.770
But I do think that they --

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:06.890
I'm not terribly
optimistic I should say

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.990
about either the US politics --

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.770
Ivan, you asked whether will
we revert to normal here

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:19.050
in the United States, will
this moment be a blip, you know

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.000
and in two years or in six years
we say, oh, well, that was kind

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.400
of strange but that's over
now, we go back to usual both

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.920
in the United States and
in terms of the UK figures

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.340
out the whole BREXIT thing,
we all revert to normal?

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.630
I doubt it, I think
it's not impossible

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.230
that that could happen,

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.360
that everyone could just agree
let's just delete the last four

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.660
years, six years, eight years,

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.530
whatever it will
have been by then.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:48.720
I think unfortunately somewhat
more likely, not inevitable

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.970
but more likely is that both
the international liberal order

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:57.950
and the American, the
particularly American experiment

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:03.200
in late empire democracy
both essentially crumble due

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.560
to their own internal
contradictions.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.970
What comes after if
the American experiment

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.500
in the liberal international
order crumble?

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.610
I don't think it's
anything very good, right?

00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:16.400
I don't see anybody kind of
waiting in the wings saying,

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.530
hey, we've got the
next great idea.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:22.060
I think that we are probably
due, unfortunately both

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:26.170
in this country and globally,
for one of those periods

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:30.050
that could last three or four
years and could last decades

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:37.130
or even centuries of back to
power politics, back to power

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.690
and force as primary means
of resolving disputes,

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.900
and it's not going to be,
it's not an era I feel good

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.990
about leaving to my children
and my grandchildren,

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.590
but that's I think the direction
in which we're heading.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.890
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Thank you very much.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.190
And, of course, Rosa
knows something

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:57.510
about this contradiction
because she's a famous,

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:00.650
also humorized professor,
who served in the Pentagon,

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:03.290
so she knows both worlds.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.540
But one of the things which for
us was quite interesting was

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.310
that people automatically
believed that the return

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.890
to great power politics
is a return to realism,

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:16.800
and this is something that
I'm personally questioning

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.360
and this is what
not you're seeing.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.220
This is in a way identity type
of a great power politics.

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.520
And Steven Walt [assumed
spelling],

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.800
one of the famous realists,
was part of the group.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.300
It is one thing with this type
of a highly politicized and kind

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.440
of changing the way
nation interest is defined.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.160
This very rational realism
view of foreign policy

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.660
in such a way it does
not look very convincing.

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.960
But Thomas Baggett
[assumed spelling],

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.100
who is the Foreign Policy
Advisor to the German President

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:49.190
and who is probably one of the
best known public intellectuals

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:51.190
in Germany when it
comes to foreign policy,

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.060
recently he said the end of
history was an American idea,

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.630
but European reality and
particularly German reality.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.160
And I'm going to say why
for Europeans this talk

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.070
about the change of
language appeared

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.840
to be much more important
than to anybody else.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.090
For the United States,
for Russia, for China,

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:13.300
for Turkey moving for a much
more liberal values colored

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.330
justification of
government acts.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:18.900
It is a problem of choice.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.420
European Union cannot
easily shift

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:25.840
to the national interest type of
justification of its policies.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.110
It's not a nation state.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.920
And, by the way, if you
see the nation states some

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.680
of these nation states
are very small.

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:35.710
I can easily understand
what it means for China

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.610
or for the United States
becoming protection is

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:40.650
nationalistic, but
you try to explain

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:44.500
to me how Bulgaria is going
to benefit from the world

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.780
in which everybody
goes this way.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.650
And from this point of view in
a certain way the German dilemma

00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:55.210
and the problem that Germany is
facing as a leading member state

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.640
in my view is one of the most
interesting, but also one

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.940
of the most challenging.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.110
So, Thomas?

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.030
&gt;&gt; Thomas Bagger: Yes, thank
you, Ivan, and thank you

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:07.370
to all of you for coming.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:12.120
I think, you know, when I
look back at the last 25,

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:15.630
30 years since the end of
the fall of, since the fall

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.770
of the wall, the end of the
cold war, which happened sort

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:29.600
of at half point in my life,
this was the most surprising,

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:34.490
the most unthinkable event
that I could possibly remember.

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:39.520
And I was in a US university
computer lab in College Park,

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.860
not very far from here, and
did my Masters Degree there

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:46.090
and this was sort of
before laptop time.

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:48.460
So we sat at this computer lab

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.110
and there were American students
coming in and they're saying,

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.690
telling and sort of saying
they're taking the wall down,

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.770
they're taking the wall down.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:59.680
And I thought they must
have gotten something wrong,

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.680
which wall are they
talking about?

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.560
Because even with all
the runup to November 9,

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:12.890
1989 it was out of my
imagination as a 24 year old

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.850
that this could actually
happen and be true.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.940
So it was, really it was
basically unthinkable.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:21.180
I had grown-up with
it, it was impossible.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:26.640
The most disruptive event that
I can think of in my lifetime.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.650
But when I think back
over these last 30 years

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.210
and what has happened
since it struck me

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:36.890
that from this most
nonlinear event

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:41.870
that you can imagine most
Germans have derived a

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:45.830
thoroughly linear expectation
of what was to follow,

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:49.640
and I don't think
there's another country

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.320
where Francis Fukuyama's
thesis of the end of history

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:58.370
after 1989 was as
popular as in Germany

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:04.250
because it somehow fit
our own expectations

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.270
and our hopes in many ways.

00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:11.980
You know, after having been on
the wrong side of history twice

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.700
in the 20th Century the
country finally found itself

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:20.240
on the right side of
history of stable democracy,

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.410
a market economy, and to say

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:26.190
that this is actually the
final destination of history

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.330
and now everybody else
would have to change

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:31.530
and essentially become like
us, but we had already arrived

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:37.050
at the destination, was
very appealing as a thought.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:42.120
And so I think this assumption
of a grand convergence

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.270
that would happen, first with
the transformation of central

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:47.760
and eastern Europe,
then with a wave

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.970
of democratization elsewhere,
but eventually everywhere,

00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:56.870
that was actually, that
was good and we would be

00:34:56.870 --> 00:35:00.430
at the center of it again.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:04.390
I think also that for a country
that had been burned so badly

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:09.890
by sort of charismatic idea
of leadership the notion

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:14.130
that personal agency didn't
really matter that much

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.210
because it, you know leaders
would basically just administer

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:20.840
the inevitable on a broader
flow of history that would lead

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.180
in a predetermined
direction, also had something

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:27.100
that was deeply appealing to
Germans much more so than,

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.090
I don't know, French
or Americans or others.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:36.100
And, finally, what happened
since where I grew-up

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.920
in West Germany, we were
sort of a frontline state

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:42.700
in the cold war, highly
militarized, including lots

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.600
of American troops,
nuclear weapons and the same

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.690
on the other side
from the Soviets,

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:55.630
with all of that disappearing
in the 1990s and the notion

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:56.930
that for the first time

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:00.400
in Germany's history the country
was surrounded only by friends,

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.440
it basically drove threat
perception down to zero.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:09.030
If we wouldn't meddle in other
people's affairs nobody would

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.370
meddle in ours,

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:16.210
and so essentially what was
left was a trading state, right?

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.660
So the limitations that had
been imposed in Germany one way

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:24.140
or another after World War II
suddenly seemed to transform us

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:30.070
into an avant-garde of history,
we were at the front of it

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.800
and if we considered
the European Union

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.100
to be the avant-garde

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.690
of integration globally
Germany was seen

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:39.160
as the avant-garde
within Europe.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.710
And I think, you know this is
sort of somewhat simplified

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:44.620
and not everybody shared that,

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.750
but I think it was a
pretty broad sentiment,

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.370
including in the foreign policy,
security policy community.

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:59.250
And it took us awhile because
in a way what this view

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:04.290
of the international order
did, of which we were a product

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:10.360
as the Federal Republic of
Germany created in 1949,

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:16.220
what it did was it took our
own peculiar German history

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.010
and allowed us to
universalize it.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.490
We took our own lessons
from history,

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:26.250
never again the holocaust
and, therefore, a strong focus

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:31.110
on human rights,
moving away from power,

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.960
moving towards what you
could call a judicialization

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.340
of international politics.

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:39.830
So you move away from power
to sort of rule of law system,

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.860
also in the international order,

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.810
through international
institutions,

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.360
through the creation of
an international court,

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.940
international criminal
court in 1998

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:57.250
that would have jurisdiction
not just for war crimes,

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.810
but crimes against humanity,

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.990
state aggression
and these things.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:05.430
But this was a path that
sort of perfectly conformed

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:09.230
to our preferences, but also
to our historical lessons.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.580
And so we could universalize
the rather difficult,

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.370
peculiar German history.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:20.410
And this feeling, this
sense of being in sync

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:27.070
with history started to
crumble I think really in 2014,

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.550
and there was, if you go back
now you can see the signs

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:33.520
on the wall earlier, of
course, but the real,

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.720
the actual that it hit
home I think the invasion

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.670
and annexation of Crimea
and the Russian aggression

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.910
in Eastern Ukraine and
the Donbas was the sign

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:49.300
that the happy days
of post-wall Europe

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:52.010
and international
order were really over.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:56.330
And then suddenly once you
realized that you also realized

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:59.480
that Russia had already
years before begun

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:02.460
to define its own future,
actually more in opposition

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.070
to the West, and no
longer in cooperation

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.410
or on a path of convergence.

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:09.750
And at the same it was
actually also true for China

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.280
under the new President
Xi Jinping

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:17.730
who would still modernize, still
grow, but not open, rather close

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.510
and become more repressive.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:25.400
And there's sort of a far
more competitive element

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:30.060
in the international system
than we'd like to believe.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:36.180
But these were still all
outside pressures and datapoints

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:39.930
that signaled the problem.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:45.040
I think 2016, first
with the BREXIT and then

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.500
with the election
of the US President,

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.690
represented a different
dimension.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:58.110
I mean the BREXIT decision ran
directly counter to the notion

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.280
that the process of integration
in Europe had something

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.120
that was irreversible,
that was sort of necessary,

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.080
that it conformed to
a historical pattern

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.290
of ever deeper integration.

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:16.140
And the British said, oh, we
can actually turn-off and go off

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.850
in the opposite direction, which
is a serious blow for Europe

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:24.200
but also a serious blow to
the way we Germans looked

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.280
at Europe and Europe's future.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.250
And with the election of an
American President who would go

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:35.160
out in public, he and his top
advisors, and say there is no

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.560
such thing as an international
community, everybody is

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:44.270
out there for him or herself,
to look after him or herself,

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.310
that ran directly counter

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:51.310
to the second grand German
lesson of never alone.

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:54.490
So, as Ivan said, there are
other countries who can go back

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:58.780
to a more national
conception of their own country

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.500
in the international system.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.410
You know, the French have their
goalist tradition of France

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:09.480
and the world that looks
after itself, but for Germany

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.190
that doesn't really
exist anymore

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.290
because all these more national
conceptions have all been

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.360
contaminated in the Nazi years
and they now basically belong

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.610
to the political fringes in
Germany's political system

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:26.970
for all the mainstream parties,
all those centrous parties.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:32.260
There is nothing but a
multilateralist foreign policy

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:38.290
that looks at Germany's future
always linked to its neighbors,

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:44.530
but limited but also
legitimized in organizations

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:46.720
that include partners.

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:51.230
And that is why I would say
there's no other country

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:56.840
that I could think of that is
as challenged by the world view

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:00.240
as it is articulated by
the current US President

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:04.790
as is Germany, that in itself
looks at itself so much

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.930
as an American post-war
creation.

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:15.350
And this conceptual challenge
now to imagine the world

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:19.200
and our role in the world at
a moment when our own lessons

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.650
of history and the course

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.630
of the international political
system sort of diverge

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:27.620
after we thought they
would be, they would run

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:32.030
in parallel forever hopefully,
but certainly for longer

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:35.980
than it did is a pretty
painful situation in Germany

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.910
and it's just starting a
foreign policy debate of, well,

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.450
what is then Germany's
role and what should it do?

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.810
And most of that
points to Europe,

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:49.380
invest in the European
Union, invest in a network

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.080
of multilaterally
oriented nations,

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.970
and that is where
Ivan's point comes in.

00:42:57.970 --> 00:43:03.100
You can sort of a national
political system can survive a

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.120
populist challenge,

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:09.690
maybe sometimes a populist
government can even help to sort

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:14.490
of correct or redefine the
national political landscape,

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:21.570
the issues that are important,
and then sort of it moves on.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:26.530
It is quite difficult to imagine
the same for the European Union

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:32.570
because if you think of
it it is made up of 28

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:37.130
and once the British have
left 27 member states,

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:41.750
and it's working around
a table in Brussels

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.810
where all these countries
larger and smaller come together

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:49.850
and basically hammer out a
compromise that is, of course,

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:58.040
always imperfect but that
is based on the assumption

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:03.800
that in the longer term and if
you define national interests

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:10.140
in a wider perspective it is
beneficial to all of them.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:15.050
And if you narrow your
definition of national interest

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:20.130
and you shorten the time
horizon then what you do is you

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:25.390
basically close the space, the
space shrinks for compromise

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:29.490
around the Brussels table
until it disappears entirely.

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:33.490
Everyone is only looking
after his or her own interests

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:37.510
on this very day, on this very
issue that is on the table

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.110
and not considering that
you may need the partners

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:45.200
and their enlightened
self-interests the next day,

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.590
then there is no room for
compromise or it shrinks

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:52.760
to a degree where it makes the
European Union actually look

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:54.140
like a body that is not able

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:57.860
to produce any meaningful
solution for any real problem.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:02.600
So I think for me this
is it's really a question

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.710
of how you define
national interests,

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:08.930
there's a great expression
in Tocqueville's Democracy

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:14.880
in America where he talks of the
self-interest rightly understood

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.810
and I think you can
define self-interest

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:18.110
in very different ways.

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:22.950
And the Germans have learned
this lesson in a hard way

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:28.340
that we're better off today
and in this integrated Europe

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:33.490
than at any point in our history
before and it has something

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:37.160
to do with trying to define
our won self-interests in a way

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.440
that actually includes
the interests of neighbors

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.620
and partners and
others on the continent

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.990
and in taking a longer view.

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:48.490
And what puzzles us now
is that not just here

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:51.070
in the United States,
but also elsewhere

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.470
in the world national
interest is defined

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:58.120
in an increasingly narrow
and short-term perspective

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.490
and that leaves us
in a situation

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:06.630
where the solution we thought we
had found to the German problem

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.120
of being the biggest
country in the center

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:13.630
of the European Continent too
big to be just one among many,

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:19.080
but not big enough and strong
enough to rule all others,

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.160
that solution may not be as
permanent as we had hoped.

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.580
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Thank you very much.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:26.610
I do believe we are going
to have time to discuss it,

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:30.290
because some of the more
radical Euro skeptics are going

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:32.390
to ask questions like this.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:36.880
Yugoslavia did not manage to
survive the end of the cold war

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.310
because the very existence of
the state was very much embedded

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.110
in a certain type of
international context,

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:46.390
could European Union
become the major victim,

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:48.250
is it through disintegration
of the EU,

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:52.460
of the end of a liberal order
as an international environment?

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.460
And I do believe this is a
fair question and this is why

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.750
for us basically what
Europeans are asking about this,

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:03.940
this is in a way we're much
more nervous than many others.

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.220
But the interesting story
about liberal order was

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.530
that it was always about the
relations between states,

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:11.240
but also what is
happening within the states.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.000
And when people have
been very positive

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.510
on the liberal order
starting with the beginning

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:20.540
of the 21st Century one of the
critical countries was Turkey.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.390
Opening of Turkey was
critical for something

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:26.640
that is happening
simply between states,

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.940
but how the new relations

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:31.110
between states is starting
basically to change things.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:34.610
And we're going to
have basically the view

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.500
of what is happening,
the Turkish perspective

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.860
of these relations between the
foreign and domestic politics

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.580
and talking about one
of the key countries

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.910
that in a way also
symbolizes something

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:50.100
that can become problematic with
the crisis of the liberal order.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:54.820
And Solly Roselle [assumed
spelling] is the person

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.120
to say this.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.070
&gt;&gt; Solly Roselle: Well,
I prepared other notes,

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:01.770
but if you want me to talk
about those I'll talk.

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:03.110
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: This is
the problem with Turkey,

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:08.980
also as indicated, they
always prepare other notes.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.280
&gt;&gt; Solly Roselle: Yes, okay.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:15.340
I mean Turkey's behavior
today cannot be dissociated

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:19.020
with what has gone
in the past 30 years.

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.980
It's interesting, in eight
months' time it will be 30th

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:28.840
anniversary of Francis
Fukuyama's article published

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.390
in national interest.

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:36.220
And although Fukuyama wrote
a lot more and recently kind

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.980
of distanced himself from 30
years ago I guess he will always

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:46.300
be remembered or damned because
of the end of history article,

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:51.270
which of course ended like his
doctoral dissertation advisor

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:55.850
Huntington's article
with a question mark.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:58.710
And that question mark
of course we dismiss.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:04.230
And in a way for both of those
articles, that is end of history

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:09.610
and the clash of civilizations,
Turkey was a critical country

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:13.770
because it actually was
always and partially

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:15.070
because of the geography

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:20.430
on which it sat a
Janus-faced country.

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:24.100
And in a way Turkey also
showed a lot of adaptability

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:29.840
to the requirements of the new
order that was emerging in 1989,

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:37.280
wasted the 1990s, and then
almost reinvented itself.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:44.870
And I have to say that the
Clinton Administration was,

00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:49.880
mainly thanks to the
late Richard Holbrook,

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:56.530
understood Turkey's role and
actually pushed the country,

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:01.010
pushed the European Union and
pushed American foreign policy

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:06.660
to encourage Turkey to actually
play that, not the bridge role,

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:10.730
bridge in my judgment is
really the wrong metaphor

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:13.450
because bridges don't
belong anywhere,

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.060
but Turkey as a mediator,

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:19.370
a country that could
actually speak the language

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:22.260
of the three regions
that surround it.

00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:27.160
And what I call Turkey
surrounded or at the center

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:32.930
of what I call three
geopolitical ecosystems,

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:37.110
the European one, Russia,
central Asia caucus is one,

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:39.000
and of course the Middle East.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.460
Ecosystem in the Middle East
may not be fitting these days,

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.800
but still.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:49.130
And Turkey, to the extent
that Turkey could rise

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:53.440
to the occasion and
manage to actually mediate

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.680
between those three, then it
would have accomplished its role

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.040
and that is precisely almost

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.570
in so many words how
Richard Holbrook defined it

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:06.900
and the Clinton Administration
tried to push us

00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.210
and the Europeans
in that direction.

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:15.240
In fact, in an article he wrote
in 1994 for Foreign Affairs,

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:20.030
which he had a strange kind
of because Holbrook wrote,

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:24.850
during the cold war Germany
was the frontline state,

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:28.740
in the post cold war period
Turkey is the frontline state,

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.500
when there was no war
or the threat of war,

00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.470
so what was the front, what
did the war consist of?

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:38.740
And that was, of course, to
avoid what Huntington raised,

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.430
clashal civilizations.

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:43.820
Maybe this was formulated
wrongly,

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:47.220
I mean in retrospect I would
think it was, but no doubt

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.820
that issue of identity
starting with the dissolution

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:54.600
of the Yugoslavia, the
Yuan Dong massacres,

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:59.620
and all that had actually been
with us and actually hunting us

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.820
and we are now dissociating
ourselves from it

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.060
because interest has come back.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:09.010
I wish to take a detour
before I go back to Turkey

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:12.740
and to talk a bit about
the United States,

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:17.490
since our topic is
hypocrisy in our project.

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:21.850
I have a very hard
time personally

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:30.050
to accept the bemoaning
of many liberals today

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:35.020
that the Trump Administration's
policies are ending the liberal

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.320
world order.

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.240
First of all, five
years ago we didn't talk

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.440
about the liberal world order.

00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.600
And, secondly and
much more importantly,

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.240
who broke that order?

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.480
Many of the people today
who lament the passing

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:55.050
of the liberal world order were
cheerleaders for the Iraq war,

00:52:55.050 --> 00:52:58.940
whether they came from the right
or they came from the left.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:04.650
They were the intellectual
promoters of an act

00:53:04.650 --> 00:53:08.490
by the most powerful country
in the world at the time

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:14.800
to break the rules that
actually itself formulated

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.970
at the beginning of
the cold war era.

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:24.810
We really cannot have an
intelligent or a fair discussion

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:29.660
about Russia and what it does,
about China and what it does,

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:35.400
about Turkey and what it does,
we doubt accepting the fact

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:41.140
that the rules in a major
way were first broken

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:45.620
by that country which
actually set them.

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:49.460
And it will be very
difficult in my judgment

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.410
under those circumstances

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:55.700
to put Humpty Dumpty
back together, okay?

00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:03.230
Secondly, we also have
to acknowledge in my view

00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:10.360
and I hear what Thomas has
said literally and then

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:15.150
but I also add to it there
was a sense of complacency

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:18.680
and that's what the end of
history debate was all about.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:23.660
We've reached the search,
the end of the search,

00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:27.800
there will be nothing
better which blinded those

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:33.180
who actually benefited
from the unilateral moment,

00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:36.650
it blinded them to
the inequities

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:41.350
that the economic system
generated, it blinded them

00:54:41.350 --> 00:54:43.950
to the dialectic
of globalization

00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:45.880
that everybody championed.

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:50.800
That is you could not
have a win-win result

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:59.280
from globalization forever,
and it turned out that those

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.810
who support for the liberal
order and it was necessary,

00:55:02.810 --> 00:55:09.020
that is the working people
of developed countries ended

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:13.380
up on the losing side of that
development and in return,

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:16.800
of course, millions,
hundreds of millions of people

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:21.480
in the developing world
actually benefitted immensely,

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:24.630
but those who ruled those,

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:29.420
I mean the developed countries
did not take into account

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:34.180
that the legitimacy of what
they were pursuing depended

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:38.630
on taking care of those who
were actually being left behind.

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:44.370
And I'm not certain that that
blindness has been cured,

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:49.550
even now, because without
understanding this we really

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:54.930
cannot understand or begin
to treat the populist rage,

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:59.060
whether it is of a leftist
kind or a rightest kind.

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:04.840
Secondly, not to be reductionist
in terms of inequities,

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:09.230
I mean economic inequalities,
obviously the top

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:14.860
of a liberal order also
reflected a certain

00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:18.980
understanding of what the
culture of that order was

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:23.250
and I guess one does get carried
away with one's own rhetoric

00:56:23.250 --> 00:56:26.970
and beliefs and you
start belittling those

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:30.720
who do not necessarily
fit your own description

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:34.990
of what the ideal life or ideal
identity ought to be like.

00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:40.240
And now once the vase is broken
these are really very difficult

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.230
things to fix.

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:47.970
I mean Germany's
unemployment rate is what, 3.8,

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:51.730
Austria's is probably
below zero, I don't know.

00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:55.570
The United States today
is at 3.7 and all that.

00:56:55.570 --> 00:57:00.620
And if it was even more
equitably done once those

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:04.490
questions have been put on
stage it's very difficult

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:08.850
to actually change the
conversation back to one

00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:11.390
where you use the terms
that you used to be using.

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:14.370
So we've got to accept that.

00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:19.670
And coming to Rosa's question,
do we go back to what we used

00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:22.130
to have once the blip is over?

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:25.070
The blip may not be over,
that's one thing and, second,

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:29.210
even if it is over we cannot
go back, I mean we're back

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:34.030
to Ancient Greece, right, you
cannot take, we don't get baited

00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:36.600
in the same way but twice, okay?

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:43.050
And the Greeks have a lot of
wisdom to give us on that.

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:45.200
So coming to Turkey, Turkey

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:50.920
of course is a very flexible
country or it can be.

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:56.420
Okay, we will play the
dialogue of civilization scarred

00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.510
and we will give the
European Union a chance

00:57:59.510 --> 00:58:02.790
as the European Union was
going to give us a chance,

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:07.270
and I must say for a very,
in retrospect of course,

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:14.260
for a fleeting moment both sides
actually dropped the hypocrisy,

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:19.470
double talk and insincerity that
defined their relations forever.

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:21.070
Very fleeting moment.

00:58:21.070 --> 00:58:26.150
I wish that both those who were
in positions of responsibility

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:28.290
in the European Union and those

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:32.380
in Turkey actually truly
understood the meaning

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:36.540
and the potency of that moment
and actually went ahead with it.

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:41.950
That wasn't to be, we're now
back to our usual positions.

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:45.570
But in between, though,
because of the weakening

00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:50.380
of the international system,
and I personally do not talk

00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.240
in terms of the return
of geopolitics,

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:57.800
I'm more comfortable with
geopolitics finally waking

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.880
up from a long sleep because
I don't think geopolitics

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.180
ever died.

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.960
The United States exercised it.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:08.090
With the return of geopolitics,
declining American power

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:13.730
and the colossal failures of
the Iraq war Turkey, of course,

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:18.010
repossessed for itself
an identity

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:20.140
that it is usually
very comfortable with,

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:24.570
and that is a post-imperial
power which wishes

00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:30.360
to become an important not
to be ignored regional power.

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:33.080
And I must say I also detect

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:40.950
in Turkey a post-imperial
trauma syndrome.

00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:44.360
I guess Mr. Cooper could
understand me well,

00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.310
they lost an empire as well.

00:59:46.310 --> 00:59:49.560
The thing is our trauma
really came a bit late,

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:53.110
about nine years later, and
now we're trying to make-up

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:56.780
for lost time and,
therefore, all of the regions

00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:01.360
that surround us are for
Turkey fair playing in terms

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:09.470
of projecting Turkey's
power and vision

01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:14.010
of I guess hegemonic domination.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:18.350
And whether or not Turkey will
be able to do that still is

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:22.330
out in the open, but
I'll start, I'll conclude

01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:26.010
with what I'm sure
most of you at least

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:29.560
with some interest are
following, what happened

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:33.230
to Mr. Khashoggi and what kind

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:37.580
of policy Turkey is
pursuing in that?

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:42.680
I have to say the
Khashoggi affair fits right

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.580
into our project.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:51.210
There was a murder, a
rather gruesome one.

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:54.600
It is now I guess pretty obvious

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:57.680
that the Turkish
Government was aware of it,

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:04.100
the British Government
knew about it in advance,

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.590
and unless the American
intelligence was

01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:10.780
as usual sleeping on the job
they must also have had some

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:14.350
inclination as to what
was going to happen.

01:01:14.350 --> 01:01:18.170
And, therefore, we are now
playing a game and the game,

01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:21.810
therefore, beyond
the moral aspects

01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:28.080
of the murder this
has now become a dance

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.060
between three partners.

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:35.810
How will Turkey treat
Saudi Arabia?

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:40.560
How will Turkey or will
the United States side

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.510
with the Turkish
narrative and then dump MBS,

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:50.220
or as the President said
initially I have arms to sell,

01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.550
I really cannot jeopardize that?

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:53.850
That remains to be seen.

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:57.350
I mean again he was not
hypocritical, but it's obvious

01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.840
that for this particular
issue at least

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:04.420
for the moment the American
political system for a variety

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.850
of reasons and American media

01:02:06.850 --> 01:02:11.520
and maybe civil society are
not going to let this go.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:17.370
And if, indeed, this leads to
a dumping of MBS as a result

01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:19.920
that will really be a victory

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:27.520
for a noncynical approach
to power relations.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.830
And if with all the
problems that it had

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:36.080
so far Turkey I think
managed it relatively well,

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:40.800
protecting national interests
but also keeping interest alive

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:45.120
and also giving enough
information.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:51.340
And at the end of the day this
may turn out to be the defining

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:56.200
or a decisive moment
for the Middle East

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.120
to see whether it will
be the Saudi version

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.230
over an Islamic power or a
Turkish version of a Sunni power

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:07.960
that is going to
have more of a say

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.310
in the future order
of the Middle East.

01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:14.020
Don't count on order in
the Middle East, though.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:15.550
Thank you.

01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:16.850
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Thank you very much.

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:21.010
I need just to go and to
take any type of a comment,

01:03:21.010 --> 01:03:24.750
any type of a question, not
just answer one-by-one but try

01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:26.460
to make it much more
as a discussion

01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.760
and then going back
to the panel.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.360
I just want to stress one thing
that I do believe is interesting

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.910
for at least our starting
point when we started.

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:37.540
Every order goes for crisis
and being changed and so

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.780
from this point there is
nothing that is happening

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:42.580
that is historic than expected.

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:46.970
But if you go back to 1989,
1990s the major story was

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:49.530
that this was a kind
of a world order

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:52.980
which everybody is going
to feel victorious.

01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:56.580
And though on the level of
the rhetoric it is not simply

01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:59.200
that the West has
won the cold war,

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.710
that the Russian people
has won the cold war

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:04.810
against the communist regime
and everybody was winning.

01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:08.890
Thirty years later everybody
identified as a victim

01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:12.980
and loser, Russia to be honest
is the most obvious case,

01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:15.490
but then you go into central and
eastern Europe particularly some

01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:19.050
of the populist government who
said we lost, and then suddenly

01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:21.560
with President Trump the
Americans said we are the

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.020
biggest victim of the world that
the American created in 1989.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.150
And for me this type of an
important transformation

01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:31.330
of the world which was a win-win

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:35.880
and now is lose-lose is
something to be taken seriously

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.900
because it is also trying
to throw not simply a kind

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:40.940
of a language, but
this is something

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:42.350
that Simon Vale [assumed
spelling] is going

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:46.750
to define cheap collective
imagination.

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:50.430
Suddenly you start to see the
world totally differently.

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:52.430
Something that till
yesterday was looking

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:56.540
as an advantage starts to see
as disadvantage, vulnerability.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:57.960
We are finishing the book

01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:59.560
with Steven Hobbs [assumed
spelling] this was the reason I

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.120
was here, I'll give just one
example, English language.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.960
Fifteen years ago everybody is
going to claim that the spread

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.100
of the English language
was the best demonstration

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.040
of the American soft power.

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.510
You go everywhere
and you're going

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.680
to hear somebody
speaking English.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:19.370
And then suddenly the spread
of the English language starts

01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:21.740
to be perceived as
America's vulnerability.

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:24.930
Why? I'm just going to
give you three examples.

01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:28.840
Because if everybody speaks
English everybody knows how

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:32.950
America functions, but America
is not very aware how other

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:34.480
people function.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.420
It is easier for everybody to go
onto social media and to pretend

01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:41.760
to be an American, it is not
easy for the Americans to go

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.420
onto social media and to
pretend being Bulgarians.

01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:48.100
Secondly, on the level of
knowledge the fact that you have

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:51.590
so many English speakers
in different countries,

01:05:51.590 --> 01:05:54.320
you go to a country you're
always going to find somebody

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.960
who speaks English and you
have the feeling that you talk

01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.440
to the local population.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.790
But not always the
English speakers

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:05.080
which are self-selected groups
are very much representatives

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.860
for the general kind
of understanding

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.040
in the very general
mode of the country.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:14.410
So certainly, strangely enough,
which was America's biggest kind

01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:18.500
of advantage starts to be
perceived asymmetry, vulnerable,

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.200
everybody can interfere in our
politics and we find it more

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.540
and more difficult to interfere
in the politics of others

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.510
because we don't know
what is going on.

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:29.650
This type of change is for
me critically important.

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:32.470
Something that you liked
yesterday you start

01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:33.790
to fear today.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.840
This is also east
European example,

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.260
you go on the opinion polls,

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:40.010
ask the east Europeans
what is the best thing

01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:42.410
that happened to you after 1989?

01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:45.510
And they are going to tell
you opening of the borders.

01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:47.790
Ask them after the
refugee crisis,

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:50.210
what is the things
that you fear most?

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:52.500
Opening of the borders.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.460
And from this point of view
the fact where the best

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.670
and the worst happened
to be the same.

01:06:57.670 --> 01:07:02.200
Is a kind of miss in the
important political reality

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.430
that we are talking about,
but I am going to stop here.

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:07.010
Please feel free
to ask, to comment,

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:10.850
and basically then we'll
go back to the panel.

01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:14.560
Please? Yes, there should
be a microphone, yes.

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you, this
is very interesting.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:23.190
I have a whole bunch of
questions, I'll limit to two.

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:26.890
First, on the question of
BREXIT, Theresa May was opposed

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:28.660
to the idea of BREXIT
at the beginning,

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:31.020
but when she took office she
promised she would implement it,

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.220
of course she's taken
forever to do so,

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:36.920
and I'm wondering is she trying
to get someone to force her

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:40.660
to call a new referendum to
try to reverse the decision?

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:41.960
That's question number one.

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.560
Question number two
for Ms. Brooks,

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.300
you talk about whether the
US will return to normal

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.690
and I'm just wondering
what is normal?

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:52.480
Was George W. Bush's
Administration normal?

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:56.310
Was the Obama Administration
normal?

01:07:56.310 --> 01:08:01.960
Is there such a thing as normal?

01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.150
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: Yes, please?

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:05.470
&gt;&gt; John Van Houdt: Thank you

01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:10.660
for those presentations,
very interesting.

01:08:10.660 --> 01:08:13.200
My name is John Van Houdt
and I'm from The Library

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.630
of Congress, I worked

01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:17.430
on European politics
for a long time.

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:21.350
This is a comment, but
feel free to comment

01:08:21.350 --> 01:08:23.050
on the comment, if you would.

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:27.500
I think hypocrisy is a very
interesting conceptual way

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.440
to look at it, particularly
when it's Putin versus the West

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:37.790
or whatever, but from an
internal Western perspective I

01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:40.920
think a useful way to
look at it is laziness.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:47.980
I think it strikes me how
lazy the elites of the West

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:53.510
who talk endlessly about this
liberal international order how

01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:55.490
sort of lack of effort
they've put

01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:58.620
into even understanding
what creating

01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.120
and maintaining that order was.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:04.270
I mean I just, I could give many
examples, but I'd just give one.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:08.710
The Bretton Wood system,
you have to read article

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:12.600
after article after article in
which Eikenberry and others go

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.450
on and on and on about
the alphabet soup

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:18.870
of the Bretton Wood system.

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:24.500
How hard people like the
young Paul Volker used to work

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:29.330
to maintain the convertibility
of the dollar into gold

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:34.700
at $35 an ounce and not keep the
whole system from crashing down,

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:38.940
and it was just really
hard work.

01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:43.560
Now Germany runs a $300
billion trade surplus,

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.290
the US runs a $500
billion trade deficit,

01:09:47.290 --> 01:09:49.020
it goes on and on and on.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:54.030
The IMF is a bunch of well-paid
bureaucrats who give advice

01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:56.740
to mostly developing countries
and occasionally a country

01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.870
like Greece, but there's no
really hard work that goes

01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:06.210
into maintaining a
difficult costly world order.

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:09.440
And so what we've simultaneously
done is put less and less effort

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.210
into maintaining that order and
made it more and more expansive,

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:16.170
both geographically it's
supposed to apply to everybody,

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:20.210
everybody except a few rogues,
to use the lingo of the '90s,

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:23.660
and also more and more areas
in our national criminal court,

01:10:23.660 --> 01:10:24.960
Kyoto and so on and so forth.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:29.800
So there's a kind
of a now a laziness,

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.510
we invoke the international
order

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:33.310
but we don't put
much effort into it.

01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:37.080
Now the cold war, of
course, imposed discipline,

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.300
it was partly if
the dollar goes,

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:43.610
if we go off the gold standard
or whatever the world is going

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:45.670
to come to an end that's
what people like Johnson

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:47.090
and Eisenhower thought
and so on.

01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:53.120
So the East-West conflict
imposed a discipline,

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.750
maybe it was just a
different sociology and so on,

01:10:55.750 --> 01:11:00.060
but I do think we have a
problem not only with hypocrisy

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.770
but also with kind of effort.

01:11:01.770 --> 01:11:04.940
And the European Union
is a wonderful thing,

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:09.190
but it does kind of
and enlargement cost

01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:11.670
and it was not cheap and
so on, but it does kind

01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:14.420
of spin-out lots and
lots and lots of projects

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:17.220
that sound great, but
how much real effort goes

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:18.520
into actually reality.

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.980
Anyway, that's a comment,
but I would like anybody

01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:23.380
to comment on it, as well.

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.680
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Thank you very much.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.650
There was a question there?

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.410
Yes, please?

01:11:28.410 --> 01:11:31.800
&gt;&gt; How do you see
global capitalism fitting

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:37.830
into these shifts that
you're talking about?

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:40.130
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: Thank you.

01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:42.470
Please?

01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:44.280
&gt;&gt; In regards to
Germany you mentioned

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.110
that the nationalist identity
is so rooted in history

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:51.970
that Germany is now defined by
an international liberal order.

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:53.270
If Germany were to shift back

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:55.480
to the national identity
do you see some

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.210
of that extremism still coming
up and what are your comments

01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:02.160
on extremism that has arisen in
Germany, the neo-Nazi sentiment?

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.760
And in regards to Turkey with
the resent Sochi agreements

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.710
and action in Syria how has
that impacted Russia's relations

01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:12.120
with Turkey and Turkey's
relations

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.010
with the US and the EU?

01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:15.310
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: Thank you.

01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:16.660
Yes, question, next to you?

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:19.120
&gt;&gt; Topaden [assumed spelling],
I hope said it right, did I?

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.420
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: Yes.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:23.940
&gt;&gt; Would it be better for
American foreign policy

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:28.380
if more Americans,
especially foreign policymakers

01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:32.370
and politicians, instead of
speaking English while abroad

01:12:32.370 --> 01:12:35.420
if they know French or
know German or know Polish,

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:39.110
that's becoming very popular
to learn, and they spoke

01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:42.800
in those languages instead,
would that be a way to almost

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:44.100
from the bottom up start

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:46.950
to rebuild the international
community

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.590
and a sense of global
solidarity?

01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:52.720
Because instead of everyone
else speaking English it'd be

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.790
like us being, you know, I'm
going to speak your language

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:58.900
or I'm going to learn
a little bit of yours

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.820
and it'll build connections

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:04.660
that may help solidify the
international community

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:08.660
to become more pro-democratic
and more working together

01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:11.670
in solidarity like
it used to be.

01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:13.810
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: Thank you.

01:13:13.810 --> 01:13:18.470
Probably this is
the last question,

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:21.080
I believe I'm not
missing something here.

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.210
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you so much
for all of your comments.

01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:27.340
I was thinking about what you
said with in terms of hypocrisy

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.130
and like how it's
represented now in the US.

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:33.350
In terms of education and
raising this new generation

01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:36.210
to think about American
hypocrisy how do you think

01:13:36.210 --> 01:13:38.030
that's going to work?

01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:40.320
Is it so embedded in our
institutions that even

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.560
like the education we receive
at this point kind of represents

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.910
that or do you think
that there's a way

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:49.190
that that can be applied broadly
in education moving forward

01:13:49.190 --> 01:13:50.490
for the new generation?

01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:51.790
Thank you.

01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:53.090
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Thank you very much.

01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:57.050
We're basically back
from Turkey to Britain,

01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:59.670
the imperial arc this
time the other way,

01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:01.960
and we try to be very concise.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.010
On your question
about languages,

01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:06.140
which is critically important,

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.540
Carl Schmidt [assumed
spelling] was somebody

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:11.710
that Germans normally are not
going to quote, he used to say

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:17.220
that Victoria's powers tends
to [inaudible] curiosity.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.880
Part of the problem is
the history story is

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.400
that you're not very much
interested in the world

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.310
because they're coming to you,
one day they're going to be

01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:29.320
like you, you know what
they're going to be,

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.180
why are you interested
who they are?

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:34.660
And from this point it was
very different than the kind

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.040
of knowledge dynamics
during the cold war.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.210
If you see the affect
of the Sputnik

01:14:39.210 --> 01:14:41.450
on the way basically the
Americans get the feeling

01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:43.330
that they don't know
the other side,

01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:45.610
everybody was learning
languages, you have the feeling

01:14:45.610 --> 01:14:48.390
that there is something very
important that you should learn.

01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:50.140
Now you to go your countries

01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:53.360
and what you're seeing basically
is what they don't have.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:55.450
You come to Bulgaria
and they said,

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:58.170
they don't have [inaudible]
they don't have this,

01:14:58.170 --> 01:14:59.470
they don't have that.

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:01.070
In a certain way you're
starting basically

01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:05.510
to understand countries on the
base of how different they are

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:08.230
from what they're
going to be sometime.

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:10.070
And this is not good
from the knowledge base,

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:12.250
and I very much agree
with you, it's not simply

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.390
that you should learn the
language but basically it means

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:20.000
that you should very much try to
understand how society functions

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.550
and not how dysfunctional they
are from your point of view,

01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:26.290
and this is a different story.

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:29.390
Of course, knowing the
English language also creates

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:32.170
on the outside world the
talk of the false image

01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:33.670
that you understand
the United States,

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:35.880
and particularly it could
be a very cynical image.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.840
There is a well-known quote

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.660
when Mr. Shroyko [assumed
spelling] was promoted

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:42.190
to become the Minister
of Defense

01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:45.930
of the Russian Federation he
had a talk with President Putin

01:15:45.930 --> 01:15:48.490
and Putin told him,
listen, you're now going

01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:50.480
to do the international
relations, you're going to deal

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.580
with the Americans, you
don't need to do too much,

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:58.300
just watch the house of cards.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.640
And this is part of
the story that, okay,

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.680
house of cards probably
is telling you something

01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:05.930
about the United States,
but if you're going

01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:08.560
to make all your policies
towards the United States just

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:12.170
based on watching the house
of cards this also can turn

01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:16.510
to be not the greatest
idea, but I'll go to Solly.

01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:20.080
&gt;&gt; Solly Roselle: You want
to find out Turkey's policy

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:27.600
in Syria and its
closeness to Russia, well,

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:30.980
Turkey made a number
of miscalculations

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:35.190
and I think it's a tribute
to its geopolitical position

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:40.780
that despite those errors it is
still as they call at the table.

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:45.810
The major error Turkey
committed, apart from thinking

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.420
that Assad would go easily,

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:57.710
was to attack a Russian plane
thinking that this might lead

01:16:57.710 --> 01:17:00.920
to a mobilization of
NATO on its side in order

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:04.390
to actually pursue
its policies in Syria.

01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:08.470
It didn't work, in fact,
in return the Russians kind

01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:17.290
of punished Turkey, and in the
meantime the United States,

01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:21.510
Turkey's ally, has
gotten even more intimate

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:25.570
with Turkey's sworn enemies,

01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:30.140
that is the PKK's
Syrian branch, PYD.

01:17:30.140 --> 01:17:35.200
That led Turkey to reconsider
its relations with Russia

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.550
and it also led the Russians
to reconsider their relations

01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:42.430
with Turkey, which actually
was becoming a bit desperate.

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:46.980
And they allowed Turkey
to do a number of things

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:51.440
that Turkey could not without
Russian permission could do

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.740
in Syria.

01:17:52.740 --> 01:17:58.500
So for the moment Turkey is
using America's indecisiveness

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:04.230
and kind of weakness and
the Russian's immense desire

01:18:04.230 --> 01:18:09.080
to divorce Turkey from
NATO, playing both sides.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.900
How long that can go on
I really do not know,

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:17.390
but so far Turkey was able
I think with both a blink

01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:20.460
from the United States and
with the help of the Russians

01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:24.390
to make sure that the
PYD could not control all

01:18:24.390 --> 01:18:26.380
of its southern border.

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:30.840
And that to a certain
extent resolves Turkey's

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.600
security problem.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:39.140
And from this point onwards
what will happen between Turkey

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:40.880
and Russia and between Turkey

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:44.530
and the United States will
be determined in my judgment

01:18:44.530 --> 01:18:47.760
by also what happens between
Russia and the United States

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.840
for the conclusion of
the Syrian debacle.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:57.980
My sense is that peace is
not to come very soon and if

01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.990
that is the case
Turkey will continue

01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:02.520
to be administering the areas

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:07.110
that its military operations
actually made it possible

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:10.840
for it to occupy.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.140
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: Thomas?

01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.480
&gt;&gt; Thomas Bagger: Yes, I'll
try to make two points.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.320
The first one to
the laziness charge

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.070
and the languages question.

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:23.180
I think this sort of laziness,

01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.740
it relates a bit
to what Ivan said.

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:30.740
We were very good with grand
generalizations and again

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:33.340
to the argument I tried to
make earlier, if you believe

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.960
that everyone else becomes
like you you don't have

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.330
to study their peculiar
circumstances, right?

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:42.030
Why they think what they
think, how they got there,

01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:46.750
and how they will, how they
look at their own future.

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:52.240
So just one example in the
cold war understanding Moscow

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.870
and the Kremlin was
existential for Germany

01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:57.870
and there was quite a bit of
intellectual and academic effort

01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:59.300
and resources put into that.

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:03.320
After 1989 we dissolved
most of these institutions,

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.620
it was no longer interesting.

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:06.870
They would modernize and
eventually, you know,

01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:11.450
they would become like us and
we could speak English with them

01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:14.870
about how long it would
take them to get there.

01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:19.390
Now two years ago we
recreated an Institute

01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:22.490
for Eastern European and
International Studies

01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:27.590
because we realized this
is not going to happen.

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:30.660
There was a laziness certainly
in the assumption that we had

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:35.610
or in our expectation, and we
need to understand the debates,

01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:40.290
the intellectual concepts in
places, not just like Russia

01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:44.630
but also in central Asia, in
eastern Europe sort of east

01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:46.550
of the European Union.

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:51.120
So in that sense I
would go along with you.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:54.120
In a different way I don't think
the charge is entirely fair

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.960
because it is also true

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:01.580
that international relations
today compared to the days

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.870
when they conceptualized the
Brattenwood's [assumed spelling]

01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:09.450
institutions is infinitely
more complex, more states,

01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:13.040
more interdependence, more
interaction, more stakeholders,

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.290
not states only but
others as well.

01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:18.630
Just take the climate
negotiations as one example.

01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:25.590
So there's an infinite necessity
to invest time and energy

01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:33.670
to sort of produce the solutions
or the way forward for problems

01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:38.580
that are no longer, that you
can't solve on a national

01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:41.290
or even the level of
20 states let's say.

01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:47.170
So I would argue that sort of
the task ahead of people who try

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:52.680
to do this today it's a
tall order and it's not

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.670
that they just sit back, neither
in Brussels nor elsewhere,

01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:58.110
but maybe that's sort of
my own defensive nature

01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:01.640
because I'm part of a
government organization.

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.940
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: You're lazy.

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:08.030
&gt;&gt; Thomas Bagger: And I
hate to be called lazy, yes.

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:13.780
The other point is
to the immigration,

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:17.250
nationalism question,
but it also goes to sort

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:19.510
of the global capitalism
question.

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:27.170
You know, clearly Germany is
also experiencing currently a

01:22:27.170 --> 01:22:31.480
repolarization of the
political landscape.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:37.180
For decades the pendulum swung
a different direction in Germany

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:38.630
and in the United States.

01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:43.660
The story I told earlier, when I
was studying here in 1989, 1990,

01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:47.310
this was a very centrist
political discourse,

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:49.090
very civil in the US.

01:22:49.090 --> 01:22:52.180
It was much more polarized
around the division

01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:54.310
of my country in Germany.

01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:57.160
After unification we became,

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:59.700
we had a very centrist
political system able

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.770
to integrate the extremes.

01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:04.110
That's why we had grand
coalitions in Germany

01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:08.420
where essentially the former
left and former right party,

01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:10.920
the Christian democrats
and social democrats,

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:12.420
they could easily
form a coalition

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.180
because they all subscribed
to this general idea

01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:19.470
that you basically just need
the best technocratic solution,

01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:21.490
but there were no big
ideological fights

01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.790
to fight anymore.

01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:26.220
Whereas here in the US the
development went exactly the

01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:27.520
other way.

01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:29.060
So now we see a repolarization

01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:31.720
of the German political
landscape and it has a lot to do

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.670
with the immigration question,
with the identity question.

01:23:35.670 --> 01:23:40.210
And I would say that because
both big parties are suffering

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:45.920
and leading voters to
the polls of the debate.

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:50.210
But these polls of the debate
that we see are no longer

01:23:50.210 --> 01:23:54.830
in the sort of the classic left,
right spectrum of politics,

01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:57.690
doesn't help you to
understand really anymore.

01:23:57.690 --> 01:24:01.010
It's far more, it's sort
of like a different axis

01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:04.630
that defines open versus closed.

01:24:04.630 --> 01:24:09.660
And if you think about identity
do you think of something

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:12.790
that you need to protect,
that you need to close off

01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:17.640
against foreigners or others,
those who are not part of it,

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.420
whether that's an
ethnic definition

01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:21.570
or a culturalist definition,

01:24:21.570 --> 01:24:24.290
people who cannot
possibly become part of it?

01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:28.060
Or do you look at identity more
as a resource and says, look,

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:31.690
this is what Germany has to
offer, for everyone who is able

01:24:31.690 --> 01:24:34.930
to read not just
Goethe or Schiller,

01:24:34.930 --> 01:24:38.060
but listen to German music,
read German intellectuals?

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:40.220
It's actually an open
resource that can help you

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:44.360
to relate better to your own
culture, to your own thinking

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.990
about the world, and you have
a much more open perspective.

01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:51.030
And that's what I
see developing,

01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:53.460
that that's the spectrum along

01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:56.350
which political forces
are aligning themselves,

01:24:56.350 --> 01:25:01.910
and clearly also in Germany you
have those that basically want

01:25:01.910 --> 01:25:06.310
to tell sort of the story
of a victim and we need

01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:09.020
to protect ourselves
from attacks from outside

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:11.750
or from others and from
immigration and so forth.

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:14.920
And that is what gets me to
the global capitalism question,

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.630
as well, and I think,
Solly, you mentioned it

01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:20.650
in your first statement.

01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:25.060
That sort of our blindness to
the dialectics of globalization,

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:31.410
to the inequities, to the
incredible loss of credibility

01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:35.200
of the Western model or
the Western order that came

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.280
with the financial
crisis of 2008.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.600
I mean many of these
other countries,

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.660
they looked at the West
not necessarily with a lot

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:53.130
of sympathy, but with this idea
that they're richer than we are,

01:25:53.130 --> 01:25:56.290
they also may be freer than
we are, they're more efficient

01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:59.410
than we are, but certainly
they know what they're doing.

01:25:59.410 --> 01:26:02.440
And if not in Iraq with the
Iraq war or in the Middle East

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.030
at least economically
financially they knew what

01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:06.330
they're doing.

01:26:06.330 --> 01:26:10.020
And it turns out we
didn't, and this is not just

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.360
at a state level, but
lots of economic actors

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:14.060
who were actually
gaming a system

01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:16.210
that they didn't
understand, that they created

01:26:16.210 --> 01:26:18.250
but they couldn't control
and didn't understand,

01:26:18.250 --> 01:26:22.130
with massive repercussions for
lots of other people who tried

01:26:22.130 --> 01:26:25.080
to make a living every
day with their job.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.760
I think we still underestimate
how much this contributed,

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:32.290
the 2008 crisis, in the eyes
of the Chinese and the Russians

01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:36.300
and others to say
that's not the future,

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:37.600
they don't represent the future,

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.800
they don't even know
what they're doing.

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:49.580
And so I think this question of
what is the role of the state

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:54.110
in regulating the
affects of globalization,

01:26:54.110 --> 01:26:57.450
what do future trade
agreements have to look like,

01:26:57.450 --> 01:27:05.020
how do we regulate technology
and technological disruptions

01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:07.870
so that it doesn't
destroy the social fabric

01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:11.820
and doesn't only profit a
few globalized companies?

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:14.330
All of these questions
are back on the agenda,

01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:17.040
and I think there's a
pretty broad consensus now,

01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:22.500
but when you look back
clearly many people were sort

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.860
of oblivious to the challenges

01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:29.820
that globalization was actually
piling up in front of us

01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:34.120
until sort of we, until
we hit the wall with it.

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:36.330
So in that sense I think
these two are related

01:27:36.330 --> 01:27:41.110
because if you want to keep sort
of the good parts of openness

01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:43.480
as a society, but
also as an economy

01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:45.160
or as a political system,

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.150
because I think we
do need cooperation,

01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:51.320
not just for prosperity but
also for problem solving

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.450
on the international stage, but
then you have to make a case

01:27:54.450 --> 01:27:58.760
that you can do that
also in a just way,

01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:03.100
in a way that satisfy
the largest number.

01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:07.050
And otherwise those who will
argue for a closed system

01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:10.380
and you only look after yourself
and basically everyone is

01:28:10.380 --> 01:28:13.810
out there just to get
the better of you,

01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:15.720
then that will win the day.

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:20.220
And I think part of the, you
always have this group in each

01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:24.330
and every society, Germany
but also every other country,

01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:29.180
I think the stunning
realization in 2016 in Britain

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:33.760
or in the US was that that
can actually be enough to take

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.490
over and govern a country.

01:28:36.490 --> 01:28:38.270
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: Rosa?

01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:42.140
&gt;&gt; Rosa Brooks: Yes, let
me start with the question

01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.200
of whether the US can
go back to normal?

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.500
What is normal?

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:48.720
I don't think we
can for two reasons.

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:52.860
One being that you can't step
into the same river twice,

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.160
it's a different river

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:58.370
and you're a different person
reason, but also I think

01:28:58.370 --> 01:29:05.010
that the normal was as
we've been saying so full

01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:09.380
of contradictions that we
weren't acknowledging it was an

01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:11.550
unsustainable state of affairs.

01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:15.920
And I see Trump in many
ways less as a cause

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.910
than as a symptom or maybe
it's Trump is the equivalent

01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:21.750
of pouring gasoline on a fire,

01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:24.080
but that fire was
already smoldering,

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.610
it's just that under
Trump it's now a

01:29:26.610 --> 01:29:28.500
full-fledged conflagration.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.970
But I think even without,
I think all of the forces

01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:32.840
that brought us to
the moment that we're

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.390
in were there before
the election

01:29:35.390 --> 01:29:37.320
of 2016 in the United States.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.620
We saw them in Europe,

01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:41.020
we saw them in other
parts of the world.

01:29:41.020 --> 01:29:45.880
And I suppose this connects
to the laziness point

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:51.520
in that I share Solly's
eyerolling

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:57.080
over the sudden nostalgia and
insistence that we must shore-up

01:29:57.080 --> 01:29:59.910
and preserve the
international liberal order.

01:29:59.910 --> 01:30:03.300
It's like the old quip about the
holy Roman Empire being neither

01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:04.980
holy nor Roman nor an Empire,

01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:06.960
that the international
liberal order it turns

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.180
out was neither entirely
international.

01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:12.290
There were entire
states and peoples

01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:14.340
that were left entirely
out of it.

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.890
Nor was it particularly liberal,

01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:19.260
nor was it very orderly
as it happens.

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:26.960
And if we are too lazy or
unimaginative or blinded

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.270
to acknowledge that, you
know, that's the first step

01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:32.640
in Alcoholics Anonymous,

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.560
they say the first step
is acknowledging you have

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:35.860
a problem.

01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:39.110
You know, if we can't even go
that first step and acknowledge

01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:42.460
to ourselves that the
international liberal order was

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:46.360
never looked like Cary Grant,
to switch to Ivan's metaphor,

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.500
then I don't know how we
go about resolving any

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.310
of those internal
contradictions.

01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:57.360
And I was reminded when you
were talking of my favorite,

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.870
of the role that, as you say,

01:30:59.870 --> 01:31:04.130
the United States played a
significant role in undermining,

01:31:04.130 --> 01:31:07.750
in making sure that that
order would not be fully

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:10.130
international, liberal
or orderly

01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:12.240
through actions such
as the Iraq war.

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.440
I was reminded of one of
my favorite Putin quotes,

01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:16.490
which I think I quoted
to my friends

01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:21.280
in the hypocrisy study
group on previous occasions.

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:26.630
Vladimir Putin always
quotable when, and this was not

01:31:26.630 --> 01:31:30.980
over the Iraq war, but when
Kosovo declared independence

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:34.650
unilaterally and, of course, the
United States along with most

01:31:34.650 --> 01:31:39.100
of the EU states had said, no,
no, no, Russia, don't worry,

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:42.000
we are not going to support
Kosovo independence from Serbia,

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:45.480
absolutely not, we support
Serbian sovereignty, et cetera.

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.410
And then when Kosovo
unilaterally declared

01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:50.940
independence and the EU and the
United States immediately said,

01:31:50.940 --> 01:31:53.350
okay, we recognize
Kosovo independence,

01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:56.190
Vladimir Putin said something,
this is not a direct quote

01:31:56.190 --> 01:31:58.530
but it was more or
less along these lines,

01:31:58.530 --> 01:32:01.530
he said you Americans,
you Europeans,

01:32:01.530 --> 01:32:04.280
those of you recognizing
Kosovo's independence,

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:07.760
you do not understand, you
are overturning 200 years

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:10.430
of international norms
about sovereignty

01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:13.560
and you do not understand
this is a two-sided stick

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:16.830
and the other end will come
back and hit you in the face.

01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:20.110
And, of course, a few
years later in Crimea

01:32:20.110 --> 01:32:23.220
that stick did come back
and hit us in the face,

01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:28.230
and he wasn't wrong to
level that critique.

01:32:28.230 --> 01:32:32.380
It does, one of the things that
depresses me most is I do think

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.740
that in this country, we've
been talking about this

01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:37.320
with our friend and
colleague, Steve Walt,

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:41.080
one thing that depresses me
most is the I think inability

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:44.270
of the sort of mainstream
foreign policy elites

01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:47.760
and also Democratic Party
elites to grapple with any

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.060
of those contradictions.

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:50.980
And it pains me to say

01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:53.010
that I still see these
statements coming

01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:57.090
out of my favorite
Washington liberal think tanks

01:32:57.090 --> 01:33:01.060
and organizations where
you'll get this sort

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:04.350
of unblushing contradictions
where you'll sort

01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:06.980
of simultaneously
say we recognize

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:10.200
that endless war is not good for
our nation and so we will work

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:14.010
to end these wars, we recognize
that terrorism is a scourge

01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:16.320
to the whole world and so
we will pursue terrorists

01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:17.620
to the end of the earth.

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.640
And you think wait a
second, hold on, you know,

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.650
how are you going to
do both of those things

01:33:21.650 --> 01:33:23.990
because if you think both of
those, that's not going to work.

01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:29.480
And yet I think that we are
still lazy or still blinded,

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:33.310
there is a fantasy that
there is a sustainable normal

01:33:33.310 --> 01:33:36.470
that we can simply
revert to and just edit

01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:40.220
out this whole business of
Trump and this whole nationalism

01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:44.050
and populism business
and it really isn't.

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:48.890
The final question I think and
I'm sure I'm missing several,

01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:54.140
but about young people and
how do we educate young people

01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:57.680
to not be quite as hypocritical
and not be quite as lazy?

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.780
I almost worry, and I
have two teenaged children

01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:04.200
and I watch them, that
they are so deeply aware

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.550
of American hypocrisy that I
worry it becomes paralyzing.

01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:12.940
You know, that they do not think
of the United States as a force

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:16.690
for global good, they
think of the US as a force

01:34:16.690 --> 01:34:18.870
for global disruption
and inequality,

01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:21.980
and of course they're
right to think that,

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:24.530
but I do worry a little bit
that that leads to a sort

01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:26.500
of sense of paralysis.

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:30.750
It's not laziness, it's
depression, it's a sense of, oh,

01:34:30.750 --> 01:34:35.740
well, we're out of big
ideas, communism didn't work,

01:34:35.740 --> 01:34:37.750
the great American
experiment didn't work,

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:40.890
the international liberal order
wasn't so liberal or orderly,

01:34:40.890 --> 01:34:42.680
you know, we're out of ideas.

01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:49.330
And I don't quite know how
to urge them and urge others

01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:52.290
in their generation,
urge the students I teach

01:34:52.290 --> 01:34:56.630
to say don't give
up, don't be lazy,

01:34:56.630 --> 01:35:00.850
but don't stop being
creative and imaginative

01:35:00.850 --> 01:35:02.190
or then we really are done.

01:35:02.190 --> 01:35:05.710
And if there is a bright
side to Donald Trump

01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:10.170
and the various other Trump-like
conflagrations that we're seeing

01:35:10.170 --> 01:35:12.420
around the globe
today, you know,

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:16.540
it's the old saying what does
not kill us makes us strong.

01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:18.430
If this doesn't completely
blow things

01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:22.990
up I think it does create some
potential space for people

01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:26.760
to break out of those old
left, right dichotomies

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.660
because they have
proven inadequate.

01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:33.220
And I hope, I love to see
young people viewing this more

01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:37.020
as a clarion call
to say, all right,

01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:41.510
those old ideas did not
work, what's the next set

01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:43.660
of big ideas, and that's going

01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:46.700
to be your job to
figure them out.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.930
&gt;&gt; Robert Cooper: I
think I would rather go

01:35:48.930 --> 01:35:52.400
for little ideas actually.

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.910
I think the big ideas are the
ones that get us into trouble.

01:35:56.910 --> 01:36:00.040
But I think that the
world can be made better,

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:03.380
but I think that it's mostly
made better bit by bit.

01:36:03.380 --> 01:36:07.370
And I think that the US played
an absolutely fantastic,

01:36:07.370 --> 01:36:10.330
stunning, indispensable
role in that

01:36:10.330 --> 01:36:13.950
and one ought to remember that.

01:36:13.950 --> 01:36:19.070
You can see it, if you have
to and now there are lots of,

01:36:19.070 --> 01:36:22.710
and when the US makes mistakes
it makes gigantic mistakes.

01:36:22.710 --> 01:36:27.470
My personal view has always been
that the first duty of Europe is

01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:29.810
to stop the US from doing
really stupid things,

01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:34.080
and that's why actually it
would be better if the UK was

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.380
in the EU because,
but still I would --

01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:43.790
if you're European you can't
forget how the US handled

01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:47.570
post-war Europe, it's
actually a miracle.

01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:52.530
So maybe I can just answer
one or two of the other?

01:36:52.530 --> 01:36:54.390
&gt;&gt; Solly Roselle: I
wanted to add one sentence.

01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:59.510
You did mention getting
into EU I think at 90 some.

01:36:59.510 --> 01:37:05.980
And I think what he says that
is important for the next thing,

01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:09.970
we're still in the
era of Ronald Reagan,

01:37:09.970 --> 01:37:12.420
that is government
is not the solution,

01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:14.500
government is the problem.

01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:17.950
And what Paul Walker
was saying was we have

01:37:17.950 --> 01:37:22.160
to make public service
valuable again.

01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.050
That is in my view
part of the answer.

01:37:25.050 --> 01:37:27.440
I just wanted to add that.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.740
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Robert, just I come back

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:33.300
because I have it stuck
in my head, in 19 --

01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:37.610
I'm not very good at
the dates, it's in 1943

01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:38.910
or something like that.

01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:40.870
&gt;&gt; 20th Century.

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:42.420
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: 20th Century.

01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:53.570
&gt;&gt; Anyway, I wasn't yet, but
still in 1943 the German who was

01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:58.960
in charge of running Denmark
as an occupied territory

01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:01.520
in World War II received
an instruction

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:05.200
to solve the Jewish question.

01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:12.800
He almost certainly knew
that the third secretary

01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:16.530
in the German Embassy, George
Dukfitz [assumed spelling],

01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:21.980
was going to inform
the community leaders

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:24.590
in Denmark what was coming.

01:38:24.590 --> 01:38:26.220
And so when the Gestapo arrived

01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:30.630
to arrest the Jews
they found only 200.

01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:36.190
Well, that was 200 too
many, but the rest escaped.

01:38:36.190 --> 01:38:40.880
And the reason why, it's
not absolutely clear,

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:43.540
and I forget his name, whether
the man who was in charge

01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:48.670
of Denmark at the time
told Dukfitz to do this

01:38:48.670 --> 01:38:51.680
but I'm pretty sure that he
guessed what was happening.

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:55.680
And the reason why was because
over the horizon they could see

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:57.440
the US coming.

01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:00.780
And the guess that you made at
the point that this order went

01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:03.280
out was you guessed that the US,

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:07.290
that the world was probably
going to be a liberal world.

01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:12.090
And, well, he got a lot of
debits on his balance sheet

01:39:12.090 --> 01:39:16.500
and he wanted to try and
finish with one credit.

01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:20.600
And I think that it was even
the looming presence of the US

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.410
at that stage in the war
was a good influence,

01:39:23.410 --> 01:39:25.470
and there's much,
much more behind that.

01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:26.860
So that's just intervention

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.910
because it happened
to be in my head.

01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:31.440
But I want just to come back
to one or two of the questions.

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:35.530
First of all, the
mention of the IMF,

01:39:35.530 --> 01:39:37.210
I think the IMF is
an interesting case

01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:41.040
because the IMF was set-up
to do, to manage a system

01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.760
which is completely
different from the one

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.040
that we have at the moment.

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:48.080
And you thought that this
system was being destroyed

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.020
with the Nixon chalk, as
they called it in Japan.

01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.510
Actually it's not a bad thing

01:39:54.510 --> 01:39:58.140
that we have a serious
international institution

01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:02.500
that has some responsibility,
rather vague,

01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:05.170
for the international
financial system.

01:40:05.170 --> 01:40:07.440
It's not exactly a
lender of last resort,

01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:10.660
that's Wall Street is the lender
of last resort, but the ability

01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:15.800
to cooperate in financial crises
and the ability of the IMF

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:18.470
to steady national
crises and to deal,

01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:22.130
to help Wall Street
basically at the moment deal

01:40:22.130 --> 01:40:24.610
with real international crises.

01:40:24.610 --> 01:40:26.870
I think that that's
actually indispensable

01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:28.380
for the order at the moment.

01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:33.490
So it wasn't what they
planned at Brettenwoods,

01:40:33.490 --> 01:40:38.370
but it's I think still a very,
very valuable institution.

01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:41.620
It makes mistakes like others
do, but learns like others do.

01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:44.390
It's a good thing about
institutions, unlike men,

01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:47.060
is that they sometimes learn.

01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:49.580
Second, a remark on languages.

01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:54.000
The British Ambassador
in Tehran,

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.330
way back when the
Shah was there,

01:40:57.330 --> 01:41:00.390
said that when a British
Minister came to call

01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:05.550
on the Shah and the Shah spoke
English, which he did perfectly,

01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:07.650
it made his blood run cold

01:41:07.650 --> 01:41:11.570
because the British Minister
would think he was dealing

01:41:11.570 --> 01:41:15.520
with an English gentleman,
whereas, he was actually dealing

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:19.240
with somebody who was very
complicated and very different

01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.200
from the way in which he
seemed when he spoke English.

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.350
Consequently, there's
a lot to be said for,

01:41:27.350 --> 01:41:30.990
actually there's a lot to
be said for interpreters,

01:41:30.990 --> 01:41:33.690
at least you know then
that you're dealing

01:41:33.690 --> 01:41:34.990
with a foreign culture

01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:38.820
and foreigners are not
necessarily exactly the same

01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:40.120
as you.

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:46.830
So it's a pity that American
Presidents don't speak however

01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:52.700
many languages that are left,
but it's several thousand.

01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:54.230
But, well, they have diplomats

01:41:54.230 --> 01:41:56.260
and other people
who can help them.

01:41:56.260 --> 01:42:00.000
But one should never forget
that it's not just the language,

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.790
even if the language is the
same the ways of thinking

01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:06.850
and the history and the
words, they're all different.

01:42:06.850 --> 01:42:09.440
And then I come back to
the question that was kind

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:13.490
of in away for me, which
is a complicated one.

01:42:13.490 --> 01:42:15.340
Theresa May, wow.

01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:22.090
The demonstration I was at
last weekend there was somebody

01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:26.940
carrying a sign saying,
hey, hey, Theresa May,

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:29.720
when will you let
us have our say?

01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:33.020
This recalls the last
demonstration I went

01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:35.550
on which was against
the Vietnam war,

01:42:35.550 --> 01:42:40.800
in between I'd missed
the demonstrations, but.

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:42.570
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Being in office.

01:42:42.570 --> 01:42:44.930
&gt;&gt; Robert Cooper: Yes,
Theresa May was never planned

01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:52.050
to be Prime Minister and
she was not intended by God

01:42:52.050 --> 01:42:58.130
to be Prime Minister, but things
sometimes turn out that way.

01:42:58.130 --> 01:43:00.620
And when she became
Prime Minister she knew

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:04.070
that she'd voted
for the other side,

01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:06.920
but the first thing she
thought she'd better do is

01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:10.510
to persuade the BREXITers
that she was one of them.

01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:13.060
So she made some fire
breathing speeches

01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:16.410
about how awful the European
Union was and said we were going

01:43:16.410 --> 01:43:20.460
to leave absolutely everything
that we could possibly leave.

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:22.470
Actually she didn't
really know very much

01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:24.980
about the European
Union at that point.

01:43:24.980 --> 01:43:27.540
Nobody does, it's
only when you leave it

01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:29.570
that you begin to understand it.

01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.540
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev:
Like divorce, yes.

01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:33.940
&gt;&gt; Robert Cooper:
Exactly, exactly.

01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:36.870
She's been on this
voyage of discovery.

01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:41.250
Everybody should, they say
no good marriage is complete

01:43:41.250 --> 01:43:44.350
without one.

01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:47.440
So everybody ought to try
and do a mock divorce early

01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:50.620
on in their marriage and then
they would realize what they

01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.190
were going to lose.

01:43:53.190 --> 01:43:55.730
And she knew about one
specific sector quite well

01:43:55.730 --> 01:43:57.560
and she operated it
quite efficiently,

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.150
it's a very narrow sector
concerned with things

01:44:01.150 --> 01:44:04.100
like European arrest warrant
and very useful instruments

01:44:04.100 --> 01:44:05.620
but a very narrow sector.

01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:07.220
And she's been discovering
all kinds

01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:09.270
of things she didn't
know before,

01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:14.750
like about how a supply
chain works and the problems

01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:16.050
of the Irish border,

01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:17.710
all of these things
that she didn't know.

01:44:17.710 --> 01:44:24.310
And I didn't know, too, even
though I worked 10 years.

01:44:24.310 --> 01:44:31.030
The other thing that she's
learning is she's learning how

01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:34.250
extraordinarily difficult
it is, first of all,

01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:37.230
it's extraordinarily difficult
to negotiate with somebody

01:44:37.230 --> 01:44:39.380
if you don't know what you want.

01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:45.900
And her opening slogan of no
deal is better than a bad deal,

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:48.230
she didn't know what
she meant by a bad deal

01:44:48.230 --> 01:44:50.410
and she certainly
didn't know what, quotes,

01:44:50.410 --> 01:44:52.030
no deal was going to mean.

01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:54.240
So this was completely vacuous

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:59.660
and you can't govern
just by slogans.

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.700
And now as the more
she discovers,

01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:08.370
the more she discovers what is
disaster leaving the European

01:45:08.370 --> 01:45:11.970
Union, potentially is for the
UK, and the more she's trying

01:45:11.970 --> 01:45:13.830
to find ways around it.

01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:16.530
But she's also discovering
that negotiating

01:45:16.530 --> 01:45:20.690
with the European Union
is one definition of hell,

01:45:20.690 --> 01:45:23.480
and negotiating with
the European Union

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.620
on absolutely everything and
all things that are vital

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:30.650
to your country is about as bad
as you can get in terms of hell.

01:45:30.650 --> 01:45:33.530
It's the seventh
circle, or I don't know

01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:39.880
which way the circles go,
anyway it's the hottest part.

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:42.810
And so it would have been better

01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:45.900
if the UK hadn't
started the process

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:48.210
without knowing what it wanted

01:45:48.210 --> 01:45:50.880
and how it was going
to get there.

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:55.550
But the point about the European
Union is it creates fantastic

01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:59.330
solidarity among the
member states because,

01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:06.400
as I think someone said earlier,
I think it was probably Thomas,

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.270
you're always going to need
somebody else's help the next

01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:13.890
day, you can never afford
to break with everybody.

01:46:13.890 --> 01:46:16.590
So if somebody has got
a problem that matters

01:46:16.590 --> 01:46:20.100
to them then you really
take it into account,

01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:22.180
you mold your policy around it.

01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:25.460
The Irish care very, very deeply

01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:27.860
about the Irish border
for very good reason.

01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:32.510
The European Union will not
budge from supporting Ireland

01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:36.280
because it's a member,
it's one of them.

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.910
So for the first time in
history we have Dublin,

01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:41.890
which used to be
kicked around by London

01:46:41.890 --> 01:46:44.900
because it was just a
rather difficult colony,

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:49.910
we have Dublin dictating
the terms to London.

01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:55.030
The European Union is anybody
who wants anything now,

01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:57.020
and the Spanish were talking

01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:58.890
about whether they might
get Gibraltar back,

01:46:58.890 --> 01:47:00.720
I'm not sure how we fix that,

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:04.420
but anybody in the European
Union who wants something

01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:08.650
from Britain is now in
position to demand it.

01:47:08.650 --> 01:47:11.410
So this is the most
awful negotiation

01:47:11.410 --> 01:47:15.000
that you can imagine, and
the most sensible thing

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:18.140
to do would be to give
up the whole idea.

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:22.120
So I think that's probably
a good place to stop.

01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:24.450
&gt;&gt; Thomas Bagger:
Can I have a --

01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:29.080
just because Robert was kind
enough to bring up the case

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.350
of Dukfitz who saved the lives

01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:37.430
of 7,000 Danish Jews 75 years
ago and it brought me back

01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:39.430
to your question
about education.

01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:44.370
The way I tell this story
of the last 30 years to me

01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:47.960
and my own sort of illusions,
intellectual illusions

01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:52.140
about grand convergence and
the end of history is also

01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:55.780
to realize that in
reality the future is open

01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:58.670
and that we should be aware
of the grand generalization.

01:47:58.670 --> 01:48:01.780
So I'm very much with you
on sort of little steps

01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:06.250
to make the world better,
but I like the Dukfitz' case

01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:10.050
because I don't think he did
it because he was concerned

01:48:10.050 --> 01:48:13.590
about a world dominated
by America in the future.

01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:15.930
I think he did it because
he knew it was wrong

01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:19.420
if it went ahead, he knew
what was coming and he decided

01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:22.360
that he was in a position,
he knew the right people

01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.380
to actually open a door for
these 7,000 people to escape

01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:28.720
to Sweden across
the narrow waterway

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:31.680
between Denmark and Sweden.

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:34.060
And what that story
really tells in the midst

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:38.860
of very dark times is
individuals matter,

01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:42.310
people matter, they
can change the world.

01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:46.070
And I think that would
be the fallacy from sort

01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:50.490
of saying farewell to the
grand generalization of 1989,

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:53.350
that the future is sort of
predetermined, only to turn

01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:56.130
around and say, well,
we were too optimistic,

01:48:56.130 --> 01:48:58.270
now the world belongs
to the strong man

01:48:58.270 --> 01:49:00.250
or to the authoritarian system.

01:49:00.250 --> 01:49:02.450
None of that is predetermined
either,

01:49:02.450 --> 01:49:06.400
so it actually does matter
what you're interested in,

01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.540
which position you're in, and
what you do with the space

01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:11.060
that is accorded to you.

01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:14.880
And I think that's actually
quite an optimistic outcome

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.180
for me.

01:49:16.180 --> 01:49:21.750
So my, I would say be curious
and aspire to something.

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:23.940
&gt;&gt; Robert Cooper: And you never
know when you may get the chance

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:25.240
to make some decisive decision.

01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.540
&gt;&gt; Thomas Bagger: We
all don't know, yes,

01:49:26.540 --> 01:49:30.150
and that may be a test
but it also may be a way

01:49:30.150 --> 01:49:33.290
to prove yourself and
actually make the world better.

01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:36.360
&gt;&gt; Ivan Krastev: History does
not end, but the panels do.

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:40.570
And I want very much to thank
you, and I really do believe

01:49:40.570 --> 01:49:43.420
that people matter, even
people on the panel matter.

01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.720
So thank them.

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:46.600
Thank you very much and
thanks to The Kluge Center.
