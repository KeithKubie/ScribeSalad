00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.940
So they've identified
a flaw in your game.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.880
But you aren't sure about how to fix it.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.200
What do you do?

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.130
Well you can make an educated guess.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.010
But the best developers don't guess.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.740
They know, they use A/B testing,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.290
which is testing different versions
of a game at the same time.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.590
And seeing which version gets
the best response from players.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.500
It's called AB, because the simplest
test compared two versions.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.600
An A and B version.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.520
The A version is given to
one half of the games users.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.860
And the B is given to the other half,
and

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.540
we see how each group of users respond.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.510
These tests can help you repair any
game content that you're unsure about.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.520
From the color scheme to game content.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.120
And you can test out two versions or
as many as you want.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.600
Let's walk through an example of
creating effective AB testing scenarios.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.910
Let's say we've made a platform a game,
where we jump around and

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.180
shoot enemies to advance levels.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.250
Our analytics have shown us that only
20% of players make it past Level 3.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.860
We think that the level might
be too hard, so let's change it.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.340
Let's test out different levels of
difficulty and see how users respond.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.040
To see how players respond to different
scenarios, we can use A/B testing,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.100
which is a method of testing that
compares the performance of two or

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.670
more game versions A and B and so on.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.210
The most effective A/B testing
scenarios are designed to test out

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.660
one main variable, X,
Y, count, color, etc.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.420
And they monitor one or two results
like level completion or profitability,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.440
things like that.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.350
Our game versions are distributed
amongst our players.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.340
And so there are usually only
2-4 versions tested at one time.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.940
So for
our game we want to change level 3.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.120
Let's create three different test cases
where we change the number of enemies

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.180
and see how many more players
will complete the level.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.240
You also want to test your original
version and comparison to the new ones.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.360
So we have an A, original version.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.861
A version B with 10% fewer enemies.

00:01:59.861 --> 00:02:03.146
And a version C with 20% fewer enemies.

00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:06.333
The next step is to distribute
these versions to our players, so

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.570
that about a third of our
players play each version.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.490
This is usually done by percentage.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.080
So, we have 33%, 33% and 34%,
which adds up to a total of 100%,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.400
distributed to versions A, B, and C.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.870
Then we get our results and
see how many players complete the level.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.675
We see that only 20% of our group
A players completed the level.

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:34.260
80% of group B completed level 3, and
70% completed level 3 for group C.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.420
So both B and
C seem like a lot better options than A.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.261
And maybe the reason that C isn't as
high as B is because it's too easy, so

00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:45.067
people get bored playing.

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:49.920
Either way, A/B testing let's us know for
sure that version B is our best option.
