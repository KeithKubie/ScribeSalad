00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.009
I want to review a little
bit of what we

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:02.700
did in the last video.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.520
And maybe draw a larger, more
spread-out diagram.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.560
Because I think in the last
video I started to cram things

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.060
on the right-hand side here.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.180
And this is a very important
concept, so I want to do it

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.650
nice and spread-out in a way
that we can breathe.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.860
And maybe in the process I can
fill in some more blanks.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.400
So let's go back and draw the
membrane of a thylakoid that's

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.220
sitting inside of a chloroplast.
I'm going to draw

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.225
this same membrane here.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:30.440
So let me draw it nice
and spread out.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.090
So let me draw a nice big
membrane like that.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.520
That's the inside
of the membrane.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.780
So you can imagine that this
loops around and that would

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.510
form the thylakoid.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.630
On this side of the membrane
we have the lumen.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.120
And on the outside of the
membrane we have the stroma,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.840
where all the fluid that fills
up the choloroplast. So this

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.880
is the stroma right there.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.830
And this is just a kind of
standard membrane that we see

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.010
in a lot of organelles.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.510
But this is actually a membrane
within an organelle.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.870
And then maybe there will be
a phospho-bilipid layer.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.840
And I just say that, or I'm
pointing that out because I

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.950
want to think a little bit
about, in this video, how

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.240
protons can actually get
across this thing.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.770
How do we use the energy from
these electrons going to lower

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.780
energy states to actually pump
protons across this membrane.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.370
So you know when you have these
bilipid layers, your

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.510
outside is hydrophilic.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.560
And of course, it's hydrophilic
because it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.080
operates well in a polar
environment.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.350
And then the insides are
non-polar or they're

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.880
hydrophobic and you
have these tales.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.510
So I could draw the whole
membrane like that, but I

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.996
won't do that.

00:01:38.996 --> 00:01:40.570
It will take me forever.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.060
But let me draw some of the
components that I did in the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.680
last video.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.400
So we have these complexes that

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.590
span across this membrane.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.795
And the place we started
off with was the

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:52.380
photosystem II complex.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.660
And then later on we have the
photosystem I complex.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.699
And let me draw the ATP
synthase right here.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.330
So ATP synthase also
spans across it.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.060
Then it has little
motor part of it.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.750
And the hydrogens go through and
it spins the motor and it

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.280
crams the phosphate groups
into the ADP to make ATP.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.160
I'll talk about that
in a second.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.890
But the first thing I want to
point out is, as I said in the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.370
last video, the first place
where the electrons get

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.710
excited is in the chlorophyll
and photosystem II.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.600
And then it gets less and less
and less excited, it gets

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.150
headed off from one complex
to another complex.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.120
And eventually ends up
in photosystem I.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.780
It gets excited again.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.100
Then it gets handed off, handed
off, the whole time

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.890
that energy is being used to
transfer hydrogen protons from

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.800
the stroma into the lumen .

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.160
But the first question that I
would ask is, why is this

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.710
called photosystem II, while
this is called photosystem I

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.590
when we're starting over here?

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.780
And the reason is, this was
discovered first. Even though

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.520
in the light reaction it
actually comes into use, or it

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.750
comes into play, second.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.780
This was discovered first.
That's why they call it

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.970
photosystem I.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.890
But the reality is photosystem
II is where

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.800
everything starts from.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.910
Now in some textbooks you'll
also see this written as P680.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.420
And you'll see photosystem
I written as P700.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.010
And these numbers come from the
wavelength of light that

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.100
is best absorbed by the
chlorophyll in these

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.590
photosystems. So 680 corresponds
to 680 nanometers.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.490
That's the wavelength of light
that this absorbs the best.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.390
700 corresponds to
700 nanometers.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.710
That's the wavelength of
light it absorbs best.

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.730
Now what I want to do here is
draw a little diagram below

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.980
here to kind of talk
more about the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.160
electron energy states.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.750
I just kind of handwaved it a
little bit in the last video.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.520
So I'm going to draw a
little diagram here.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.540
And over here I'm going to write
the different things

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.020
that the electron can
be a part of.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.930
So right now the electrons
can be part of H2O.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.300
It could be part of
chlorophyll A.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.190
It could be a part of-- I'll
talk more about this in a

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.540
little bit-- pheophytin And
then you have all of the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.980
molecules or the complexes
it can become a part of.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.060
I'll actually write
them down here.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.770
So let me write.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.100
I don't want to take
up too much space.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:56.250
Plastoquinone and then there's
a cytochrome B6F complex.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.500
I'll just write B6F.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.520
Then you have plastocyanin .

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.610
I'll just write as PC.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.270
You don't have to
memorize these.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.030
You'll forget them in
a week if you do.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.710
But unless you're studying
photosynthesis, then it might

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.650
make sense to memorize them.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.570
And this is in photosystem II.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.810
Then you have chlorophyll
in photosystem I.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.380
And then you have some other,
you know you have ferredoxin

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.790
I'll just write FD for
ferredoxin Some other

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.640
molecules, you keep going and
then you have your eventual

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.650
electron acceptor NADP plus.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.020
Which, once it accepts the
electron, becomes NADPH.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.580
Now, electrons are very-- so
this is, if we go up that's a

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.060
high energy state, down it's
a low energy state.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.940
So electrons are already
very comfortable.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.700
in water.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.780
And in chlorophyll A they're
even more comfortable.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.080
At least this is
how I view it.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.120
But left to its own devices,
this electron will never leave

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.360
chlorophyll A.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.150
But we know what happens.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.820
A photon comes in from 93
million miles away.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.250
You could imagine photons as
little light packets or you

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.130
could view it as a light
wave. Either way.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.700
And it excites-- not necessarily
directly the

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.810
chlorophyll A.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.830
It might excite other antenna
chlorophyll or

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.140
other pigment molecules.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.860
And then through resonance
energy, you can imagine them

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.600
vibrating, and it eventually
will excite the

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.240
photophorylation A directly.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.210
Or excite the electrons in
chlorophyll A directly.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.530
And this dude right
here gets excited.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.050
Let me do that in a
brighter color.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.670
So it goes to a high
energy state.

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.020
So the electron here is in
a high energy state.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.200
Ignore that lumen right there.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.040
It has nothing to do
with this electron.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.030
And then it goes-- and actually
when it goes to the

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.840
high energy state, maybe I
should draw it like this, it

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.880
actually shows up
in pheophytin.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.720
That is the primary
electron acceptor.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.620
And it's actually a chlorophyll
A molecule.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.910
Actually, let me show you
what a chlorophyll A

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.680
molecule looks like.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.070
This is what a chlorophyll
A molecule looks like.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.590
In general, it has a
hydrocarbon tail.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.840
You see that right here.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.510
And it has a porphyrin ring.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.710
Or porphyrin head, I guess
you could call it.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.380
This little group right here
is called a porphyrin.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.520
And right in the center of
it, you have a magnesium.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.860
That green right there, that's
a magnesium ion.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.620
And when the photon comes in or
when the resonance energy

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.520
comes in from some of the
antenna molecules, electrons

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.840
in the double bond sitting
here in the

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.870
porphyrin head get excited.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.810
Those are the electrons that
we're talking about.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.590
And they get excited.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.800
And the first electron acceptor
is this pheophytin

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.030
that I just talked about.

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:06.750
Pheophytin.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.830
It actually looks just like a
chlorophyll, but it has no

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.470
magnesium ion in the middle.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.110
And maybe I'm getting a little
bit into the weeds a little

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.850
bit too much.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.960
But the pheophytin, you actually
see in this diagram

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.260
right here.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.160
It's part of this photosystem
complex.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.940
So the electron, you can
imagine, jumping from the

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.090
chlorophyll to the pheophytin
that does not have that

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.390
magnesium in the center.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.220
And when it sits in the
pheophytin it's at a very,

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.430
very, very, very, high
energy state.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:36.330
And then it keeps being
transferred from the

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:36.880
pheophytin.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.860
It goes to the plastoquinone So
maybe we go to a slightly

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.390
lower energy state here.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.650
We keep using the electron
in green.

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:50.230
Then it keeps going to a
slightly lower energy state in

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:52.750
the cytochrome B6F complex.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.210
And then you have the
plastocyanin complex, lower

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.610
energy state.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:02.430
And then eventually it goes into
photosystem I at an even

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.210
lower energy state.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.560
Maybe slightly higher than the
energy state that it was

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.470
originally in the chlorophyll A
molecule in photosystem II.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.350
Another photon or another set
of photons comes and hits

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.290
photosystem I.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:15.780
Maybe its antenna molecules,
through resonance energy, that

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.530
excites the electron.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.380
It might directly hit the
chlorophyll in photosystem in

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.010
its reaction center.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.510
And then this gets
excited again.

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:32.350
And so once again we have an
electron with a high potential

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:36.720
that can keep going to, from one
molecule to another as it

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.070
gets more and more
comfortable.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.640
And this releases energy that
can drive the proton pump.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.110
And it eventually ends
up in the NADPH.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.120
At a fairly high level
of energy still.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.580
This electron can still be
transferred to other things

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.510
and release energy.

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.610
And we'll see that when we
talk about the light

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.180
independent reactions.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.010
Now the whole point of me
showing you this is, I wanted

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.810
to kind of depict graphically
that the electron is starting

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.000
off at a pretty low
energy state.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.430
And the only way this happens
is by energy from light.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.140
This would not happen
on its own.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.880
Going from a low energy state
to a higher energy state.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.320
And I touched on in the last
video, you have this electron

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.410
going here and it gets
transferred from one molecule

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.150
to another.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:21.090
Gets excited again, then keeps
going all the way, eventually

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.650
being accepted by the NAD
plus to become NADPH.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.820
And you're like, where
did that H come from?

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.590
You could say, well that
H is a proton.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.160
It gets that electron and then
they merge together and you

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.340
have NADPH.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:33.050
But either way.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.740
But the question is, what
replaces this electron?

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.060
And that's where that amazing
thing that I talked about in

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.420
the last video happens.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.210
Water gets oxidized.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.060
Oxidizing is losing electrons.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.670
OIL RIG.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:52.110
So water gets oxidized by
the water oxidation

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.890
on photosystem II.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:58.210
And that electron ends up and
replaces the electron in the

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:58.830
chlorophyll.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:00.910
So once again, that's an amazing
idea, that you're

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.730
oxidizing oxygen.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.410
So the net effect of what
happens is, is you're using

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.610
energy, using this photon
energy right here, to

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:15.110
essentially strip electrons
off of water.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.510
And as you know, when it's on
water it's spending most of

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.700
its time on the oxygen.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.770
So it essentially strips
electrons off of oxygen and

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.710
put them in a higher energy
state and have

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.360
them end up on NADPH.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.220
And in the process, it
had gone to an even

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.290
higher energy state.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.200
And then as it goes down to
NADPH, you are pumping protons

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.430
across the membrane.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:39.330
We learned in the last video,
through chemiosmosis,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.470
eventually goes through the ATP
synthase channel, turns

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.680
around this part of this protein
complex or enzyme

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:51.460
complex and actually
generates ATP.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:55.070
ATP from ADP and phosphate
groups.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.740
And in the electron transport
chain video, when I talk about

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.680
cellular respiration, I give a
visual concept of how this

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.630
actually might happen.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.470
How you could, as these go
through, you actually can jam

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.450
together the ATP and the ADP.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.680
So that's another question in
my head is, we talk about

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.600
these electrons going from
one molecule to another.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.780
But how does that actually
pump hydrogen through?

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.210
And I'm just going to do a very
gross oversimplification.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.070
I'm sure it's much more
complicated in

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:24.470
actual plant cells.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:31.140
But you could imagine that we
have our pheophytin right here

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.760
that has that electron
on it right there.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.400
Maybe it has its electron
right there.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.430
This is a gross
oversimplification.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.130
And then you have your
plastoquinone right here.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.520
That's the next acceptor.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.020
Now maybe on this protein
complex right there, the point

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.350
that wants to accept the
electron is right there.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:57.970
And let's say that there's
another point on it that can

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:00.170
accept a hydrogen.

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.170
Maybe it accepts a hydrogen
proton there.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.910
So you can imagine when it's on
this side of the membrane,

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:10.130
a hydrogen can become attached
right there.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.000
And this guy will want to
be attracted to that.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.720
So he'll rotate around.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.860
So you can imagine this-- if
this is kind of a wheel-- this

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:20.530
attraction.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.660
Because the electron wants to
go into a lower energy state

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.370
right here.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.970
It'll rotate around.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.950
That'll allow, essentially, this
hydrogen as it rotates.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.820
As this molecule, as this
protein rotates around this

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:35.050
hydrogen will be able to
cross the barrier.

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:38.290
And then once this guy and
that guy meet, then the

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.750
hydrogen will be on
the other side.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.940
And so it can freely
go away again.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:47.420
So that's, at least in my
head, how I imagine the

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.680
electrons going from a high
energy state to a lower energy

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.250
state, how that can actually
drive a reaction.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.950
Remember, the electrons
want to do this.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:55.760
So they'll attract the different
parts of the

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.920
molecules together.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.260
And as those molecules turn and
rotate and move, that can

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:04.140
help facilitate hydrogen going
from the stroma, the outside

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.440
of the thylakoid, to the inside
of the thylakoid.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.270
That will drive the chemiosmosis
later on.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.310
Now there's one other point
I want to touch on here.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.590
Everything I've described so
far, we started with an

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.020
electron in water.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.880
And obviously when water loses
its hydrogens, it loses both

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.760
the hydrogen protons and
electrons associated with it.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.710
You end up with just water.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.420
So you start off with hydrogens
and then you end up

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.320
with just O2.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.670
And then the hydrogen protons--
the electron got

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.730
taken up by the chlorophyll.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.070
When you start off with that,
we've seen already that you

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.220
end up with the electron
sitting in NADPH.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.400
The electron sitting
out here in NADPH.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.955
At some point you have NAD
as the final acceptor.

00:14:51.955 --> 00:14:54.300
Let me do it in the
right color.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.600
You have NAD plus as
the final acceptor.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.850
And it becomes NADPH.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:04.820
You can imagine it accepts
maybe a hydrogen

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:06.030
proton from out here.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.570
It accepts the electron from
this electron transport chain

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:10.990
in photosynthesis.

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:14.570
And it becomes NADPH and that
travels in the stroma, which

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.230
is where the dark reactions
occur that actually produce

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.340
the carbohydrate.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.710
But this idea of an electron
going from water to NADPH,

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:39.710
this is called non-cyclic
photophosphorylation And it's

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.160
called non-cyclic because you're
not reusing the same

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.610
electrons over and over again.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.705
The electrons start off, and
depending how you view it, in

00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:47.700
the chlorophyll or the water.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.280
And they end up in the NADPH.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.640
Now there's another type of
photophosphorylation and you

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.360
might guess what it's called.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.740
It's called cyclic.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:02.470
Cyclic photophosphorylation
We'll see when we study the

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.280
dark cycles or the Calvin cycle
or the dark reactions or

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.720
the light independent
reactions, that it

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.960
uses a lot of ATP.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.420
Actually ATP in disproportion
to the

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.290
amount of NADPH it uses.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.140
It uses both, but it
uses a ton of ATP.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:24.730
So cyclic phosphorylation only
produces ATP and actually does

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.370
not oxidize water.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.660
So what happens in that
situation is this electron,

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.530
after it gets activated or
after it gets excited in

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.550
photosystem I, it's the
electron, it eventually ends

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:43.470
up-- instead of at NADPH, it
ends up at photosystem II.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.420
So instead of this guy having
to be replaced by electrons

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.990
from water, this guy, in cyclic
photophosphorylation

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:53.390
ends up-- well, maybe I should
do it from here-- ends up

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.980
getting replaced by the
original electrons.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.155
It gets excited here.

00:16:57.155 --> 00:16:59.810
It goes from molecule to
molecule, lower energy states,

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.150
hydrogen gets pumped
into the lumen.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:06.040
Gets excited again in
photosystem I and it enters

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.490
lower and lower energy states.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.050
But then ends up again
in photosystem II.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.319
That is cyclic
photophosphorylation.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:15.140
So you can imagine in this
situation, since the electron

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:20.190
never ends up at NAD plus, you
don't end up producing NADPH.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.010
And since you're replacing
this electron from the

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.230
photosynthesis or from the
electron transport chain

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.110
directly, you don't
have to strip the

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.960
electrons off of the water.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.900
So you're not going to
produce your oxygen.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.360
So, in this situation--
so this non-cyclic

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.620
phosphorylation, which
is kind of what most

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.050
photophosphorylation, is what
most people associate with

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:48.030
photophosphorylation, this
produces O2 and NADPH.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.470
And of course it produces ATP.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.320
While cyclic
photophosphorylation, because

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.890
it doesn't have to strip
electrons off of water and the

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:07.150
electrons don't end up at NADPH,
only produces ATP.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.600
So I think we now have a very
good understanding, hopefully,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.020
of the light reactions
in photosynthesis.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.190
We're now ready to take
the products of this.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.810
Now let's remember what
the products were.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.660
Well, the oxygen just
gets eliminated.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.140
We don't need the
oxygen anymore.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.960
But that goes into the
atmosphere and you and I can

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.400
breathe that and we can use that
for cellular respiration.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.030
But in the photosynthesis
context, we've now generated a

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.430
bunch of ATP.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.610
And now we have a
bunch of NADPH.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.750
And we can use that in
conjunction with carbon

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:44.240
dioxide to produce actual
carbohydrates in the stroma.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.830
Outside the thylakoids, but
we're still inside of the

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.500
chloroplast. And I'll cover
that in the next video.
