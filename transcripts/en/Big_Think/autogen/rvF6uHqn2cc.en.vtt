well parasites are a huge menace to any

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:14.389
well parasites are a huge menace to any
 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.400
well parasites are a huge menace to any
free living organism for one thing

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410
free living organism for one thing
 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.780
free living organism for one thing
they're just a whole bunch of them

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790
they're just a whole bunch of them
 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.310
they're just a whole bunch of them
they're a lot more of those parasites

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320
they're a lot more of those parasites
 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.779
they're a lot more of those parasites
than there are of us so perhaps four

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789
than there are of us so perhaps four
 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.380
than there are of us so perhaps four
five six seven parasites for every free

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390
five six seven parasites for every free
 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.029
five six seven parasites for every free
living species that's one estimate I've

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039
living species that's one estimate I've
 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.460
living species that's one estimate I've
seen although I bet there's a lot more

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470
seen although I bet there's a lot more
 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.720
seen although I bet there's a lot more
and so these things these parasites

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730
and so these things these parasites
 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.810
and so these things these parasites
they're trying to use us and other hosts

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820
they're trying to use us and other hosts
 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.570
they're trying to use us and other hosts
to make more copies of themselves that's

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580
to make more copies of themselves that's
 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.840
to make more copies of themselves that's
what they do and in the process we can

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850
what they do and in the process we can
 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.250
what they do and in the process we can
get pretty sick or die so any kind of

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
get pretty sick or die so any kind of
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.200
get pretty sick or die so any kind of
mutation that might give us a little bit

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210
mutation that might give us a little bit
 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.270
mutation that might give us a little bit
of resistance might be able to let us

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280
of resistance might be able to let us
 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.320
of resistance might be able to let us
evade these parasites it's going to be

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.330
evade these parasites it's going to be
 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.539
evade these parasites it's going to be
incredibly valuable it's going to be

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549
incredibly valuable it's going to be
 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.230
incredibly valuable it's going to be
strongly favored by natural selection

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240
strongly favored by natural selection
 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.320
strongly favored by natural selection
and so you can see the effect of

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330
and so you can see the effect of
 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.750
and so you can see the effect of
parasites on us in lots of different

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760
parasites on us in lots of different
 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.340
parasites on us in lots of different
ways I mean you can just go through the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350
ways I mean you can just go through the
 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.090
ways I mean you can just go through the
genome the human genome and and see that

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100
genome the human genome and and see that
 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.710
genome the human genome and and see that
the fingerprints of parasites there

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720
the fingerprints of parasites there
 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.430
the fingerprints of parasites there
they're all over the place there they

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440
they're all over the place there they
 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.980
they're all over the place there they
have shaped genes that make our immune

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990
have shaped genes that make our immune
 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.840
have shaped genes that make our immune
system better able to recognize certain

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850
system better able to recognize certain
 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.090
system better able to recognize certain
kinds of parasites for example they have

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100
kinds of parasites for example they have
 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.470
kinds of parasites for example they have
in some parts of the world they have

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480
in some parts of the world they have
 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.240
in some parts of the world they have
made people resistant to malaria by

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250
made people resistant to malaria by
 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.190
made people resistant to malaria by
making their blood cells harder for the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200
making their blood cells harder for the
 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.360
making their blood cells harder for the
malaria parasite to invade and on the

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370
malaria parasite to invade and on the
 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.770
malaria parasite to invade and on the
other hand we have also kind of reached

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780
other hand we have also kind of reached
 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.950
other hand we have also kind of reached
kind of an uneasy kind of a date on with

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960
kind of an uneasy kind of a date on with
 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.510
kind of an uneasy kind of a date on with
with some parasites as well if you go to

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520
with some parasites as well if you go to
 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.640
with some parasites as well if you go to
a jungle and look at the people who live

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650
a jungle and look at the people who live
 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.030
a jungle and look at the people who live
there and this can be in the jungle to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040
there and this can be in the jungle to
 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.649
there and this can be in the jungle to
Venezuela or in central Africa or

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659
Venezuela or in central Africa or
 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.450
Venezuela or in central Africa or
what-have-you places far from medical

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460
what-have-you places far from medical
 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.410
what-have-you places far from medical
care people are loaded with parasites

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420
care people are loaded with parasites
 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.690
care people are loaded with parasites
particularly intestinal worms but it

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700
particularly intestinal worms but it
 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.789
particularly intestinal worms but it
generally doesn't harm their help all

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799
generally doesn't harm their help all
 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.559
generally doesn't harm their help all
that much and what's also interesting is

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569
that much and what's also interesting is
 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.600
that much and what's also interesting is
that

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610
that
 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.940
that
people in these parts of world also

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950
people in these parts of world also
 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.570
people in these parts of world also
don't have a lot of allergies whereas if

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580
don't have a lot of allergies whereas if
 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.190
don't have a lot of allergies whereas if
you were to go to a city in Venezuela

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200
you were to go to a city in Venezuela
 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.000
you were to go to a city in Venezuela
for example you would find people who

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010
for example you would find people who
 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.610
for example you would find people who
have very few of these parasites but

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620
have very few of these parasites but
 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.550
have very few of these parasites but
have lots of allergies and other kind of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560
have lots of allergies and other kind of
 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.070
have lots of allergies and other kind of
autoimmune disorders so there is a

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080
autoimmune disorders so there is a
 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.330
autoimmune disorders so there is a
theory that over the past century we we

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
theory that over the past century we we
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.160
theory that over the past century we we
have we have rid ourselves a lot of

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170
have we have rid ourselves a lot of
 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.530
have we have rid ourselves a lot of
these nasty parasites I mean nobody

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540
these nasty parasites I mean nobody
 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.010
these nasty parasites I mean nobody
wants hookworm but the problem is that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020
wants hookworm but the problem is that
 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.830
wants hookworm but the problem is that
our immune systems had evolved to be in

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840
our immune systems had evolved to be in
 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.380
our immune systems had evolved to be in
a kind of a balance with these parasites

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390
a kind of a balance with these parasites
 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.390
a kind of a balance with these parasites
so they sort of hold them in check but

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400
so they sort of hold them in check but
 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.479
so they sort of hold them in check but
they would not attack them too severely

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489
they would not attack them too severely
 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.330
they would not attack them too severely
and it appears that that our immune

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340
and it appears that that our immune
 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.220
and it appears that that our immune
systems have to learn to find this

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230
systems have to learn to find this
 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.690
systems have to learn to find this
balance but if we live a life that is in

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700
balance but if we live a life that is in
 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.990
balance but if we live a life that is in
a sense to clean we can't our bodies

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000
a sense to clean we can't our bodies
 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.270
a sense to clean we can't our bodies
don't learn that balance and so we get

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280
don't learn that balance and so we get
 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.720
don't learn that balance and so we get
thrown off and we might attack some

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730
thrown off and we might attack some
 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.370
thrown off and we might attack some
meaningless thing like a piece of cat

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380
meaningless thing like a piece of cat
 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.039
meaningless thing like a piece of cat
dander or a piece of mold we and we

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049
dander or a piece of mold we and we
 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.440
dander or a piece of mold we and we
totally overreact because our immune

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450
totally overreact because our immune
 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.009
totally overreact because our immune
systems haven't been trained to

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019
systems haven't been trained to
 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.430
systems haven't been trained to
basically calm down so so parasites have

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440
basically calm down so so parasites have
 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.430
basically calm down so so parasites have
have affecting affected us on on all

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440
have affecting affected us on on all
 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.930
have affecting affected us on on all
sorts of different levels

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940
 
 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.660
 
now if you have parasite very often you

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670
now if you have parasite very often you
 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.540
now if you have parasite very often you
don't just want to make your host sick

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550
don't just want to make your host sick
 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.380
don't just want to make your host sick
you actually have other things in mind

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390
you actually have other things in mind
 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.660
you actually have other things in mind
so for example there is a fungus that

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670
so for example there is a fungus that
 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.680
so for example there is a fungus that
lives inside of ants called cordyceps

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690
lives inside of ants called cordyceps
 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.020
lives inside of ants called cordyceps
now the fungus has to get from one ant

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030
now the fungus has to get from one ant
 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.800
now the fungus has to get from one ant
to the next and what it does is it it's

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810
to the next and what it does is it it's
 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.350
to the next and what it does is it it's
going to shower its spores down on

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360
going to shower its spores down on
 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.070
going to shower its spores down on
healthy ants well what that means is

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080
healthy ants well what that means is
 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.289
healthy ants well what that means is
that it's got to get up above those ants

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299
that it's got to get up above those ants
 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.840
that it's got to get up above those ants
so how does it do that what it does is

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850
so how does it do that what it does is
 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.540
so how does it do that what it does is
it infects an ant so spore gets into an

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550
it infects an ant so spore gets into an
 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.400
it infects an ant so spore gets into an
ant and it's or Bros its way in and it

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410
ant and it's or Bros its way in and it
 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.610
ant and it's or Bros its way in and it
starts to to branch out inside of the

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620
starts to to branch out inside of the
 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.670
starts to to branch out inside of the
ant and if you cut these poor ants open

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680
ant and if you cut these poor ants open
 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.170
ant and if you cut these poor ants open
they're like after a while they're just

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180
they're like after a while they're just
 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.690
they're like after a while they're just
pure fungus inside but they're still

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700
pure fungus inside but they're still
 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.430
pure fungus inside but they're still
alive and they look pretty normal

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440
alive and they look pretty normal
 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.720
alive and they look pretty normal
they're going around their business but

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730
they're going around their business but
 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.910
they're going around their business but
eventually when the fungus is ready they

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920
eventually when the fungus is ready they
 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.890
eventually when the fungus is ready they
get a signal and they get this urge to

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900
get a signal and they get this urge to
 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.650
get a signal and they get this urge to
climb upwards and what they do is they

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660
climb upwards and what they do is they
 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.650
climb upwards and what they do is they
climb up plants typically trees or small

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660
climb up plants typically trees or small
 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.890
climb up plants typically trees or small
bushes and they'll go about two feet up

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900
bushes and they'll go about two feet up
 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.750
bushes and they'll go about two feet up
and then they'll find a leaf and they

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760
and then they'll find a leaf and they
 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.820
and then they'll find a leaf and they
will go and they will perch on the

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830
will go and they will perch on the
 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.610
will go and they will perch on the
underside of the leaf usually amazingly

them to do this this very specific thing

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860
them to do this this very specific thing
 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.230
them to do this this very specific thing
and the reason they're doing that is

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240
and the reason they're doing that is
 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.620
and the reason they're doing that is
because it's good for the fungus so what

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630
because it's good for the fungus so what
 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.140
because it's good for the fungus so what
it does is it puts the fungus up in the

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150
it does is it puts the fungus up in the
 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.060
it does is it puts the fungus up in the
air above other ants and now the fungus

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070
air above other ants and now the fungus
 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.890
air above other ants and now the fungus
can get ready to spread what it does is

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900
can get ready to spread what it does is
 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:39.050
can get ready to spread what it does is
it produces a stock that pops out of the

scientists have documented of parasites

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910
scientists have documented of parasites
 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.350
scientists have documented of parasites
manipulating the behavior of their hosts

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360
manipulating the behavior of their hosts
 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.750
manipulating the behavior of their hosts
sometimes it's going from one host to

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:56.760
sometimes it's going from one host to
 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.090
sometimes it's going from one host to
another in the same species there are a

00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100
another in the same species there are a
 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.970
another in the same species there are a
lot of cases where what the parasite

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980
lot of cases where what the parasite
 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.870
lot of cases where what the parasite
wants to do is get from one species to

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880
wants to do is get from one species to
 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.160
wants to do is get from one species to
another species so for example there is

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.170
another species so for example there is
 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.760
another species so for example there is
a parasite called Toxoplasma it's very

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:13.770
a parasite called Toxoplasma it's very
 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.920
a parasite called Toxoplasma it's very
common in birds and rats and so on lots

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930
common in birds and rats and so on lots
 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.890

the final host is cat so you've got

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:33.120
the final host is cat so you've got
 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.880

into a cat rats are very good at not
 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.640

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:29.540
if you get infected with toxoplasma
 

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.360
if you get infected with toxoplasma
generally it's not a big deal because

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.370
generally it's not a big deal because
 

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.980
generally it's not a big deal because
what happens is you may feel a little

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:33.990
what happens is you may feel a little
 

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.160
what happens is you may feel a little
fever but then after a while you recover

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.170
fever but then after a while you recover
 

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.800
fever but then after a while you recover
and you're fine what's happened is that

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:39.810
and you're fine what's happened is that
 

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.130
and you're fine what's happened is that
the Toxoplasma has formed little cysts

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.140
the Toxoplasma has formed little cysts
 

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.290
the Toxoplasma has formed little cysts
in your brain thousands and thousands

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300
in your brain thousands and thousands
 

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.030
in your brain thousands and thousands
and thousands of cysts in your brain and

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040
and thousands of cysts in your brain and
 

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.920
and thousands of cysts in your brain and
it's just hiding there it's just hanging

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:48.930
it's just hiding there it's just hanging
 

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.520
it's just hiding there it's just hanging
out it's still alive in fact every now

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:52.530
out it's still alive in fact every now
 

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.170
out it's still alive in fact every now
and then they might break out but your

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180
and then they might break out but your
 

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:55.820
and then they might break out but your
immune system can sense that they've

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:55.830
immune system can sense that they've
 

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.890
immune system can sense that they've
broken out and they attack them again

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:57.900
broken out and they attack them again
 

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.160
broken out and they attack them again
and they go back into their cysts so

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:01.170
and they go back into their cysts so
 

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.480
and they go back into their cysts so
there's this balance that we strike the

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:05.490
there's this balance that we strike the
 

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:06.530
there's this balance that we strike the
reason that pregnant women aren't

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540
reason that pregnant women aren't
 

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.170
reason that pregnant women aren't
supposed to handle a kitty litter is

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180
supposed to handle a kitty litter is
 

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.450
supposed to handle a kitty litter is
because if the types of plasma gets into

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:13.460
because if the types of plasma gets into
 

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.130
because if the types of plasma gets into
their babies that's when the trouble

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:16.140
their babies that's when the trouble
 

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.840
their babies that's when the trouble
starts because the babies don't have a

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:17.850
starts because the babies don't have a
 

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.390
starts because the babies don't have a
mature immune system yet so there's

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:20.400
mature immune system yet so there's
 

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.370
mature immune system yet so there's
nothing there to keep toxoplasma in

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:22.380
nothing there to keep toxoplasma in
 

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:23.380
nothing there to keep toxoplasma in
check and so

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:23.390
check and so
 

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.630
check and so
replicate like crazy can cause brain

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:25.640
replicate like crazy can cause brain
 

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.370
replicate like crazy can cause brain
damage it's it's not a good thing yeah

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:30.380
damage it's it's not a good thing yeah
 

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.000
damage it's it's not a good thing yeah
so so there we are a billion people

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.010
so so there we are a billion people
 

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.310
so so there we are a billion people
maybe maybe two billion people with

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320
maybe maybe two billion people with
 

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.460
maybe maybe two billion people with
toxoplasma in their brains and we know

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:39.470
toxoplasma in their brains and we know
 

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.130
toxoplasma in their brains and we know
that it can affect a mammal brains and

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:42.140
that it can affect a mammal brains and
 

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.950
that it can affect a mammal brains and
and the fact is that a rat brain and a

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:44.960
and the fact is that a rat brain and a
 

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.820
and the fact is that a rat brain and a
human brain aren't all that different in

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:48.830
human brain aren't all that different in
 

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.500
human brain aren't all that different in
the really basic ways they're quite

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:50.510
the really basic ways they're quite
 

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:55.480
the really basic ways they're quite
similar so is it possible that the

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:55.490
similar so is it possible that the
 

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.350
similar so is it possible that the
Toxoplasma is affecting people it's it's

00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360
Toxoplasma is affecting people it's it's
 

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.070
Toxoplasma is affecting people it's it's
possible the evidence is really I'd say

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.080
possible the evidence is really I'd say
 

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.840
possible the evidence is really I'd say
it's pretty sketchy at this point but

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:04.850
it's pretty sketchy at this point but
 

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.970
it's pretty sketchy at this point but
it's it's evidence that can't be just

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:06.980
it's it's evidence that can't be just
 

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.310
it's it's evidence that can't be just
dismissed out of hand so for example

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320
dismissed out of hand so for example
 

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.250
dismissed out of hand so for example
people with toxoplasma have been

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:12.260
people with toxoplasma have been
 

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.350
people with toxoplasma have been
reported to get into more traffic

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360
reported to get into more traffic
 

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.590
reported to get into more traffic
accidents so does this mean they're

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600
accidents so does this mean they're
 

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.810
accidents so does this mean they're
being more reckless that they're not

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:19.820
being more reckless that they're not
 

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.680
being more reckless that they're not
being as anxious as a normal human or

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:23.690
being as anxious as a normal human or
 

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:25.630
being as anxious as a normal human or
rat might be I don't know the answer to

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:25.640
rat might be I don't know the answer to
 

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.350
rat might be I don't know the answer to
that but the fact remains that we have

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360
that but the fact remains that we have
 

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.000
that but the fact remains that we have
these mind-altering parasites in our

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.010
these mind-altering parasites in our
 

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.550
these mind-altering parasites in our
brains and so I think we had to figure

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:33.560
brains and so I think we had to figure
 

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.650
brains and so I think we had to figure
out what they're doing

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:37.660
 
 

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:42.570
 
there are lots of diseases in the

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:42.580
there are lots of diseases in the
 

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.060
there are lots of diseases in the
tropics that we fortunately don't have

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.070
tropics that we fortunately don't have
 

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.030
tropics that we fortunately don't have
to contend with in places like the

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.040
to contend with in places like the
 

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.010
to contend with in places like the
United States and we should consider

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:50.020
United States and we should consider
 

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.170
United States and we should consider
ourselves fortunate because some of them

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:52.180
ourselves fortunate because some of them
 

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.720
ourselves fortunate because some of them
are really horrendous particularly

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:54.730
are really horrendous particularly
 

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.310
are really horrendous particularly
horrendous one is called sleeping

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320
horrendous one is called sleeping
 

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.550
horrendous one is called sleeping
sickness sleeping sickness is caused by

00:11:59.550 --> 00:11:59.560
sickness sleeping sickness is caused by
 

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.430
sickness sleeping sickness is caused by
a single-celled organism called the

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440
a single-celled organism called the
 

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.860
a single-celled organism called the
trypanosome and it looks like a little

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:06.870
trypanosome and it looks like a little
 

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.360
trypanosome and it looks like a little
fluke or a kind of a flatworm under a

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.370
fluke or a kind of a flatworm under a
 

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.740
fluke or a kind of a flatworm under a
microscope but it's obviously much

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:10.750
microscope but it's obviously much
 

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.910
microscope but it's obviously much
tinier than that they are carried inside

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920
tinier than that they are carried inside
 

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.180
tinier than that they are carried inside
certain kinds of flies in Africa and

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:18.190
certain kinds of flies in Africa and
 

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.750
certain kinds of flies in Africa and
these flies will bite people and they

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760
these flies will bite people and they
 

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.790
these flies will bite people and they
will inject these parasites these

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:23.800
will inject these parasites these
 

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.110
will inject these parasites these
trypanosomes into these humans who would

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.120
trypanosomes into these humans who would
 

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.180
trypanosomes into these humans who would
then start to get sick and they do that

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:30.190
then start to get sick and they do that
 

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.010
then start to get sick and they do that
something called sleeping sickness which

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:32.020
something called sleeping sickness which
 

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.800
something called sleeping sickness which
you know not surprisingly makes you very

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:34.810
you know not surprisingly makes you very
 

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.560
you know not surprisingly makes you very
tired and rundown the real problem is

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:37.570
tired and rundown the real problem is
 

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.080
tired and rundown the real problem is
that unless you treated it is quite

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:40.090
that unless you treated it is quite
 

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:45.470
that unless you treated it is quite
fatal and so it's a serious problem in

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480
fatal and so it's a serious problem in
 

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.660
fatal and so it's a serious problem in
particularly in the belt just below the

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:48.670
particularly in the belt just below the
 

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:53.060
particularly in the belt just below the
Sahara now a 100 years ago it was a

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.070
Sahara now a 100 years ago it was a
 

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.830
Sahara now a 100 years ago it was a
quite a serious problem I'm much more

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:55.840
quite a serious problem I'm much more
 

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.050
quite a serious problem I'm much more
serious than it is today but it's been

00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:58.060
serious than it is today but it's been
 

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.140
serious than it is today but it's been
gradually eradicated from a lot of

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:01.150
gradually eradicated from a lot of
 

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:05.280
gradually eradicated from a lot of
places where it was a big problem it was

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.290
places where it was a big problem it was
 

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.680
places where it was a big problem it was
eradicated through good public health

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:07.690
eradicated through good public health
 

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.070
eradicated through good public health
through through treating people and

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:11.080
through through treating people and
 

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.190
through through treating people and
through trying to attack the population

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:14.200
through trying to attack the population
 

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.370
through trying to attack the population
of the Flies to basically break the

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:17.380
of the Flies to basically break the
 

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.800
of the Flies to basically break the
cycle of transmission and it's worked in

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:19.810
cycle of transmission and it's worked in
 

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.980
cycle of transmission and it's worked in
a lot of places and this is a story that

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:22.990
a lot of places and this is a story that
 

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.840
a lot of places and this is a story that
has been replicated with a number of

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:24.850
has been replicated with a number of
 

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.880
has been replicated with a number of
parasites with with for example a

river blindness it's a worm that
 

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:35.100
river blindness it's a worm that
actually like gets into your system and

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.110
actually like gets into your system and
 

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.290
actually like gets into your system and
can get into your eye and inflamed your

can get into your eye and inflamed your
 

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.960
can get into your eye and inflamed your
eye and scars it until you're blind

eye and scars it until you're blind
 

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.510
eye and scars it until you're blind
that's that is being very nicely

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:42.520
that's that is being very nicely
 

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.400
that's that is being very nicely
eradicated and other diseases well
