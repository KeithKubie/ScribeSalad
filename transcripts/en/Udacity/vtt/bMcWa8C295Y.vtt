00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Of course, the step size simply is the total time divided by the number of steps.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
To store the positions and the velocities, we have to make space for one more entry,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which is the initial condition.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We start the position vector at the right location,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
meaning that its x component is equal to the radius computed above,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the y component of the velocity is equal to the speed computed above.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The other components are equal to zero. This is the forward Euler method as we know it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And then we compute the distance between the ultimate position and the initial position

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
using this number function and we return that as the error.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So this is the result, what do we learn if we have the step size of 100 seconds,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
our end result will be off about 1.5*10â ˇ m about 15 million meters,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and you see that this relationship seems to be linear.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We are going to look into that in the next second.
