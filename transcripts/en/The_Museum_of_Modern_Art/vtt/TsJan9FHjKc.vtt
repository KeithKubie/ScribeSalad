00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.899
Hi, my name is Martine Syms, and we're here
at MoMA on the third floor outside of my exhibition,

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.040
Projects 106.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.040
That's me.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.809
Normally, the curators do these tours, but
since I'm alive I thought I should tell you

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.809
about my show.

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:22.230
So, the exhibition is focused around my first
feature film, "Incense, Sweaters, and Ice,"

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.160
and it's physically kind of the center of
the show and grounds the space, and your action

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.230
in it as you kind of watch it is focused here.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.020
One of the key kind of themes is the Great
Migration, which was blacks moving from the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.210
rural South to the urban North.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.931
I have the film itself moving between these
three screens in the space.

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:53.510
So, you have to migrate between...around this
kind of circle to think about it.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.109
This film was actually adapted from a performance
that I've been doing called "Misdirected Kiss,"

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:07.580
which looked at some of this transitional
period in cinema and beyond, and kind of performances

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.410
of femininity, especially black femininity.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.660
And, as part of that sort of performance,
I create this, like, real time collage behind

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.070
me using multiple screens, and videos, and
audio, and text that continue to layer and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.560
kind of play and loop.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.200
And, so I wanted to bring that experience
into the gallery, and the way I decided to

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.280
do that was through an augmented reality app.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.330
You can go to mo.ma/syms (my last name S-Y-M-S),
and if you download this app, it's called

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:48.590
WYDRN, which is maybe something someone's
texted you before, late night perhaps, which

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.970
means "what are you doing right now?"

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.950
Basically, you need to have your audio on
and turned up.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.540
Some of them have audio, but if you hold it
over some of this images, it will populate

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.380
with additional kind of media.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.770
That's another part of the film, so in this
one is a sequence of GIFs that are a key part

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.060
of some of the ideas that we talk about, that
I talk about in the film, and that the character

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.190
kind of goes through.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.200
There's a suite of kind of 12 photographs
that are hung on the gallery walls, and each

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.000
of those are stills or images that were taken
in production.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.310
Some are directly...you know, you'll see a
scene in the film that is replicated sort

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.670
of in one of the photographs in a way, and
then other ones are more that were just taken

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.920
over the course as I was shooting in each
of these locations.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.530
And, I chose to print them on found movie
posters that were sort of directed towards

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.610
black audiences because that was something
I was thinking about is what are these key

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.110
signifiers around blackness and black audience,
and what would be marketed towards them?

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.960
So, each of them is printed [00:08:30] on
top of that, producing this, again, kind of

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.810
a collage or a double exposure kind of image.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.819
This is a group chat.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.840
There's a really intense karaoke scene, and
this is, like, everyone planning the karaoke

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840
scene.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.920
The main character, Girl, is loosely based
on my mom as a kind of character, and I interviewed

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.080
her to use as a research.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.100
Her voice is also heard in this, but, also,
to use...to direct the performer.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.870
And, at the end of her interview, that's what
she said, "Boring life, isn't it?"

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.630
And, so this one has a selection of photos
from my family archive.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.510
The main character's name is Girl, but not
maybe the way you might think.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.810
It's Girl...or, maybe the way you would think.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.130
It's Girl the way you would say to a friend,
like, "Girl, oh, my God, you would not believe

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.970
what he said to me," or you'd say like, "Girl,
I can't even today."

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.490
It's that kind of "Girl," and the way that
that it spoken and talked about is sort of

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:57.900
reiterated in this wall painting that has
"Girl" spelled in different iterations that

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.600
are supposed to be, like, different ways you
would say it, you know.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.930
So, there's three Rs, three Ls.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.070
I don't know.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.500
"Girrrl," "Girlll.”

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.819
Things like that, you know?

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:10.970
If you say the word...

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:11.970
I say it a lot.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.990
The is a frequent expression of mine.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:23.310
I mean, the easiest way to explain why I use
the color purple in a lot of my work is to

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.530
make people say the phrase "the color purple."

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.160
There's a lot of associations with that phrase,
some of which you may be familiar with, like

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.160
Alice Walker's work.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:40.020
And, around that are a kind of feminist, specifically
black feminist, tradition that I'm trying

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.560
to be a part of with my own work.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.090
And, so it's really this, kind of like I talked
about with the painting, relationship between

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.180
spoken word and text and how I can produce
a certain effect.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.910
I'm really interested in scoring.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.570
One of the things with my film and with the
way that I make work sort of improvisationally

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.060
is my scripts, as well as the way that this
program operates the videos.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.020
It creates a situation where I have these
rules that hopefully people will do while

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.020
they're in this space.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.300
So, one of those is you walk in here, and
you think the color purple.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.180
I know people are gonna come in here, I see
them around the rest of the museum using their

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.130
phones, and hopefully using the app.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.900
And, so I wanted to take these activities
and these actions that we're already doing,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.460
that are already part of culture, and use
them to create this other narrative and play

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.020
with some of the feelings that we have just,
you know, like, the anxiety of you send a

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.950
text message and you see those dots.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.960
Are you gonna get a response?

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.740
Kind of use those cues that we're already
really familiar with to create work with.
