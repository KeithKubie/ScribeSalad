the first of all I'm going to start with

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
the first of all I'm going to start with
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.350
the first of all I'm going to start with
is that research has found that 86% of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
is that research has found that 86% of
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.170
is that research has found that 86% of
users do not like creating and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
users do not like creating and
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.899

remembering new passwords to interact
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.359
remembering new passwords to interact
with you what I find stunning about this

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
with you what I find stunning about this
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.179
with you what I find stunning about this
number is that it's not higher right I

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
number is that it's not higher right I
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.459
number is that it's not higher right I
mean I certainly hate going to a new app

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469

for what's a valid password and what
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.400
for what's a valid password and what
isn't a valid password and

to remember what that user name and
 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.670
to remember what that user name and
password was 86% there according to

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
password was 86% there according to
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.590
password was 86% there according to
research the next number is 54% of users

also secure one thing I'm going to talk

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750
also secure one thing I'm going to talk
 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.330
also secure one thing I'm going to talk
about in a moment is phishing and

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340
about in a moment is phishing and
 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.670
about in a moment is phishing and
hacking and being me there's lots more

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680
hacking and being me there's lots more
 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.560
hacking and being me there's lots more
stats so I'll have a lot more stats on

stats so I'll have a lot more stats on
 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.060
stats so I'll have a lot more stats on
phishing and hacking but before I get to

Google have done that for you so I think

that's something that it's very secure

then the next part of this and it's part
 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.869
then the next part of this and it's part
I'll be frank that we kind of failed on

00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879
I'll be frank that we kind of failed on
 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:13.939
I'll be frank that we kind of failed on
but we're really improving on is making

like September of this year the API was
 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.360
like September of this year the API was
quite complex there would be a case of

Google API clients but what would happen

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:32.279
Google API clients but what would happen
 

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:33.469
Google API clients but what would happen
is the first thing that the user would

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479
is the first thing that the user would
 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:36.499
is the first thing that the user would
see is a dialog asking them well which

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:36.509
see is a dialog asking them well which
 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.749
see is a dialog asking them well which
ID are you signing in with that would

00:07:38.749 --> 00:07:38.759
ID are you signing in with that would
 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.519
ID are you signing in with that would
actually error out the connection

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:40.529
actually error out the connection
 

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:42.589
actually error out the connection
process and how you was a programmer

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599
process and how you was a programmer
 

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:44.059
process and how you was a programmer
would handle that is by handling that

00:07:44.059 --> 00:07:44.069
would handle that is by handling that
 

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:46.820
would handle that is by handling that
error then once the user has selected

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:46.830
error then once the user has selected
 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.430
error then once the user has selected
their ID then in many cases the

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440
their ID then in many cases the

application would ask them for some kind

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.330
application would ask them for some kind
 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.019
application would ask them for some kind
of permission like maybe accessing

00:07:53.019 --> 00:07:53.029
of permission like maybe accessing
 

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:55.249
of permission like maybe accessing
contents or if you're building something

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259
contents or if you're building something
 

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:56.809
contents or if you're building something
for example that uses Google Drive to

00:07:56.809 --> 00:07:56.819
for example that uses Google Drive to
 

00:07:56.819 --> 00:07:58.430
for example that uses Google Drive to
give the user to give their permission

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440
give the user to give their permission
 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.740
give the user to give their permission
to access Google Drive that would also

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:00.750
to access Google Drive that would also
 

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.839
to access Google Drive that would also
error out the connection process and

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:02.849
error out the connection process and
 

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:04.219
error out the connection process and
you'd have to handle that as if it was

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:04.229
you'd have to handle that as if it was
 

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:06.589
you'd have to handle that as if it was
an error and how you knew when the user

00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599
an error and how you knew when the user
 

00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:08.180
an error and how you knew when the user
was sign-in was when your Google API

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.190
was sign-in was when your Google API
 

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.950
was sign-in was when your Google API
connected and it handled all these

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960
connected and it handled all these
 

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.110
connected and it handled all these
errors and you know as a developer to me

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120
errors and you know as a developer to me
 

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.029
errors and you know as a developer to me
I find I found that a little bit ugly

00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:14.039
I find I found that a little bit ugly
 

00:08:14.039 --> 00:08:15.890
I find I found that a little bit ugly
you know a user picking their name is

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900
you know a user picking their name is
 

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.709
you know a user picking their name is
not an error a user giving permission is

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:18.719
not an error a user giving permission is
 

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:21.079
not an error a user giving permission is
not an error and so we've really really

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:21.089
not an error and so we've really really
 

00:08:21.089 --> 00:08:22.550
not an error and so we've really really
improved the API I'm gonna be showing

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560
improved the API I'm gonna be showing
 

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.409
improved the API I'm gonna be showing
off some of the stuff in the API so I

00:08:24.409 --> 00:08:24.419
off some of the stuff in the API so I
 

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:26.179
off some of the stuff in the API so I
find it a lot easier I find it a lot

00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:26.189
find it a lot easier I find it a lot
 

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:27.230
find it a lot easier I find it a lot
quicker I find it a lot more

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240
quicker I find it a lot more
 

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.110
quicker I find it a lot more
straightforward I hope you do too and

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120
straightforward I hope you do too and
 

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.129
straightforward I hope you do too and
then the next thing is to make it

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139
then the next thing is to make it
 

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:33.230
then the next thing is to make it
extensible it's all very well if you've

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240
extensible it's all very well if you've
 

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.880
extensible it's all very well if you've
got a mobile device and you've got a

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:34.890
got a mobile device and you've got a
 

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:36.409
got a mobile device and you've got a
sign-in dialogue in the mobile device

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419
sign-in dialogue in the mobile device
 

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.360
sign-in dialogue in the mobile device
and the user has signed into the device

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:38.370
and the user has signed into the device
 

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.240
and the user has signed into the device
on that but then what most of you likely

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.250
on that but then what most of you likely
 

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.100
on that but then what most of you likely
have some kind of back-end service most

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:43.110
have some kind of back-end service most
 

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.660
have some kind of back-end service most
of you are probably storing some kind of

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:44.670
of you are probably storing some kind of
 

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.430
of you are probably storing some kind of
data in that back-end service that as

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440
data in that back-end service that as
 

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.139
data in that back-end service that as
the user signing in some of the

00:08:48.139 --> 00:08:48.149
the user signing in some of the
 

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:50.120
the user signing in some of the
customization of the app comes from that

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.130
customization of the app comes from that
 

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.880
customization of the app comes from that
data and maybe you want that data to be

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:52.890
data and maybe you want that data to be
 

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.260
data and maybe you want that data to be
secured to

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:54.270
secured to
 

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.880
secured to
now think about what can happen with a

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:55.890
now think about what can happen with a
 

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.579
now think about what can happen with a
middleman attack between the device and

00:08:58.579 --> 00:08:58.589
middleman attack between the device and
 

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:00.019
middleman attack between the device and
your server we'll talk about that a

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:00.029
your server we'll talk about that a
 

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:01.880
your server we'll talk about that a
little bit later in the presentation but

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:01.890
little bit later in the presentation but
 

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.019
little bit later in the presentation but
one of the things about sign-in with

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:03.029
one of the things about sign-in with
 

00:09:03.029 --> 00:09:05.660
one of the things about sign-in with
Google is it's not just about your phone

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:05.670
Google is it's not just about your phone
 

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.310
Google is it's not just about your phone
it's not just about your device it's

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:07.320
it's not just about your device it's
 

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.110
it's not just about your device it's
also about being able to secure back-end

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120
also about being able to secure back-end
 

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.860
also about being able to secure back-end
services ok so first of all I'd like to

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:12.870
services ok so first of all I'd like to
 

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.260
services ok so first of all I'd like to
talk a little bit about the UX and some

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:15.270
talk a little bit about the UX and some
 

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.310
talk a little bit about the UX and some
of the things that we've done to help

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320
of the things that we've done to help
 

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.230
of the things that we've done to help
you focus on the user reduce some of

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240
you focus on the user reduce some of
 

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.870
you focus on the user reduce some of
this friction and improve the UX so my

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880
this friction and improve the UX so my
 

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.000
this friction and improve the UX so my
speaker notes one is really small here

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.010
speaker notes one is really small here
 

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:24.740
speaker notes one is really small here
so I'm gonna just turn around so this is

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:24.750
so I'm gonna just turn around so this is
 

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.139
so I'm gonna just turn around so this is
what it used to look like so on the very

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:27.149
what it used to look like so on the very
 

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:29.060
what it used to look like so on the very
left hand side you have your application

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.070
left hand side you have your application
 

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.280
left hand side you have your application
and you've got a set of sign-in buttons

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:31.290
and you've got a set of sign-in buttons
 

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.170
and you've got a set of sign-in buttons
like the top one is sign-in with Google

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:33.180
like the top one is sign-in with Google
 

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.030
like the top one is sign-in with Google
the middle one is Facebook the bottom

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040
the middle one is Facebook the bottom
 

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.889
the middle one is Facebook the bottom
one I think is Yahoo so the user would

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:36.899
one I think is Yahoo so the user would
 

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:38.269
one I think is Yahoo so the user would
pick sign-in with Google what would

00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279
pick sign-in with Google what would
 

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:40.280
pick sign-in with Google what would
happen well first of all they will get a

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:40.290
happen well first of all they will get a
 

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.680
happen well first of all they will get a
request asking can this access their

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:42.690
request asking can this access their
 

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.100
request asking can this access their
contacts can this access your contacts

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.110
contacts can this access your contacts
 

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.889
contacts can this access your contacts
why when signing in to this application

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:48.899
why when signing in to this application
 

00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:50.180
why when signing in to this application
should this application access my

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:50.190
should this application access my
 

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.579
should this application access my
contacts and I there's a rule of thumb

00:09:52.579 --> 00:09:52.589
contacts and I there's a rule of thumb
 

00:09:52.589 --> 00:09:54.530
contacts and I there's a rule of thumb
that I like to follow that every time

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540
that I like to follow that every time
 

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.530
that I like to follow that every time
you give the user a choice that really

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540
you give the user a choice that really
 

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.900
you give the user a choice that really
isn't relevant to what they want to do

00:09:59.900 --> 00:09:59.910
isn't relevant to what they want to do
 

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.300
isn't relevant to what they want to do
at this moment in time you lose 90% of

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:02.310
at this moment in time you lose 90% of
 

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.310
at this moment in time you lose 90% of
them and to me this is a great case

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320
them and to me this is a great case
 

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.230
them and to me this is a great case
where you could lose 90% of them so you

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240
where you could lose 90% of them so you
 

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.910
where you could lose 90% of them so you
then select that when the user is very

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920
then select that when the user is very
 

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.800
then select that when the user is very
nice and they say okay yes I will and

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:09.810
nice and they say okay yes I will and
 

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.210
nice and they say okay yes I will and
then they get this oh you've got to give

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:11.220
then they get this oh you've got to give
 

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.880
then they get this oh you've got to give
me permission and then they say ok to

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:13.890
me permission and then they say ok to
 

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.710
me permission and then they say ok to
that and then it's like ok

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720
that and then it's like ok
 

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.750
that and then it's like ok
once they've given permission now have

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:17.760
once they've given permission now have
 

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.610
once they've given permission now have
to ask for the contacts again once they

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620
to ask for the contacts again once they
 

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.410
to ask for the contacts again once they
give that permission now finally oh

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420
give that permission now finally oh
 

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.380
give that permission now finally oh
you've got what account do you want to

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.390
you've got what account do you want to
 

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.240
you've got what account do you want to
sign in with this phone only has one

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.250
sign in with this phone only has one
 

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.889
sign in with this phone only has one
account on it but yet you need to tell

00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:27.899
account on it but yet you need to tell
 

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:28.970
account on it but yet you need to tell
me the account that you're going to sign

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:28.980
me the account that you're going to sign
 

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.860
me the account that you're going to sign
in with so that's there what is that's

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:30.870
in with so that's there what is that's
 

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.660
in with so that's there what is that's
the fifth from the left it's once

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:32.670
the fifth from the left it's once
 

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.160
the fifth from the left it's once
they've picked that one and they sign in

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.170
they've picked that one and they sign in
 

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.530
they've picked that one and they sign in
now guess what this user didn't have a

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:36.540
now guess what this user didn't have a
 

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.110
now guess what this user didn't have a
Google+ profile oh we can't continue we

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120
Google+ profile oh we can't continue we
 

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.940
Google+ profile oh we can't continue we
need to fill out a Google+ profile so

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:40.950
need to fill out a Google+ profile so
 

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.079
need to fill out a Google+ profile so
this group they would have to fill out a

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:42.089
this group they would have to fill out a
 

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:44.389
this group they would have to fill out a
Google+ profile they create that submit

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399
Google+ profile they create that submit
 

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:47.210
Google+ profile they create that submit
and then finally guess what it's asking

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220
and then finally guess what it's asking
 

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.100
and then finally guess what it's asking
them for their basic info including the

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.110
them for their basic info including the
 

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.199
them for their basic info including the
list of their contacts and then they say

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:51.209
list of their contacts and then they say
 

00:10:51.209 --> 00:10:52.579
list of their contacts and then they say
ok to that they allow it and then

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:52.589
ok to that they allow it and then
 

00:10:52.589 --> 00:10:53.990
ok to that they allow it and then
finally they're in sign into the

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000
finally they're in sign into the
 

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.910
finally they're in sign into the
application there's a lot of friction

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920
application there's a lot of friction
 

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.130
application there's a lot of friction
here we understand this so we've tried

00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:58.140
here we understand this so we've tried
 

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.050
here we understand this so we've tried
to improve it and we fixed it so now it

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060
to improve it and we fixed it so now it
 

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.740
to improve it and we fixed it so now it
looks like this so now we say ok let's

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:03.750
looks like this so now we say ok let's
 

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.540
looks like this so now we say ok let's
get started let's sign-in with Google

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:05.550
get started let's sign-in with Google
 

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.490
get started let's sign-in with Google
the first thing is well we just need to

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500
the first thing is well we just need to
 

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.060
the first thing is well we just need to
know which

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:08.070
know which
 

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.440
know which
on your phone you're signing in with in

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:09.450
on your phone you're signing in with in
 

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.820
on your phone you're signing in with in
this case I'm going to pick the account

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:10.830
this case I'm going to pick the account
 

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.090
this case I'm going to pick the account
and then I'm in most cases I'm straight

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.100
and then I'm in most cases I'm straight
 

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.220
and then I'm in most cases I'm straight
into the app there is sometimes there

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.230
into the app there is sometimes there
 

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.930
into the app there is sometimes there
will be another step between the second

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:17.940
will be another step between the second
 

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.880
will be another step between the second
and third of these and that's if the

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:19.890
and third of these and that's if the
 

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.980
and third of these and that's if the
user has to give specific permissions to

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:21.990
user has to give specific permissions to
 

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.510
user has to give specific permissions to
access something I'd like to use Google

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:23.520
access something I'd like to use Google
 

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.130
access something I'd like to use Google
Drive as an example so if you're

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140
Drive as an example so if you're
 

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.660
Drive as an example so if you're
building an application that accesses

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:26.670
building an application that accesses
 

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.700
building an application that accesses
their stuff on Google Drive then they

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:28.710
their stuff on Google Drive then they
 

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.160
their stuff on Google Drive then they
would have a you know a third step in

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.170
would have a you know a third step in
 

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.480
would have a you know a third step in
between the middle one and the one on

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:32.490
between the middle one and the one on
 

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:33.830
between the middle one and the one on
the right here but that's how

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:33.840
the right here but that's how
 

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.870
the right here but that's how
frictionless it has become we're really

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880
frictionless it has become we're really
 

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.400
frictionless it has become we're really
really proud of this we ship this in the

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:37.410
really proud of this we ship this in the
 

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.660
really proud of this we ship this in the
last version of Google Play services

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:38.670
last version of Google Play services
 

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.390
last version of Google Play services
back in September ish and we think it'll

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:41.400
back in September ish and we think it'll
 

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.340
back in September ish and we think it'll
make it a lot easier for your users to

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:43.350
make it a lot easier for your users to
 

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.500
make it a lot easier for your users to
be able to sign in and to be able to

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:45.510
be able to sign in and to be able to
 

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.700
be able to sign in and to be able to
feel secure in signing in without

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:46.710
feel secure in signing in without
 

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.770
feel secure in signing in without
without all these dialogs asking them

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:48.780
without all these dialogs asking them
 

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:50.720
without all these dialogs asking them
for a stuff sometimes stuff that may not

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:50.730
for a stuff sometimes stuff that may not
 

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.010
for a stuff sometimes stuff that may not
be actually relevant to what they're

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.020
be actually relevant to what they're
 

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.640
be actually relevant to what they're
doing right now so the next part is I

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:55.650
doing right now so the next part is I
 

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.010
doing right now so the next part is I
spoke about security and one of the

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:58.020
spoke about security and one of the
 

00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.570
spoke about security and one of the
points so we've made it easier for your

00:11:59.570 --> 00:11:59.580
points so we've made it easier for your
 

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.920
points so we've made it easier for your
end users and now we want to talk about

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:00.930
end users and now we want to talk about
 

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.300
end users and now we want to talk about
security and I think it's really

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:02.310
security and I think it's really
 

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.800
security and I think it's really
important in security that security

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:03.810
important in security that security
 

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.420
important in security that security
isn't a static thing security is always

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:05.430
isn't a static thing security is always
 

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.550
isn't a static thing security is always
a moving target and it's really really

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560
a moving target and it's really really
 

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.930
a moving target and it's really really
important to stay ahead of the game and

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940
important to stay ahead of the game and
 

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.030
important to stay ahead of the game and
as part of like our job at Google is to

as part of like our job at Google is to
 

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.500
as part of like our job at Google is to
stay ahead of the game in the security

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:12.510
stay ahead of the game in the security
 

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:13.940
stay ahead of the game in the security

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:08.580
like that is at risk every single day
 

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.730
like that is at risk every single day
from hackers now a lot of this stuff of

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:10.740
from hackers now a lot of this stuff of
 

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.070
from hackers now a lot of this stuff of
course was inside jobs some of the

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:13.080
course was inside jobs some of the
 

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.140
course was inside jobs some of the
retail ones where people had planted a

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:15.150
retail ones where people had planted a
 

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.210
retail ones where people had planted a
worm inside the credit card scanning

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220
worm inside the credit card scanning
 

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.740
worm inside the credit card scanning

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:18.750
machines that was able to collect data
 

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.660
machines that was able to collect data
about credit cards that were scanned you

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:20.670
about credit cards that were scanned you
 

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:21.920
about credit cards that were scanned you
know so it's a little bit of it

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:21.930
know so it's a little bit of it
 

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.060
know so it's a little bit of it
different scenario than you may be

really a feeling of insecurity that
 

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.360
really a feeling of insecurity that
people are out there to get them and

it's our job to at least try to help

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:34.589
it's our job to at least try to help
 

00:13:34.589 --> 00:13:36.139
it's our job to at least try to help
them feel a little bit more secure when

00:13:36.139 --> 00:13:36.149
them feel a little bit more secure when
 

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.820
them feel a little bit more secure when
they're using your apps when they're

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:37.830
they're using your apps when they're
 

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.019
they're using your apps when they're
using your sites that kind of thing so

00:13:41.019 --> 00:13:41.029
using your sites that kind of thing so
 

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:43.400
using your sites that kind of thing so
you don't want to be this guy and you

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:43.410
you don't want to be this guy and you
 

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.680
you don't want to be this guy and you
want to help them not to be this guy you

want to help them not to be this guy you
 

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.120
want to help them not to be this guy you
know sometimes I think I should just

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.130
know sometimes I think I should just
 

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.980
know sometimes I think I should just
change my password to incorrect you know

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:48.990
change my password to incorrect you know
 

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.960

for this reason you know we really want

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:50.970
for this reason you know we really want
 

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:53.780
for this reason you know we really want
to help them not be this guy so the next

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:53.790
to help them not be this guy so the next
 

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:54.740
to help them not be this guy so the next
part that I want to talk about a little

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:54.750
part that I want to talk about a little
 

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.660
part that I want to talk about a little
bit is the bit one of the biggest things

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:56.670
bit is the bit one of the biggest things
 

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.579
bit is the bit one of the biggest things
where your users are at risk and that's

00:13:58.579 --> 00:13:58.589
where your users are at risk and that's
 

00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:00.829
where your users are at risk and that's
from phishing scams now there was some

00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839
from phishing scams now there was some
 

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:02.720
from phishing scams now there was some
research done by the Canadian government

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:02.730
research done by the Canadian government
 

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.920
research done by the Canadian government
and it's spoke about and this research

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:06.930
and it's spoke about and this research
 

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:11.060
and it's spoke about and this research
found that 156 million phishing emails

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:11.070
found that 156 million phishing emails
 

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:13.519
found that 156 million phishing emails
are sent out every single day

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:13.529
are sent out every single day
 

00:14:13.529 --> 00:14:15.350
are sent out every single day
okay now by the way this research was

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360
okay now by the way this research was
 

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.670
okay now by the way this research was
done a couple of years ago so I think

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680
done a couple of years ago so I think
 

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.650
done a couple of years ago so I think
these numbers are probably bigger now so

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:18.660
these numbers are probably bigger now so
 

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.290
these numbers are probably bigger now so
of those 156 million phishing emails now

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300
of those 156 million phishing emails now
 

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.690
of those 156 million phishing emails now
of course we all have great email

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:23.700
of course we all have great email
 

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:26.600
of course we all have great email
filters we all have great you know tools

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:26.610
filters we all have great you know tools
 

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.699
filters we all have great you know tools
that allow us to filter out and says

00:14:28.699 --> 00:14:28.709
that allow us to filter out and says
 

00:14:28.709 --> 00:14:30.980
that allow us to filter out and says
stop phishing scams and and to block

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:30.990
stop phishing scams and and to block
 

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.949
stop phishing scams and and to block
them so how many of that 156 million do

00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:33.959
them so how many of that 156 million do
 

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:35.170
them so how many of that 156 million do
you think got through these filters

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:35.180
you think got through these filters
 

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.360
you think got through these filters
anybody take a guess somebody say 10%

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:40.370
anybody take a guess somebody say 10%
 

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.850
anybody take a guess somebody say 10%
that's a good guess 16 million all right

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860
that's a good guess 16 million all right
 

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.980
that's a good guess 16 million all right
around 10 percent actually got through

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:45.990
around 10 percent actually got through
 

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.699
around 10 percent actually got through
so when you think about this a lot of

00:14:49.699 --> 00:14:49.709
so when you think about this a lot of
 

00:14:49.709 --> 00:14:52.040
so when you think about this a lot of
the free email providers like Gmail and

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.050
the free email providers like Gmail and
 

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.500
the free email providers like Gmail and
Yahoo and hotmail etc they all provide

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:54.510
Yahoo and hotmail etc they all provide
 

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.630
Yahoo and hotmail etc they all provide
these spam filters and I'm sure like

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:56.640
these spam filters and I'm sure like
 

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.370
these spam filters and I'm sure like
many of you I've gotten my name on all

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:58.380

hotmail at Gmail and all these kind of
 

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.819
hotmail at Gmail and all these kind of
things and you know these these try

00:15:04.819 --> 00:15:04.829
things and you know these these try
 

00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:06.050
things and you know these these try
their best to keep spam and phishing

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:06.060
their best to keep spam and phishing
 

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.750
their best to keep spam and phishing
away from my eyes but most of them some

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760
away from my eyes but most of them some
 

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.069
away from my eyes but most of them some
are better than others I won't say which

00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079
are better than others I won't say which
 

00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:12.710
are better than others I won't say which
are bad and but most of them try to keep

root off of that phrase by changing
 

00:18:09.929 --> 00:18:11.720
root off of that phrase by changing
letters around or adding numbers or

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:11.730
letters around or adding numbers or
 

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.460
letters around or adding numbers or
punctuation and and it helps me to

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:13.470
punctuation and and it helps me to
 

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.799
punctuation and and it helps me to
remember password so had I gone to one

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:15.809
remember password so had I gone to one
 

00:18:15.809 --> 00:18:17.749

they now know that my password has that
 

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:22.220
they now know that my password has that
kind of combination so maybe I need to

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:22.230
kind of combination so maybe I need to
 

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.279
kind of combination so maybe I need to
change it but if they've gotten a one of

00:18:25.279 --> 00:18:25.289
change it but if they've gotten a one of
 

00:18:25.289 --> 00:18:27.379
change it but if they've gotten a one of
these sources of my password then they

00:18:27.379 --> 00:18:27.389
these sources of my password then they
 

00:18:27.389 --> 00:18:29.389
these sources of my password then they
already have several steps towards being

00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:29.399
already have several steps towards being
 

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:30.980
already have several steps towards being
able to compromise my account in other

able to compromise my account in other
 

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.730

that passwords get compromised is that

that passwords get compromised is that
 

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.270
that passwords get compromised is that
somewhere in a system they're stored in

somewhere in a system they're stored in
 

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.040
somewhere in a system they're stored in
a place that's unencrypted or maybe

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.050
a place that's unencrypted or maybe
 

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.049
a place that's unencrypted or maybe
they're passing from A to B across an

infrastructure that's unencrypted and

infrastructure that's unencrypted and
it's easy for somebody to sniff that off

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:45.150
it's easy for somebody to sniff that off
 

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:47.390
it's easy for somebody to sniff that off
in network and as a result passwords can

be compromised again the infrastructure

I'm thinking about I'd mentioned earlier
 

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.060
I'm thinking about I'd mentioned earlier
on about there were some difficulties

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:14.070
on about there were some difficulties
 

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.890
on about there were some difficulties
and there was some like bumps and the

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900
and there was some like bumps and the
 

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.000
and there was some like bumps and the
road that you have when you try to

road that you have when you try to
 

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.160
road that you have when you try to
sign-in so we've tried to make it a lot

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:19.170
sign-in so we've tried to make it a lot
 

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:20.780
sign-in so we've tried to make it a lot
easier and I'm gonna like talk through

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:20.790
easier and I'm gonna like talk through
 

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.310
easier and I'm gonna like talk through
some of the steps here I'm not gonna

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320
some of the steps here I'm not gonna
 

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.049
some of the steps here I'm not gonna
demo it because unfortunately the

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059
demo it because unfortunately the
 

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:26.450
demo it because unfortunately the

slide okay next now if you've built with
 

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.810
slide okay next now if you've built with
Google Play services and if you've built

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:33.820
Google Play services and if you've built

with a authentication and identity when
Google Play services you'll know about

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840
Google Play services you'll know about
 

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.900
Google Play services you'll know about
the Google API client and here's where

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:39.910
the Google API client and here's where
 

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.760
the Google API client and here's where
you set up the Google API client you

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:41.770
you set up the Google API client you
 

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:44.460
you set up the Google API client you
create it with a builder and you access

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:44.470
create it with a builder and you access
 

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.710
create it with a builder and you access
it with the ad API and you pass it the

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720
it with the ad API and you pass it the
 

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.780
it with the ad API and you pass it the
GSO that you just created earlier on the

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:48.790
GSO that you just created earlier on the
 

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:50.640
GSO that you just created earlier on the
second parameter there it's off the

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:50.650
second parameter there it's off the
 

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.070
second parameter there it's off the
Google sign-in API and you just passes

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080
Google sign-in API and you just passes
 

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.200
Google sign-in API and you just passes
that gso object and that gso object had

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:55.210
that gso object and that gso object had
 

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:56.610
that gso object and that gso object had
the configurations for the type of

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:56.620
the configurations for the type of
 

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:58.010
the configurations for the type of
permissions that you want to access

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020
permissions that you want to access
 

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.630
permissions that you want to access
right so it's as simple as that the

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640
right so it's as simple as that the
 

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.100
right so it's as simple as that the
function to determine it there's an auth

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:02.110
function to determine it there's an auth
 

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.690
function to determine it there's an auth
class there's a constant on there and

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:03.700
class there's a constant on there and
 

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.400
class there's a constant on there and
that constant is the Google sign-in API

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:05.410
that constant is the Google sign-in API
 

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.130
that constant is the Google sign-in API
so now you've created a GSO you've

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:08.140
so now you've created a GSO you've
 

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.530
so now you've created a GSO you've
created your Google API client so the

00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:10.540
created your Google API client so the
 

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.300
created your Google API client so the
next thing to do is to get a sign-in

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:12.310
next thing to do is to get a sign-in
 

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:14.790
next thing to do is to get a sign-in
intent from the API for this Google API

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:14.800
intent from the API for this Google API
 

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.650
intent from the API for this Google API
client and you can see it's here I just

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:16.660
client and you can see it's here I just
 

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:19.170
client and you can see it's here I just
create intent dot sign-in intent equals

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:19.180
create intent dot sign-in intent equals
 

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.140
create intent dot sign-in intent equals
off that Google sign-in API I passed

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:22.150
off that Google sign-in API I passed
 

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.940
off that Google sign-in API I passed
that the API clients remember the API

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:23.950
that the API clients remember the API
 

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:25.740
that the API clients remember the API
client was configured with the sign-in

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:25.750
client was configured with the sign-in
 

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:28.050
client was configured with the sign-in
object and then I start an activity for

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:28.060
object and then I start an activity for
 

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.970
object and then I start an activity for
that result there's a constant on the

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:29.980
that result there's a constant on the
 

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.860
that result there's a constant on the
right hand side there are C sign-in

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:31.870
right hand side there are C sign-in
 

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:34.230
right hand side there are C sign-in
that's not part of the API usually if

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240
that's not part of the API usually if
 

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.940
that's not part of the API usually if
you're building an application and you

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:35.950
you're building an application and you
 

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.790
you're building an application and you
start an activity so that Android can

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:38.800
start an activity so that Android can
 

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.370
start an activity so that Android can
tell which activity result is for which

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:41.380
tell which activity result is for which
 

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.650
tell which activity result is for which
activity you just pass it an integer and

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:43.660
activity you just pass it an integer and
 

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.210
activity you just pass it an integer and
it can be anything that you want it's

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:45.220
it can be anything that you want it's
 

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.620
it can be anything that you want it's
just up to you to do if you've got

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:46.630
just up to you to do if you've got
 

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:48.720
just up to you to do if you've got
multiple activities going on it's up to

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:48.730
multiple activities going on it's up to
 

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.220
multiple activities going on it's up to
you to identify them with your own

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:50.230
you to identify them with your own
 

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.230
you to identify them with your own
constants so in this case you know this

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240
constants so in this case you know this
 

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.090
constants so in this case you know this
constant or C sign-in I think we made it

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:54.100
constant or C sign-in I think we made it
 

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.830
constant or C sign-in I think we made it
there's a sample that you can download

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840
there's a sample that you can download
 

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.420
there's a sample that you can download
that I took this code from I think it

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:57.430
that I took this code from I think it
 

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.980
that I took this code from I think it
was like seven thousand and one so when

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:58.990
was like seven thousand and one so when
 

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:00.840
was like seven thousand and one so when
you get the callback saying hey we got a

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:00.850
you get the callback saying hey we got a
 

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:02.430
you get the callback saying hey we got a
result for activity seven thousand and

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440
result for activity seven thousand and
 

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.020
result for activity seven thousand and
one you know that it's that one that

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:04.030
one you know that it's that one that
 

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.460
one you know that it's that one that
it's the same in one but like I said it

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:05.470
it's the same in one but like I said it
 

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.160
it's the same in one but like I said it
can be anything you like and then you

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.170
can be anything you like and then you
 

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.660
can be anything you like and then you
can see the callback here where you

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:09.670
can see the callback here where you
 

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.780
can see the callback here where you
catch the activity result and it's so

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:12.790
catch the activity result and it's so
 

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.400
catch the activity result and it's so
you get your own activity results and

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:14.410
you get your own activity results and
 

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:16.590
you get your own activity results and
then on the activity result you have a

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600
then on the activity result you have a
 

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.300
then on the activity result you have a
request code remember the request code

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:18.310
request code remember the request code
 

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.130
request code remember the request code
that I said that you passed in if it's

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:20.140
that I said that you passed in if it's
 

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.780
that I said that you passed in if it's
that request code that you created for

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:21.790
that request code that you created for
 

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.790
that request code that you created for
the sign-in activity then all you have

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:23.800
the sign-in activity then all you have
 

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.250
the sign-in activity then all you have
to do is create a Google sign-in result

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:26.260
to do is create a Google sign-in result
 

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:28.890
to do is create a Google sign-in result
object and this is going to be the

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:28.900
object and this is going to be the
 

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.370
object and this is going to be the
result

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:29.380
result
 

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.830
result
of the call to Google sign-in API dot

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840
of the call to Google sign-in API dot
 

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.780
of the call to Google sign-in API dot
get sign-in result from the intent and

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:33.790
get sign-in result from the intent and
 

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.430
get sign-in result from the intent and
the intent passes you back the data

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440
the intent passes you back the data
 

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.530
the intent passes you back the data
parameter that you can see at the top so

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:37.540
parameter that you can see at the top so
 

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.240
parameter that you can see at the top so
now you have your sign-in result and the

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:39.250
now you have your sign-in result and the
 

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.740
now you have your sign-in result and the
sign-in results object gives you

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:40.750
sign-in results object gives you
 

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.910
sign-in results object gives you
everything that you need to know about

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:41.920
everything that you need to know about
 

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.030
everything that you need to know about
the sign-in such as the account and the

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:45.040
the sign-in such as the account and the
 

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.010
the sign-in such as the account and the
account is a Google sign-in account

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:47.020
account is a Google sign-in account
 

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.900
account is a Google sign-in account
object and you get that using the result

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:48.910
object and you get that using the result
 

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:52.050
object and you get that using the result
I get sign-in account as it suggests and

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:52.060
I get sign-in account as it suggests and
 

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.610
I get sign-in account as it suggests and
then you can query that account object

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:53.620
then you can query that account object
 

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.290
then you can query that account object
for things that the user has given you

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:55.300
for things that the user has given you
 

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.060
for things that the user has given you
permission to including hey has this

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:57.070
permission to including hey has this
 

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.440
permission to including hey has this
user actually signed in and out that

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:58.450
user actually signed in and out that
 

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.450
user actually signed in and out that
kind of thing so now that you have your

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:00.460
kind of thing so now that you have your
 

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.280
kind of thing so now that you have your
accounts now you can personalize your

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:02.290
accounts now you can personalize your
 

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.320
accounts now you can personalize your
application for that end user and it's

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:04.330
application for that end user and it's
 

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.390
application for that end user and it's
as simple as that and again just to look

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400
as simple as that and again just to look
 

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.670
as simple as that and again just to look
at the flow again it looks like this the

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:08.680
at the flow again it looks like this the
 

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.410
at the flow again it looks like this the
user clicks the connect with Google

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:10.420
user clicks the connect with Google
 

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.750
user clicks the connect with Google
button they get given the picker which

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760
button they get given the picker which
 

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.430
button they get given the picker which
asked them which account that they want

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440
asked them which account that they want
 

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.320
asked them which account that they want
to sign in with they pick that account

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:16.330
to sign in with they pick that account
 

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.400
to sign in with they pick that account
and then they're taken to your

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:17.410
and then they're taken to your
 

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.140
and then they're taken to your
application and you can customize your

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:19.150
application and you can customize your
 

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.240
application and you can customize your
application as you as you please for

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.250
application as you as you please for
 

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.190
application as you as you please for
that user like in this case we see we

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200
that user like in this case we see we
 

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.960
that user like in this case we see we
have the user's name and a picture and

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:24.970
have the user's name and a picture and
 

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.790
have the user's name and a picture and
stuff at the top for that user and as I

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:26.800
stuff at the top for that user and as I
 

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.080
stuff at the top for that user and as I
mentioned before that if you're doing

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:28.090
mentioned before that if you're doing
 

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.870
mentioned before that if you're doing
additional scopes for example the one I

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880
additional scopes for example the one I
 

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.580
additional scopes for example the one I
always like to use is drive that if your

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:32.590
always like to use is drive that if your
 

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.050
always like to use is drive that if your
app is going to access the users Drive

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:34.060
app is going to access the users Drive
 

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.670
app is going to access the users Drive
there'll be an additional step in

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:35.680
there'll be an additional step in
 

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.380
there'll be an additional step in
between you know the middle one and the

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:37.390
between you know the middle one and the
 

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:38.970
between you know the middle one and the
right one there where the user has to

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:38.980
right one there where the user has to
 

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.210
right one there where the user has to
give permission to that so this is great

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:42.220
give permission to that so this is great
 

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.970
give permission to that so this is great
but guess what this is all very nice for

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:44.980
but guess what this is all very nice for
 

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.920
but guess what this is all very nice for
authenticating on the device but what

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:46.930
authenticating on the device but what
 

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.330
authenticating on the device but what
happens when you want to extend beyond

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:48.340
happens when you want to extend beyond
 

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.340
happens when you want to extend beyond
that and I like to give a story here

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:50.350
that and I like to give a story here
 

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.260
that and I like to give a story here

there was before I joined Google I was
an independent application developer I

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520
an independent application developer I
 

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.280
an independent application developer I
worked for a lot of startups building

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:56.290
worked for a lot of startups building
 

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.320
worked for a lot of startups building
applications for them and there was one

00:25:58.320 --> 00:25:58.330
applications for them and there was one
 

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.780
applications for them and there was one
startup that I worked with that they had

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:00.790
startup that I worked with that they had
 

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:02.550
startup that I worked with that they had
this really interesting app for a very

this really interesting app for a very
 

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.430
this really interesting app for a very
unique audience and their audience where

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.440
unique audience and their audience where
 

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.840
unique audience and their audience where
was people who own pets who hire other

people to look after their pets for them
so part of this was like you know I have

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:14.260
so part of this was like you know I have
 

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.410
so part of this was like you know I have
you know I have a dog

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:16.420
you know I have a dog
 

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.480

I'll use my own dog my dog but is called
 

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:21.690
I'll use my own dog my dog but is called
Bucky and and if I for example work too

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:21.700
Bucky and and if I for example work too
 

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.820
Bucky and and if I for example work too
much and I can't walk Bucky then I can

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:23.830
much and I can't walk Bucky then I can
 

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:26.040
much and I can't walk Bucky then I can
hire somebody to walk Bucky for me but

how do I know that that person has

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:27.430
how do I know that that person has
 

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.760
how do I know that that person has
actually walked my dog for me right so

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:29.770
actually walked my dog for me right so
 

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:31.530
actually walked my dog for me right so
the idea behind this app was that I

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:31.540
the idea behind this app was that I
 

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.210
the idea behind this app was that I
would have this use did my person

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:33.220
would have this use did my person
 

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.130
would have this use did my person
they've hired use this app so then as

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:35.140
they've hired use this app so then as
 

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.660
they've hired use this app so then as
they're looking after my dog during the

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:36.670
they're looking after my dog during the
 

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.160
they're looking after my dog during the
day as they're walking the dog it would

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:38.170
day as they're walking the dog it would
 

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.690
day as they're walking the dog it would
like collect data around that it would

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:39.700
like collect data around that it would
 

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.460
like collect data around that it would
like collect data of where they walked

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:41.470
like collect data of where they walked
 

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:42.690
like collect data of where they walked
and all that kind of stuff it was an

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:42.700
and all that kind of stuff it was an
 

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:43.320
and all that kind of stuff it was an
interesting

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:43.330
interesting
 

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.870
interesting
concept but of course in order to be

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880
concept but of course in order to be
 

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.490
concept but of course in order to be
able to use this people needed to sign

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:47.500
able to use this people needed to sign
 

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:50.010
able to use this people needed to sign
up for this cyst for this service so

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:50.020
up for this cyst for this service so
 

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.810
up for this cyst for this service so
that you know they register that I am

first barriers that I was talking about
 

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.160
first barriers that I was talking about
earlier on of yet another sign up that

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.170
earlier on of yet another sign up that
 

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.720
earlier on of yet another sign up that
people had to do so we thought okay

one of the things I've just highlighted
 

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.549
one of the things I've just highlighted
in red here I've added another method to

00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559
in red here I've added another method to
 

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:33.039
in red here I've added another method to
this and this method was request ID

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:33.049
this and this method was request ID
 

00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:35.289
this and this method was request ID
token and I passed this thing called the

00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:35.299
token and I passed this thing called the
 

00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:37.419
token and I passed this thing called the
server client ID in there and the server

00:30:37.419 --> 00:30:37.429
server client ID in there and the server
 

00:30:37.429 --> 00:30:39.580
server client ID in there and the server
client ID is this unique ID that's

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:39.590
client ID is this unique ID that's
 

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.740
client ID is this unique ID that's
generated for your server there are

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:41.750
generated for your server there are
 

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.510
generated for your server there are
steps in our documentation that show you

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520
steps in our documentation that show you
 

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.399
steps in our documentation that show you
how to do that it's just it's a big long

00:30:45.399 --> 00:30:45.409
how to do that it's just it's a big long
 

00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:47.139
how to do that it's just it's a big long
ugly string that you can just put as a

00:30:47.139 --> 00:30:47.149
ugly string that you can just put as a
 

00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:50.080
ugly string that you can just put as a
constant in your app and or any other

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:50.090
constant in your app and or any other
 

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.149
constant in your app and or any other
way that you want to do it and so when

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159
way that you want to do it and so when
 

00:30:52.159 --> 00:30:54.850
way that you want to do it and so when
you call the request ID token now once

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:54.860
you call the request ID token now once
 

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:56.320
you call the request ID token now once
the users sign in once you get that

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:56.330
the users sign in once you get that
 

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.669
the users sign in once you get that
successful sign and you're able to get

00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679
successful sign and you're able to get
 

00:30:57.679 --> 00:30:59.529
successful sign and you're able to get
that token to so that's the only change

00:30:59.529 --> 00:30:59.539
that token to so that's the only change
 

00:30:59.539 --> 00:31:01.149
that token to so that's the only change
that you need to make to your GSL sign

00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159
that you need to make to your GSL sign
 

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:04.600
that you need to make to your GSL sign
in so then step two when you're setting

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:04.610
in so then step two when you're setting
 

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.100
in so then step two when you're setting
up your Google API client spot the

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:06.110
up your Google API client spot the
 

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:10.270
up your Google API client spot the
difference there is no difference

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:10.280
difference there is no difference
 

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.070
difference there is no difference
right so it's exactly the same thing you

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080
right so it's exactly the same thing you
 

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.360
right so it's exactly the same thing you
don't need to change anything in your

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:13.370
don't need to change anything in your
 

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.400
don't need to change anything in your
code for setting up the Google API claim

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:15.410
code for setting up the Google API claim
 

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:18.370
code for setting up the Google API claim
now step three to get the sign-in intent

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:18.380
now step three to get the sign-in intent
 

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.500
now step three to get the sign-in intent
it's exactly the same we've added that

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:20.510
it's exactly the same we've added that
 

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:22.930
it's exactly the same we've added that
one line of code to the GSL but creating

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:22.940
one line of code to the GSL but creating
 

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.330
one line of code to the GSL but creating
the Google API client calling the Google

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:25.340
the Google API client calling the Google
 

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:27.010
the Google API client calling the Google
API client connecting it and getting the

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:27.020
API client connecting it and getting the
 

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.020
API client connecting it and getting the
sign in intent back the flow is exactly

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:29.030
sign in intent back the flow is exactly
 

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.910
sign in intent back the flow is exactly
the same but then once you get your

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:30.920
the same but then once you get your
 

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:34.960
the same but then once you get your
result back so earlier if you remember

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:34.970
result back so earlier if you remember
 

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.850
result back so earlier if you remember
this one on our activity results coming

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:36.860
this one on our activity results coming
 

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.790
this one on our activity results coming
back you know if the activity was the or

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:39.800
back you know if the activity was the or
 

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.470
back you know if the activity was the or
C sign-in activity when we get our

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:41.480
C sign-in activity when we get our
 

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.090
C sign-in activity when we get our
result back and we get our account back

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.100
result back and we get our account back
 

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.640
result back and we get our account back
there's a method on the account which is

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:45.650
there's a method on the account which is
 

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:48.310
there's a method on the account which is
get the ID token so this gets the token

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320
get the ID token so this gets the token
 

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.230
get the ID token so this gets the token
for us we have this token now in our

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240
for us we have this token now in our
 

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.510
for us we have this token now in our
client upon a successful sign-in and

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:52.520
client upon a successful sign-in and
 

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.760
client upon a successful sign-in and
it's a simple case of posting that token

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:54.770
it's a simple case of posting that token
 

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.800
it's a simple case of posting that token
to the server right to our own server

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:56.810
to the server right to our own server
 

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:59.590
to the server right to our own server
and in our server sorry when I say our I

00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600
and in our server sorry when I say our I
 

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.390
and in our server sorry when I say our I
don't mean Google I mean our if I'm the

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:01.400
don't mean Google I mean our if I'm the
 

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.760
don't mean Google I mean our if I'm the
application developer so my back-end

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:03.770
application developer so my back-end
 

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.110
application developer so my back-end
server is an application developer

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120

poster token to that and then that token

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:07.250
poster token to that and then that token
 

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:08.950
poster token to that and then that token
can be posted to Google and authorized

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960

Google they've gotten the identity token

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:18.590
Google they've gotten the identity token
 

00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:20.320
Google they've gotten the identity token
from that they post the token to the

from that they post the token to the
 

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:22.660
from that they post the token to the
server so now Google will get the server

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:22.670
server so now Google will get the server
 

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:24.340
server so now Google will get the server
a kit and send it back so we avoid the

bad guys doing it let's see what the
 

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:28.480
bad guys doing it let's see what the
code for that would look like here's how

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:28.490
code for that would look like here's how
 

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:29.740
code for that would look like here's how
you process the code on your server

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:29.750

a number of different servers because

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:20.090
a number of different servers because
 

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:21.730
a number of different servers because
you may have multiple servers posting

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:21.740
you may have multiple servers posting
 

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.720
you may have multiple servers posting
into this thing and you want the

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:22.730
into this thing and you want the
 

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.070
into this thing and you want the
audience for each of these and this

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080
audience for each of these and this
 

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.380
audience for each of these and this
scenario I just have one and the ID for

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:26.390
scenario I just have one and the ID for
 

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:27.700

that you remember us talking earlier
about the server client ID I know it

00:33:29.289 --> 00:33:29.299
about the server client ID I know it
 

00:33:29.299 --> 00:33:30.700
about the server client ID I know it
sounds like an oxymoron a server client

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:30.710
sounds like an oxymoron a server client
 

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.250
sounds like an oxymoron a server client
but it's the client ID from your server

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:33.260
but it's the client ID from your server
 

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:36.159
but it's the client ID from your server
to Google servers and so you set the

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:36.169
to Google servers and so you set the
 

00:33:36.169 --> 00:33:38.139
to Google servers and so you set the
audience with that ID and then you set

00:33:38.139 --> 00:33:38.149
audience with that ID and then you set
 

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.880
audience with that ID and then you set
the issuer and the issuer is just

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:39.890
the issuer and the issuer is just
 

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.250
the issuer and the issuer is just
accounts.google.com and then you build

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:42.260
accounts.google.com and then you build
 

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.019
accounts.google.com and then you build
this thing and then after you build this

00:33:44.019 --> 00:33:44.029
this thing and then after you build this
 

00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:46.240
this thing and then after you build this
thing you can then just verify your

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:46.250
thing you can then just verify your
 

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.430
thing you can then just verify your
token by calling verify or dot verify

00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440
token by calling verify or dot verify
 

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.590
token by calling verify or dot verify
that actual string that was posted up

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600
that actual string that was posted up
 

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.440
that actual string that was posted up
and if that comes back as not null then

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:53.450
and if that comes back as not null then
 

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.019
and if that comes back as not null then
you know this token has a payload

00:33:55.019 --> 00:33:55.029
you know this token has a payload
 

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:57.490
you know this token has a payload
associated with it the payload all the

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:57.500
associated with it the payload all the
 

00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:58.930
associated with it the payload all the
things in orange on this slide by the

00:33:58.930 --> 00:33:58.940
things in orange on this slide by the
 

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.820
things in orange on this slide by the
way a part of the API so the payload

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:00.830
way a part of the API so the payload
 

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.430
way a part of the API so the payload
that you create from that ID token has

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440
that you create from that ID token has
 

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.960
that you create from that ID token has
something for example a method in it

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:04.970
something for example a method in it
 

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:06.430
something for example a method in it
which is the get subject and that just

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440
which is the get subject and that just
 

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.710
which is the get subject and that just
gives you the user ID so if you think

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720
gives you the user ID so if you think
 

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.750
gives you the user ID so if you think
about the flow the user on your device

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:10.760
about the flow the user on your device
 

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.480
about the flow the user on your device
tries to sign in when they sign in

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:13.490
tries to sign in when they sign in
 

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:16.629
tries to sign in when they sign in
Google issue a token to your device your

00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639
Google issue a token to your device your
 

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.579
Google issue a token to your device your
device then gets that token and post it

00:34:18.579 --> 00:34:18.589
device then gets that token and post it
 

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:20.740
device then gets that token and post it
to your server your server gets that

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:20.750
to your server your server gets that
 

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.290
to your server your server gets that
token and posts it back to Google Google

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:23.300
token and posts it back to Google Google
 

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.030
token and posts it back to Google Google
then verify that token and come back and

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040
then verify that token and come back and
 

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.339
then verify that token and come back and
say this is the user ID associated with

00:34:27.339 --> 00:34:27.349
say this is the user ID associated with
 

00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:29.200
say this is the user ID associated with
that token so you have the complete flow

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:29.210
that token so you have the complete flow
 

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:33.010
that token so you have the complete flow
from your device to your server securely

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:33.020
from your device to your server securely
 

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.440
from your device to your server securely
for your actual end user so then if

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:35.450
for your actual end user so then if
 

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:36.879
for your actual end user so then if
you're building for example a dog walker

00:34:36.879 --> 00:34:36.889
you're building for example a dog walker
 

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:38.320
you're building for example a dog walker
application and you don't want a

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.330
application and you don't want a
 

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.750
application and you don't want a
nefarious third party to access data

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760
nefarious third party to access data
 

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.339
nefarious third party to access data
such as the breed of your dog or your

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:42.349
such as the breed of your dog or your
 

00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:43.869
such as the breed of your dog or your

00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879
address or where you live this is a
 

00:34:43.879 --> 00:34:45.790
address or where you live this is a
great way of doing that so all of this

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:45.800
great way of doing that so all of this
 

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.320
great way of doing that so all of this
data that's in flight is much more

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:47.330
data that's in flight is much more
 

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.909
data that's in flight is much more
secure than if it was just an email

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:48.919
secure than if it was just an email
 

00:34:48.919 --> 00:34:50.649
