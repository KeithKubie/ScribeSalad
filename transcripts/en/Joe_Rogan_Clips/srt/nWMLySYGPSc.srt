1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,260
Five four, three, two, one.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,190
Yes.
And realize Brian Calvin,

3
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:17,480
we are live on the Internet in
cashmere right now. Everybody. Me,

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,970
how come you don't wear watches? You
were just saying I don't wear, I don't,

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,500
I was thinking as I was saying Brendon,
I go,

6
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:24,440
you could rob my house and there's
nothing you'd find a value.

7
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:29,150
Like there's not a viking thing.
It's still your car. Oh, okay. Oh no

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,010
wonder why you make money then.
Yeah, well got a lot of money. Right?

9
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:41,300
You can totally like not work for years.
I, yeah, I have enough. I make money.

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,010
But uh, I never thought I was thinking
about that too. I can, I genuinely,

11
00:00:46,011 --> 00:00:50,240
I did some soul searching about this
because I watch how motivated Chavez,

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,980
he's so buttoned down about his stuff.

13
00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:56,981
He's just always coming up with ideas
and I don't think I ever gave to Fox for

14
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:02,321
real about fame or
money and I still don't,

15
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:04,280
I have a very precarious
relationship with that.

16
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,230
What I love is coming up with new ideas
and writing new stand up and you know,

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,130
like now having done the album,

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,470
now I've got to come up with a whole new
bag of tricks that that's a really fun

19
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,040
time.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm probably more happy or never as happy
as when I'm on the road at some cafe

21
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:23,030
somewhere coming up,
solving problems,

22
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:26,300
coming up with new ideas and surprising
myself, everything else, you know,

23
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,310
I like hanging with my boys and
laughing and like having a nice house.

24
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,590
Do you get any pleasure out
of having a nice house? Yeah,
but uh, I could live, uh,

25
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,430
I'm have lived in rudimentary places
and I have, I don't notice. Yeah,

26
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:44,240
I noticed that when I, when I first
started making money, you get,

27
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,500
everything gets normal. Like this
is your house. Wake up. It's normal.

28
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,280
You know what doesn't change wouldn't
always makes you feel good as views.

29
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,790
I was about to say that I can't
believe you just said that you use not

30
00:01:55,791 --> 00:02:00,620
underrated. No views or views are very
underrated. I so interesting you say that.

31
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:05,180
I had just said that, you
know who else said that to me?
Ray Kurzweil. Really? Yeah.

32
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:09,080
He always lives in a place with a
view. Yeah. When I interviewed him,

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,200
he was on a very high floor in an
apartment building in San Francisco.

34
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,030
That's where he lives.
And You out,

35
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:22,090
you look out from his apartment and you
see the city and you see the bay and

36
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:25,460
it's beautiful. Yeah. It's expensive. Yes.

37
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,400
He said views are very important to him.
They are.

38
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,200
But I have another weird thing that
like if you put me in a French cafe,

39
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,010
there's a, there's a, I don't know if
it's still around, but there was a fuss.

40
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,920
I'm so French Seo and that we should pop.
We'll see.

41
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:44,480
Go homoe uh, so my accent as far as
say, Ham Sandwich, the jazz for him,

42
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,210
I said I speak French fluently.
Say Hummel, come home.

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,670
Do Shambu how well do you feel
much speak it fluently? No, I mean,

44
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:57,160
I used to speak it. I went to
French schools in Lebanon. Yeah.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,270
Um, you know, I mean I can give me,
give me six months and I'm going to,

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,710
you'd hop right back in then.
I think so the dating pool and frauds.

47
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,010
Shelly,
what were you saying?

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,230
You're about to say something
about you were in a cafe in France,

49
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,630
there's a place called
Chez Paul, which is, uh,

50
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,600
this restaurant where you're crammed
in with a bunch of people and,

51
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,370
and the walls and the wood has been there.
You know, you go to the comedy store,

52
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,940
like a comedy, like a comedy club that's
been around since the 70s. I yourself.

53
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,500
Yeah. And you think these are the
wood in this. This is a weird thing,

54
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:34,180
but the wood in his walls has, have
absorbed so much laughter and good energy.

55
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,750
I was just saying that the other day
about the ice house. Ah, it's, it's,

56
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,300
it's very special. If they
ever dump, demolish that,

57
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:44,290
God forbid I would buy that wood
and put it up on my walls. Oh,

58
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,710
so you do get to match stuff.
Yes. Magical stuff. Yes.

59
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:51,940
I like things that last,
I like marble and,

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,180
and heavy would like old railroad tracks.

61
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,850
Reclaimed wood. Yeah, I like this table.
Yeah. Good leather. Who reclaimed wood?

62
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,670
Yeah. A man with a mustache. Handmade,

63
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,710
things like that are handmade.
I do craftsman like, like,

64
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,890
like if I had,
if I wanted to,

65
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:16,720
I would maybe go and have my shoes
made in London. I'd have bespoke shoes.

66
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,550
Bespoke. Yes. That when they use that
high, now I'd have bespoke shoes.

67
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,140
The problem with jewelry watches,
nice shoes and everything is I,

68
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:29,340
I'd have to maintain them
and I, I'd rather have. Mm.

69
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,620
I also think we have to maintain
watches. Just put them on. That's right.

70
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,870
But I have a weird,
I have another weird thing,

71
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:37,030
which I think if I have
leather under my feet,

72
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,470
I don't feel as secure and I don't
feel like I can run or fight. Oh.

73
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:46,180
Like leather soles. Rubber Bro. I gotta
yeah, you should have some tread. Yeah,

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,860
they can put some leather tread below the
rubber tread rather. Blow the leather.

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,740
You don't want those scuffed
up leather bottom shows, man,

76
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,430
those bitches are useless. I've been on
socks. Right. But it's good for pivoting.

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,000
If you want to pivot, like you want to
throw a wheel kit, it's really good. Yes,

78
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,400
it's true. If you want to
bear down, if I want to,

79
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,630
let's call it squash the bug when I
throw my right and squash the bug with my

80
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:09,070
and my back foot. No,
because you want to push off.

81
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,670
You want to have some something to push
off. You don't need that much pivot.

82
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,560
You really need pivot with a
kick. A spinning kick. Yes. Yeah.

83
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,540
So this is, this is the kind of
bullshit you and I still talk about it.

84
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,900
52 it's so with that,
you're going to end well.
