Hey, what's up guys happy New Year, this is the first video of 2017

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.649
I've had a lot of awesome comments come through asking if I died or if I got arrested

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.629
But as you can see, I'm still here working in my lab, in fact I've been working my lab every single day making new videos

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.789
For you. I am literally making liquid nitrogen right now. So why haven't I been posting them?

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.858
Well, I'll tell you all about that in a minute first of all

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.719
I want to give you a couple of really exciting updates seven and a half million subscribers is coming up very fast

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.699
So I'm going to be giving away an Xbox one to show my appreciation so watch for that contest coming soon

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.439
Yeah, and every time we hit milestones like 8 million, 9 million, 10 million subscribers

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.079
I'm going to give away things like Macbook laptops and video cameras to enable you to start making videos for yourself

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.539
You rock, and you know that. If you're following me on Instagram or Facebook you've probably seen a lot of the updates on projects

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.909
I have been working on. I give sneak peeks and previews on Instagram and Facebook so links are in the description if you want to

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.680
See what I'm doing these days. the instagram stories only last 24 hours though, so if you didn't see what I was doing yesterday

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.180
It's probably already too late, but if you start following me on Instagram now, you'll see everything I do in the future

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.360
so here's the thing guys, mid-november, I tried a personal experiment just to see if I could post a video every single day

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.909
It's not something. I've ever been able to do before, and definitely something I couldn't do by myself

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.959
so I hired one of my friends to help me do the filming and the editing and every single day

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.509
We worked sunup to sundown pulling all-nighters and often stay up until 4:00 and 5:00 in the morning to get a video prepped and ready

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.689
For release going to bed for a few hours and then getting up and doing it all over again

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.889
Along with the contests the descriptions the annotations and everything else that goes with releasing a video

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.279
This is by far one of the most challenging and taxing personal experiments

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.729
I've taken on in quite a while and while you guys were opening presents on Christmas morning

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.769
I was still editing videos getting them ready for release the next day so after a month and a half of editing and putting out

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.630
videos every day with no sleep my left eye started twitching. So once Christmas ended, I decided to scale back

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.399
Take a little bit of a break let my eye heal up and put some systems into place because what I found out through this

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.798
Experiment is I really like posting videos every day

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.550
I Love being able to read your comments and the next day put out a video responding to them

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.689
But there's a lot of back-end work a lot of production a lot of things that go into making a video that you don't see

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.399
That makes it very difficult to turn them around that quickly especially ones that we're trying to make good quality so right now

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.690
I'm bringing on some people to help me

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.760
I'm training them and I'm going to get back into a groove where I can continue daily posting to videos and hopefully still be able

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.140
To get a full night's sleep in the process

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.550
I don't want to stay up 'til 4:00 and 5:00 every morning editing. These systems take a lot of work to manage

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.649
It takes a little bit of time to put them in place and in

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.350
January the Revenue for making videos is cut in half because all the advertisers who are pushing for Christmas are done

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.690
Advertising so instead of posting every day right now

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.020
What I'm doing instead is putting systems in place so I can post every day later on as well as give away cool prizes to all

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.179
You guys supporting me on YouTube and Instagram and give away more cool prizes every time we hit those subscriber Milestones

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.940
10 million is not far away guys. Can you help me do it?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.740
Can you help me get a diamond play button so basically that's it and to recap. I am filming every single day

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.740
I've got about 14 videos right now and I film just waiting to be produced

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.419
I'm just not putting them out because what I really needed is help producing them so I can get a good night's sleep okay.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.589
What's next? don't forget that in every video I post from now on I will be giving something away

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.489
