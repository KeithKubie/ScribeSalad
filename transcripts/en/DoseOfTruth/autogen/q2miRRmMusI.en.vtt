Richard Boyle says hi dr. Peterson how

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570
Richard Boyle says hi dr. Peterson how
 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.349
Richard Boyle says hi dr. Peterson how
does this score of 91 for compassion and

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359
does this score of 91 for compassion and
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.600
does this score of 91 for compassion and
1 for politeness equals a score of 35

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
1 for politeness equals a score of 35
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.060
1 for politeness equals a score of 35
for agreeableness yeah well it's because

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
for agreeableness yeah well it's because
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.450
for agreeableness yeah well it's because
91 and 1 aren't ordinary numbers they're

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460
91 and 1 aren't ordinary numbers they're
 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.760
91 and 1 aren't ordinary numbers they're
percentiles and you can't just average

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
percentiles and you can't just average
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.880
percentiles and you can't just average
percentiles it doesn't work that way

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890
percentiles it doesn't work that way
 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.210
percentiles it doesn't work that way
what it says is that let's see I don't

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220
what it says is that let's see I don't
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.679
what it says is that let's see I don't
know if I can generate at just a

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
know if I can generate at just a
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.810
know if I can generate at just a
description on the fly because I'm not I

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
description on the fly because I'm not I
 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.540
description on the fly because I'm not I
wouldn't say I'm particularly

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550
wouldn't say I'm particularly
 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.290
wouldn't say I'm particularly
mathematically gifted although I know

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
mathematically gifted although I know
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.700
mathematically gifted although I know
that the answer I just gave you is

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
that the answer I just gave you is
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.690
that the answer I just gave you is
correct let's see there's a 1 in there's

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
correct let's see there's a 1 in there's
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.540
correct let's see there's a 1 in there's
a 1 in 10 chance that a person would be

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
a 1 in 10 chance that a person would be
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910
a 1 in 10 chance that a person would be
that compassionate and a 1 and a hundred

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
that compassionate and a 1 and a hundred
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.069
that compassionate and a 1 and a hundred
percent chance that a person would be

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
percent chance that a person would be
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.020
percent chance that a person would be
that that that nope I can't generate it

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
that that that nope I can't generate it
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.090
that that that nope I can't generate it
on the fly but that's the answer so if

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
on the fly but that's the answer so if
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.850
on the fly but that's the answer so if
you want to point to the proper

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
you want to point to the proper
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.670
you want to point to the proper
literature you'd look up how to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680
literature you'd look up how to
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.069
literature you'd look up how to
transform percentiles into z-scores

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
transform percentiles into z-scores
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.860
transform percentiles into z-scores
they're called z-scores then you can if

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
they're called z-scores then you can if
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.440
they're called z-scores then you can if
you oh that's how it works you convert

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
you oh that's how it works you convert
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.230
you oh that's how it works you convert
the percentiles into z-scores you some

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240
the percentiles into z-scores you some
 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.969
the percentiles into z-scores you some
the z-scores and then you re convert

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
the z-scores and then you re convert
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830
the z-scores and then you re convert
them into percentiles and so if you take

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
them into percentiles and so if you take
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.100
them into percentiles and so if you take
the z-score for naught for compassion 91

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
the z-score for naught for compassion 91
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.350
the z-score for naught for compassion 91
and the z-score for politeness 1 add

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
and the z-score for politeness 1 add
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.929
and the z-score for politeness 1 add
them divide them into Andry convert them

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
them divide them into Andry convert them
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.850
them divide them into Andry convert them
to a percentile you'll get 35 I know

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
to a percentile you'll get 35 I know
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560
to a percentile you'll get 35 I know
it's weird but that's that's how it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
it's weird but that's that's how it
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.780
it's weird but that's that's how it
that's how it is that's how it's done
