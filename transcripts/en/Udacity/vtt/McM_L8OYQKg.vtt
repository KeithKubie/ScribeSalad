Congratulations, you've passed the quizz and you've actually written your first program.

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:07.491
It might not seem like much of a program but that's all a program is. It's just instructions

00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:11.541
to tell the computer what to do. To be able to write something more interesting, like a web crawler

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:15.000
well, we are gonna need to learn to write
more complex programs.
