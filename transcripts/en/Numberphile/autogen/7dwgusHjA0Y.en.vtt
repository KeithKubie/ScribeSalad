00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
just as we have a notation for music we

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760
just as we have a notation for music we
 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.640
just as we have a notation for music we
have a notation for language we have a

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650
have a notation for language we have a
 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.650
have a notation for language we have a
notation for dance we came up with the

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660
notation for dance we came up with the
 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.200
notation for dance we came up with the
notation for juggling and the really

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210
notation for juggling and the really
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.610
notation for juggling and the really
cool thing was that there was some

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620
cool thing was that there was some
 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.890
cool thing was that there was some
unexpected mathematics underneath that

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
unexpected mathematics underneath that
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.570
unexpected mathematics underneath that
then let us predict the existence of

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580
then let us predict the existence of
 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.310
then let us predict the existence of
juggling tricks that as far as we knew

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
juggling tricks that as far as we knew
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.260
juggling tricks that as far as we knew
had never been done before well the one

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270
had never been done before well the one
 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.310
had never been done before well the one
I'm going to talk about is called

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
I'm going to talk about is called
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.710
I'm going to talk about is called
siteswap if you go on the Wikipedia page

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
siteswap if you go on the Wikipedia page
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.359
siteswap if you go on the Wikipedia page
it does have a couple of alternative

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369
it does have a couple of alternative
 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.340
it does have a couple of alternative
names but really the place to start is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
names but really the place to start is
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.259
names but really the place to start is
with a little bit of juggling so that

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
with a little bit of juggling so that
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.970
with a little bit of juggling so that
you can see what it is we're trying to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
you can see what it is we're trying to
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.040
you can see what it is we're trying to
capture I'll just do three to start with

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
capture I'll just do three to start with
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.209
capture I'll just do three to start with
and a lot of people think that they'll

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
and a lot of people think that they'll
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.670
and a lot of people think that they'll
go in a circle but in fact the easiest

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
go in a circle but in fact the easiest
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.400
go in a circle but in fact the easiest
thing to do is to throw them so that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
thing to do is to throw them so that
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.770
thing to do is to throw them so that
they all come down in the same order and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
they all come down in the same order and
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200
they all come down in the same order and
if you do that they've got yellow green

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
if you do that they've got yellow green
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.569
if you do that they've got yellow green
orange and then it will be the yellow

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
orange and then it will be the yellow
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.029
orange and then it will be the yellow
ones turn again but if my hands taken in

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
ones turn again but if my hands taken in
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.770
ones turn again but if my hands taken in
turns that means the yellow has to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
turns that means the yellow has to
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.229
turns that means the yellow has to
change hands so let me show you yellow

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
change hands so let me show you yellow
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.360
change hands so let me show you yellow
with this hand green with that hand

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
with this hand green with that hand
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100
with this hand green with that hand
orange with this and so yellow green

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
orange with this and so yellow green
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.840
orange with this and so yellow green
orange yellow green orange yellow green

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850
orange yellow green orange yellow green
 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090
orange yellow green orange yellow green
orange yellow green orange and you'll

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
orange yellow green orange and you'll
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.880
orange yellow green orange and you'll
see that they have to change hands

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890
see that they have to change hands
 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.439
see that they have to change hands
because the balls are taking it in turns

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
because the balls are taking it in turns
 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.890
because the balls are taking it in turns
and so are my hands and so it just works

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
and so are my hands and so it just works
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.200
and so are my hands and so it just works
out that that's the way it goes so the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
out that that's the way it goes so the
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.330
out that that's the way it goes so the
first thing to be able to do is at least

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
first thing to be able to do is at least
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.609
first thing to be able to do is at least
to be able to describe that juggling

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
to be able to describe that juggling
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.640
to be able to describe that juggling
pattern in any notation that you use and

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
pattern in any notation that you use and
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.920
pattern in any notation that you use and
then think to yourself what can I then

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
then think to yourself what can I then
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.080
then think to yourself what can I then
also describe other ones so what I'm

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
also describe other ones so what I'm
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.190
also describe other ones so what I'm
going to do is I'm going to have my left

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
going to do is I'm going to have my left
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.770
going to do is I'm going to have my left
hand here and my right hand here and I'm

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
hand here and my right hand here and I'm
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.510
hand here and my right hand here and I'm
gonna have time running in this

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
gonna have time running in this
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.490
gonna have time running in this
direction so imagine that I'm walking

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
direction so imagine that I'm walking
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.700
direction so imagine that I'm walking
forwards as I juggle and this more or

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
forwards as I juggle and this more or
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.170
forwards as I juggle and this more or
less is where my left hand isn't this

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
less is where my left hand isn't this
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.850
less is where my left hand isn't this
more or less is where my right hand is

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860
more or less is where my right hand is
 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.679
more or less is where my right hand is
and then I'll leave out some of the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
and then I'll leave out some of the
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.960
and then I'll leave out some of the
detail of my hands moving from side to

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
detail of my hands moving from side to
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.660
detail of my hands moving from side to
side but I'm gonna say as I'm walking

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
side but I'm gonna say as I'm walking
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.190
side but I'm gonna say as I'm walking
forwards I'm going to throw with the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
forwards I'm going to throw with the
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.740
forwards I'm going to throw with the
right hand from here and that balls

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
right hand from here and that balls
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.300
right hand from here and that balls
going to go over to the other hand I

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
going to go over to the other hand I
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.889
going to go over to the other hand I
don't know when that balls going to come

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
don't know when that balls going to come
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.389
don't know when that balls going to come
down but it's going to go over to the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
down but it's going to go over to the
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.550
down but it's going to go over to the
other hand and a moment later I'm going

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
other hand and a moment later I'm going
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.350
other hand and a moment later I'm going
to throw with the left hand and then a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
to throw with the left hand and then a
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.700
to throw with the left hand and then a
moment later I'm going to throw at the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710
moment later I'm going to throw at the
 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.899
moment later I'm going to throw at the
right hand and then I'm going to throw

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
right hand and then I'm going to throw
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.399
right hand and then I'm going to throw
with the left hand then I'm going to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
with the left hand then I'm going to
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.959
with the left hand then I'm going to
throw with the right hand and then with

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
throw with the right hand and then with
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.550
throw with the right hand and then with
the left hand and I've got this this

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
the left hand and I've got this this
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.859
the left hand and I've got this this
rhythm about the whole thing this this

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869
rhythm about the whole thing this this
 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.100
rhythm about the whole thing this this
constant metronomic beat going on here

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110
 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.540
so I'm going to put the the colors onto

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
so I'm going to put the the colors onto
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.460
so I'm going to put the the colors onto
here now so this one was with the yellow

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
here now so this one was with the yellow
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.760
here now so this one was with the yellow
ball

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
ball
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.530
ball
this will also show you that they have

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
this will also show you that they have
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.940
this will also show you that they have
to change hands because if I throw the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
to change hands because if I throw the
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.980
to change hands because if I throw the
yellow one here and then I'll throw the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990
yellow one here and then I'll throw the
 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.600
yellow one here and then I'll throw the
green one next and then I'll throw the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
green one next and then I'll throw the
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.280
green one next and then I'll throw the
orange one next and then I've got to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
orange one next and then I've got to
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.020
orange one next and then I've got to
throw the yellow one here so it has to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030
throw the yellow one here so it has to
 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.960
throw the yellow one here so it has to
be in the other hand and in truth it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970
be in the other hand and in truth it
 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.970
be in the other hand and in truth it
comes down a little bit before that so

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980
comes down a little bit before that so
 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.440
comes down a little bit before that so
if we look at when it comes down it

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
if we look at when it comes down it
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.480
if we look at when it comes down it
might come down there and then it's in

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490
might come down there and then it's in
 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.370
might come down there and then it's in
my hand for that moment there so there's

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
my hand for that moment there so there's
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.260
my hand for that moment there so there's
the yellow ball going across to that

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270
the yellow ball going across to that
 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.900
the yellow ball going across to that
hand there and then the green ball does

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910
hand there and then the green ball does
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.880
hand there and then the green ball does
the same thing it goes over here in that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890
the same thing it goes over here in that
 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.770
the same thing it goes over here in that
direction and then it's in my hand for a

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780
direction and then it's in my hand for a
 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.120
direction and then it's in my hand for a
while there so that will be the green

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130
while there so that will be the green
 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.760
while there so that will be the green
ball there and then the orange one gets

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770
ball there and then the orange one gets
 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.740
ball there and then the orange one gets
thrown it goes across to the other hand

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
thrown it goes across to the other hand
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.440
thrown it goes across to the other hand
and so that's over here in this hand and

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450
and so that's over here in this hand and
 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.790
and so that's over here in this hand and
then that's the orange ball being thrown

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
then that's the orange ball being thrown
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.090
then that's the orange ball being thrown
and then the yellow one again and then

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100
and then the yellow one again and then
 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.970
and then the yellow one again and then
the green one again and then the orange

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980
the green one again and then the orange
 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.940
the green one again and then the orange
one again and in fact what we are not

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
one again and in fact what we are not
 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.140
one again and in fact what we are not
with here is a plat and if you juggle

with three ball juggling what's

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160
with three ball juggling what's
 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.590
with three ball juggling what's
happening is I throw the yellow ball

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600
happening is I throw the yellow ball
 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.390
happening is I throw the yellow ball
green ball orange balls then I throw the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400
green ball orange balls then I throw the
 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.690
green ball orange balls then I throw the
yellow and again so the length of time

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700
yellow and again so the length of time
 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.210

from that throw of the yellow ball to
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.500
from that throw of the yellow ball to
that throw of the yellow ball is three

I've got yellow pink green white and
 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.540
I've got yellow pink green white and
look the yellow

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550
look the yellow
 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.100
look the yellow
it's the yellows turn and it's the

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110
it's the yellows turn and it's the
 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.010
it's the yellows turn and it's the
right-hand turn again so the yellow has

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020
right-hand turn again so the yellow has
 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.690
right-hand turn again so the yellow has
to come back to the same hand and that's

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700
to come back to the same hand and that's
 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.250

the juggling yellow pink green white so
the yellow ball is thrown here and next

the yellow ball is thrown here and next
 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.450
the yellow ball is thrown here and next
it has to be thrown there so it stays in

it has to be thrown there so it stays in
 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.040

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.770
early I catch it before I throw it
obviously it has to spend some time in

your hand is full for more than half the

your hand is full for more than half the

time because the only time you can
 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.150
time because the only time you can
control the juggling prop is while

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160
control the juggling prop is while
 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.700
control the juggling prop is while
you're holding it so you tend to hold it

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710
you're holding it so you tend to hold it
 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.140
you're holding it so you tend to hold it
for as long as you can to give you the

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150
for as long as you can to give you the
 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.170
for as long as you can to give you the
maximum control but you can see here the

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180
maximum control but you can see here the
 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.910
maximum control but you can see here the
yellow ball comes and it's in that and

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:40.920
yellow ball comes and it's in that and
 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.290
yellow ball comes and it's in that and
then the green ball does the same thing

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300
then the green ball does the same thing
 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.280
then the green ball does the same thing
it Bob's

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.290
it Bob's
 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.590
it Bob's
over the time that I'm holding the

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600
over the time that I'm holding the
 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.420
over the time that I'm holding the
yellow ball and then it's in the hand

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430
yellow ball and then it's in the hand
 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.890
yellow ball and then it's in the hand
therefore the green then the yellow ball

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900
therefore the green then the yellow ball
 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.500
therefore the green then the yellow ball
gets launched again and this is actually

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:51.510
gets launched again and this is actually
 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.320
gets launched again and this is actually
how it feels it feels like you get these

green in the same hand here you can see

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810
green in the same hand here you can see
 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.990
green in the same hand here you can see
that they really do feel like they're

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000
that they really do feel like they're
 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.910
that they really do feel like they're
bouncing one over the top of the other

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:04.920
bouncing one over the top of the other
 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.440
bouncing one over the top of the other
it's almost like they're playing

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450
it's almost like they're playing
 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.690
it's almost like they're playing
leapfrog and in fact if you turn this

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700
leapfrog and in fact if you turn this
 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.250
leapfrog and in fact if you turn this
side on you can see that they're playing

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260
side on you can see that they're playing
 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.320
side on you can see that they're playing
leapfrog over each other although it's

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330
leapfrog over each other although it's
 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.510
leapfrog over each other although it's
leapfrog through time not leapfrog

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520
leapfrog through time not leapfrog
 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:28.070
leapfrog through time not leapfrog
through space

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080
 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.020
but now the interesting thing is if we

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:31.030
but now the interesting thing is if we
 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:32.640
but now the interesting thing is if we
have a look at the time that the yellow

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:32.650
have a look at the time that the yellow
 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.710
have a look at the time that the yellow
ball gets thrown here and then the time

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720
ball gets thrown here and then the time
 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.510
ball gets thrown here and then the time
the yellow ball next gets thrown is

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520
the yellow ball next gets thrown is
 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.390
the yellow ball next gets thrown is
there and look how long is that well

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400
there and look how long is that well
 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.070
there and look how long is that well
I've got a beat here and then I go one

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080
I've got a beat here and then I go one
 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.280
I've got a beat here and then I go one
two three four beats and you can see

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.290
two three four beats and you can see
 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.880
two three four beats and you can see
that that really is four beats of time

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:47.890
that that really is four beats of time
 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.220
that that really is four beats of time
from a throw of the yellow ball to the

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.230
from a throw of the yellow ball to the
 

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.470
from a throw of the yellow ball to the
next strong yellow ball and they're all

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:52.480
next strong yellow ball and they're all
 

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.780
next strong yellow ball and they're all
doing the same thing so they will all

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:54.790
doing the same thing so they will all
 

00:07:54.790 --> 00:08:03.480
doing the same thing so they will all
have a four beat cycle in a moment I'm

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:03.490
have a four beat cycle in a moment I'm
 

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.920
have a four beat cycle in a moment I'm
going to talk about throwing the balls

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:04.930
going to talk about throwing the balls
 

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.080
going to talk about throwing the balls
to different heights at the moment

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.090
to different heights at the moment
 

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.080
to different heights at the moment
they're all doing the same thing so at

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.090
they're all doing the same thing so at
 

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.820
they're all doing the same thing so at
the moment I can say that the pattern

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:11.830
the moment I can say that the pattern
 

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.070
the moment I can say that the pattern
has four beats between throws but

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080
has four beats between throws but
 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.770
has four beats between throws but
shortly I'll talk about an individual

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:16.780
shortly I'll talk about an individual
 

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.550
shortly I'll talk about an individual
throat being four beats okay so having

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560
throat being four beats okay so having
 

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.560
throat being four beats okay so having
seen three balls and three beats four

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:22.570
seen three balls and three beats four
 

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.200
seen three balls and three beats four
balls and four beats we can fairly

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:25.210
balls and four beats we can fairly
 

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.360
balls and four beats we can fairly
obviously go on and do five and six and

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.370
obviously go on and do five and six and
 

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.100
obviously go on and do five and six and
seven and there's no real interest in

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.110
seven and there's no real interest in
 

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.279
seven and there's no real interest in
that we can go down and ask what does it

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:32.289
that we can go down and ask what does it
 

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.409
that we can go down and ask what does it
actually mean now based on this kind of

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:34.419
actually mean now based on this kind of
 

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.209
actually mean now based on this kind of
diagram can I draw a diagram for two

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:36.219
diagram can I draw a diagram for two
 

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:38.730
diagram can I draw a diagram for two
balls and what does then in that then

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:38.740
balls and what does then in that then
 

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.670
balls and what does then in that then
imply for the physical juggling and one

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680
imply for the physical juggling and one
 

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.500
imply for the physical juggling and one
ball and perhaps even zero balls

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:43.510
ball and perhaps even zero balls
 

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.690
ball and perhaps even zero balls
I'm not going to do that yet because I

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:45.700
I'm not going to do that yet because I
 

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.130
I'm not going to do that yet because I
really want to get to the payoff I want

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:47.140
really want to get to the payoff I want
 

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.740
really want to get to the payoff I want
to get to the actual notation and why

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:49.750
to get to the actual notation and why
 

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.810
to get to the actual notation and why
it's interesting and what happens so I'm

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:51.820
it's interesting and what happens so I'm
 

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.860
it's interesting and what happens so I'm
going to go back and I'm going to look

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:52.870
going to go back and I'm going to look
 

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.710
going to go back and I'm going to look
at four ball juggling again yellow pink

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720
at four ball juggling again yellow pink
 

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.270
at four ball juggling again yellow pink
green and white so that's what's going

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:57.280
green and white so that's what's going
 

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.220
green and white so that's what's going
on there and the yellow ball will be

00:08:59.220 --> 00:08:59.230
on there and the yellow ball will be
 

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.650
on there and the yellow ball will be
thrown next over here and the pink ball

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:01.660
thrown next over here and the pink ball
 

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.329
thrown next over here and the pink ball
will be thrown next over here and the

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:03.339
will be thrown next over here and the
 

00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:05.370
will be thrown next over here and the
green ball thrown next over here the

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:05.380
green ball thrown next over here the
 

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.650
green ball thrown next over here the
white ball thrown next over here we know

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:07.660
white ball thrown next over here we know
 

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.270
white ball thrown next over here we know
that that's what's going on but now

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:09.280
that that's what's going on but now
 

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.400
that that's what's going on but now
let's cheat now let's do something

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:11.410
let's cheat now let's do something
 

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:12.930
let's cheat now let's do something
slightly different I'm looking at the

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:12.940
slightly different I'm looking at the
 

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.460
slightly different I'm looking at the
yellow ball landing here and I'm looking

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:14.470
yellow ball landing here and I'm looking
 

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.020
yellow ball landing here and I'm looking
at the pink ball landing here and I'm

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:16.030
at the pink ball landing here and I'm
 

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.170
at the pink ball landing here and I'm
going well they're good friends why

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.180
going well they're good friends why
 

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.200
going well they're good friends why
don't I change places so in fact what we

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:22.210
don't I change places so in fact what we
 

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.170
don't I change places so in fact what we
can have is the yellow ball not come to

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:25.180
can have is the yellow ball not come to
 

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.030
can have is the yellow ball not come to
here but actually go to there where the

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040
here but actually go to there where the
 

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.800
here but actually go to there where the
pink ball would go so the yellow ball

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:28.810
pink ball would go so the yellow ball
 

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.620
pink ball would go so the yellow ball
actually go

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:29.630
actually go
 

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.720
actually go
to wear the pink ball would go and the

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:31.730
to wear the pink ball would go and the
 

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.340
to wear the pink ball would go and the
pink ball actually goes to wear the

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:33.350
pink ball actually goes to wear the
 

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.410
pink ball actually goes to wear the
yellow ball would go so they exchanged

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:37.420
yellow ball would go so they exchanged
 

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.900
yellow ball would go so they exchanged
landing sites they swap their sites it

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:40.910
landing sites they swap their sites it
 

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.370
landing sites they swap their sites it
is a site swap which is where we get the

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:45.380
is a site swap which is where we get the
 

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.680
is a site swap which is where we get the
name of the notation from they are

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:47.690
name of the notation from they are
 

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.460
name of the notation from they are
swapping the places that they go to and

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:50.470
swapping the places that they go to and
 

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.990
swapping the places that they go to and
that's great on the diagram what does it

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000
that's great on the diagram what does it
 

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.360
that's great on the diagram what does it
mean physically well if we look at this

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:55.370
mean physically well if we look at this
 

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.370
mean physically well if we look at this
the yellow would normally have this

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:57.380
the yellow would normally have this
 

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.940
the yellow would normally have this
cycle time of 4 but now the time it's

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:00.950
cycle time of 4 but now the time it's
 

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.450
cycle time of 4 but now the time it's
next thrown is 1 2 3 4 5 beats of time

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:04.460
next thrown is 1 2 3 4 5 beats of time
 

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.600
next thrown is 1 2 3 4 5 beats of time
in the future and the pink ball would be

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:07.610
in the future and the pink ball would be
 

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.300
in the future and the pink ball would be
normally 1 2 3 4 bitten it infects 1 2 3

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:10.310
normally 1 2 3 4 bitten it infects 1 2 3
 

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.420
normally 1 2 3 4 bitten it infects 1 2 3
it's 3 beats of time in the future so

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:13.430
it's 3 beats of time in the future so
 

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.040
it's 3 beats of time in the future so
what's happening is I'm doing lots of

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:15.050
what's happening is I'm doing lots of
 

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.070
what's happening is I'm doing lots of
cycle time for throws so I'm doing 4 4 4

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:18.080
cycle time for throws so I'm doing 4 4 4
 

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.660
cycle time for throws so I'm doing 4 4 4
4 4 and then suddenly and without

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:19.670
4 4 and then suddenly and without
 

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.700
4 4 and then suddenly and without
provocation I'm doing a 5 and a 3

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:21.710
provocation I'm doing a 5 and a 3
 

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.970
provocation I'm doing a 5 and a 3
according to my diagram and what's

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:24.980
according to my diagram and what's
 

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.830
according to my diagram and what's
really nice is that actually turns out

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:26.840
really nice is that actually turns out
 

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.480
really nice is that actually turns out
to be exactly the kind of throw that you

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:28.490
to be exactly the kind of throw that you
 

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.370
to be exactly the kind of throw that you
do when juggling five balls followed by

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:30.380
do when juggling five balls followed by
 

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.930
do when juggling five balls followed by
exactly the kind of throw you do in

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:31.940
exactly the kind of throw you do in
 

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.690
exactly the kind of throw you do in
juggling three balls so what's predicted

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:34.700
juggling three balls so what's predicted
 

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.910
juggling three balls so what's predicted
from the diagram turns out to be the

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920
from the diagram turns out to be the
 

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:39.370
from the diagram turns out to be the
case in reality and if I demonstrate

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:39.380
case in reality and if I demonstrate
 

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:45.240
case in reality and if I demonstrate
that I need the yellow pink green and

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:45.250
that I need the yellow pink green and
 

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.280
that I need the yellow pink green and
white in that order so yellow pink green

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.290
white in that order so yellow pink green
 

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.690
white in that order so yellow pink green
and I'm going to do the yellow and the

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:49.700
and I'm going to do the yellow and the
 

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.480
and I'm going to do the yellow and the
pink as the high and low as the five and

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:52.490
pink as the high and low as the five and
 

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.310
pink as the high and low as the five and
three so if I just juggled for for a

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320
three so if I just juggled for for a
 

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.720
three so if I just juggled for for a
while and then I'm going to do the

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:55.730
while and then I'm going to do the
 

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.060
while and then I'm going to do the
yellow ball high and the people of those

00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:58.070
yellow ball high and the people of those
 

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:03.670
yellow ball high and the people of those
so we can counting down so you three and

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680
so we can counting down so you three and
 

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.130
so we can counting down so you three and
you'll see that they have chained cans

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:06.140
you'll see that they have chained cans
 

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.830
you'll see that they have chained cans
as is predicted by the diagram the

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:08.840
as is predicted by the diagram the
 

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.240
as is predicted by the diagram the
yellow did go high

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:10.250
yellow did go high
 

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.670
yellow did go high
the pink did go low and they landed

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:12.680
the pink did go low and they landed
 

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.830
the pink did go low and they landed
perfectly in rhythm and I could just

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:14.840
perfectly in rhythm and I could just
 

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:22.890
perfectly in rhythm and I could just
carry on

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:22.900
 

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:32.560
[Applause]

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:32.570
 

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:36.320
so the brilliant thing there is that the

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:36.330
so the brilliant thing there is that the
 

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.450
so the brilliant thing there is that the
diagram lets us predict that this should

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:38.460
diagram lets us predict that this should
 

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.829
diagram lets us predict that this should
work and in fact this is a juggling

00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839
work and in fact this is a juggling
 

00:11:39.839 --> 00:11:43.550
work and in fact this is a juggling
trick that's been known and so now we

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560
trick that's been known and so now we
 

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.590
trick that's been known and so now we
can say okay well it's possible to do a

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600
can say okay well it's possible to do a
 

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.380
can say okay well it's possible to do a
four and it's possible to do a five

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:48.390
four and it's possible to do a five
 

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.710
four and it's possible to do a five
three we could have a look at pushing

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720
three we could have a look at pushing
 

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:55.790
three we could have a look at pushing
two of them one later and the other one

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800
two of them one later and the other one
 

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.670
two of them one later and the other one
has to be brought back more so instead

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680
has to be brought back more so instead
 

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.829
has to be brought back more so instead
of having a four four four

00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839
of having a four four four
 

00:12:00.839 --> 00:12:04.910
of having a four four four
it becomes five five and then the four

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920
it becomes five five and then the four
 

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.579
it becomes five five and then the four
has to become a two so we end up with

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:07.589
has to become a two so we end up with
 

00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:12.280
has to become a two so we end up with
five five two and that can also be done

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.290
five five two and that can also be done
 

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.050
five five two and that can also be done
and now you can see a pattern building

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060
and now you can see a pattern building
 

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.269
and now you can see a pattern building
so we get look at these last numbers

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279
so we get look at these last numbers
 

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.550
so we get look at these last numbers
here four three two and you predict that

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:19.560
here four three two and you predict that
 

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.050
here four three two and you predict that
there's going to be a one here all of

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:21.060
there's going to be a one here all of
 

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.920
there's going to be a one here all of
these are five so we get five five five

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:24.930
these are five so we get five five five
 

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.680
these are five so we get five five five
and we predict that this should be

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:27.690
and we predict that this should be
 

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.660
and we predict that this should be
possible and we can do it just from the

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:29.670
possible and we can do it just from the
 

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.390
possible and we can do it just from the
numbers we can do it by drawing the

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:32.400
numbers we can do it by drawing the
 

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.870
numbers we can do it by drawing the
diagram and when we first did this this

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880
diagram and when we first did this this
 

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.790
diagram and when we first did this this
was a juggling trick that we didn't know

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800
was a juggling trick that we didn't know
 

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.280
was a juggling trick that we didn't know
and as far as I know have actually never

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:40.290
and as far as I know have actually never
 

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.370
and as far as I know have actually never
been done when I took this to juggling

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:43.380
been done when I took this to juggling
 

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.560
been done when I took this to juggling
conventions people did not know it

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:45.570
conventions people did not know it
 

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.720
conventions people did not know it
after four months people from America

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:47.730
after four months people from America
 

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.250
after four months people from America
were trying to show it to me

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260
were trying to show it to me
 

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.720
were trying to show it to me
because it was a juggling trick that had

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:50.730
because it was a juggling trick that had
 

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.400
because it was a juggling trick that had
just gone right around the world from

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:52.410
just gone right around the world from
 

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.660
just gone right around the world from
juggling Club to juggling Club to

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:53.670
juggling Club to juggling Club to
 

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.210
juggling Club to juggling Club to
juggling Club it's called the fake five

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:56.220
juggling Club it's called the fake five
 

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.280
juggling Club it's called the fake five
because it feels and sounds a lot like

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:58.290
because it feels and sounds a lot like
 

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:00.920
because it feels and sounds a lot like
juggling five balls and if I actually do

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:00.930
juggling five balls and if I actually do
 

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:03.680
juggling five balls and if I actually do
it here we go so we get yellow yellow

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:03.690
it here we go so we get yellow yellow
 

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.519
it here we go so we get yellow yellow
pink green white so we do a single shot

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:07.529
pink green white so we do a single shot
 

00:13:07.529 --> 00:13:09.170
pink green white so we do a single shot
at this starting with the yellow ball

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180
at this starting with the yellow ball
 

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.310
at this starting with the yellow ball
counting three two one five five five

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320
counting three two one five five five
 

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.970
counting three two one five five five
one and those three high throws are

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:16.980
one and those three high throws are
 

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.560
one and those three high throws are
exactly the kind of throw that you would

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:18.570
exactly the kind of throw that you would
 

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.540
exactly the kind of throw that you would
do if you're juggling five balls but

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:20.550
do if you're juggling five balls but
 

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.579
do if you're juggling five balls but
hang on what's this one what am I doing

00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:22.589
hang on what's this one what am I doing
 

00:13:22.589 --> 00:13:24.199
hang on what's this one what am I doing
with the one and you may have noticed I

00:13:24.199 --> 00:13:24.209
with the one and you may have noticed I
 

00:13:24.209 --> 00:13:27.170
with the one and you may have noticed I
did a zip across underneath and we can

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180
did a zip across underneath and we can
 

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.060
did a zip across underneath and we can
actually show that on the diagram why

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:29.070
actually show that on the diagram why
 

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:45.100
actually show that on the diagram why
that becomes inevitable

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.110
 

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.020
what's this one business well once again

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:48.030
what's this one business well once again
 

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.030
what's this one business well once again
if we very very quickly sketch this I

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040
if we very very quickly sketch this I
 

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.440
if we very very quickly sketch this I
say I'm throwing here throwing here

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:51.450
say I'm throwing here throwing here
 

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:52.610
say I'm throwing here throwing here
throwing here throwing you're throwing

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620
throwing here throwing you're throwing
 

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:56.030
throwing here throwing you're throwing
here trying here I throw this ball I've

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040
here trying here I throw this ball I've
 

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.340
here trying here I throw this ball I've
only got one I have to throw it from

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:58.350
only got one I have to throw it from
 

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:00.890
only got one I have to throw it from
here it's got to be the same ball so

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:00.900
here it's got to be the same ball so
 

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.930
here it's got to be the same ball so
that means that the ball basically has

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940
that means that the ball basically has
 

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.120
that means that the ball basically has
to zip across to be held in a hand for a

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:05.130
to zip across to be held in a hand for a
 

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.610
to zip across to be held in a hand for a
short time to be zipped across to be

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620
short time to be zipped across to be
 

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.970
short time to be zipped across to be
held in the hand for a short time so in

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980
held in the hand for a short time so in
 

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.400
held in the hand for a short time so in
essence if the if the catch is happening

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:13.410
essence if the if the catch is happening
 

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.590
essence if the if the catch is happening
in the middle of those two throws then

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600
in the middle of those two throws then
 

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.240
in the middle of those two throws then
basically the ball gets slipped across

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.250
basically the ball gets slipped across
 

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.670
basically the ball gets slipped across
spending no time in the air at all and

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680
spending no time in the air at all and
 

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.890
spending no time in the air at all and
we can start to talk about the flight

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:21.900
we can start to talk about the flight
 

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.810
we can start to talk about the flight
time of the ball and how that compares

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:23.820
time of the ball and how that compares
 

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.390
time of the ball and how that compares
and if the catcher's are always in the

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:26.400
and if the catcher's are always in the
 

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.850
and if the catcher's are always in the
middle then we always have the ball in

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860
middle then we always have the ball in
 

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:31.880
middle then we always have the ball in
the hand for one beat so you've got your

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:31.890
the hand for one beat so you've got your
 

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:34.670
the hand for one beat so you've got your
cycle time you take up one beat of that

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680
cycle time you take up one beat of that
 

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.740
cycle time you take up one beat of that
with the dwell time and the flight time

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:36.750
with the dwell time and the flight time
 

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.050
with the dwell time and the flight time
is always there for one less than the

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060
is always there for one less than the
 

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.290
is always there for one less than the
total cycle time that has interesting

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300
total cycle time that has interesting
 

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.850
total cycle time that has interesting
implications if you look at zero ball

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:43.860
implications if you look at zero ball
 

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.350
implications if you look at zero ball
juggling because that would mean that

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360
juggling because that would mean that
 

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.000
juggling because that would mean that
the ball actually has to go backwards in

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.010
the ball actually has to go backwards in
 

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.060
the ball actually has to go backwards in
time but there aren't any balls but

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.070
time but there aren't any balls but
 

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:51.140
time but there aren't any balls but
there are some interesting things that

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:51.150
there are some interesting things that
 

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:53.900
there are some interesting things that
you can say about that but here we can

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:53.910
you can say about that but here we can
 

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.540
you can say about that but here we can
do a 1 a 0 is basically having an empty

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:56.550
do a 1 a 0 is basically having an empty
 

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.510
do a 1 a 0 is basically having an empty
hand and so now we can start to say well

00:14:59.510 --> 00:14:59.520
hand and so now we can start to say well
 

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:02.030
hand and so now we can start to say well
what what are all of the possibilities

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040
what what are all of the possibilities
 

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.580
what what are all of the possibilities
we can start to draw the diagrams are

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:04.590
we can start to draw the diagrams are
 

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.650
we can start to draw the diagrams are
there other ways of inventing juggling

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:06.660
there other ways of inventing juggling
 

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:08.750
there other ways of inventing juggling
tricks are there other ways of knowing

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:08.760
tricks are there other ways of knowing
 

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.270
tricks are there other ways of knowing
that we've got them all how does this

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:11.280
that we've got them all how does this
 

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.090
that we've got them all how does this
help us find every possible juggling

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100
help us find every possible juggling
 

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.560
help us find every possible juggling
trick when jugglers talk about the

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:15.570
trick when jugglers talk about the
 

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.360
trick when jugglers talk about the
height of a ball there are two possible

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.370
height of a ball there are two possible
 

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:18.650
height of a ball there are two possible
things that they could mean one is the

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660
things that they could mean one is the
 

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.690
things that they could mean one is the
physical height but we also talk about

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:20.700
physical height but we also talk about
 

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.170
physical height but we also talk about
the natural height of a five ball pan

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.180
the natural height of a five ball pan
 

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.540
the natural height of a five ball pan
and we'll call that a height five the

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:26.550
and we'll call that a height five the
 

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.090
and we'll call that a height five the
natural height of a six ball pattern and

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:29.100
natural height of a six ball pattern and
 

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.860
natural height of a six ball pattern and
we'll call that a six that varies

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:30.870
we'll call that a six that varies
 

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.440
we'll call that a six that varies
according to the speed but when you talk

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:33.450
according to the speed but when you talk
 

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.090
according to the speed but when you talk
about the height of a ball then you'll

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.100
about the height of a ball then you'll
 

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.010
about the height of a ball then you'll
tend to mean the the number of balls

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:37.020
tend to mean the the number of balls
 

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.950
tend to mean the the number of balls
that you're juggling for that given

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:38.960
that you're juggling for that given
 

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.530
that you're juggling for that given
physical height

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:40.540
physical height
 

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.810
physical height
so that the term is often used

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:42.820
so that the term is often used
 

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.420
so that the term is often used
interchangeably which can be confusing

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:45.430
interchangeably which can be confusing
 

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.640
interchangeably which can be confusing
but once you use it often enough it

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:47.650
but once you use it often enough it
 

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.050
but once you use it often enough it
stops being something that you're

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:49.060
stops being something that you're
 

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.520
stops being something that you're
worried about there are way diagrams

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:50.530
worried about there are way diagrams
 

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.190
worried about there are way diagrams
that help us which are finite state

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:53.200
that help us which are finite state
 

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.770
that help us which are finite state
diagrams but I can show you a finite

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:55.780
diagrams but I can show you a finite
 

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.230
diagrams but I can show you a finite
state diagram for every possible three

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240

ball juggling pattern where the height

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:00.520
ball juggling pattern where the height
 

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.110
ball juggling pattern where the height
of throat never exceeds five so let's do

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:04.120
of throat never exceeds five so let's do
 

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.380
of throat never exceeds five so let's do
that what I do know is that there are

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:06.390
that what I do know is that there are
 

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:10.050
that what I do know is that there are
ten places to be and as I draw this

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:10.060
ten places to be and as I draw this
 

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.250
ten places to be and as I draw this
you'll think hang on that's only eight

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:11.260
you'll think hang on that's only eight
 

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.570
you'll think hang on that's only eight
but I'm going to put an extra one here

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:12.580
but I'm going to put an extra one here
 

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.430
but I'm going to put an extra one here
in an extra one here and I'm going to

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:14.440
in an extra one here and I'm going to
 

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.020
in an extra one here and I'm going to
start in a strange place I'm going to

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.030
start in a strange place I'm going to
 

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.210
start in a strange place I'm going to
start here and I'm going to label that

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:18.220
start here and I'm going to label that
 

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.120
start here and I'm going to label that
arrow as a three and the way you read

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:21.130
arrow as a three and the way you read
 

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.400
arrow as a three and the way you read
this diagram is that you follow the

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:23.410
this diagram is that you follow the
 

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:25.740
this diagram is that you follow the
arrow and write down the number and that

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:25.750
arrow and write down the number and that
 

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.750
arrow and write down the number and that
tells you the cycle time of the throw

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:27.760
tells you the cycle time of the throw
 

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.270
tells you the cycle time of the throw
you're doing so this tells you that I

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:30.280
you're doing so this tells you that I
 

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.280
you're doing so this tells you that I
can do three three three three three

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:32.290
can do three three three three three
 

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.530
can do three three three three three
three and that's good because that's the

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:34.540
three and that's good because that's the
 

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.070
three and that's good because that's the
native three ball pattern from there I

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:38.080
native three ball pattern from there I
 

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.190
native three ball pattern from there I
could also do a four and come back with

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:41.200
could also do a four and come back with
 

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:48.360
could also do a four and come back with
a two now I haven't talked about a two

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:48.370
a two now I haven't talked about a two
 

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.130
a two now I haven't talked about a two
but basically if you've got two juggling

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:50.140
but basically if you've got two juggling
 

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.230
but basically if you've got two juggling
balls then really the only thing that

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240
balls then really the only thing that
 

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.390
balls then really the only thing that
you're gonna do is two two two two two

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:54.400
you're gonna do is two two two two two
 

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.310
you're gonna do is two two two two two
two two two two two and if you draw the

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320
two two two two two and if you draw the
 

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.230
two two two two two and if you draw the
diagram that really is how it looks

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240
diagram that really is how it looks
 

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.850
diagram that really is how it looks
you're just hanging on to the balls you

00:16:59.850 --> 00:16:59.860
you're just hanging on to the balls you
 

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.770
you're just hanging on to the balls you
don't really even need to let them go so

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:01.780
don't really even need to let them go so
 

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.800
don't really even need to let them go so
that's green and orange okay so having

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:04.810
that's green and orange okay so having
 

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.650
that's green and orange okay so having
done that if I do a four it turns out

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:07.660
done that if I do a four it turns out
 

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.780
done that if I do a four it turns out
that I can actually do a five after that

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:09.790
that I can actually do a five after that
 

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.390
that I can actually do a five after that
if I choose to going there there's also

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400
if I choose to going there there's also
 

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.210
if I choose to going there there's also
a one coming back here and if I stop for

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:15.220
a one coming back here and if I stop for
 

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.040
a one coming back here and if I stop for
a moment and pull out some of the

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.050
a moment and pull out some of the
 

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.790
a moment and pull out some of the
patterns that we've got here four four

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:20.800
patterns that we've got here four four
 

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.990
patterns that we've got here four four
one was one of the very very earliest

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000
one was one of the very very earliest
 

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.090
one was one of the very very earliest
patterns that we ever found by using

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:27.100
patterns that we ever found by using
 

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.610
patterns that we ever found by using
these techniques and that's the one that

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:29.620
these techniques and that's the one that
 

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.410
these techniques and that's the one that
I use to torture they're really good

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:31.420
I use to torture they're really good
 

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.330
I use to torture they're really good
jugglers at the European juggling

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:33.340
jugglers at the European juggling
 

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.730
jugglers at the European juggling
convention because it's only three ball

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:35.740
convention because it's only three ball
 

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.570
convention because it's only three ball
juggling it looks a lot like a pattern

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:39.580
juggling it looks a lot like a pattern
 

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.370
juggling it looks a lot like a pattern
that they know which is called the box

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:41.380
that they know which is called the box
 

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.060
that they know which is called the box
but it's not it's much easier it's much

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:45.070
but it's not it's much easier it's much
 

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.120
but it's not it's much easier it's much
lower it's much cleaner and every time I

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:48.130
lower it's much cleaner and every time I
 

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.650
lower it's much cleaner and every time I
showed it to them and they tried to do

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:49.660
showed it to them and they tried to do
 

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.750
showed it to them and they tried to do
it they couldn't do it so this was a

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760
it they couldn't do it so this was a
 

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.300
it they couldn't do it so this was a
great way of getting

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:53.310
great way of getting
 

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.040
great way of getting
really good jugglers hooked on this I

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:55.050
really good jugglers hooked on this I
 

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.080
really good jugglers hooked on this I
where did you find this pattern and so I

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:57.090
where did you find this pattern and so I
 

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.120
where did you find this pattern and so I
could then start to talk about this what

00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.130
could then start to talk about this what
 

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.220
could then start to talk about this what
does a 4 4 4 4 1 okay so four four one

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:03.230
does a 4 4 4 4 1 okay so four four one
 

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.630
does a 4 4 4 4 1 okay so four four one
what I have to do is I have to do a 4

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:05.640
what I have to do is I have to do a 4
 

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.810
what I have to do is I have to do a 4
and then a 4 and then a 1 now I'll do

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820
and then a 4 and then a 1 now I'll do
 

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.370
and then a 4 and then a 1 now I'll do
that I'll start with three ball juggling

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.380
that I'll start with three ball juggling
 

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.600
that I'll start with three ball juggling
and then I'll start I'll just do a

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:11.610
and then I'll start I'll just do a
 

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.250
and then I'll start I'll just do a
single shot starting with the orange

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260
single shot starting with the orange
 

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.670
single shot starting with the orange
ball and so next time round so we get 4

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:16.680
ball and so next time round so we get 4
 

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.030
ball and so next time round so we get 4
4 1 and I'll do it again one shot 4 4 1

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:20.040
4 1 and I'll do it again one shot 4 4 1
 

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.510
4 1 and I'll do it again one shot 4 4 1
and now if I do it constantly we get 4 4

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520
and now if I do it constantly we get 4 4
 

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.990
and now if I do it constantly we get 4 4
1 4 4 or 4 months and if you watch each

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000
1 4 4 or 4 months and if you watch each
 

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.390
1 4 4 or 4 months and if you watch each
ball goes everywhere and that's the

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400
ball goes everywhere and that's the
 

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.100
ball goes everywhere and that's the
really cool thing about this pattern is

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.110
really cool thing about this pattern is
 

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.680
really cool thing about this pattern is
all three balls are doing the same thing

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:33.690
all three balls are doing the same thing
 

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.370
all three balls are doing the same thing
but out of phase in such a way that they

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380
but out of phase in such a way that they
 

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.560
but out of phase in such a way that they
all meet together and then in the middle

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:39.570
all meet together and then in the middle
 

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.750
all meet together and then in the middle
of doing all of that you can simply drop

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760
of doing all of that you can simply drop
 

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.790
of doing all of that you can simply drop
back to doing 3 balls and it just

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:43.800
back to doing 3 balls and it just
 

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.970
back to doing 3 balls and it just
disappears it's just a really cool neat

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:46.980
disappears it's just a really cool neat
 

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.550
disappears it's just a really cool neat
clean pattern and and I love it

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:49.560
clean pattern and and I love it
 

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.870
clean pattern and and I love it
particularly cuz it's one of one of the

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880
particularly cuz it's one of one of the
 

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:58.160
particularly cuz it's one of one of the
ones we found

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:58.170
 

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.950
[Music]

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960
 

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.760
now there's an interesting thing that

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:04.770
now there's an interesting thing that
 

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.340
now there's an interesting thing that
happens here is that you get patterns

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:07.350
happens here is that you get patterns
 

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.410
happens here is that you get patterns
that start and finish here but don't

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:09.420
that start and finish here but don't
 

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.540
that start and finish here but don't
travel over there and patterns that

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:11.550
travel over there and patterns that
 

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:13.400
travel over there and patterns that
start and finish here but don't travel

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:13.410
start and finish here but don't travel
 

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.590
start and finish here but don't travel
over there and so within the juggling

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600
over there and so within the juggling
 

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.570
over there and so within the juggling
world there's a thing known as excited

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:17.580
world there's a thing known as excited
 

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.270

patterns that you can't do just starting

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280
patterns that you can't do just starting
 

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.630
patterns that you can't do just starting
from the 3-ball cascade and they're a

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640
from the 3-ball cascade and they're a
 

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.490
from the 3-ball cascade and they're a
ground state which are patterns that you

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500
ground state which are patterns that you
 

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.730
ground state which are patterns that you
can so for example five three one five

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:28.740
can so for example five three one five
 

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.620
can so for example five three one five
three one you can just patch that into

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:30.630
three one you can just patch that into
 

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:37.400
three one you can just patch that into
the middle of a cascade but five one

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:37.410
the middle of a cascade but five one
 

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.200

figure of eight you have to do a
 

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:56.060
figure of eight you have to do a
preparatory throw and there are

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:56.070
preparatory throw and there are
 

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.680
preparatory throw and there are
different preparatory throws that you

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:57.690
different preparatory throws that you
 

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.520
different preparatory throws that you
can do so for example you can do a four

all the balls are currently in the air
so I have zero juggling balls to throw

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840
so I have zero juggling balls to throw
 

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.039
so I have zero juggling balls to throw
and what's the one a one is this one

00:21:31.039 --> 00:21:31.049
and what's the one a one is this one

that transfers directly from one hand to
 

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:34.100
that transfers directly from one hand to
the other so if I've only got one

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.110
the other so if I've only got one
 

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.139
the other so if I've only got one
juggling ball I actually just transfer

doing this which is surprisingly
 

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:45.139
doing this which is surprisingly
difficult because you have to throw in

00:21:45.139 --> 00:21:45.149
difficult because you have to throw in
 

00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:47.149

nerdy way of looking at their art it's

00:22:29.239 --> 00:22:29.249
nerdy way of looking at their art it's
 

00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:31.999
nerdy way of looking at their art it's
fairly clear that almost everybody who's

00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:32.009
fairly clear that almost everybody who's
 

00:22:32.009 --> 00:22:35.060
fairly clear that almost everybody who's
heard of the notation and it really is

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:35.070
heard of the notation and it really is

split fairly evenly you know it might

00:22:37.759 --> 00:22:37.769
split fairly evenly you know it might
 

00:22:37.769 --> 00:22:40.580
split fairly evenly you know it might
not be 5050 it might be 6040 but but

there's a good proportion of people who

00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:42.749
there's a good proportion of people who
 

00:22:42.749 --> 00:22:45.349
there's a good proportion of people who
actually can use this to communicate

actually can use this to communicate
 

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:47.779
actually can use this to communicate
with each other a slightly smaller

notations and of course we've got rules

00:22:52.489 --> 00:22:52.499
notations and of course we've got rules
 

00:22:52.499 --> 00:22:54.320
notations and of course we've got rules
underneath this and the idea then is how

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:54.330
underneath this and the idea then is how
 

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:56.119
underneath this and the idea then is how
do we break these rules to do things

00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:56.129
do we break these rules to do things
 

00:22:56.129 --> 00:22:58.369
do we break these rules to do things
which are more artistic potentially then

00:22:58.369 --> 00:22:58.379
which are more artistic potentially then
 

00:22:58.379 --> 00:23:00.289
which are more artistic potentially then

juggling worlds they don't like this

00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:11.549
juggling worlds they don't like this
 

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:13.249
juggling worlds they don't like this
they know it's there they don't want to

00:23:13.249 --> 00:23:13.259
they know it's there they don't want to
 

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:14.989
they know it's there they don't want to
use it if somebody comes to them and

00:23:14.989 --> 00:23:14.999
use it if somebody comes to them and
 

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:16.700
use it if somebody comes to them and
says this is a really cool pattern what

can you make of this they want you to
 

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.409
can you make of this they want you to
demonstrate what it is so they can then

00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:21.419
demonstrate what it is so they can then

just for two done in a very clever ways

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:57.110
 

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.750
so I do pick out what the patterns are

00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760
so I do pick out what the patterns are
 

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.150

does then mean that I don't have to

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:03.929
does then mean that I don't have to
 

00:24:03.929 --> 00:24:05.630

the structure of what's going on and so
 

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.720
the structure of what's going on and so
it is when I watch juggling I see the

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:35.730
it is when I watch juggling I see the
 

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.180
it is when I watch juggling I see the
pattern and I have the siteswap in my

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:38.190
pattern and I have the siteswap in my
 

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.950

head of what they're doing and that then
lets me see more about what's going on

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120
lets me see more about what's going on
 

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.870
lets me see more about what's going on
in more of the detail underneath
