00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.590
Some of the issues that arise when we try to determine relationships.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.330
First of all, all of the indicated classes are really part of

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.650
an overarching TreeCountingSystem class, as we mentioned before.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.180
Such system classes are not normally displayed in these diagrams. But

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.320
you can think of each of the rectangles as being a part of, or an attribute of.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.260
The, this overarching class. The textual description from which we, began was

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.100
not truly characteristic, obviously, of typical requirements documents, which

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.060
can go on for hundreds of pages and have lots of specialized vocabulary. Also,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.320
we went into implementation details. It was actually describing an algorithm.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.660
Requirements documents don't necessarily describe solutions, they

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.230
describe problems. In general it is important to distinguish the analysis and

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.210
design phases of a software development effort in order to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.940
avoid prematurely biasing the approach taken towards solution.
