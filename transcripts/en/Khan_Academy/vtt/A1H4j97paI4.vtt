00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.960
- [Instructor] So we have some data here

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.650
that we can plot on a scatter plot

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.380
that looks something like that.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.920
And so, the next question
given that we've been talking

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.660
a lot about lines of
regression or regression lines

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.230
is can we fit a regression line to this?

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.817
Well, if we try to, we might get something

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.310
that looks like this, or maybe something

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.070
that looks like this,
I'm just eyeballing it,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.200
obviously you can input it into a computer

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.620
to try to develop a
linear regression model

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.040
to try to minimize the sum
of the square distances

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.640
from the points to the line.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.780
But you can see it's pretty difficult.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.050
And some of you might be saying,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.570
well, this looks more like
some type of an exponential.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.930
So maybe we could fit
an exponential to it.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.270
So it could look something like that.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.450
And you wouldn't be wrong.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.470
But there is a way that
we can apply our tools

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.090
of linear regression to this dataset.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.770
And the way we can is instead
of plotting x versus y,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.090
we can think about x
versus the logarithm of y.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.230
So this is the exact same data set.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.220
You see the x values are the same.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.850
But for the y values, I just took

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.170
the log base 10 of all of these.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.650
So 10 to the what power
is equal to 2,307.23.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.650
10 to the 3.36 power is equal to 2,307.23.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.310
And I did that for all
of these data points,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.670
I did it on a spreadsheet.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.070
And if you were to plot all of these,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.270
something neat happens.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.690
All of a sudden, when we're
plotting x versus the log of y,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.750
or the log of y versus x, all
of a sudden, it looks linear.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.220
Now, be clear.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.260
The true relationship between
x and y is not linear.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.500
It looks like some type of
an exponential relationship,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.150
but the value of transforming the data,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.720
and there's different ways you can do it.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.370
In this case, the value
taking the log of y,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.150
and thinking about that
way, is now we can use

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.030
our tools of linear regression
because this data set,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.910
you could actually fit
a linear regression line

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.640
to this quite well.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.680
You can imagine a line that
looks something like this,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.020
it would fit the data quite well.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.890
And the reason why you might wanna do this

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.760
versus trying to fit an exponential

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.080
is because we've already
developed so many tools

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.850
around linear regression
and hypothesis testing

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.029
around the slope and confidence intervals

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.090
and so, this might be the
direction you wanna go at.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.270
And what's neat is once you
fit a linear regression,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.580
it's not difficult to
mathematically unwind

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.870
from your linear model
back to an exponential one.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.920
So the big takeaway here is that the tools

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.768
of linear regression can be useful

00:02:35.768 --> 00:02:38.100
even when the underlying relationship

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.920
between x and y are non-linear

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.710
and the way that we do that
is by transforming the data.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.600
Here, we took a logarithm of the y's

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.150
and that helped us see a
more linear relationship

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.393
of log y versus x.
