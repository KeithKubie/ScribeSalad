DANNY: Jeanette and Joe-- man,
these are some cool people.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.210
They brought us
their beloved Bronco

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.120
to get some very special
custom touches on her

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.710
and to make sure that
she's ready to rock

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.620
for at least another 20 years.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.000
Nick did an amazing
job commemorating some

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.670
of the family heroes on
the hood of this truck,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.380
and I cannot wait to see
the look in their eyes

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.540
when they land on this beautiful
brand-new 20-year-old Bronco.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.380
I gotta ask you some questions
before we get into the Bronco,

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.540
OK?

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.580
Now what year is
this again? '90--

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.250
- '96.
- '96.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.920
And you've had her for how long?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.210
I'm the original owner.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.750
- The original owner of this?
- Yeah.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.750
This is a really nice vehicle.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.710
So what are you all going
to do with this truck now?

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.830
Well, we're still going
to keep it as our workhorse.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.040
We're going to drive it around.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.500
Your workhorse?
JOE: Yeah.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000
It's too beautiful
to be a workhorse.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.500
I know, but then what's
the sense of having it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.920
if you can't show it off?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.380
I love it.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.500
It's really cool, and I
think you guys are going

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.880
to have a ball in it, so--

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.080
- You're getting me going now.
- [laughing]

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.210
- Should we just look at it?
- Yes.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.500
Quit talking about it?
Come on.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.080
All right.
I'm ready.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.920
Ryan, come on, man.
[music playing]

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.750
Bring out that Bronco.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.250
[engine starting]

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.790
Soak it in.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.750
Oh wow.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.750
JEANETTE: What is that?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.620
[laughing] Wow.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.620
Oh, god.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.620
Wow.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.420
Look at-- unbelievable.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.250
Beyond my wildest dreams.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.880
DANNY: We made some necessary
mechanical and cosmetic fixes

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.040
on this Bronco to make her look
like new, but man, oh, man.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.710
Ryan's beautiful paint job
coupled with Nick's portrait

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.250
work transformed
this Bronco's hood

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.380
into a piece of art
that would look right

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.120
at home hanging in a museum.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.290
But we didn't stop there, man.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.210
We installed that
brand-new crate

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.960
engine straight from Ford,
disc brakes all the way around.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.580
And inside, Pauly did that
beautiful double diamond

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.750
stitched interior,
complete with a gun

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.460
safe in the center console.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.080
I'm so proud of my guys
and how beautifully

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.500
they did this truck.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.330
You brought us a very
original, clean vehicle.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.120
So everything has been
gone through on her,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.920
and then we put a brand-new
set of tires on it.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.330
These are Cooper Discoverer
A/T3's, so brand-new.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.920
Nobody's got these yet.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.290
They're a whole new line
that Cooper's come out with.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.170
These are their All-Terrain 3's.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.290
American made--
they're fantastic.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.290
So you're going to dig the
ride on that going along.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.330
OK.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.670
DANNY: The drivetrain-- all new.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.460
The engine-- all new.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.620
Everything is all new, so she
drives like a brand-new truck,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.330
like she should.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.460
And she looks better than any
brand-new truck could look.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.830
Originally, what you
guys started out with

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.670
was an Eddie Bauer
edition Bronco.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.210
What I wanted to do was
get a little '70s in it

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.960
from the older
model Broncos where

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.880
they brought the two-tone line
on the bottom over the wheel

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.500
well.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.830
They kind of pushed the fender
flares out a little bit.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.500
Lowers the top of the
vehicle, but makes

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.540
the bottom of the
vehicle look much higher.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.000
And he slipped in some
beautiful stars and stripes.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.210
JOE: Yes.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.880
DANNY: You guys
wanted it patriotic,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.960
but you didn't want to make
a billboard out of it, so--

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.710
JOE: Correct.
Correct.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.540
[click]
- There it is.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.670
There it is.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.210
Oh, wow.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.460
So literally everything
under the hood is factory Ford,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.500
but it's brand-new.
JOE: Wow.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.540
DANNY: So this is
ready to be driven

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.380
for another gazillion
miles, and you're not going

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.500
to have any issues with it.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.960
And I will.
DANNY: Absolutely.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.710
It's done everywhere inside now.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.710
Watch your hands.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.040
[thump]

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.830
Solid.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.250
Rock solid.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.040
The mural on the hood--

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.920
who we got here?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.540
JOE: That's my father.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.920
DANNY: That's your father.
JEANETTE: In the Navy, yeah.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.170
JOE: In World War II.
JEANETTE: In the Navy.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.040
DANNY: In World War II.
JOE: Right.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.080
DANNY: God bless him.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.710
- My brother.
- Your brother.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.580
He was in Vietnam War
also, during that time frame.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.000
DANNY: Amen.
JOE: Myself.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.170
DANNY: Yourself.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.330
That's a handsome
man right there.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.380
ALL: [laughing]
DANNY: I love it.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.670
JEANETTE: That's
the man I married.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.670
[laughing]
DANNY: I love it.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.710
Oh, my god, I love it.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.000
JOE: This is my nephew Brian.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.420
DANNY: How do you
feel about the hood?

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.250
Oh--

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.670
Correct?

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.880
No words could
describe how I'm feeling.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.420
Amen.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.580
From the bottom my heart,
I can't thank you enough.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.710
JEANETTE: We're taking our
family with us wherever we go.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.080
That's beautiful.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.710
Man, I'm so glad that
Jeannette and Joe are

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.710
thrilled with this truck, man.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.120
And I'm so happy that
another military tribute

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.290
vehicle has come out of
my shop, Count's Kustoms.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.790
Glad you guys are
happy, and that's all--

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.210
JEANETTE: More than happy.
- That's what we wanted.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.380
JEANETTE: It's got
your stink on it.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.210
Amen.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.460
JEANETTE: [laughing]

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.790
DANNY: Got our stink
all over it, baby.
