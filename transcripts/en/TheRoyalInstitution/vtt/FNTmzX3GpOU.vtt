00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.580
This is one of my favourite things to do

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.480
not just because I love drinking wine

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.000
but because i love making music.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.360
A few years ago I was at a conference

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.120
and i saw this couple called 'The Glass Duo'

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.240
who played the glass harp, an instrument made out of wine glasses

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.200
And i thought: 'I've got to try it'.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.940
It is really simple to do, you just need any glass with a stem.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.680
And some glasses work better than others

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.340
so it's worthwhile trying lots of different
glasses.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.580
Now you need to wet your hand and you just need to apply some pressure

00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:57.181
around the rim of the glass

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.020
and hold the base really steady.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.079
You can start softly and then apply more pressure

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.600
until you get a good note.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.600
I love doing this with my daughter, not just because it's an amazing phenomenon

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.770
but because it allowed us to do some really
simple science together,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.660
where we can investigate and observe how changing one thing can affect another.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.610
So Tilly, we're going to look at making some sounds today

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.570
with different objects.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.960
How do you reckon you could make a sound with that?

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.050
Do you want to try pinging one of the glasses and seeing what sound it makes?

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.070
So, what happens when you hit the glasses?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.610
It makes a noise.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.829
What happens when you hit the different glasses?

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.749
It makes a different noise.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.589
How is that noise different to that noise?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.450
Because this one is lower.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.880
OK so, I'm going to show you a different way to make a sound with the glasses.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.840
For this we have got to get our hands wet.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840
Do you want to?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.380
I'm going to dip my finger in this juice

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.910
and I'm going to put it around the glass like that.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.920
Can you hear that? Would you like to try?

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.409
That's it, I'll hold the glass.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.169
Keep going.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.320
Well done you are making a note, that's really good!

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.349
Let's do it with a different glass.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.900
So what's happening with that one?

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.540
It's making a different noise.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.940
It's a different noise isn't it, well done.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.520
That's a nice one. I think this one is the best.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.220
One of the reasons that I find this so delightful

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.840
is that it's surprising. 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.760
If you didn't already know about it, you wouldn't guess

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.080
that you could do this with a wine glass.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.860
When you hit a wine glass like this,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.320
it makes it vibrate and that produces a sound.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.940
It's not always easy to see but if
something is making a sound

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.620
some part of it must be vibrating.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.500
In the case of making a wine glass sing like this,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.680
it's not obvious what's making the glass vibrate

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.000
and what's actually happening, is as you move your fingers around the rim of the glass

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.080
they repeatedly stick and slide off the glass.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.260
It's this repeated sticking and sliding around the glass that makes the glass vibrate

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.800
and produces the note.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.780
Different glasses vibrate in different ways

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.160
and so produce different notes.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.540
Putting fluid in the glass also makes it vibrate in a different way.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.380
And the more fluid there is in a glass

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.420
the lower the pitch of the note.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.060
It's different. 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.720
With enough glasses and a little bit of practice you might be able to do something like this:

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:18.680
Plays "Ode to joy'
