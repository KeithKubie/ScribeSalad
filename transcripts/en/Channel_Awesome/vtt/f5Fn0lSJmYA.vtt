00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.600
Hello. I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.480
This is one of those movies that doesn't even need an introduction.

00:00:08.488 --> 00:00:12.240
I don't need to say anything about it.
 All you gotta do is look at the fucking cover.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.120
If you didn't laugh your ass off looking at this, then call the insane asylum they've been looking for you.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.860
This is Zeus and Roxanne.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.700
From the brilliant director of The NeverEnding Story 2,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.220
Here's a story about a dog in a dolphin who befriend one another. How can you even say that with a straight face?

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.620
A dog and a dolphin

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.180
Was there no room for 
a pony and a chipmunk to join the fun?!

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.559
And to make sure there is absolutely nothing redeemable about this movie,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.020
They added Steve Guttenberg. What a cherry on the top.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.980
So, for all of you who always wanted to see Flipper meets Lassie.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.260
Get some fucking help!

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.480
For the rest of us, this is Zeus and Roxanne.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.900
So we open up with the pretty sunrise over the ocean.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.380
Naaaaaah! This movie sucks!

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:08.840
You got totally screwed! Did you even see the posteeeer? And you paid money for thisssssss.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.160
Wow this movie wastes no time sucking, does it?!

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.420
It simply jumps right into the heart of what's going to be absolutely horrible about this premise.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.220
So dog likes dolphin how touching, and creepy, but surely there's some human characters to balance out the insipidus of the story?

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.780
Hey, I said human! That's Steve Guttenberg!

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.020
Dodger, do I smell some dinner?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.480
"Breakfast." "I knew that." 
"You've been up all night again, huh?"

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.720
"Sorry, It's just that.."

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.180
"I've been working on this melody, and.."

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.729
What did he marry this kid or something? He's cooking for him, he's trying to be responsible for him...

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.280
Who knew owning a Steve Guttenberg 
would be so much work?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.400
"So, uh, what's in this burrito?" 
"Refried beans, onions, jalapenos, peanut butter, mozzarella cheese, pineapple chunks.."

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.760
Zeus! Psst! Good boy, yes. Eat up! Thank you, thank you. Oh good, you finished yours. I'll go get you another one.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.200
[ Wah-wah trombone ]

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.100
So this is Terry and his son Jordan.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.140
They have a summer home in Key West and live right next door to a marine biologist

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.740
named Mary Beth and her two 
daughters, Judith and Nora,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.180
The only downside is that their dog Zeus seems to keep getting into trouble over a Mary Beth's house.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.680
"I'm so sorry. I'm Terry Barnett."

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.360
"Mary Beth." 
"Mary Beth.."

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.800
Excuse me, my forced, wide-eyed whimsicalness 
seems to follow me to have a performance

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.040
"Me Terry, you?"

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.840
"Judith?"
 "You?" 
"Nora."

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.000
Ohhh....

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.480
Oh wait, you forgot to make that charming or clever.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.080
So while Guttenberg agrees to keep a closer eye on Zeus, he writes jingles for his next commercial.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.650
That's right..

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.820
He writes jingles for commercials. Who knew that could pay for a summer home in Key West?

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.240
Next you'll be telling me the internet 
reviewers can make a living making fun of movies.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.740
Good Ol' Guttenberg, keeping a close eye on their dog to make sure that no danger may befall him!

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.640
Idiot.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.940
Dolphin! Dolphin!

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.860
I'm a dog who is horny for a dolphin! Don't ask me why, I just want a dolphin! DOLPHIN!

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.060
So we see that Mary Beth is trying to get a grant for her research on a dolphin named Roxanne

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.860
The only problem is she has competition with--
"I didn't know I ever had one"

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.280
AHHHH! THE MUMMY (actually Arnold Vosloo)!

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.440
"Let me know if you change your mind."

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.410
I can respect to trying to kill Brendan Fraser, 
but you leave Mary Beth alone!

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.420
So our species confused canine follows Mary Beth through extreme measures to get on board and see Roxanne

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.320
By the sequel rights of Darkman...

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.140
So our two scientists discovered that Zeus is on board and deduce there's nothing they can do but continue on to Roxanne

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.020
[ "Gilligan's Island" theme ]

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.800
So they finally come across the chipper Roxanne as Zeus want to get a closer look at her

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.600
O-kay, this is getting scary.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.330
Zeus obviously has a sick obsession 
that is probably not very healthy

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.790
Don't believe me? Then check out his porn!

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.060
So when it looks like their research is over,
 they pull up the anchor and take off.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.520
YES! Yes, yes, yes! That was awesome! 
Let's see that again!

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.980
Oh my God, I could watch that a million times...!

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.280
[ Maniacal Laughter ]

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.640
Thank you for that movie. 
I really needed that! Ok, continue to suck now.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.640
Did I just see that?!

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.290
A dolphin just punched a shark in the fucking mouth?! Are you fucking serious?

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.380
Good Lord, who knew that a 
dolphin punch was so deadly?!

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.880
Why can't we get those things the Pearl Harbor? They would have saved the day!

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.840
We shall bomb the harbor, and -- 
OH MY GOD GIANT DOLPHIN!

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.480
[ screams of terror ]

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.040
Fear the Dolphin Punch! It knocks out sharks.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.180
"Oh my gosh. Come here!"

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.900
"Get the camera..."

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.700
I have to document how stupid this moment is.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.120
So it turns out not only did the dog and dolphin like each other, but they can also communicate with each other!

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.680
So Gary Beth think she's a shoo-in now for the grant,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.900
but first she has to ask Guttenberg's son, Jordan, if it's all right to keep using it.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.740
"Wow. Did you do all these?"
"Yeah."

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.980
That one's going to be the cover
from my dad's opera score.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.100
So let me get this straight.

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.800
We have a dog who has a strange obsession with a dolphin,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.080
and a boy who has a strange obsession with a dog?

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.799
This is like a psychiatric case from Doctor Doolittle!

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.940
"It might be really interesting to get the two together, Zeus and Roxanne,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.160
And just seeing how things sort of go from there."

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.720
The son agrees as they all go out to sea to watch the two communicate.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.940
"What's she doing out there with that dog?"
"I'll tell you what you she's doing..."

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:42.539
she's trying to steal my grant. 
Well, that's just not gonna happen."

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.380
"No, sir."

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.760
I was just establishing that I was the villain of this picture...

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.440
D-Did you get that did you get that?

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.700
That I was the villain of this picture? Because I am!

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.379
Because I don't want to get her grant, no sir.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.590
Villain!

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.820
So we think Mary Beth's daughters get in trouble for trespassing but luckily, Rebel without a Career drops by

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.200
to talk with the cop. He seems to convince the cops to let the girls go as he

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.400
quite illegally drives all of them away on his motorcycle,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.380
This, of course, leads to more quirky awkward talk from our romantic leads.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.100
"She's asking him out."

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.220
"Yeah, you could..."

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.760
"Right!"

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.780
Wha- di- d'hey! What, wh- Uh? Wha- HEY!

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.600
Bad montage off the port bow!

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.320
So while Jordan takes a picture of...

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.280
So while Jordan takes a picture of...
My nightmare for the next two weeks,

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.400
Mary Beth and Guttenberg seemed to hit it off quite well

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.620
By the movie's standards.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.340
for the rest of us. It's like watching a bad episode of Blind Date

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.809
"This uh... this Claude guy..."

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.410
"Do you see him?"

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:01.079
"Every day. He's a head honcho at the institute.
 I should be his assistant,

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:06.419
but we had a parting of the ways." 
"Would it be tactless to ask over what?"

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.440
"Third party."

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.339
"I apologize. Never mind, I--"
"A dolphin."

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.920
So after Guttenberg and Mary Beth make it to first base. We see our villain trying to sneak a peek at her research.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.460
What is he doing with his lip?! What, he turned a Beaker from the Muppets for a second?

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.720
So he escapes and sees if he can try  dolphin communication with other animals.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:42.240
But sadly, none of them has the sick, disturbing love that Zeus and Roxanne seem to feel for each other

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.960
Hey! Speaking of which, we haven't seen much of them have we?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.420
I mean, we're at the hour mark here, And we've only had two scenes with the animals together!

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.469
One was only ten minutes, of the other was under five!

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:57.959
They should have just called this movie 
"Guttenberg and Mary Steenburgen Look-Alike!" 
That would have been more accurate!

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:00.339
"Uh-oh, drift nets..."

00:10:00.339 --> 00:10:04.768
"They kill thousands of dolphins every year.
Come on, let's lead Roxanne out of here."

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.809
Yeah, we don't want to get caught in those nets
 now, if a fucking shark comes along!

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.659
THAT'S okay, but if she gets caught
 in one of those nets, *phew*, it's all over!

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:17.519
So, after a few more days, our lovebirds decide Guttenberg should move in with Mary Beth

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:21.520
But this leads to some issues that he starts thinking about his deceased wife.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.479
"What are we doing this for? We do this for us?"

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.539
"We doing this for the Rothman Foundation,
 or are we doing it for the kids?"

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.220
"All of the above."

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.320
"I don't know..."

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.340
I think you missed a line. You're supposed to say I'm having second thoughts,

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.139
she's supposed to say why, and then you say--
O-kay, you don't know

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.600
So because Huttenberg doesn't know he decides he wants to move away and take Zeus and Jordan with him.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.580
This leads to the most groundbreaking questions that this movie- no, no, no

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.540
ANY ovie has ever asked in the history of Man!

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:03.860
"If a dog and a dolphin can get along,
why can't our mom and his dad?"

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.360
My god.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.760
It was so simple all this time!

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.019
The dog and the dolphin!
We must look to the dog and dolphin!

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.180
Yes, quickly, get me everybody in the world!
They all need to hear this!

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.900
If a dog and a dolphin can get along with each other,
 why can't our mom and his dad?!

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.820
Yes, I know! Let them know... let them all know!

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.840
A dog and a dolphin.
A dog and a dolphin!

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.440
So after Guttenberg, Jordan, and Zeus finally move away, we see that Zeus spends most of his time watching--

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.240
Oh, God, really? Really, movie?!

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.800
This is what he spends his free time doing?!

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.180
Did he really learn how to change the channels until he found something with dolphins in it?!

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.200
Or is he just watching the old ironic channel?!

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.040
"C'mon, Zeus."

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.540
"Zeus, c'mon."

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.960
I don't even get it! Why couldn't they just leave the dog?!

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.340
This makes no sense! a gigantic scientific breakthrough totally destroyed because

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.500
Guttenberg doesn't know he's looking for BOO-HOO-HOO!

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.820
But Zeus is a little more proactive as he decides
 it's either his beloved dolphin or nothing

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800
Goodbye CRUEL WORLD!

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:46.260
So Zeus literally traveled all the way back to Mary Beth so that he can be with his beloved Roxanne again!

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.930
So the kids talk to each other and devise a trick to keep Guttenberg and Mary Beth talking to each other again.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.260
But unfortunately, our villain
 finds the dog and captures him,

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.740
hoping to use him to find and
 communicate with Roxanne.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.280
"Right... no more Mister Nice Guy."

00:13:07.569 --> 00:13:10.829
Not a bad plan to sabotage the competition, 
but I like his other one better!

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.320
Now that would be awesome!

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:25.880
"Now Roxanne is ours." 
"No, Dr. Carver, yours. We quit."

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:33.439
Are you seriously telling me that kidnapping is dog to entrap a dolphin is your idea of unethical?!

00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:36.400
So Guttenberg and Jordan fly back to Key West

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.828
as it turns out out his son has some 
very choice words about the situation

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.740
"Zeus is a extremely extreme dog."

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:44.980
"That he is."

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.900
"He's also in love."

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.140
"An extreme emotion."
"Why don't you try it sometime dad?"

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.480
Ohh! Gutenberg, nothing! Kid that takes pictures of 
the dog dressed as a frog, one!

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:03.620
So as the bad guy tries to lure Roxanne in, we find that Roxanne is one step ahead of their game

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.300
Dolphin Punch!

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.860
Wow, so people and shark pose no threat to this dolphin!

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.320
But if she comes across a tuna net, OOHH!

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.060
And speaking of idiots who get caught in tuna nets, look! Mary Beth is a idiot  getting caught in a tuna net

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:29.200
Yeah, apparently nets are dangerous to dolphins and really stupid marine biologists.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.460
You know what? It's still worth it! I love tuna so much,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.580
it's worth a few dead dolphins and marine biologists  to get my tuna.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.540
If they're so smart why didn't they see the net coming to begin with?! Fuck the bastards, I want my tuna!

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.540
So, in maybe one of the lamest ways to fix the situation.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:56.180
Damn! If I had installed that screen door, like I originally wanted, none of this would have happened

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.820
So seeing how there's no friggin' scuba gear that she brought with her,

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:05.510
it's up to Roxanne to find her and relay the message that she's in trouble!

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.480
Cool. I think she's trying to tell us something!

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:19.640
Lobster people are invading the forest with blenders?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.780
Ninjas from another 
planet have stolen all the earth's corn!

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.820
Mary Beth is trapped right bellow us in a tuna net?

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.460
That's it? Mary Beth is trapped right below us in a tuna net? Well, I better save her!

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.209
"I think she wants you to follow her"

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.199
Uh- yeah, I think she also said bring an oxygen tank, dumbass!

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:53.040
Oh, hold on. I can't stay down here long because I didn't bring an oxygen tank!

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.260
"Get me a knife."

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:06.899
Welp, gotta go up again. You know maybe I could save precious time if I just put on one of those oxygen tanks

00:16:06.899 --> 00:16:09.359
Or maybe even brought one down for you to breathe through. But hat do I know? I'm Steve Guttenberg!

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:14.969
So he finally get her out of the sub as the police drop by to see...

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:21.420
Whaaaat? Zeus has trapped the bad guys in a net? Well in all my years!

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.280
"Atta boy, Zeus!"

00:16:32.199 --> 00:16:38.429
D'oh, and I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those pesky kids! Oh, and that mangy dog!'

00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:41.129
oh, a-and um, dolphin...

00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:44.579
this has been a weird week, hasn't it?

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.620
So of course, Guttenberg and Mary Beth decide to get back together and finally tie the knot.

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.940
"Wait!
Sorry, they told me to bring this down here right away."

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:01.220
Ah, the postman. just like the old saying goes:
 nor rain, nor snow,nor sleet, nor...

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.839
your wedding.

00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:05.839
"It's the grant!"

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.440
Well, isn't this magical!

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:16.980
I suppose only one other thing could possibly top off this day of whimsical to light!

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:25.200
Of course, how else could this movie possibly end?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.040
There are rainbow sprinkles, and syrup, and unicorn farts that aren't as sappy as this fucking movie!

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.640
This film is shit, plain and simple!

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.440
We don't see much of the dog and dolphin together,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.460
The romance is pretty bland,
 and none of it seems to have any surprises!

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:46.500
It's just a safe film with an unusually safe premise,
 if not a totally insane premise!

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.760
On top of that, if Zeus and Roxanne did have a 
 relationship together, what what the kids look like?

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.690
I dunno.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.769
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. 
I remember it so you don't have to!

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.600
Okay, okay, since you've been so patient!
