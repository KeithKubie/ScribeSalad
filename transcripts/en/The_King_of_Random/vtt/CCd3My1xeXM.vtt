00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.630
Hey, guys!

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.730
Welcome back thanks for joining us today on the king of random a lot of people find the sound of running water very soothing and

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.719
Relaxing but it's not always practical to have water running inside so today we're

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.089
Going, to try to build our own desktop fountain with

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.109
A twist to it the supplies for this build are surprisingly simple we've got some clear plastic

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.299
Solo cups another container that holds, about twice as much liquid, as the solo cups, some bendy straws

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.640
A plastic lid or plate and of course a pump you drive the water i've, also got a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
Glue gun, which i'll be using to do a lot of the assembly on this build i've got a couple of extra

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.419
Supplies here but i am actually only just going to use one cup

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.320
and one straw

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.489
So i'll set the extras aside this container that i'm using is when i picked up at walmart for just a few

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.808
Bucks it actually has a lot more on it than we need, we won't be using the lid or any of the attaching

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.859
Hardware i just like the size and the shape of this and the fact that it's clear so you can

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.619
See what i'm doing as i work on it so the first step

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.739
is i'm going to remove all of the excess hardware from our container

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.019
Here's the basic setup of how this is going to work

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.829
This larger container will hold our water and the pump will

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.830
Be down inside that

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.299
Our lid or plastic plate will go on top of that and our solo cup will go on top of our plate our drinking straw

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.688
Will connect to the pump come up. Through the plastic plate and through the plastic

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.569
Cup the water will be pumped into the cup at an angle

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.619
Spraying around in circles there will be another small hole in the center of the cup

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.359
Where the water will be draining out hopefully if everything goes, well we'll get sort of a vortex effect

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.139
As the water is filling up and draining at the same time what

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.959
We want to do now is drill two holes into the bottom of our solo cup?

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.459
One right in the center and one much closer to the edge for the hole in the very center of the cup

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:47.189
We want to drill bit that's about 3/4 the diameter of our straw i'm going to be using a 3/16 inch drill bit

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.580
Next, we want to take a, drill bit that's the exact

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.520
Same diameter of our straw and drill a second hole much closer to the edge of the cup, with, straws i'm using a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.699
1560 fourths inch drill bit is the perfect size

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.239
If you've used the right size of drill bit your straw should fit into the hole

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.849
And be pretty snug if it's not a perfect

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.559
Fit don't worry too much, we are going to be using, some hot glue to attach the straw. And that will help

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.339
By filling in some gaps as, well now that we've got two holes drilled into the bottom of our cup

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.739
We want to drill two corresponding holes into our plastic lid, this plastic lid has a small bump in the center

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.319
so
We'll line up the hole in the center of our cup with that mark now using a sharpie make a small mark on the plastic

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.319
Lid through the second hole in the cup

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.358
Now we're going to drill two holes into the plastic lid

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.559
They'll, both be a little bit larger than the holes in the cup, for the center hole i'm using a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560
Fairly, large 1/2 inch drill bit

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.689
Scrap of wood so i don't drill holes into, my table

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.480
This is so thin that just started cutting right into the plastic immediately, so i'm just going to clean that up with an exacto knife

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.179
For the second hole off of the side i'm using a, drill bit that's slightly larger than the diameter of our straw

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.790
This, drill bit that i'm using is a 5/16 inch

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.749
How's a little better perfect, we can?

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.940
now set our cup on top of our lid, and

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.420
Our holes line up wonderfully one of them is going to be for the straw

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.170
Carrying the water up into the cup, and the other is a hole for it to drain out

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.030
Back in the main container with

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.229
Those holes drilled let's get ready to attach the straw to our cup, before we attach the straw

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.860
We're, going to trim off the section that feeds the water into our cup let's leave

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.630
About 1/2 of an inch after the bend the elbow part now let's feed the bottom of the straw

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.970
Through, the outside hole in the bottom of our cup

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.829
We want to push our straw all the way to the bottom of the cup, the part of the straw that

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.480
We just cut short should be lined up with

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.039
These ridges at the bottom all right, we can, see how, we've got it lined up now for a

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.440
Second we're just, gonna pop it back out then we're

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.880
Going to apply, some hot glue to the bottom of this part of the straw. And then pull it back down

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.969
And hold it in place until the glue cools now

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.630
We, also, want to use a little bit of hot glue to go in a circle around the bottom

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.049
Where the straw is connected to the cup, to make sure it's completely watertight

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.918
At this point if you, line, the straw, up with the outside hole in the lid, you can

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.919
See how it's going to start to fit together although of course at

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.769
This, point with, this container our straw is too long so we need?

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.350
To, trim it back a little bit i'm going to trim the straw

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.429
Back in two stages first i'm just going to cut it short enough that it doesn't stop the cup

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.380
From reaching the plastic plate then i'm going, to put the pump in and line the straw up with

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.749
Where it's going to connect to that and cut it again at

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.169
This point

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.609
My, straw is about 1 and 3/4 of an inch too long for my cup, to rest on the plastic plate

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.610
So i'll cut. That much off

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.690
That's better our cup, now rests nicely on the plastic pleat just how, we want it however our straw?

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.690
Is going to connect to the output of our pump and so it's going to need to be trimmed even more put the pump entirely

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.890
inside the container

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.080
Approximately lined up with the side hole in our plate resting our cup on the side of the container

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.569
We can then mark a spot at the same height as

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.719
The output of our pump i'm going to cut it a little bit below

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.160
The line because a portion of the straw will actually fit inside the output tube of the pump

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.999
we'll take the straw run it through the outside drilled hole in our lid, and

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.739
Then, we'll connect it to our pump and we can place the pump inside the lower container

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.350
And we can see how, that is going to work the pump will send water up the straw

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.439
Which will spray out the straw at an angle swirling around, the cup

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.040
with a

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.349
Small hole in the middle the water will drain down through that spot and hopefully give us a nice water

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.980
Vortex now if everything goes correctly the pump will be sending water into the cup, faster than its draining out the bottom

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.299
Which will end up with water spilling over the top of the cup as, well which is one of the reasons?

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.380
we have this plastic tray here and we need to make sure that it's a tray that has edges on it

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.409
Water will spill down into that and to help it drain even faster let's put a few more holes in it to drain down into

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.890
Our larger container below it's not very important precisely

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.699
Where you put the holes but they should be farther out than the diameter of the bottom of the cup

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.190
and

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.820
Closer in then the edges of our large container if you put them out on the very edges then all of your water of course

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.780
Is going to run out onto

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.540
Your table to drill these holes i have to disconnect our cup

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.390
From the pump but i'm just going to mark really quickly on the straw

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.890
How far in it is because i think i've got at a good height for these drain holes it doesn't matter a?

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.279
Whole lot what size they are but i like to try, and keep them smaller, so i'm going back to our

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.830
3/16 inch of drill bit

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.910
Sometimes the drilled holes are just a little bit messy you can, clean them up

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.860
By just pulling the plastic off with your fingers or in some cases just use an exacto. Knife carefully cut

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.770
off the excess

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.710
Now there is another step that i want to take our fountain does run off of electricity and of course that?

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.269
Means it's got a cord coming off of it if the cord comes up over the lip of the container it will make our lid

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.129
Sit in a, weird angle if we're alright with the cord coming out of the top of a fountain then, we could just cut

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.320
A small divot into the top, where the cord could fit below, the level of our lid but i really

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.779
Like the look of the cord coming out of the bottom of the fountain

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.800
So what i'm going to do is drill a small hole in the bottom of our container i'm then

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.210
Going to cut the power cord, and fit it through that hole, and then splice it back together so

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.210
We have a complete cord running through the bottom of the mountain

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.969
Oh, that fits through pretty nicely strip off the rubber

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.010
There, we have it we now have our cord running out from the bottom of our fountain, which is just what

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:08.439
We want now let's use some hot glue to secure that cord in place and seal up the hole so it's completely waterproof

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.010
i

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:14.530
do
Want to leave a little bit of extra cord inside the container so that if we ever need to get our fountain out for any

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:19.239
Reason, we still have a little bit of room to play with it of course if you're extremely patient you can

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.120
Also, use a silicone based caulking, that's designed for sealing up things like

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.500
Fish tanks, but those usually take a, long time to cure and i want to go a little bit faster

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.109
There, we have it our power cord is now attached so it's time to add some water now?

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:39.419
First i'm just going to add enough water that it covers this pump and then we gonna plug it in so we can see the

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:42.328
Amount of power that this pump puts out it's not very much

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.360
There you go!

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:54.129
That's how, much power we're getting out of our tiny little pump, we want to make?

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.499
Sure the pump is completely covered and then take another cup

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:01.750
Just like the one we're using in our fountain and fill it all the way and pour that much water into our container as, well

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.490
This, way, we know that no matter how, much water is in our fountain?

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:16.019
Above the pump there will still be enough water to keep the pump completely covered, which

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.060
Is what it needs to keep pumping, in fact i'm even going to add just a little bit more water just to be safe

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.220
Looks, like our seal is holding up beautifully, no water is leaking out just what, we want to see?

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.670
Before we seal anything down let's do a test attaching our straw to our pump through our lid, and see what kind of effect

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.399
We get when, we turn on our pump this is precisely one of those situations?

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:41.639
Where i'm glad that i left enough cord that i can reach the pump all right so our straw. Goes down through our lid

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.459
Put that into the output of our pump

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.310
the level, we marked off

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:53.460
That lower itself back down into the water and now, we'll plug it in this type of pump doesn't have an

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.180
On/off switch it just runs whenever it's got power coming to it so if you

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.889
do
Want to be able to turn this on and off you should use a power strip or another form of outlet that has a switch

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.860
Attached to it all right here goes three two, one?

00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:11.669
Go, we can, see we've got, some good spinning in that water

00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:18.808
Cup, is filling up nicely as well that's good?

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.630
Strings of hot glue stuck to it a. Clip, that's not a. Huge problem

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.100
Beautiful look at that

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.100
Fills all the way to the top of the cup

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:46.239
Overflows over the edge and we have that awesome little vortex going down through the middle of the cup

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:53.409
Fantastic look at that that works perfectly nice relaxing pouring, water noises

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:03.429
Alright, let's turn this off for a second of course as soon as we turn it off it stops filling and just starts draining out

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:04.670
The hole on the bottom

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.279
Now our vortex fountain?

00:11:06.279 --> 00:11:10.539
Is working but right now it doesn't look all that great so now it's time to do a

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.880
Few decorations to make this thing look, a lot more classy our plastic lid here doesn't look very fancy, so i'm gonna

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.489
Scuff it up lightly with, some sandpaper and then paint it all black

00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:34.479
Being able to see inside a container. And watch the pump in action might be pretty interesting to some people but

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.620
I, want to decorate it a little more than that, so i'm going to take, some popsicle sticks and make a

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.940
Border that goes all the way around our lower container so it looks like a wooden planter

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:49.659
Box or some of our popsicle, sticks are just a tiny bit too tall they'll be interfering with our plastic lid

00:11:49.699 --> 00:11:53.559
So i'm going to trim a, whole bunch of popsicle sticks down to a little bit shorter

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:58.899
Perfect, now i just need to do that to like 50 more popsicle sticks

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:13.360
Now, let's see how, good my estimate, was i'm just, gonna use the hot glue gun, to attach these all the way around, my container

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.510
This, wedge shape at the top i'm pretty, sure it's because, when I've been cutting these

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:33.749
Off it makes the top of the popsicle stick flare just the tiniest bit so they're all a little bit wider at the top

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.400
And it's got me just this slight offset gap, so i'm just going to cut

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.269
This, popsicle stick a little bit shorter and then i'm gonna, use sandpaper and taper it down to that shape

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.980
curve it

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.390
Our lower container has been lined with. Popsicle sticks that look, like nice wooden slats our lid has been painted

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:15.749
Black, so let's attach them all together i'm going to use hot glue to attach the cup, to the lid, and then if you

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.960
Feel like it you can attach the lid, to the lower, base although if you

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.189
do that it will be harder to get inside of your fountain if you ever need to in the future i

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.800
Am using some hot glue to attach the lid

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.640
to

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.559
the wooden popsicle sticks but i'm only using a little bit so that if i do need to get into the fountain it should be

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.950
really
easy to break through

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:41.309
The hot and glue seal holding it there this will just keep it from shaking or moving if i accidentally bump it

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.740
There, we have it it's now secured together fairly?

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:49.680
Well and just as one more decorative element i've got some little pebbles that are too big to fit through any of my drain holes

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.509
And i'm just going to set those around the cup, so our fountain looks like it has a little bit more nature on

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:03.809
Alright our fountain is all hooked up ready to go and decorate it let's plug it back in and see how

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.810
This, whole thing looks all together

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:16.580
It's a nice tornado, i like that tornado now one more thing that i'm gonna try just because i think it can

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:22.160
Be fun, is i'm gonna, add one drop of blue food coloring to our water let's see what happens

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.130
It's really cool for a second it just kind of holds the blue, dye

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.770
Near, the whirlpool

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.460
then the

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:41.329
Dye gets down into the base the pump picks it up and now it's just evenly distributed throughout the whole thing so a slightly blue

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:48.289
Vortex water tornado maelstrom fount i don't know, what to call it take your pick there you go a quick and easy

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.730
Way to build a very cool

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.030
looking vortex

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:57.589
Desktop fountain it provides nice relaxing sounds it looks pretty sweet with all the swirling water the bubbles in it and the little

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:01.609
Column of twisted, air running down through the middle for this project i have been using

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:06.380
What's just, about the smallest volume of aquarium pump available if you, do use something with

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:11.869
A little more power the water will spin faster and the vortex will actually open up a little bit and you'll usually have

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:15.830
Some water pouring, off more parts of the cup at once coming up soon we're going to show

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.939
You, how to take this, same idea and scale it up to a much larger vortex fountain and we're

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:22.760
also, going to add a couple of fun twists to it if you

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.460
Want to build this project down in the description we've provided a link

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.099
Where you can get one of these pumps thank you guys for joining us for this project

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.440
Today, and we'll see you in the next one talk to you then, oh?

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.840
my, goodness

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:39.470
This thing can't cut, the electrical tape, uh i don't know, why it gets tiny little bubbles in it but i'm so glad it does
