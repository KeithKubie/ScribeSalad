Hello calculator fanciers

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.440
A bit of an unusual one today people have been sending in calculators for me to unbox. Which is very sweet of them

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.150
I think some people have calculators

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.550
They think should be unboxed by a professional

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.120
And it's very considerate of them to send them in so I'm going to go for the record of most calculators

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.920
Unboxed in a video sight unseen so let's get into it

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.720
First up one we've been sent in here at the South Surrey And Associated Regions Calculator Appreciation Society

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.840
for professionals and amateurs and no indication where or who has sent this in

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.240
So let's, I mean this is more of a calculator

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.390
I'm bagging so far, but I'm going to allow it well padded so it doesn't get damaged

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.680
It's come with a note please funny clothes free calculators

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.039
Which I hope you will unblock over the time for that and frankly

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.969
Three is cheating [of] somebody going [to] unbox one of these we're either going to do the scientific calculator with cover

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.939
We're going [to] do the home and office scientific calculator, or we will do the wilko

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.459
Scientific calculator make sure you get your sums right vote now

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.869
Yep, it's the wilko so let's get into that one let's pop this thing open using

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.989
scissors for when you're doing speed unboxing

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.570
I mean, you know I like my specialist tools

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.180
but sometimes you just need a multi-tool for everything and

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.239
We are in ok in no time for instructions in a speed unboxing is it a cover?

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.489
Yeah, okay. It is it all it's got a little stand. That's nice and

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.180
Let's fire it up. So we'll do a simple test to open all the way around it's a root 2

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.299
equals x Root 2

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.020
equals 2

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.630
It works [ok] you can see how someone saw the calculator and thought this this would be a good one to unboxed at this

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.909
What a drab little kit, there's very little going on here in this particular calculator

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.489
And so I don't think it wants any further tests

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.500
I'm impressed that someone had the enthusiasm to send it in but I mean

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.319
It's [just] it's not it's it's it's no gak co is what I'm trying to say [here]. [so] we'll pop that

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.550
In the not particularly exciting pile and move on to whatever this one is okay, and we have

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.270
All this is exciting it comes in a smaller

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.880
Unmarked box wow what could it be [I] mean, I'm not fluent in all

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.699
Barcodes so that I mean if you are fluent in but then barcodes spoiler alert, that's already given away

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.770
What's going to happen, but I don't know so it's okay

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.880
right [oh]

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.669
My goodness already, okay. It's not a rectangle. So I'm already more exposed than what [that] it's a keyboard, okay?

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.040
Well, let's test it first before we get too

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.279
Excited, how does it even turn? How's it turn on?

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.260
Is it solar-powered needs more luck nothing light, okay?

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.299
Where I can and it's on [alright]

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.729
So if we give it enough charge, [I] feel like we should do like the harmonic series. What are we going to do five?

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.140
times

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.459
six

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.749
Okay, it works okay, so it's a straightforward stuff with clear on okay on Doubles is clear

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.869
That's not very useful [off] is off on his

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.930
Con is on and doesn't play any sounds so if it played music as I was typing I'd be impressed

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.940
But sadly it doesn't they were

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.159
Keyboard calculator up next a oh hopefully labeled

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:41.130
This is the box that through useful think I've done enough unboxings to recognize a box when I see one

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.730
So let's get although use electrical tape which is [a] nice touch

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.239
Obviously professional circumstances, I wouldn't just be hacking at it with scissors and ripping it open but given

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.459
We're just doing you know a fun little unboxing of one of the amateurs have sent in with a letter

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.690
number file, I'm having to present

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.380
you the

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.980
staff

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.610
Device a device that looks and behaves like a normal digital clock if you hold down the middle button while turning it on so it

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.610
becomes a calculator oh

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.749
My goodness. Oh wow this looks this looks dangerous

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.320
It comes in bits. How on Earth did this not get flagged up by the post this would not look good on an x-Ray?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.469
So okay, and that's all that we've got all the pieces

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.370
Seems to be the main body of it. This is a

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.299
Dangerously homemade-looking power supply. [I] don't

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.510
Wow, I mean it must be legitimate. They've written it on in tip x and the European

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.850
Socket very little something in the name of my organization which starts self sorry and associated regions which would indicate I'm doing this in England

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.029
And I'm unable to plug that in because we have Queens

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.610
voltage over here

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.310
Until [I] can't plug that into it is this European socket warranted work

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.780
I believe we had a vote on this recently so I'm going to file this away for further investigation up next okay

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.809
This one's comes Via Amazon. Let's cancel there

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.079
Okay, that was a very straightforward. This is almost a trivial unboxing. It's just open. Oh, okay. No, there's more [legal]

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.859
Still not fully worthy of an unboxing yet

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.800
and we have

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.229
well

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.229
Texas instruments

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:43.199
[okay], someone has sent us in a Texas instruments because on people get very upset that in America all their calculators

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.019
Come from Texas, and we don't tend to [have] [many] over here in South sorry, so an associate regents

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.700
So someone is finally cracked and sent me in a Ti the ti

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:02.399
30x [-] ass. That's an unnecessary level of versions. That's been through without a correct name so let's turn it on and

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:10.829
All it already comes with a calculation [preloaded] so it's already got two asterisks ^ asterisk times tan of something

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.490
[that's] to help people if you're using it, and you're not familiar with doing calculations as an example one or maybe in the factory

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.490
that's just that that's a

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:25.739
Texan testing it or actually if you rotate it. It's like a little smiley face. I appreciate all the feedback

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.579
Everyone gives however misguided it may be and I know everyone [wants] us to do More, Texas instruments

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.849
So we will do we've heard you you voted [with] your calculators. We will do a Texas

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:46.380
Calculator special, so I will get a whole bunch. We'll have a look at some don't worry. We will get around to Texas instruments

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.540
Thank you for sending it in

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.280
Okay, and this one. I mean

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.599
Unboxing it is trivial. We can already see it. This was actually it wasn't posted

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.710
Which is why it's already open this one someone came and gave it to me at the Manchester Science festival

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:12.149
So they wake up as it here is a calculator pen so let's get in there and have a closer look at it, and I

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.989
There are no surprises what we saw on the outside

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:22.050
it's exactly what we all look at the instructions there has to be a new record for the

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.089
compact and efficient placement of instructions and looking at no unnecessary information

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:33.420
I don't even use both sides there like that's all we need why print double-sided when you can just fold it in half

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:34.950
Afterwards and cram it in there

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:41.279
and they vary uk patent on they figured you know someone else is going to try and beat them to market, so the

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.989
crossover pen calculator market [it] says auto power off and

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.860
It's very efficient the moment. I turn it on it's off again

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.070
so

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:56.309
Is there no battery in that I mean if only there was some other way [to] use this without all there's not there's a pen

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:02.489
Right so obviously I can to the pen pen doesn't work the pen is also also auto off

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.139
What is this can we commit we should better get in there dude

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.170
Wow, so it's got ink in there. Maybe it's just been

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:20.730
Okay, so it was a [fair] [nick] [ever] gave this to me what I'm saying to question how much they really liked me

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.809
So I mean look at that. This is clear this isn't aged this is an aged product

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.360
[I]

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.410
don't know how

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:34.260
this went so long and people are able to resist opening it to get out the calculator pen this is clearly a product of a

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.979
Legal loophole somewhere, it's like you're not let a calculator

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:43.229
But you can bring in a pen or you have to do all your mathematical working out by pen and they've gone

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:47.279
Not a problem. [I] will do all [my] working out bike pen

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.810
right, so there you [I] [mean] full points for creativity, but

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:57.369
You have to take it into the shop and get it looked at properly because this is a vintage model

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.370
And it's [Gonna] need a proper

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.349
Refurbishment and a going-over before it's in a state for me to unbox and review it here

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:10.060
We go once at the world record. So next one up another anonymous Little Sack, I

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.890
Get into this

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:18.129
Oh my goodness second mystery box and so again if you know your barcodes

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.239
Them up your spoiler. [they're] all my goodness. It's

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.350
Transparent

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.790
Okay

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.680
Okay, that's kind of cool. Okay. It's a guard. It's a guide everyone. It's okay

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.150
I can remove that safely, [and] there's no way. That's gonna work. There's no way

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.150
I don't know what I'm pressing

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:42.910
Clear what oh my goodness often my desk is just dense with working out and notes about

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.719
Calculators and all sorts of math, and you go well what am I going to put my character?

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.000
I want to cover up some of [my] mouth now

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.880
You can put it down and you're not you're barely

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:57.010
losing any of the mass you had available before so I can get up quite handy, and I guess as a

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.820
professional

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:04.539
Unboxer if I've got another calculator. I want to unbox and I want to do some calculations at the same time

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.280
So I'm not under lee I can calculate I can unbox two at once like I'm barely

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.999
Obscuring the one behind it okay this one has already been opened

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:17.530
Because it wasn't labeled as the calculator on the outside and so I opened it thinking it was normal post

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.989
And oh my goodness, and this is it it was the casio Data [count]

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:30.130
100 and oh this is intriguing you can schedule a telephone call to tell someone a secret

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.219
I mean, it look like a particularly nice narrow thing

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:40.030
But should this situation ever occur you can do some calculations at the same time this because this is a new [generation] of calculators

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:45.429
So the box is already open that it is still here. I mean, it's missing missing a little tab there

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.430
Which is a bit, it's a bit sad, but it's got

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.020
The what on Earth?

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.979
Operation manual haven't got time for that in the speed unboxing

00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:01.420
It's got is that a note is that [all] okay? It's the receipt from the original purchase

00:11:02.209 --> 00:11:04.209
okay, that's quite nice, [so]

00:11:04.459 --> 00:11:06.969
Someone has bought this cow you later in

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:16.030
December 8 so the 14th of December a year that ends in [8th]. I mean. I'm gonna guess

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:23.079
It's oh, there's a tap. [oh], thank goodness okay, so there's that missing turns from the end there, so this has been purchased

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.380
I assume in

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:31.689
1988 I could be wrong. This is why you should always use the full with the complete [timecode]

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.600
various appoint, let's not use that

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.030
someone's paid 17 pounds 75

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:43.029
P back in the day from this from John and that's actually I mean I know a lot of people

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.360
Try hard when they want to be a serious calculator collector

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.439
and they send them in I try and be encouraging and I always say keep all your

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.910
Documentation if you can't show the providence of the calculator

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.899
what is the point of having it in your collection and someone here is actually kept the

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:04.030
[original] sales receipt from a Branch of the John Lewis partnership so well done

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:08.139
Someone out there you're you're halfway to being a serious

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.980
calculator

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.009
Appreciator I mean I'm a little confused

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.590
Partly because this is a very new device and partly because I appeared of woken up in the year 2041

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:23.440
Which I mean, I had I mean time flies when you're unboxing calculators, but that is ridiculous

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.050
This is here because [in] some calculators if you press up up down down left right a bit

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.560
You know you can unlock special modes to the square root test

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.159
Times 2 Square root

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.900
equals

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:44.440
Eat nothing what times? Oh I didn't I it's probably before to

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.999
realistic buttons wow equals [Rf] is rounded down

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.869
That's not good, [so] I'm going to put that in my curiosity pile

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:58.000
think you've ever sent that in and I will have a closer look at one birth is going on there and

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.560
Maybe it maybe I can tease out its secrets who knows

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:10.450
And I'll keep the original tab can go in there with [a] receipt that I mean that is a pretty complete collection. I'm impressed and

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:15.940
finally in our attempt the eighth's calculator because you always do powers of two and

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:22.219
You sixteen I mean no no human could unlock sixteen taxes. Oh, haha

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:28.819
So some comedian out there. I mean, I don't really go into the jokes and

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.890
Comedy that someone thinks they're hysterical and they sent me in an abacus

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:41.419
[oh], I almost think I shouldn't even give it the the decent even unboxing, but I am professional and I refuse to

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.620
[let] down my

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.620
standards

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:53.900
Okay, [so] this sticks clear entry function isn't working properly some of the previous entry is still in there

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.900
yeah, that's a hard reset and

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.109
what is this someone's ah [there's] a

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:06.859
Manufacturing default and the display is there's like a dead pixel on the display of this abacus flip

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.240
note two dead pixels okay, so I guess I can turn into a

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:18.530
Calculation with this let's let enter in just this maybe that's seven

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.040
And I'm going to divide to [1/7] and then multiply by seven again

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.579
So there you are an abacus well done from up there thinks they're hilarious

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.939
And I guess I mean is it's quite a funny joke sending in an abacus

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.080
I can appreciate that that someone out there [is] a comedian but a

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.940
calculator unboxing video is no time for joking around so

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:44.540
It's just it's not appropriate [but] thank you to everyone who did send in proper serious calculators?

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:50.329
It's been fun doing a speed unboxing. We'll be back with [some] proper serious unboxing soon

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.119
This should be equal to the main tricky

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:59.089
What age group is behind that well clearly from the front children and amusement know hang on yeah?

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.119
It's a suitable only for Nobel prize with [anything] [that]

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:10.190
We want they're putting them all back in [altered]. So here it is there so we're going to be into the wall one hundreds
