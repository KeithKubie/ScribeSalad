00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.967
Voiceover:The relative
frequency table below

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:05.663
shows statistics from a
study about the relationship

00:00:05.663 --> 00:00:07.968
between the amount of time a person spends

00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:09.966
using a computer before bed

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.366
and the amount that a
person sleeps each night.

00:00:12.366 --> 00:00:13.567
For computer use,

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.367
each participant was classified

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:16.839
as minimal, moderate, or extreme.

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.167
Let's look at the frequency table below.

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:20.033
Let's see.

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:21.433
That's the frequency table,

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:21.900
and let's see,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.834
there's 3 categories of computer time,

00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:24.633
just like they told us,

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:27.034
minimal, moderate, and extreme.

00:00:27.034 --> 00:00:29.169
This is before they go to bed or at night.

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.700
Then they have the 3 categories

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.833
of how much they're sleeping,

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.433
5 or a few hours per night,

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.033
5 to 7 hours per night,

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.033
or 7 or more hours.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:38.566
OK, so that's fair enough.

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:40.700
Let's see what they want us to do.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.700
They tell us, "Suppose there
were 17 people in the study

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.833
"who are both in moderate computer users

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:49.503
"and got 5 to 7 hours of sleep."

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:51.367
Moderate, 5 to 7.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:53.233
This category right over here,

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:56.633
there are 17 people in
this category over here.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:57.967
Just to mark that, let me ...

00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:01.233
I copy and pasted this
chart onto my scratch pad

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:03.233
so I can write on it.

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:05.766
This group, they're telling us this group,

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.166
and my pen is really acting up.

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.100
I don't understand what's going on.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.966
This group right over
here, there are 17 people.

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:16.766
That group right over there is 17 people.

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.500
Now what are they asking us?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.500
They're saying, "How
many people in the study

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.900
"were both extreme computer users

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.366
"and got 5 to 7 hours of sleep?

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.700
"Round to the nearest whole number."

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.300
So extreme and got 5 to 7.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.700
I'll get my scratch pad out.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.033
They are saying how many
people are in this bucket,

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.555
in this bucket right over here?

00:01:42.663 --> 00:01:44.900
I think I have to replace
my pen tablet or something.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.888
I don't know why it's getting
all splotchy like this.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.633
How would we think about this?

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.366
There are 17 people in this group.

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.336
How many people are in this group?

00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:58.434
They tell us that 17 is 34% of the row,

00:01:58.434 --> 00:01:59.833
of the row total,

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:03.770
so I guess you could say 17 is 34.3%

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.633
of the moderate computer users,

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:12.397
or you could say that
17 is 30% of the people

00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:15.700
who slept 5 to 7 hours each night,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.501
or you could say 17 is 10%,

00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:25.500
is 10% of the total number of people.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.300
Let's just go with that.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.303
We could figure out the
total number of people.

00:02:28.303 --> 00:02:30.033
So 10%,

00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:31.866
actually, let me write it this way.

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:37.940
So 10% of the total,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.701
10% of total is going to be equal to 17,

00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:44.033
or that the total,

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:45.669
just divide both sides by 10%

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.635
is equal to 17 divided by 10%,

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:52.766
which is the same thing as 17 over 0.1,

00:02:52.766 --> 00:02:55.633
which, of course, is equal to 170.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.633
The total is 170,

00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:59.901
and they tell us that extreme,

00:02:59.901 --> 00:03:03.300
extreme computer users represent ...

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.633
extreme computer users who
sleep 5 to 7 hours per night

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:11.700
represent 11.7%,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.366
11.7% of the total.

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:15.766
So the answer to their question

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:18.167
of how many people were
extreme computer users

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.436
who sleep 5 to 7 hours per night,

00:03:20.436 --> 00:03:24.234
it's 11.7% of 170.

00:03:24.618 --> 00:03:26.151
Let's go back over here.

00:03:26.151 --> 00:03:28.500
We actually have a little
calculator tool here.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.766
It's 11.7%, which is 0.117,

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:36.766
times 170,

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:40.501
times 170 is,

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:42.834
and let me make sure that
you can see what I'm doing

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:44.367
by scrolling over a little bit,

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:48.034
times 170 is equal to 19.89.

00:03:48.034 --> 00:03:49.766
If we're rounding to the nearest whole,

00:03:49.766 --> 00:03:52.166
that's going to be 20 people,

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:53.800
20 people.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.966
And then they are going
to ask us some questions.

00:03:56.966 --> 00:03:58.567
They say, "Does the table show evidence

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:02.233
"of an association between
being a minimal computer user

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:04.235
"and getting 7 hours of sleep or more?"

00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:05.892
Let's just look at the chart.

00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:09.700
An association between being
a minimal computer user

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.101
and getting 7 hours of sleep or more.

00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:16.966
It looks like minimal computer users,

00:04:17.627 --> 00:04:19.166
these are the minimal computer users

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:21.833
who get 7 or more hours of sleep.

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:23.500
There's a couple of ways to read this.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.835
You could say that 51%
of minimal computer users

00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:28.701
get 7 or more hours of sleep.

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:31.101
You could say that of the people

00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:33.033
who get 7 or more hours of sleep,

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:36.033
55% are minimal computer users.

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:37.166
And of course, this one just says

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:39.967
that minimal computer users who
get 7 or more hours of sleep

00:04:39.967 --> 00:04:44.393
represent 18.3% of all of
the people who were surveyed.

00:04:44.393 --> 00:04:46.156
Let's look at the choices.

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:47.967
Actually, before I even
look at the choices,

00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:49.834
let's see if there is an association.

00:04:49.834 --> 00:04:52.500
It does look like if you look at,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.635
if you look at minimal computer users,

00:04:54.635 --> 00:04:56.839
it looks like a small percentage,

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.367
only 16% get 5 or few hours.

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:02.166
A higher percentage gets 5 to 7 hours,

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:04.766
and 51%, the highest percentage,

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:05.901
gets 7 or more.

00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:09.769
So it looks like for
minimal computer users,

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:12.981
it looks like the distribution
is definitely weighted

00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:15.901
towards getting more sleep.

00:05:16.193 --> 00:05:18.233
For example, if we look at
the extreme computer users,

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:19.500
it's the opposite trend.

00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:23.366
It's 47% have 5 or few hours per night,

00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:25.166
33% 5 to 7 hours,

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:28.100
and then only 19% get 7 or more.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.966
It looks like the moderate
is someplace in between.

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:32.233
Just looking at this,

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:34.366
just looking at each of these rows,

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:35.566
it looks like there is a trend

00:05:35.566 --> 00:05:38.966
where if you use a computer for less time,

00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:40.900
you are more likely to have more sleep,

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.769
and likewise, if you use a computer more,

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:44.833
you're more likely to have less sleep.

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:45.901
Another way to think about it,

00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:46.762
when you look at the people

00:05:46.762 --> 00:05:49.233
who are getting 7 or more hours of sleep,

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:51.300
a majority of them,

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.633
a majority of them are
minimal computer users,

00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:55.767
and there's 3 categories.

00:05:55.767 --> 00:05:58.041
So for 55% to be minimal computer users

00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.448
really does feel like the
minimal computer users

00:06:00.448 --> 00:06:01.833
are more ...

00:06:03.002 --> 00:06:05.566
they're definitely more
disproportionately representing

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:07.301
the people who are getting 7 ...

00:06:07.301 --> 00:06:09.769
or disproportionally
represented in this category

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.500
of 7 or more hours of sleep.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.434
You see that the extreme
computer users in this category,

00:06:15.434 --> 00:06:18.301
they represent only 20% of this category.

00:06:18.301 --> 00:06:20.433
So it does look like
there is an association

00:06:20.433 --> 00:06:22.033
between minimal computer use

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:24.100
and getting 7 or more hours of sleep.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.066
But let's look at the
actual choices they give us.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:28.966
Does the table show
evidence of association

00:06:28.966 --> 00:06:30.501
between a minimal computer user

00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:32.835
and getting 7 hours of sleep or more?

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.166
Yes, because 35.1% are
extreme computer users,

00:06:37.166 --> 00:06:39.393
and 29.1% of people are moderate.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.700
I go with the yes, but this doesn't seem

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.534
to really back up the claim.

00:06:43.965 --> 00:06:45.900
This is just giving us some random data

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.833
about the percentage that
are extreme computer users

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:49.600
or moderate computer users.

00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:50.633
No ...

00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:51.500
well ...

00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:54.700
I explained why I go with yes,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:55.965
that there does seem to be a trend,

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:57.366
and I don't even believe
what this statement is

00:06:57.366 --> 00:06:58.700
because the total column percentages

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.035
are essentially equal.

00:07:00.035 --> 00:07:01.372
We see that the total column ...

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.767
that the column percentages,

00:07:03.767 --> 00:07:06.166
the column percentages are not equal

00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:07.767
for the various,

00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:12.133
for people who are getting
7 hours or more of sleep.

00:07:12.166 --> 00:07:13.166
We see that right over here,

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:15.833
55, 25, 20,

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:18.101
so I won't go with that one either.

00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:22.118
Yes, because 51% of minimal computer users

00:07:22.118 --> 00:07:23.566
get 7 or more hours of sleep,

00:07:23.566 --> 00:07:25.927
and only 33% of all computer users

00:07:26.357 --> 00:07:28.701
get 7 or more hours.

00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:29.167
Yeah.

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:30.966
I mean that seems pretty good.

00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:33.433
51% of minimal computer users

00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:34.966
get 7 or more hours of sleep,

00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:38.575
and only 33% of all computer users

00:07:38.575 --> 00:07:41.633
get 7 or more hours of sleep.

00:07:41.633 --> 00:07:43.500
That looks like a pretty good explanation,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.566
so I'll check that,

00:07:44.566 --> 00:07:46.068
but let's just review all of them.

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:47.366
No.

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:49.033
Well, I already said I think it's yes,

00:07:49.033 --> 00:07:50.833
but because the total
percentage of extreme users

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:52.300
who get 5 to 7 hours of sleep

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.300
is the same as the total percentage

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.567
of moderate computer users

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:58.733
who get 5 to 7 hours of sleep.

00:07:58.966 --> 00:08:00.719
So that doesn't really meet,

00:08:00.719 --> 00:08:03.366
it's not touching on the
point that we're looking for.

00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:06.484
Yes, because 55% of people who get 75 ...

00:08:06.823 --> 00:08:10.366
who get 7 or more hours
are minimal computer users,

00:08:10.366 --> 00:08:13.976
and only 35% of all people
are minimal computer users.

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:15.002
Actually, I'll go with this as well.

00:08:15.002 --> 00:08:16.905
Oh yeah, this is a multi-select here,

00:08:16.905 --> 00:08:18.636
so I could select that one as well.

00:08:18.636 --> 00:08:20.636
This one, we're looking at of the ...

00:08:20.636 --> 00:08:23.433
so here, we looked at the percentage

00:08:23.433 --> 00:08:24.566
of minimal computer users

00:08:24.566 --> 00:08:26.433
who get 7 hours of sleep,

00:08:26.433 --> 00:08:28.101
and we saw that percentage is higher

00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:29.906
than for the whole population.

00:08:29.906 --> 00:08:32.366
Here, we're looking at the people

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.366
who get 7 or more hours of sleep,

00:08:34.366 --> 00:08:36.833
and we're saying 55% of them,

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:42.366
55% of them are minimal computer users

00:08:42.366 --> 00:08:45.434
even though only 35% of all the people

00:08:45.434 --> 00:08:46.701
are minimal computer users.

00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:48.367
So I would go with both of these.

00:08:48.367 --> 00:08:51.366
And so let us check our answer,

00:08:51.366 --> 00:08:52.935
and we got it right.
