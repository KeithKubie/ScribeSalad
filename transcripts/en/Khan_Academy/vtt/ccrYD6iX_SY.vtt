00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.950
A card game using 36 unique
cards, four suits, diamonds,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.500
hearts, clubs, and spades, with
cards numbered from 1 to

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.410
9 in each suit.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.440
So there's four suits.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.220
Each of them have nine
cards, so that gives

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.330
us 36 unique cards.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.980
A hand is a collection of nine
cards, which can be sorted

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.310
however the player chooses.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.000
So they're essentially telling
us that order does not matter.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.900
What is the probability of
getting all four of the 1's?

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.900
So they want to know the
probability of getting all

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.670
four of the 1's.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:43.340
So all four 1's in
my hand of 9.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.850
Now this is kind of daunting at
first. You're like, gee you

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.160
know, I've got nine cards and
I'm taking them out of 36 and

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.200
I have to figure out how do
I get all of the 1's.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.240
But if we think about it just
very, very, in very simple

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.400
terms, all a probability is
saying is, the number of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.660
events-- or I guess you could
say-- the number of ways in

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.030
which this action or
this event happens.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.960
So this is what the definition
of the probability is.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:18.210
It's going to be the number of
ways in which event can happen

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.910
and when we talk about the
event, we're talking about

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.270
having all four 1's
in my hand.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.480
That's the event.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.810
And all of these different ways,
that's sometimes called

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.740
the event space.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.100
But we actually want to count
how many ways that, if I get a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.890
hand of 9 picking from
36, that I can get

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.120
the four 1's in it.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.730
So it is the number of ways in
which my event can happen and

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:48.480
we want to divide that into all
of the possibilities-- or

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.220
maybe I should write it this
way-- the total number of

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.470
hands that I can get.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.900
So the numerator in blue is the
number of different hands

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.639
where I have the four 1's and
we're dividing the total

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:09.449
number of hands.

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.620
Now let's figure out the total
number of hands first, because

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.360
on some level this might be
more intuitive and we've

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.290
actually done this before.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.040
Now, the total number
of hands, we're

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.840
picking nine cards.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.900
And we're picking them from
a set of 36 unique cards.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.510
And we've done this
many, many times.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.500
Let me write this, total number
of hands, or total

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.420
number of possible hands.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.780
That's equal to-- you can
imagine, you have nine cards

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.750
to pick from.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.010
The first card you pick, it's
going to be 1 of 36 cards.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.220
Then the next one is going
to be 1 of 35.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.130
Then the next one is going to
be 1 of 34, 33, 32, 31.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.550
We're going to do this nine
times, one, two, three, four,

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.160
five, six, seven,
eight, and nine.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.375
So that would be the
total number of

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.000
hands if order mattered.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.800
But we know-- and we've gone
over this before-- that we

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.500
don't care about the order.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.650
All we care about are the actual
cars that are in there.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.310
So we're overcounting here.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.850
We're overcounting for all of
the different rearrangements

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.550
that these cards could have. It
doesn't matter whether the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.540
Ace of diamonds is the
first card I pick or

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.730
the last card I pick.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.980
The way I've counted them right
now, we are counting

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.110
those as two separate hands.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.770
But they aren't two
separate hands, so

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.560
order doesn't matter.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.500
So we have to do is, we have to
divide this by the number

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.600
of ways you can arrange
nine things.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.800
So you could put nine of the
things in the first position,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.500
then eight in the second,
seven in the third, so

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.950
forth and so on.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.450
It essentially becomes 9
factorial times 2 times 1.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.920
And we've seen this
multiple times.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.400
This is essentially
36 choose 9.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.700
This expression right here is
the same thing-- just you can

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.880
relate it to the combinatorics
formulas that you might be

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.470
familiar with-- this is the
same thing as 36 factorial

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.480
over 36 minus 9 factorial--
that's what this orange part

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.930
is over here-- divided by 9
factorial or over 9 factorial.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.410
What's green is what's green and
what is orange is what's

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.980
orange there.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.990
So that's the total
number of hands.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.730
Now a little bit more of a
nuanced thought process is,

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.720
how do we figure out the number
of ways in which the

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.695
event can happen, in which
we can have all four 1's.

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:21.680
So let's figure that out.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:28.050
So number of ways-- or maybe we
should say this-- number of

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.355
hands with four 1's.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.310
And just as a little bit of a
thought experiment, imagine if

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.600
we were only taking four cards,
if a hand only had four

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.710
cards in it.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.270
Well if a hand only had four
cards in it, then the number

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.240
of ways to get a hand with four
1's, there'd only be one

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.950
way, one combination.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.200
You'd just have four 1's.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.550
That's the only combination with
four 1's, if we were only

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.130
picking four cards.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.010
But here, we're not only
picking four cards.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.210
Four of the cards are
going to be 1's.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.480
One, two, three, four.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.660
But the other five cards are
going to be different.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.210
So one, two, three,
four, five.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.460
So for the other five cards--
if you imagine this slot--

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.880
considering that of the 36 we
would have to pick four of

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.640
them already in order for
us to have four 1's.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.260
Well, we've used up four of
them, so there's 32 possible

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.500
cards over in that position
of the hand.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.750
And then there'd be 31 in that
position of the hand.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.480
And then there'd be 30 because
every time we're picking a

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.400
card, were using it up.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.720
And now we only have
30 to pick from.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.440
Then we only have
29 to pick from.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.820
And then we have 28
to pick from.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.020
And just like we did before,
we don't care about order.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.055
We don't care if we pick the 5
of clubs first or whether we

00:05:59.055 --> 00:06:01.680
pick the 5 of clubs last. So we
shouldn't double count it.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.380
So we have to divide by the
different number of ways that

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.670
five cards can be arranged.

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.310
So we have to divide this by the
different ways that five

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.190
cards can be arranged.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.890
The first card or the first
position can be any one of

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.210
five cards, then four cards,
then three cards, then two

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.830
cards, then one cards.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.040
So the number of hands
with four 1's is

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.060
actually just this number.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.400
You're actually looking at all
of the different ways you can

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.840
fill up the remaining cards.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.350
These four 1's are just
going to be four 1's.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.060
There's only one way to get that
if the remaining cards

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.810
that's going to give all of the
different combinations of

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:37.900
having four 1's.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.350
So this will be a count of all
of the different combinations

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.780
because all of the different
extra stuff that you have will

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.520
be all of the different hands.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.930
Now we know the total
number of hands with

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.550
four 1's is this number.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.010
And now we can divide
it by the total

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.210
number of possible hands.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.280
And I didn't multiply them out
on purpose so that we can

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.240
cancel things out.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.530
So let's do that.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.950
Let's take this and
divide by that.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.460
So let me just copy
and paste it.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.870
Let's take that and let's
divide it by that.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.780
But dividing by a fraction is
the same thing as multiplying

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.820
by the reciprocal.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.250
So let's just multiply
by the reciprocal.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.350
So let's multiply-- so this
is the denominator.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.300
Let's make this the numerator.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.900
So let me copy it and then
let me paste it.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.440
So that's the numerator
and then that's the

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.900
denominator up there.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.720
Because we're dividing
by that expression.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.110
So let me-- whoops.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.050
Let me put that there.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.590
Let me get the select tool and
then let me make sure I'm

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.110
selecting all of the numbers.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.970
Let me copy it and then
let me paste that.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.880
It's a little messy with those
lines there, but I think

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.070
this'll suit our purposes.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:56.260
This'll suit our purposes
just fine.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.890
So when we're multiplying by
this, we're essentially

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.130
dividing by this expression
up here.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.250
Now this we can simplify
pretty easily.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.820
We have a-- well actually I
forgot to do-- this should be

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.610
9 factorial.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.070
This should be 9 times 8 times
7 times 6 times 5 times 4

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.570
times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.260
Let me put that in
both places.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.190
Actually let me just-- let me
clear that both places.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:20.620
Clear.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.470
Don't want to confuse people.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.520
Clear.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.280
I'm sorry if that confused you
when I wrote it earlier.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.260
This would be 9 factorial.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:33.190
9 times 8 times 7 times 6
times 5 times 4 times 3

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.230
times 2 times 1.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.760
Let me copy and paste
that now.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.230
Copy and then you paste.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.190
It That's that, right there.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.960
And then we have this
in the numerator.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.720
We have 5 times 4 times 3 times
1 in the denominator.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.400
So this will cancel out with
that part right over there.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:58.980
And then we have 32 times 31
times 30 times 29 times 28.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.150
That is going to cancel
with that.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:04.230
That and that cancels out.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.630
So what we're left with is
just this part over here.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.650
Let me rewrite it.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:15.710
So we're left with 9 times 8
times 7 times 6 over-- and

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.380
this will just be an exercise
in simplifying this

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:23.920
expression-- 36 times 35
times 34 times 33.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.360
And let's see, if we divide the
numerator and denominator

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.550
by 9, that becomes a 1,
this becomes a 4.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.780
You can divide the numerator
and denominator by 4, this

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.710
becomes a 2.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.680
This becomes a 1.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.470
You divide numerator and
denominator by 7, this becomes

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.530
a 1, this becomes a 5.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.170
You can divide both by 2 again
and then this becomes a 1.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.140
This becomes a 17.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.500
And you could divide
this and this by 3.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.260
This becomes a 2 and then
this becomes an 11.

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.550
So we're left with, the
probability of having all four

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:04.100
1's in my hand of 9 that I'm
selecting from 36 unique cards

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:05.970
is equal to-- in the numerator,
I'm just left with

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.880
this 2 times 1 times 1 times 1--
so it's equal to 2 over 5

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.150
times 17 times 11.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.980
And that is-- so drum roll, this
was kind of an involved

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:28.660
problem-- 5 times 17 times
11 is equal to 935.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:34.150
So it's equal to 2 over 935.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.800
So about roughly 2 in a thousand
chance or 1 in a

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.040
500-- roughly speaking, this
isn't exact odds-- you have a

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.020
roughly 1 in 500 chance of
getting all four of the 1's in

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.000
your hand of 9 when
you're selecting

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.190
from 36 unique cards.
