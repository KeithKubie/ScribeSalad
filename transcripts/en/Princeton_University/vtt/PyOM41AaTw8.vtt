birthday, Shakespeare.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.740
RUSSELL LEO: At Princeton,
we who teach Shakespeare

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.230
see it as an opportunity
to have interdisciplinary

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.550
conversations.


00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.130
It's really a rare opportunity
to get a room full of students

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.330
from all different majors and
concentrations, who all agree--

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.240
at least at the beginning--
that this material is important.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.820
LILEANA BLAIN-CRUZ:
How do we continue

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.710
to capture the immensity
of the human spirit?

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.650
And it's in Shakespeare's plays.


00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.150
BARBARA ROMER: So
my sophomore year,

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.910
I was working on a production of
Henry IV, Part One and Part Two

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.250
combined, in the chapel.


00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.290
I think maybe as a foreigner
at first at Princeton,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.650
where I was struggling
with the foreign language,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.810
that production
sophomore year really

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.250
allowed me to find that voice.


00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.830
MICHAEL CADDEN: We're looking
at the ways in which Shakespeare

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.770
continues to shape the
contemporary British theater.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.390
One of the great
things about Princeton

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.500
is that there are the
resources at the university

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.870
to do things like what I've
just done during Spring

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.470
Break-- which is to take 14
Princeton students to London

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.070
and Stratford to
kind of experience

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.510
the legacy of Shakespeare.


00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.590
DAVID CRUIKSHANK: It's
really important for people

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.650
to have opportunities to view,
and to perform Shakespeare,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.720
because you kind of get an
experience and an understanding

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.260
of the text that you wouldn't
be able to get when you're just

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.300
kind of learning it
in the classroom.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.260
EMMA WORTH: Shakespeare
is very dense material,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.050
so it's really important that
that first introduction is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.180
both an encouraging, and clear,
and helpful hand in guiding you

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.120
through the texts.


00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.580
JOHN PATRICK DOHERTY: I played
Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.350
when I was a senior
at Princeton.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.340
We did it in the
Berlind Theatre,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.640
part of the McCarter Theatre.


00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.160
And it was the first time
that I had done Shakespeare

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.410
in a theater of that size, with
that kind of production value.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.030
EMILY MANN: It's a wonderful
amalgamation of the two,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.410
to be able to study it,
and then see it come alive

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.970
and hopefully, blow your
mind with its intensity

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.200
on the stage.


00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.430
SANDRA BERMANN: Yes, and I do
think that reading Shakespeare

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.930
is an experience of
broadening oneself,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.110
and one's understanding.


00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.840
EMILY MANN: No question.


00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.630
SANDRA BERMANN: And
that happens every time

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.500
we pick up a page of
Shakespeare's work.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.600
And it leads me in the
classroom to always

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.180
make sure our students
read it aloud.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.670
"Love's not time's fool.


00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.990
The rosy lips and cheeks within
his bending sickle's compass

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.120
come.


00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.220
Love alters not with his
brief hours and weeks,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.180
but bears it out even
to the edge of doom.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.200
If this be error
and upon me proved,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.770
I never writ, nor
no man ever loved."

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.520
LILEANA BLAIN-CRUZ:
Working on Shakespeare

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.970
reminds you the beauty
and the power of language,

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.430
the ability to transform and to
act through words, the ability

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.490
to-- a million ways
that you can express

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.760
love, and at the same time
express doubt about that love,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.000
the way that people are
able to frame identities out

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.370
of language.


00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.080
It's incredible.


00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.040
I just think it's an immense
project that will never

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.700
cease to provide new discoveries
about who we are as people.
