we learn is not necessarily from a
 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.160
we learn is not necessarily from a
teacher but from somebody in another

the way we learn is just very different

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190
the way we learn is just very different
 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.990
the way we learn is just very different
now so and then that has also led to a

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000
now so and then that has also led to a
 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.100
now so and then that has also led to a
revolution in terms of production we

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110
revolution in terms of production we
 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.700
revolution in terms of production we
build through digital media now and that

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710
build through digital media now and that
 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.520
build through digital media now and that
changes the way that you design things

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530
changes the way that you design things
 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.800
changes the way that you design things
all of this has changed the way that we

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810
all of this has changed the way that we
 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.270
all of this has changed the way that we
instruct in the earlier years and the

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280
instruct in the earlier years and the
 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.120
instruct in the earlier years and the
later years in addition to that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130
later years in addition to that
 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.580
later years in addition to that
obviously the question of sustainability

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590
obviously the question of sustainability
 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.100
obviously the question of sustainability
has become up front and center for a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110
has become up front and center for a
 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.680
has become up front and center for a
great range of people and that's another

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690
great range of people and that's another
 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.170
great range of people and that's another
debate to be had but it is of some

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180
debate to be had but it is of some
 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.590
debate to be had but it is of some
concern so there are let's say a range

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600
concern so there are let's say a range
 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.840
concern so there are let's say a range
of issues that have changed the focus

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850
of issues that have changed the focus
 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.229
of issues that have changed the focus
from a global level and because of that

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239
 
 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.420
 
one may say that there's two tendencies

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430
one may say that there's two tendencies
 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.949
one may say that there's two tendencies
one is again how you incorporate the

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959
one is again how you incorporate the
 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.870
one is again how you incorporate the
world into education the other one is

how do you look at those irreducible

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750
how do you look at those irreducible
 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.740
how do you look at those irreducible
aspects of the architectural Mattia or

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750
aspects of the architectural Mattia or
 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.870
aspects of the architectural Mattia or
the architectural tradition without

the architectural tradition without
 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.509
the architectural tradition without
which we don't we can't consider

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519
which we don't we can't consider
