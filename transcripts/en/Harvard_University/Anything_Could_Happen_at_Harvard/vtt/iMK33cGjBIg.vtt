[ Anthony Narrating ]
Every day, when I wake up...

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:09.767
I still can’t believe I’m at Harvard.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.233
Like every freshman,
I get to live in Harvard Yard...

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:19.700
and I get to eat breakfast
in Annenberg Hall.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:21.600
- What’s up, you guys?
- Hey.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.333
I really enjoy my freshman seminar,
“The Evolution of Aging.”

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.100
It’s just me, 15 other students
and a faculty member.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:34.533
And I get to work directly with my professor
on research projects.

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.167
I’m able to visit any of the other
great Harvard schools...

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.167
like the School of Engineering...

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:43.433
or the Kennedy School,
where I’ve heard world leaders speak...

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:46.933
or the medical school,
which is pretty cool...

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.667
because I’m also training to become an E.M.T.–
I want to become a doctor.

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.367
Every day, I get to hang out with my friends
and try something new.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:57.233
[ All Shout ]

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.100
Harvard is one university
with a million things to explore...

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.133
and I’m glad I’ve got the next three years
to try them all.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.900
My name is Anthony,
and I’m from Tucker, Georgia.
