00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.830
MARK SPATES: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.380
Thank you so much for coming
to the Smart Home talk.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.219
The goal here is really to
give you guys a little bit

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.290
of understanding
and background on,

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.787
how do you connect a IoT
device to Google Assistant

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:23.870
so that you can allow that
device to be controlled

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.502
by the Google Assistant?

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:27.260
I'm Mark Spates.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.150
I am the product lead for Smart
Home and the Google Assistant.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.640
This is David Schairer,
kind of my partner in crime.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.730
He's the engineering lead
for Smart Home and the Google

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.250
Assistant.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.260
I think when you start to look
at some of the things that

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.860
are happening in this
space, it's really clear

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.320
that having a Assistant
control physical space

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.740
is going to be extremely
important moving forward.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.100
So when we start to look at
Smart Home and the Google

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.740
Assistant, it was clear
that this was a feature

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.950
that we had to have when
Google Home launched last year.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.611
The feature has become a pillar
of the Google Home experience,

00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.360
and what users come
to expect when they're

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.700
interacting with the Assistant.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.430
The other thing is,
the IoT market--

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.270
which you guys have
heard 1,000 times,

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.440
it's one of the biggest buzz
words of the last three years,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.390
it's actually finally
going to happening.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.370
And the Assistants are
part of that, right?

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.020
They're driving this
interaction with these devices.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.700
So for us, we knew that there
was a unique opportunity

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.200
for the Google Assistant as
it relates to the Smart Home

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.700
space.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.010
Just basic numbers,
these are the numbers

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.740
that you guys have seen
scene 1,000 times, right?

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.510
IoT is growing, and there's
a whole bunch of devices.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.380
But I just want to look at 2017.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.380
There's 8.4 billion
connected devices.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.260
And out of that, you have
5.2 that are actually

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.360
consumer segment devices.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.070
It's huge.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.740
This means that having
that physical thing

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.080
in this space that's
connected to the cloud

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.120
is actually at a big
enough penetration

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.389
rate that having the Assistant
control it actually makes sense

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.930
to a user.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.590
And those devices are
super diverse, right?

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.220
You have things from cars
and lights and fans and robot

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.360
vacuums.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.360
I mean, I just got a
connected sous vide machine

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.272
delivered to my
desk so I can test

00:02:25.272 --> 00:02:26.480
when I barbecue this weekend.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.530
But that's how far we've come.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.310
Everything will be connected.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.870
And if it's connected, it should
be controlled at some level

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.330
by the Assistant.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.750
The next thing that we
really start to look at

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.590
is, where does the Assistant
play in this user interaction?

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.560
And for us, it was always--

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.690
the Assistant will
be at the center

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.220
of these intelligent
interactions

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.630
with these IoT devices.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.130
And we put the word intelligent
in there for a specific reason.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.610
Today, a lot of the ways that we
control these things are simple

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.195
on and off switches.

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:04.570
They're actually
not intelligent.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.200
You're simply sending
a on/off command,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.910
and the thing goes
on and off, but it

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.320
doesn't take into consideration
context, device type, and all

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.270
these things that a user
would come to expect.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.280
Which got us to this point in
our development, and we said,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.990
it's about conversations,
not about commands.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.420
And this is a core philosophy
that our team looks at.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.080
And we make product decisions
and engineering decisions

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.820
based on this philosophy.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.690
A user should be able to say
multiple things to a device,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.190
right?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.530
Not just turn this
device on, but if you

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.140
look at a light and
all the vast commands

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.350
you can give it just to simply
control it, it's amazing.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.990
So you can change the color,
you can turn them on and off,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.650
you can do things like
make the bedroom brighter.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.960
Imagine yourself sitting
there with your spouse

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.730
or your roommate or
your best friend,

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.104
think about all
the ways that you

00:03:59.104 --> 00:04:01.910
tell that person to turn the
light on or control the light.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.910
It's extremely
different if you're

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.250
talking to your mom
versus your girlfriend

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.480
versus your boyfriend.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.775
All these things we need to
be able to understand so we

00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:10.900
can do what the user wants.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.380
So to do this, we
had to get context.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.060
We have to understand things
like, what is in the home?

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.860
What are the rooms in the home?

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.510
Who lives in that home?

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.870
This is the key reason our team
decided to create the Google

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.250
Home Graph.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.260
The Google Home Graph stores
and provides the contextual data

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.520
about the devices in the
homes to the Google Assistant.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.310
Now, this may
sound very similar.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.230
You've heard these
things, right?

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.313
There's Knowledge Graph,
there's a graph for this,

00:04:44.313 --> 00:04:45.640
there's a graph for that.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.220
But actually, the home is
one of the last frontiers.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.190
If you look at yourself
in your day to day,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.380
if you walk out of
here, we pretty much

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.330
know that you got
a mobile phone,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.740
this is your GPS locations,
and this is where you are.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.880
Soon as you walk into
home, a lot of us

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.250
know that you walked in a
home, but we have no idea

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.680
what happens after that.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.910
Are you in a living room?

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.070
Are you in the bedroom?

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.410
Are you watching TV?

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.410
Your phone may be in the
basement, you may be upstairs.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.450
We have to have better
conceptual understanding

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.750
of the home to have a
really good experience.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.250
So let's break down a Home
Graph really quickly, right?

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.080
We look at it as properties.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.016
And there's three big
sets of properties,

00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:26.890
and under there, there's
a lot of things that

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.070
build upon these properties.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.570
So there's a structure.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.540
That structure has to address,
it has managers, it has rooms,

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.730
it has labels, right?

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.220
Then you have rooms--

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.410
because rooms are very specific.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.080
What I do in the bedroom and
what I do in the living room,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.530
saying the exact same thing
can mean totally different

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.180
in the context, right?

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.480
So you have to understand where
you actually are in the home.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.350
And there's devices.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.990
Devices are extremely unique.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.800
And we have to know, what
type of device is it?

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.840
What are the capabilities
of that device?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.020
What are the attributes?

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.030
What's the current state?

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.660
And the reason is, there
are situations like this.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.700
Let's go back to my example.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.750
If you're sitting on the
couch, and you say, dim

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.910
the lights in the living
room a little bit, that's

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.710
a super complex
command or conversation

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.940
to even have with someone that's
sitting right next to you.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.320
So using a Home Graph,
this is what we do.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.260
We first say, are there any
lights in the living room?

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.180
Basic question.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.470
OK, yeah, there's some
lights in the living room.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.990
Next, are those
lights currently on?

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.330
OK, the current-- the lights
are on, that's awesome.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.410
What are they set to?

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.100
Oh, these lights are on,
and they're set to 50%.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.010
What does a little bit mean?

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.460
Well, in this case, a
little bit, may mean 3%.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.210
It's a default thing
that we put in there.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.930
We have-- we support things like
little bit, we support a lot.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.120
Our interns put hella
in there because they're

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.510
from California.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.531
But you have to know how to
increment based on those words,

00:06:57.531 --> 00:06:58.030
right?

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.080
So we say, oh,
it's a little bit.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.670
We're going to
increment by three.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.320
We take that data,
we package it up,

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.945
and we pass it to
the Google Assistant.

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:05.860
And then Assistant
says, all right, got it.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.712
I will change the
lights from 50% to 53%.

00:07:09.712 --> 00:07:11.170
That's how the data
from Home Graph

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.670
is actually being
used in real time.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.380
But it was awesome as
we were building this,

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.690
and we were saying
to ourselves, I

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.550
think we stumbled
upon what's going

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.160
to unlock this market
for everyone when

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.560
it comes to controlling
devices in the house.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.500
So we have to get
this to developers.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.920
How do we allow developers
to build interactions

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.190
that leverage Google
Assistant in the Home Graph?

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.090
So today I'm really excited
to introduce Smart Home apps.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.570
Smart Home apps is a
experience that you can

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.370
build using Actions on Google.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:48.920
I'm sure you guys have heard
tons about Actions on Google.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.930
It is the greatest thing ever.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:53.360
It is my favorite
platform Google's made.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.520
But it's going to
be the way that we

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.011
go from this being a early
adopter platform to everyone

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.010
in this audience being
able to hook up something

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.110
to the Assistant,
leverage their Home Graph,

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:07.040
and control it in a
very conversational way.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.630
But that's enough
about me talking.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.830
I think for most
of you, you want

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.690
to see, how do you actually
build one of these things?

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.231
And with that, I'm going to turn
it over to David to give you

00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:16.297
guys the developer experience.

00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:17.505
DAVID SCHAIRER: Thanks, Mark.

00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:19.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.610
So as Mark, said most
of you have probably

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.290
seen Actions on Google by now.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.525
If you haven't, you
should definitely read up.

00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:30.430
Actions on Google
is our new platform

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.700
to let you extend the
Assistant directly

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.460
to your applications, to your
services, and, in this case,

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.630
to your hardware.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.600
So we've brought--
with this launch,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.450
we're bringing
Smart Home devices

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.430
into the Actions
on Google platform.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.580
We let you register your devices
directly to the Home Graph.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.580
And rather than have the
Actions on Google model

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.930
where you talk to your
app, it changes the voice,

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.550
you interact
conversationally, you

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.259
can now have direct
actions that directly

00:08:59.259 --> 00:09:01.341
communicate with your
devices, and everything else

00:09:01.341 --> 00:09:01.990
in the home.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.660
So if you have lights,
you register your lights

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.770
to the user's living room.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.936
The user says, turn on my
lights in the living room,

00:09:07.936 --> 00:09:10.600
it turns on your lights, it
turns on other vendors' lights.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.340
It works seamlessly.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.310
It's a descriptive grammar
that lets the user interact

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.810
naturally.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.940
One of my coworkers
likes to say,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:21.460
no one wants a light bulb
that asks too many questions.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.180
So our system is designed for
those one shot single actions,

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.860
fire and forget,
everything just works.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.420
How do we do this?

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.890
So you guys, you folks
that are building hardware,

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.570
building Smart Home devices--

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.560
light bulbs, thermostats, ovens,
sous vide machines, microwaves,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.269
sprinklers, whatever--

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:43.560
you're building great hardware.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.476
We want to make it really
easy for you to keep

00:09:45.476 --> 00:09:46.620
building great hardware.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.930
You provide a very lightweight
cloud infrastructure

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.430
on top of what
you're already doing.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.040
You've already got cloud
control for these devices.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.360
Add in OAuth,
which you all know,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.840
some basic device sync,
execution and data integration

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.710
protocols.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.130
All of these are stock JSON,
trivial stuff to implement.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.770
And then we add on top
of that all of the stuff

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:05.730
that Google's good at--

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.350
the natural language
understanding,

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.750
the speech generation, the
personality, the Home Graph

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.910
that Mark talked about,
internationalization

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.370
and context, and error
management, and all

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.280
of these sort of complex
schemas of what does it

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.930
mean to be a washing machine?

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.960
And how do users interact
with washing machines?

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.730
We can apply learning,
we apply a lot

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.610
of our AI to these engines so
that they keep getting better.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.050
And everything we improve,
you get the improvements

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.640
on as well.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.220
We basically
integrate in two ways.

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.590
We have a flow for device setup,
we have a flow for execution.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.625
This is the setup
flow, very simple.

00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:43.500
I'm going to show you
all of this end to end.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.230
Once you've registered,
you simply--

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.530
your app shows up in our
list of Smart Home apps,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.020
a user clicks on it,
we send them off to you

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.669
for OAuth registration.

00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:55.710
You would do whatever else
you want in that flow.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.560
Come back to us, we send
a request for the devices,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.930
you give us all the
devices that that user has,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:01.740
any data you want.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.240
It's a simple JSON protocol.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.710
They have 17 lights,
they're called these things,

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.060
they're in these rooms, and they
have these traits associated

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.580
with them, what have you.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.080
That's a full sync
each time, so you

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.746
don't need to do delta
state management,

00:11:14.746 --> 00:11:15.870
we do all that for you.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:19.170
We take that stuff, we
put it in the Home Graph.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:24.300
Then at execution time,
we use our Assistant stack

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.121
to do all the heavy lifting.

00:11:26.121 --> 00:11:27.870
We've gotten your state
from your devices,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.080
we know what those
things are called.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.570
Again, what their
capabilities are.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.570
We feed that into our real
time speech recognition engine.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.000
So if a user's named their
light something weird,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.720
we understand it.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.240
They have a chandelier in
their gazebo, that's just fine.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.060
So speech recognition knows it,
natural language understanding

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.280
knows it, the Smart
Home engine knows it.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.900
So all that stuff
lets us then build

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.420
the exact execution and query
semantics that we give you.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.300
We feed those to you,
you do your task.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.890
Again, simple JSON/HTTPS stuff.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.500
Or maybe we generate the TTS--
the text response and speech

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.210
response to the
user, and it works.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.551
We have built some
basic device types.

00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:06.050
We're building a lot more device
types over the coming weeks

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.790
and months.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.671
These device types are
composed of traits.

00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:11.545
Traits are really where
functionality occurs.

00:12:11.545 --> 00:12:13.070
So you have a trait of--

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.780
the simplest trait ever, on/off.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:16.910
It means this
device has a switch.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:21.340
Those traits then are made of
attribute states and commands.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.810
On/off is pretty
simple, no attributes.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:24.470
One state.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:26.060
I bet you can guess what it is.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.710
Pretty much one
command that just

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.270
is turning things on and off.

00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.000
That trait then could be
composited into whatever

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.590
devices you want to make.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.520
Right now, what we've
launched publicly,

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.320
those are lights and switches
and thermostats and the like.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.420
You build a robot, you
can reuse that trait,

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.670
and make your robot
have an on/off trait.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.170
Generally speaking,
all your robots

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:48.050
should have an on/off
trait, highly recommended.

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.420
Otherwise, problems occur.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:51.950
So you'll be able to build--

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.450
as we roll out more
and more traits,

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:54.824
you can composite
your own device

00:12:54.824 --> 00:12:56.090
types of whatever you want.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.089
Maybe it's a clock radio that
has clock functionality, radio

00:12:59.089 --> 00:13:00.380
functionality, and other stuff.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.860
Maybe it's that robot that
combines standard traits

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:06.664
that we have plus custom
traits that you build.

00:13:06.664 --> 00:13:08.330
We're releasing custom
traits soon where

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:10.663
you can build your own features
on top of this platform.

00:13:12.529 --> 00:13:14.070
I'm going to walked
through the demo.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:15.030
It's really simple.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.720
We're going to do
this in six steps.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.845
We're going to register
your project in the Actions

00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:19.970
on Google platform.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.780
We're going to set up OAuth.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.120
We're going to implement
your Smart Home app.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.506
I'm going to cheat
there a little bit.

00:13:26.506 --> 00:13:28.380
We're going to use this
gactions command line

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.930
tool to test that package.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:32.370
And once you do that, we're
going to go to the real app,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.280
production level, no-- nothing
googly, nothing special,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.890
production level Assistant
app in home control,

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.550
connect to your app,
set up your devices,

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.190
and then start talking to them.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.190
So let's start the demo.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.350
Great.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.067
So this is the Actions
on Google console.

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:55.650
You may have played
with this already.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.650
This is the new console
we launched yesterday.

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.890
I'm going to create a
project, give it some name.

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:03.300
Doesn't really matter for here.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:06.717
I'm going to call
it Sheep Project,

00:14:06.717 --> 00:14:07.800
see if it lets me do that.

00:14:10.722 --> 00:14:11.930
This will take a few seconds.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.070
What we're doing
here is creating

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.220
a project inside the
Actions on Google systems.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.660
So it's assigning a project
ID, giving you all the tools

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:18.680
you need to build this.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.620
Now, you may have seen
some of the API discussions

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.880
that we had earlier today.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.160
We actually, today, are not
using API AI for the Smart Home

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.381
stuff because we've
written all the grammar.

00:14:30.381 --> 00:14:32.630
You don't need to write any
grammar for these actions,

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.740
we provide it for you.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.200
So we reuse the Assistant SDK--

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.610
or, Actions SDK.

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.310
We skip reading the docs
because we're developers.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:43.940
And let's go and set
up the app information.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.560
Now, a lot of the
stuff on this page,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:53.930
honestly, we don't need for
home automation for Smart Home

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:54.860
projects.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.450
But we're going to fill it
in anyway because currently

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.920
the application here wants it.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.750
For example, the
Assistant voice,

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.100
because everything you do here
runs as a native Google app,

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.862
it's running native
understanding,

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:06.070
we can use the natural voice.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.528
We don't need to change the
voice and make it feel jarring.

00:15:08.528 --> 00:15:12.980
So we'll just say
home control demo.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.140
Full description, demo.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.670
We don't really care.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.810
Category, let's pick
home control down here

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.880
at the bottom.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.640
And what did I miss?

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.600
To control some stuff.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.302
Obviously when you
do this for real,

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:29.760
since eventually
this will be going

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.880
to build in your
registry item, you'll

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.320
want some real text there.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.420
Now it's asking for icons.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:39.240
Same thing, I'm going to
load up some dummy ones.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:44.500
And eventually these will be
used when you submit your app.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.220
Away we go.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.150
Testing instructions
we can skip.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.855
My [INAUDIBLE] is
called Sheep Company.

00:15:51.855 --> 00:15:53.355
Let's not think
about this too hard.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.730
And feel free to spam me there.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.840
Oops.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.525
Privacy policy.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.690
Just a dummy URL for now.

00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:12.290
And it will think.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.890
Great.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.740
We've now created our project.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.150
We have one more thing to do.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:18.410
Number two on that list--

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.640
account linking.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.620
So let's add some
account linking.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.600
Authorization code,
standard OAuth.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.050
Let me go and grab my keys here.

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:31.160
Now, these are the standard
keys in the demo app

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.870
that we have put on GitHub.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:38.870
Please do not use these OAuth
keys in your actual app.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:43.000
I should not have
to tell you why.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.570
Now, I'm just going
to set this up.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.350
I'm using a stock [INAUDIBLE]
instance here right

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.090
off the shelf.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.050
Signed it up onto the
node the other day.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:53.260
So I'm not doing anything funky.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:58.570
Testing instructions, demo.

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.010
OAuth should now be set up.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:03.940
Now, over here I have--

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.880
this is our stock example app.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.700
And all I'm going to
do is start this up.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.420
You'll see this is sitting
behind an NGINX proxy.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:14.109
You know, standard SSL stuff.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:17.349
So not running now,
start this running.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.069
Away we go.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:27.430
Now, when I load this, I
should be able to go here--

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:32.810
and please don't hack into
my demo while I'm doing it.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:33.790
Blam.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:34.900
Now, this is a ver--

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.358
I know, I shouldn't
have said that.

00:17:36.358 --> 00:17:37.990
You're doing it now.

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.150
When the lights start going on
crazy, I know it's one of you.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.400
This is our example app.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:47.509
We've shipped this app for
testing out the application.

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:48.550
These are virtual lights.

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:50.383
We actually used this
in our own development

00:17:50.383 --> 00:17:52.510
because I can't get 100
light bulbs at my desk.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.350
People complain.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.850
So when we need to
do scale testing,

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.433
we tend to do it
with virtual devices.

00:17:56.433 --> 00:17:58.270
So I can turn those on
and off, set these up

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.850
for cloud registration.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.960
Now, I now have an app running.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.980
My next step, I'm
going to hop over here,

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.730
and I am going to
find the action.

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:15.762
We have this gactions
command here, which simply--

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:16.262
oops.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.440
This takes the action--

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.830
actually, before we do that, let
me show you the action package.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.356
So you may have
seen action packages

00:18:28.356 --> 00:18:30.730
and other demos that have lots
and lots of stuff on them.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.240
Ours is really simple.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.100
That's all there is.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.900
You put the URL to
use for execution

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.900
in there, execution in sync,
everything else is stock.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.790
And then I can run this.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:44.410
I can go and grab my
project ID, which happens

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.000
to be easily right here.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.140
And if I didn't forget
something because I'm on stage,

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.490
I can do that.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.244
And of course it
will ask me to update

00:18:53.244 --> 00:18:55.660
while I'm on stage because
apps know when you're on stage.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.510
Skip that.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.510
Pushing the app.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:01.880
Now it should be live.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.505
I'm going to go over
here to the phone.

00:19:03.505 --> 00:19:04.900
Oops.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.750
Here on the phone,
restart the Assistant.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:13.950
Go into Settings, Home
Control, I have no devices.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.650
Plus.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:16.850
There is my app.

00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:19.970
So my app that I just
created and I just ran

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.430
is now available just like
all of our production partners

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.540
here.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.143
And I click on
that app, and I now

00:19:27.143 --> 00:19:31.374
have to type this, which
you'll probably see.

00:19:31.374 --> 00:19:32.820
Whoops.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.490
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
please hack in.

00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:37.320
I should put it a paste buffer.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.450
All right, if I
did that right, I

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.020
got OAuth, linking my devices.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.909
And then these four
lights that I put up here

00:19:46.909 --> 00:19:48.200
are now available on the phone.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.530
I'm going to skip rooms
because I don't really

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.120
care about that right now.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.421
And I can say--

00:19:53.421 --> 00:19:56.760
going to go back
to the Assistant.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.578
Turn on all my lights.

00:19:59.578 --> 00:20:01.782
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Sure,
turning four lights on.

00:20:01.782 --> 00:20:03.740
DAVID SCHAIRER: All right,
two of those decided

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.160
to get knocked off the cloud.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.850
If they weren't on the cloud--

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.690
turn on all my lights.

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.120
And there go the other ones.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.892
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Turning four lights.

00:20:11.892 --> 00:20:12.391
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:12.391 --> 00:20:14.181
DAVID SCHAIRER: Make
my lights, green.

00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:16.430
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Sure,
changing four lights to green.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.529
DAVID SCHAIRER: So
pretty simple stuff.

00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:20.570
We have lots of other
device types-- thermostats,

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.040
more complex things.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.090
This is the base case.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.040
And you saw, yes, I did cheat.

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.350
We have a little Node.js
instance over here.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.690
But that's all it takes.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:32.720
So with that, I will
turn it back to Mark.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.740
MARK SPATES: Awesome.

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.520
Great demo, David.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:35.919
That was awesome.

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.240
So you go and crush it
like David just did.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:44.797
You build your stuff in 36
hours, and you're ready to go.

00:20:44.797 --> 00:20:46.380
But there's still a
couple more things

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.730
you have to do to launch it.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.430
First, send me a device,
because I have to test it.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.660
But then, once you send
the device over to Google

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.050
and you deploy your
action, we will then

00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.460
do a certification process.

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.780
And the certification
process is really simple.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.710
We do have a few testers go
through, test basic things--

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.470
latency, make sure that
the policies and privacy

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.550
things are correct.

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:11.844
And then once that's
all done, we say,

00:21:11.844 --> 00:21:13.260
all right, this
looks really good,

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.940
and this is ready to go to
production after we certify it.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.890
And then we launch
it into production.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.380
So it's a really simple process.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.989
We are making sure that
the experience that the end

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:23.280
user is getting is really good.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.470
So that's where the
certification process comes in.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.320
Just to make sure things
like the right grammars work,

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.910
and the expectations
around latency are set.

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.400
We have a bunch of partners
who have been working with us.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.740
They've helped us
build this process.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.620
And we are super
excited because they've

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.350
helped us learn a lot about
what we can do better.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:47.980
But more importantly,
I think, the rapid pace

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.440
in which we've been adding
Smart Home integrations has

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.950
been amazing.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.400
We started with
three integrations.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.850
In the keynote, you heard
our team say we have 70 now.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.330
And we did most of those
in the last six weeks

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.070
using this process.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.600
So we extremely excited to
open this up to everyone

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.482
so we can go even faster.

00:22:08.482 --> 00:22:09.940
So you might say
like, what's next?

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.620
The first thing is,
everyone leave here,

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.230
don't go to the concert,
go build a Smart Home app.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.790
Then go to the concert, right?

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:19.360
But there's other things that
you may want to check out.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.090
There are going to be more
device support, more features

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.006
and all that coming the
next couple of months,

00:22:24.006 --> 00:22:25.360
as David said.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.769
Also, all these
integrations are on display

00:22:27.769 --> 00:22:28.810
in some of the Sandboxes.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.520
So if you go to the
Assistant Sandbox,

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:33.220
if you go to IoT's Sandbox,
you see a lot of these things

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.030
already on display.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.360
And it's running in
production, which is awesome.

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.670
And the last one is that
we work really closely

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.744
with the Assistant SDK team.

00:22:41.744 --> 00:22:43.660
So if you're thinking
about, how do I actually

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.725
embed the Assistant
into my device,

00:22:45.725 --> 00:22:47.350
you should check out
the Assistant SDK.

00:22:48.724 --> 00:22:53.930
