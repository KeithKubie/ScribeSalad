Here are the cars. Let's see how I did it? I simply added an ArrayList for

00:00:04.822 --> 00:00:10.990
cars. Put in the cars at the coordinates that the question asked for, and then

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.950
I added a third loop to draw all the cars. Now, this is not so pretty. And it

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.942
really would be nice if we could some how unify all of these various elements,

00:00:23.942 --> 00:00:30.580
put them in a single container and draw them in a single loop. That's what

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.390
we'll be able to do with Java interface types.
