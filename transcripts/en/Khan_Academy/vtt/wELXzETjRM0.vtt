00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
[Instructor] When we look at communities

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.940
of organisms, an interesting
question to think

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.790
about is how diverse
are those communities?

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.570
And here I have two example communities

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.090
and each of them is made
up of species of circles.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.240
Each species is represented
by a different color.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.370
And so pause this video.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.120
Intuitively, which of these communities

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.143
would you think to be more diverse?

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.210
Well, if you look a community number one

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.800
you see that it has two different colors

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.680
of circles, or we could view that as two

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.960
different species, while
community number two

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.500
has four different species.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.110
So intuitively we would say that community

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.400
number two is more diverse.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.820
But how could we actually
quantify these things?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.070
Well, to help us do that biologists

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.050
have developed a tool, which is known

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.140
as Simpson's Index of Diversity.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.480
And so it's gonna be a number between zero

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.620
and one where one is a,
you could say a very,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.450
very diverse community and
zero'd be not diverse at all.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.270
And so let me write this down.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.000
So the index is going to be,
this is gonna be the index

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.273
of diversity.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.380
And then capital N is
going to be the total

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.810
population in that community,
so the total number

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.160
of individuals of all species.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.160
So number of all individuals, individuals.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.940
And then n sub i is going
to be the number of,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.560
we could view that as the ith species.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.560
So number of individuals,
viduals, in ith species

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.600
where i I'm saying, you
know, here there's two

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.460
species so that'd be the first species

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.510
and they're the second species.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.510
So i would be one and then i would be two.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.240
Here there's four, so you would have it

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.970
the number of individuals
for the first, second,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:48.803
third, or fourth.

00:01:48.803 --> 00:01:50.320
So how do you put all of
these numbers together

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.360
to get the index of diversity?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.000
Well, we would get this formula.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.630
And we're gonna apply it a few times

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.930
to see why it makes sense.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.460
So Simpson's Index of
Diversity is gonna be equal

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.460
to one minus the sum of
the product of n sub i

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.670
times n sub i minus one, all of that over

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.620
capital N times capital N minus one.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.860
Now to see why this makes
sense, let's calculate

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.720
Simpson's Index of Diversity
for each of these communities.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.340
So for community number
one, won't you let me

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.260
scroll a little bit so that
we can do it right over here.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.730
Community number one,
I could write Simpson's

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.300
Index of Diversity's going to be equal

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.260
to one minus, and actually let me do

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.610
the denominator right over here.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.090
What's the total population size?

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.610
We have one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.170
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.090
So capital N is 12.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.960
So we're gonna have 12 times
12 minus one, so 12 times 11.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.587
And then up here we're
going to first think about

00:02:52.587 --> 00:02:54.730
the population of blues.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.300
We could view that as our first species.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.950
So one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.750
So we're gonna have seven
times seven minus one,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.380
so seven times six.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.820
Seven times six.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.130
And then to that we are going to add

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:12.210
the population of our second species.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.860
One, two, three, four, five.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.410
So it's going to be five times one less

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.200
than that, which would be four.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.410
And so what is this going to get us?

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.410
We are going to get, this is
going to be equal to one minus.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.170
Up here we have 42 plus
20, so it's 62 over.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.077
And then down here, 12 times 11 is 132.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.710
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.360
I can get a calculator out for that.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.960
62 divided by 132 is equal to that.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.070
Put a negative sign on it
and then add it to one.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.070
So plus one is equal to 0.53.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.110
So this is approximately 0.53.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.960
Now I encourage you,
pause the video and see

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.900
if you can now apply
Simpson's Index of Diversity

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.600
to community number two,
if you can solve that

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.320
on your own before we do it together.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.330
All right, now let's do it together.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.160
So in this situation, community
number two, I will do it.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.880
Let me draw a little line here so that we

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.160
don't get confused.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.010
So in this situation, our Simpson's Index

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.320
of Diversity's gonna
be equal to one minus.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.090
Our denominator's going to be, let's see.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.820
We have one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.250
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.570
So we have 13 individuals,
so it's gonna be 13

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.870
times one less than 13.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.000
So 13 times 12.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.300
And then our numerator is
going to be, let's see.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.710
We could view the yellow
as our first species.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.830
So there's four of them.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.190
One, two, three, four.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.210
So it's going to be four
times one less than that.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.300
Then we could think
about our orange species.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.780
There's three of them.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.760
So it's gonna be plus three
times one less than that.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.470
And then we could think
about our light blue species.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.460
There's two of them.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.070
So it's gonna be plus two
times one less than that.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.310
And then we can think
about our teal species.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.980
One, two, three, four.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.950
So it's gonna be plus four
times one less than that.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.540
And so that is going to be equal to,

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.260
it's going to be equal to one minus,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.900
see, well, I have 12
plus six, which is going

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.900
to be 18, plus two, which
is 20, plus 12, which is 32.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.470
One minus 32 over.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.940
And then what is 13 times 12?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.633
Let's see, that's going
to be equal to 156.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.550
156.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.290
And I can get my calculator out again.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.290
And I am going to get 32
divided by 156 is equal to that.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.250
And then I will need to subtract that

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.140
from one to get 0.79, roughly.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.870
So this is approximately equal to 0.79.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.710
So what's neat about this is this gave us

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.720
numbers that confirmed
what we knew intuitively,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.430
that this community right over here

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.630
by Simpson's Index of
Diversity is more diverse

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.960
than that community right over there.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.890
And if you wanna see
perfect lack of diversity

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.870
imagine a community that only had,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.330
imagine a community that
only had one species in it.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.640
I encourage you to figure that out.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.220
Think about what Simpson's
Index of Diversity would be.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.910
Say that this was community
three right over here.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:38.280
Community number three.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.760
Think about what the index of diversity

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.650
would be for that community, if they just

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.150
had those three individuals
and they were all one species.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.620
And similarly, I encourage you think about

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.210
community number four.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.820
Community number four.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.383
Well, maybe it has one
of each species, like,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.010
think about what Simpson's
Index of Diversity

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.753
would be for this community.
