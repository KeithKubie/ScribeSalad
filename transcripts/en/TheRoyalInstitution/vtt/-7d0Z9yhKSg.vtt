00:00:17.568 --> 00:00:20.090
It's a magnificent bridge.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.590
But it's quite easy to design
a bridge if the span's quite

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.165
short and the load it's carrying
is almost negligible.

00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:33.020
But it's a lot harder if the
bridge is longer and the load

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.770
it's carrying is a lot larger.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.150
And that was a challenge faced
by the engineers in the early

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.680
19th century who were building
the railways across Britain.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.110
So this is a Great Western
tank engine

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.460
from about the 1930s.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.750
The sort of thing you'd see
on a branch line train.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.790
And even though it's a small
locomotive, you can see how

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.220
massive it is, how
heavy it is.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.850
But it's not just its weight
that damages bridges.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.370
And to understand that, I'll
just explain a little bit

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.320
about how it works.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.370
So these are the cylinders.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.430
Inside the cylinder there's a
piston, it's very much like a

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.530
car engine.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.900
But when steam's admitted to
the cylinder, it pushes the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.880
piston back and that forces this
connecting rod here back.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.810
But can you see the crank
pin here which is

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.410
attached to the wheel?

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.250
The crank pins in line with
the centre of the wheel.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.040
No matter how much steam you
admit to the cylinder, it's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.480
not going to be able to move
the engine at all.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.450
So this is the left-hand
side of the engine.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.490
Here we are on the right-hand
side of the engine.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.000
Now, you'd expect that the
wheels would be 180 degrees

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.140
out of phase, the crank pin will
be up here, but it's not.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.280
The wheels are actually 90
degrees out of phase.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.160
The crank pin's at the bottom.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.060
And that means when it's in
this position, when steam

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.470
flows into the cylinder it can
push against the wheel and

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.010
rotate the wheel.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.010
And that means that the engine
can always start from a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.533
stationary position whatever
attitude the wheels are in.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.150
Let's try that with the
camera somewhere else.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.310
I've moved my crank's around so
they're 90 degrees to each

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.642
other, which is just like
the steam engine.

00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:41.360
I can't find the pedal.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.610
I can't find the pedal.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.780
There, that's got it.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.480
I cycle every day and it's
just really very obvious.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.100
It feels like cycling
on a kangaroo.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.100
But it's very uneven, and
I imagine you can

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.290
see that, feels it.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.320
And this sort of uneven
loading causes

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.570
real damage to bridges.

00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:10.321
That's about a ramming speed.

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:19.799
This is very odd.

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.150
So here's my model bridge.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.170
Just ignore this bit, it's
just a guide rail.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.580
This is the bridge itself.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.900
It's a steel bar.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.620
And when I force down on it, it
deflects downwards and the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.770
bottom of the bar goes
into tension.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.160
So I've got a strain gauge
that's fixed to the bottom of

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.840
the bar, and that measures
the tensions.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.730
That measures how much load I'm
applying to the bridge.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.320
So here's my steam engine.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.420
It doesn't look much like
the steam engine.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.590
But it's just a trolley that I
can move across the bridge, so

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.840
I'll do that now.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.550
And here's the trace from
the strain gauge.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.130
It starts from zero here, builds
to a maximum when the

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.200
train's in the middle of the
bridge, and then drops back

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.450
down to zero.

00:05:13.634 --> 00:05:16.752
And we know that steam engines
don't run smoothly like that.

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:18.260
Because of the cranks,
they apply a

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.300
cyclic load to the bridge.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.300
So we can see here how we've
replicated that.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.550
We've got this disc with an out
of balance mass on it, and

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.630
we can spin the disc
around as we're

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.400
driving across the bridge.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.010
So let's see the effect
of that now.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.680
So we've got the new trace here
with all the spikes on

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.490
it, and the old trace, this
smooth one behind.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.540
And you can see two things.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.680
The maximum load on the
bridge is higher.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.500
But also, you've got lots and
lots more load cycles applied

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.750
to the bridge.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.570
In the 19th century, railway
engineers called this cyclic

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.410
loading hammer blow.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.180
The material that they
could use, cast iron,

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.090
was a hopeless material.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.200
For one thing, it's
very brittle.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.950
But also, in the size of casting
you'd need to make a

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.170
railway bridge, it will be
just covered in defects.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.290
So we've got a small specimen
of cast iron, and we've put

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.180
our deliberate defect in it.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.760
This is to replicate the size
of defect that you get in a

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.650
large casting.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:36.020
And we're going to use this test
machine to apply cyclic

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.920
load to this specimen using this
hydraulic cylinder here.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.800
So here we've put a specimen
in the machine.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.490
We're supporting it at both
ends just like a railway

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.510
bridge would be supported
on pillars.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.220
And we're using the test
machine to apply cyclic

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.775
loading to the specimen
in the centre.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.480
And failures like this
happened in practise.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.100
A famous example's in 1847,
when a bridge carrying a

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.250
passenger train over the
River Dee failed.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.990
A bridge designed by Robert
Stephenson, causing

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.330
significant loss of life.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.060
And it isn't just history.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.600
Today we have to design
structures that are subject to

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.990
cyclic loading, whether they're
bridges or aircraft.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.450
And it's only through advances
in material technologies that

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.840
we are able to design these
structures with more

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.240
confidence.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.490
1,421.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.940
1,422.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.190
1,423.
