TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.990
I'm Timothy Jordan, and I'm
very proud to be hosting

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.890
"The Developer Show" this week.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.220
Let's skip the song and dance
number, and jump straight

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.200
to the show.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.990
First up, ha, the TLDR.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.470
Go beyond just JavaScript APIs,
frameworks, and the mysteries

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.774
of CSS to also learn
the tooling that

00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:21.690
can mean the difference
between an average web

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.649
developer and a
super-productive web developer.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:26.440
Check out the recently
launched web tooling

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.200
and automation course on Udacity
to learn about setting up

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.130
your editor, creating powerful
build scripts, live editing,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.060
linting, and all other sorts
of awesome optimizations.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.570
It's now a lot
easier to retrieve

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.930
data about an authenticated
user's connections

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.280
from their contacts by
using the new People API.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.850
And it's time to
update to HTTP/2,

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.080
as Chrome will no
longer support SPDY

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.410
starting on May 15th, which is
the anniversary of the HTTP/2

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.430
RFC.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.970
Starting in version
49, Chrome for Android

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.040
will surface
physical web content,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.170
helping an even larger
audience discover

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.160
URLs relevant to their
surroundings via Eddystone

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.250
Bluetooth low-energy beacons.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.650
Now is the time to check out
the physical web and what

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280
it can do for your users.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.720
Use Google to rapidly
build backend services

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.970
for your mobile app that scale
automatically to meet demand,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.680
automatically synchronize
data across devices,

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.200
handle the offline case
gracefully, and send

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.420
notifications and messages.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.930
Learn how Hydro Coach rapidly
reached 22 new markets

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.530
in this new blog post
on monetization tips

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.200
straight from successful
app developers.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.440
It's a great companion
to the no-nonsense guide

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.550
to app monetization we recently
mentioned on this show.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.070
Make more money from your
app with in-app payments.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.870
This video on the zen of
monetization with Ido Green

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.190
shows you how.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.190
Need an awesome functional
UI testing framework for iOS?

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.020
Well, we just
open-sourced the one

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.240
that we use for YouTube, Google
Calendar, Google Photos, Google

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.410
Translate, and
Google Play Music.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.910
Check out the blog post for more
details and the GitHub link.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.080
The Google Summer of
Code is a global program

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.870
focused on bringing more student
developers into open source

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.420
software development.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.230
Students work with a mentor
open source organization

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.940
on a three-month
programming project

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.260
during their break
from university.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.090
If you'd like to be a mentor
organization, follow the link

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.790
and submit an application.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.600
If you're a university
researcher working

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.620
on the Internet of
Things, we invite

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.300
you to participate in this
technology research award

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.100
pilot.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.430
It provides selected researchers
with in-kind GIFs of Google

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.510
IoT-related technologies,
with the goal

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.480
of fostering collaboration
on small-scale experiments

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.340
and discovering what you can do
with our software and devices.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.080
As usual, the linked blog
post has a lot more detail.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.250
And that's your TLDR.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.830
Let's see what's
next on the show.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.754
Oh, I get to go find Laurence
Moroney on the set of "Coffee

00:02:55.754 --> 00:02:56.420
with a Googler."

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.404
[CHEERING]

00:02:58.404 --> 00:03:00.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.030
Hi.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.446
I'm Laurence
Moroney, and I'm here

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:05.200
with Timothy Jordan on this
next episode of "Coffee

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.140
with a Googler."

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.630
LAURENCE MORONEY: Hi,
Timothy, how are you?

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It doesn't
feel quite right, does it?

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.920
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.375
Throw the script away.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.500
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So this is
where the magic happens,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.450
although not always
just in this place.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.312
You were saying that you
film throughout the campus

00:03:17.312 --> 00:03:19.770
because you really want to give
a peek into the Googleplex,

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.557
not just an interview
with the Googlers.

00:03:21.557 --> 00:03:22.640
LAURENCE MORONEY: Exactly.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.850
So it's like, you know,
Google is a living, breathing

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.900
entity it seems sometimes.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.066
We've got great people here.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:29.740
We've got a fabulous campus
that we get to work on.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.620
And, you know, let's just have
a peek inside of life every day

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.020
in Google while having a
10-minute chat with a Googler

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.521
over coffee.

00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.061
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
you've interviewed

00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:38.745
a lot of amazing
Googlers on the show.

00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:39.995
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes, I have.

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:42.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Who have
you not interviewed yet

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.010
that you want to
take this opportunity

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.006
to invite on the show?

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:46.130
LAURENCE MORONEY: Oh, yeah.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.740
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Who's, like,
would be the-- maybe give me

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.010
the top three, your
crowning achievements--

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.700
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well I've
already interviewed you--

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --of
"Coffee with a Googler."

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.020
LAURENCE MORONEY: --so--

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
leave me off the list.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.490
LAURENCE MORONEY:
I mean seriously,

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.020
I would actually really love
to interview Larry Page.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.010
LAURENCE MORONEY: I would love
Larry to come on the show.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.450
So-- and we can
do it in Seattle.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.160
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Remember that Google I/O

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.730
where, like, he
just came up and he

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.430
talked about the things
that were on his mind,

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.550
and then he took questions?

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: That was--

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That was amazing.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's what
made me want to join Google.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.210
I worked for one of our
competitors at the time,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.504
and I was invited to
the Google I/O Extended.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:16.920
And I watched the keynote and
I watched Larry take the mic

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.300
and, like, talk as he did.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.720
But then the more he talked,
the more awesome it became.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.579
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It was amazing.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.910
LAURENCE MORONEY: And
Twitter fell silent,

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.480
and then Twitter just
went, this guy's awesome.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.938
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It was, like,
the most earnest conversation

00:04:26.938 --> 00:04:29.532
with a CEO in the tech industry
that I think I've ever seen.

00:04:29.532 --> 00:04:30.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.830
LAURENCE MORONEY: I
watched that and I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.530
said, I want to join this
company, and here I am.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Here you are.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.280
OK, that's your number one.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.946
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
Larry's number one.

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:39.220
So number two, oh,
I think Vint Cerf.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.650
I'd love to have Vint on.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.332
So Vint once keynoted
at a conference in Korea

00:04:43.332 --> 00:04:45.790
that I was a speaker at, so I
got to share a stage with him

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.830
for about five minutes.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: He's amazing.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.580
LAURENCE MORONEY:
He's incredible.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.860
And the work that he has
done and he continues to do

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.526
is really-- it's
because of that that we

00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:53.730
can do what we do today.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.880
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.290
LAURENCE MORONEY: And I
would love to have Vint.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.100
And Vint actually made a
comment about a previous show

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.433
that he really loved the format.

00:04:58.433 --> 00:05:01.060
The third one I'm going
to leave to the viewers

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.390
instead of picking it myself.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.265
LAURENCE MORONEY: So
if there's-- you know,

00:05:03.265 --> 00:05:06.670
we actually did a thing before
where we asked viewers to say,

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.490
who would you like
to have us interview,

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.660
and two names came up.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.855
One of them was Larry, and the
other one was Colt McAnlis.

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:14.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And you got Colt?

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.730
LAURENCE MORONEY:
We got Colt, yeah.

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.560
And Colt was being
Colt. He kind of-- we

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.480
swapped seats for the show.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: As he does.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: And we
changed shirts in the show,

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:21.730
and we just goofed around.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.896
That was a whole lot of fun.

00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:24.520
So thanks for
suggesting him, folks,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.110
but we'd love you to suggest
other Googlers that you'd

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.830
love to hear from, or
other technologies.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.480
You may not know the
Googler behind it,

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.479
but if you're interested
in a Google technology,

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.450
we'll find the Googler
behind it and we'll

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.596
chat with him over coffee.

00:05:35.596 --> 00:05:37.220
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
There's a huge playlist

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.900
talking with lots of Googlers
on "Coffee with a Googler"

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.952
on the Google Developer's
YouTube channel.

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:42.660
Please subscribe.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.890
Don't miss a single episode.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.870
And you've got five new
episodes coming out.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.930
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yeah.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.320
TIMOTHY JORDAN: In fact, I
think by the time this airs

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.090
two will already be out--

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.560
LAURENCE MORONEY: Two of
them will already be out.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.020
TIMOTHY JORDAN: --and
three more are coming.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.780
LAURENCE MORONEY: So yeah, we
shot some today on Identity.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.426
So we had a couple of episodes
on the Google Identity

00:05:54.426 --> 00:05:56.800
platform, including things
like Smart Lock for passwords.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.621
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I love Identity

00:05:58.621 --> 00:06:00.110
and I love Identity
technologies.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.390
As a developer, good
Identity APIs possibly

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.761
have the biggest
impact of any API,

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:07.510
because the amount of
work that developers

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.300
will have to do to build
good Identity can be crazy.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.920
So if someone like Google can
provide good Identity APIs,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.850
and we do, it really makes
developers' lives a lot easier.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.355
So I'm a real geek
for that stuff.

00:06:17.355 --> 00:06:18.980
So we had a couple
of episodes of that.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.537
We had an awesome episode
on Google Now on Tap.

00:06:22.537 --> 00:06:24.620
If you're not familiar
with it, watch the episode.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.380
It's really cool.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.954
And the PM of that, and her
name is actually Paige Rankin,

00:06:27.954 --> 00:06:28.870
which, I mean, she's--

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's perfect.

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.553
LAURENCE MORONEY: She was
born to work for Google.

00:06:31.553 --> 00:06:34.220
And she was a fabulous guest,
and she did some great demos.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.455
And I learned a lot
about Google Now on Tap,

00:06:36.455 --> 00:06:38.080
And particularly as
a developer, if you

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.290
want to take advantage of
this technology, how easy

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.540
it is for you to
do so on your apps.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:44.460
LAURENCE MORONEY: Lots of great
episodes and more on the way.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.210
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Thank you, Laurence.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.510
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Thank you, Timothy.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And that's
it for our show today.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.060
Please remember to
subscribe to the channel

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.500
so you don't miss
a single episode

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.460
of "Coffee with a Googler"
or "The Developer Show."

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.400
I'd like to thank my
producers, my parents,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.727
my lovely girlfriend, and
of course you, our fans.

00:06:58.727 --> 00:07:00.560
Without you, none of
this would be possible.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.350
I'm Timothy Jordan, and
I'll see you next week.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.000
