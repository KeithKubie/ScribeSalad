00:00:00.498 --> 00:00:02.147
- [Narrator] Nth partial
sum of the series,

00:00:02.147 --> 00:00:04.027
we're going from one
to infinity, summing it

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:05.869
a sub n is given by.

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:07.748
And they tell us of the formula

00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:09.197
for some of the first n terms.

00:00:09.197 --> 00:00:12.133
And they say write a rule for what

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:15.726
the actual Nth term is going to be.

00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:17.322
Now to help us with this, let me just

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:19.382
create a little visualization here.

00:00:19.382 --> 00:00:23.193
So if I have a sub one
plus, plus a sub two,

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:26.110
plus a sub three, and I keep adding

00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:30.131
all the way to a sub n minus one plus

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:32.375
a sub n.

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:35.923
This whole thing, this whole thing that

00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:38.060
I just wrote out.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.979
That is s sub n.

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:43.157
This whole thing is s, let me

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.324
this whole thing is sub n,

00:00:46.237 --> 00:00:48.603
which is equal to n plus one,

00:00:48.603 --> 00:00:49.853
over n plus 10.

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:52.761
Now if I wanna figure out a sub n,

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.835
which is the goal of this exercise,

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:56.906
well I could subtract out the sum of the

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:59.688
first n minus one terms.

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:02.105
So I could subtract out this.

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:04.979
So that is s,

00:01:06.717 --> 00:01:08.884
that is s sub n minus one,

00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:11.711
and what would that be equal to.

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:13.230
Well wherever we see
an n, we'd replace with

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.314
an n minus one.

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:17.091
So it'd be n minus one plus one over

00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:20.424
n minus one plus 10, which is equal to n

00:01:22.931 --> 00:01:24.348
over n plus nine.

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.563
So if you subtract the red
stuff from the blue stuff,

00:01:28.563 --> 00:01:30.311
all that you're gonna be
left with is the thing

00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:31.421
that we're gonna solve for.

00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:33.417
You're gonna be left with a sub n.

00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:37.584
So we could write down a
sub n is equal to s sub n,

00:01:38.863 --> 00:01:42.446
is equal to s sub n
minus s sub n minus one

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:46.043
S sub n minus one.

00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:49.960
Or we could write, that
is equal to this stuff.

00:01:50.984 --> 00:01:54.317
So this is the n plus one over n plus 10

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.896
minus, minus n over n plus nine.

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:05.175
And this by itself, this
is a rule for a sub n.

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:06.583
But we could combine these terms,

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:08.055
add these two fractions together.

00:02:08.055 --> 00:02:09.196
And this is actually going to be the case

00:02:09.196 --> 00:02:10.979
for n greater than one.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.809
For n equals one, s
sub one is going to be,

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:17.184
well you can just, a sub
one is going to be equal

00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:18.600
to s sub one.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.908
But then for any other
n, we could use this

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:21.971
right over here.

00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:24.152
And if we want to
simplify this, well we can

00:02:24.152 --> 00:02:25.927
add these two fractions.

00:02:25.927 --> 00:02:27.667
We can add these two fractions by having

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.174
a common denominator.

00:02:29.174 --> 00:02:30.146
So let's see, if we multiply the

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:32.093
numerator and denominator
here times n plus nine,

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:33.760
we are going to get,

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.822
this is equal to n plus
one times n plus nine,

00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:43.164
over n plus 10 times n plus nine.

00:02:46.334 --> 00:02:49.398
And from that, we are going to subtract.

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:50.779
Let's multiply the
numerator and denominator

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.671
here by n plus 10.

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:55.088
So we have n times n plus 10,

00:02:56.297 --> 00:02:59.047
over n plus nine times n plus 10.

00:03:01.412 --> 00:03:03.745
N plus nine times n plus 10.

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:07.423
And what does that give us?

00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:10.095
So, if we simplify up
here, we're gonna have,

00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:14.262
this is n squared plus 10
n plus nine, that's that.

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:20.884
And then this right over
here this is n squared

00:03:20.884 --> 00:03:23.634
plus 10 n, within that red color.

00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:29.732
So this is n squared plus 10 n

00:03:31.536 --> 00:03:33.199
and remember we're gonna subtract this.

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.105
And so, and we are close
to deserving a drum roll,

00:03:36.105 --> 00:03:39.779
a sub n is going to be
equal to our denominator

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.696
right over here is n plus
nine times n plus 10.

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:48.004
And we're gonna subtract the
red stuff from the blue stuff.

00:03:48.004 --> 00:03:50.188
So you subtract an n
squared from an n squared

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.594
and those cancel out.

00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:54.111
Subtract a 10 n from a
10 n, those cancel out.

00:03:54.111 --> 00:03:56.772
And you're just left with that blue nine.

00:03:56.772 --> 00:03:58.587
So there you have it, we've expressed,

00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:02.754
we've written a rule for a
sub n, for n greater than one.
