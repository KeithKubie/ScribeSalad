1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,750
Hey, what's, [inaudible] Jesus. Hey,
what's going on? The fuck was that?

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,760
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the
Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday,

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,350
Monday morning podcast.
And

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,580
I'm just checking in on you.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,130
I'm just checking in on you.
So I just woke up.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,410
I had a frog in my throat. Oh, Billy.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,480
No Vice William without 12 days in here.

8
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,220
No booze, no cigars. Although you wouldn't
know what that frog, Ej said my throat.

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,470
No, nothing. Ah, he's
being a foe. Billy Angel.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,720
I'm going to open for Chris Angel
out there and a fucking Vegas.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm going to sit there and just wag
my finger at everybody in the crowd.

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,010
Tell them how they live in a life of vice.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:58,980
I got to tell you people
when you find Christ, um,

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,900
I got into the,
the mornings.

15
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,650
The mornings are the best when you lived
a vice free life the night before you

16
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:11,730
wake up. It's amazing the birds
to sing it a little louder.

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,360
There's a few more nooks and crannies
in your fucking English muffin.

18
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,700
She'd sit there watching the
melted into it.

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,160
Um, yeah, I you don't have
to. Mornings are great.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,230
I am bored out of my fucking mind
at night out of my mind. Bored.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,080
Um, anyways, let's, uh,
let's put, you know,

22
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:40,650
here's one for sobriety. Now, one of
those fucking poor bastards at Aa.

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,400
Just sit there, Chow and donuts and
smoking cigarettes. They need something.

24
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,840
They got, they're trying to
get a buzz, nicotine, sugar,

25
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,830
something to break up
the fucking monotony.

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,220
Yeah, let me gay. Yeah.

27
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,990
Fucking tell glazed the
fucking jelly doughnut,

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,240
just shoving it down their pile.
Um,

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,350
that's the worst thing about opening
Pandora's box because once you fucking do

30
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,690
that,
then uh,

31
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,080
you just know how much fun
you could be having. You know,

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,370
he's just sitting around playing
fan tan or something like that,

33
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,560
drinking a Goddamn Arnold Palmer.
You know, I remember one time

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,360
I was hanging out with this guy,
I'm not gonna name the name of the person,

35
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,380
but he was hanging out with
this super fucking legendary,

36
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:38,970
famous fucking rockstar that
dude had never got married,

37
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:43,500
never had any kids or whatever. And I
remember hanging out with that guy and he,

38
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,180
and he could not,
it was all these beautiful women around.

39
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:49,530
He was barely looking at him.

40
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,570
He could not have been more bored because
he had gone so far down that fucking

41
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,500
road.
Like what?

42
00:02:55,501 --> 00:03:00,501
Literally what it took at that point to
even keep the pilot light going in his

43
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:06,370
fucking eyes. I'm not going
to sit here with this fucking,

44
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,030
hang on a second.
Sorry.

45
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,050
I had to clear my throat there. I want
to fuck did I hit stop instead of pause.

46
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,920
Now I'm going to edit those two
things together. You know what it is.

47
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:20,410
It's when you're living as clean as I am,

48
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:25,411
the toxins through years of abuse start
to come to the surface and your body is

49
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,000
reading them.
Cleansing them.

50
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,173
Yeah.

51
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,640
Um, anyways, yes to this
guy. Well, he was just like,

52
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,910
there wasn't any woman in there
that could turn his fucking head.

53
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,120
There wasn't a joke that could make
them smile. This guy just, he just,

54
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:47,200
he went too far.
I went too far down the hall.

55
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,860
He got pulled out and now he's just
sitting there just fucking bored.

56
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,590
Yeah.

57
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,930
You know, I mean I had
a fucking, you know,

58
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,080
once you participate in like an orgy
and you're the only male participant,

59
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,560
I just don't understand like why,
you know,

60
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,340
what the fuck does that guy do?
Hey,

61
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:11,660
you want to go to Brunch?

62
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,420
Yeah.

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,110
You know, hey, let's go, uh,
let's go to this. Go to a game.

64
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,280
Let's go to this arena that you
sold out and had an orgy and,

65
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,700
and let's go watch other people fucking
chase a puck. You want to go do that?

66
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,200
There's like nothing you could
suggest to this guy. He'd have to,

67
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,980
you know that that guy like his next
fucking move to get his adrenaline going

68
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:39,390
would probably be do that red bull jump.
We,

69
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,280
you just falling from outer space.

70
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,210
Um, anyways. I don't know what the
fuck I'm talking about, but that said,

71
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,930
that's what you expect.
So what you expect at this one,

72
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:58,250
I expect out of this podcast
and that's what's wrong with America.

73
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:03,370
Americans podcasting with absolutely
no expectations on how well the show's

74
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,460
going to go. All right, let's talk.
Let's Talk Yankees Red Sox. Oh,

75
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,600
it's heating up again.

76
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:12,490
Okay.

77
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,380
The Red Sox raped the keys 14
to one on Monday or whatever.

78
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,110
Was it Monday? I'm sorry.
Tuesday. All right.

79
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,620
Remember I remember when
I was a kid to be like,

80
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:27,130
they should save these runs for tomorrow.
Like you can save runs.

81
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,020
And then yesterday our stat and pitch
your price, he got hurt or something.

82
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:37,180
So our pitcher was shit yesterday
and the Yankees ended up winning, uh,

83
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,170
which is fine. Um, there's
like 9 million games left,

84
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:46,640
but I think it was really stupid of the
red sox to get into a fight with them.

85
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,550
That fight was, was good for the Yankees
because they're not as good at team.

86
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,300
They got bats, but they
don't have pitching. And
pitching is always gonna win.

87
00:05:56,301 --> 00:06:00,260
Come October. You don't need to
get involved in that stupid shit.

88
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,370
And um, and we did. So now they have,

89
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,640
now they're all fucking loads.
They're all fucking excited.

90
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,180
You don't do that. You know, the guy
wants to slide like that. I mean,

91
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:21,360
up until last year, that
was legal. Who gives a shit?

92
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,350
Who gives a shit to strike the guy out,

93
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,100
have them sit down with this
big fucking stupid face.

94
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,840
I hate baseball players in this stupid
fighting where everybody comes out and

95
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:37,740
piles on each other and uh,
nobody does the A,

96
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:40,920
you're lucky you're holding me back
better than fucking baseball players.

97
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,050
Maybe basketball players, I
don't know. That's stupid.

98
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:49,350
After the fight and there's like two
guys holding you back and then you still

99
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:53,160
have to do that stupid charge, you
know, you're not going to get there.

100
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,043
It's over

101
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,030
button your shirt and go to the showers.
Um,

102
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,620
but anyways, when we were getting
killed and we still liked,

103
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:06,750
it was almost like the Yankees
couldn't score enough runs.

104
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,820
So we have bats and we have pitched you,
we're in a great position.

105
00:07:09,821 --> 00:07:13,000
Why would we get involved
in that Tom Foolery?

106
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,610
I mean this is sober built talking.

107
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,240
Yeah.

108
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,770
Oh,
you know,

109
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,300
it's so stupid is in the middle of the
fight that you just see this guy going.

110
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,100
Yeah, yeah. Kid Shot Red Sox Fan.

111
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,940
Can we retire that stupid shit already.
It's like,

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,940
it's, it's like fucking men
sharing candidate level.

113
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,990
Like the second anything happens,
you've got to start chanting that. Okay.

114
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,790
Um, not that Yankee fans are
innocent. That stupid 19, 18 forever.

115
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,860
And then when they,
the one that champ was over,

116
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:48,120
then they switched it to a Boston saw,

117
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,540
which is the worst shit
ever. Um, I don't know.

118
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,040
There's so much of it that it just makes
me want to hit mute. The sweet Caroline,

119
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,170
the Yankees suck chant,
all of that stuff.

120
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,200
It just says to me that people do not
think for themselves and that fucking mob

121
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:12,050
mentality,
I don't like the Yankees,

122
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:15,800
but we beat them.
The movie is over.

123
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,930
It's over bro. Credits.
We won the world series.

124
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,550
They are now reduced to go at, Hey,
remember what we did last century.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,540
Remember that?

126
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,940
I mean,
it's what they've been reduced to.

127
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:41,300
Why would you like make them actually
feel that they hold some sort of position

128
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,680
by continuing to chant?
Yankees suck. They don't chuck,

129
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,580
they're a good fucking team and I love
the way that they've built from their

130
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:54,410
farm team and then added that big
free agent from Miami or Florida,

131
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,830
her fucking, uh, Tuscaloosa, whatever
the fuck they call themselves now.

132
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,393
MMM.

133
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,010
Opiate Showbie the Okeechobee
Marlin's. Um, I like what they've done.

134
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,671
They don't suck.

135
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:12,650
And I think that Aaron Boone is going
to be a great manager and I look forward

136
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:15,080
to the competition between both teams

137
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:22,160
and who gives a fuck? Either we win
or they win or somebody else wins.

138
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,660
Who gives a shit?
Just enjoy the fucking game.

139
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,620
Don't go there and be a fucking mouth
breather. And for the love of God,

140
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,050
will you sit down when they
play that stupid sweet Caroline?

141
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:36,340
How many fucking times can you do it
by

142
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,550
the fucking Yankee fence at this
cigarette? Fucking why MCA. I,

143
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:46,440
you know what? I want to, I should,
I shouldn't go this heart. You know,

144
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,480
it's for the kids. It's tradition.
It's what brings people together.

145
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,020
I don't know. I thought the Yankees did
pretty good before they had this thing,

146
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:56,330
that fucking song during
the seventh inning.

147
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,360
And this stupid grounds crew doing
the little twirly twirl. Oh my God,

148
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,920
I'm such a continent. Um, anyways,

149
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,750
I'm sure Dan Shaughnessy is very excited
that it's heated up again and you can

150
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:15,830
actually write about the sport that he
knows about and ignore the Bruins playoff

151
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:16,664
run.

152
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,770
Why do I always pick on Dan Shaughnessy?
I don't hate that guy.

153
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I just like picking on him because I
will never forgive that fucking guy for

154
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,820
after 2004 when we won and then 2005,
we were in first place in September.

155
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,000
We got a bunch of injuries
which clearly affected the team.

156
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,080
And then the $200 million Yankees I
believe ended up coming in passing us.

157
00:10:39,081 --> 00:10:43,010
And Shaughnessy is like, is the
curse back. I was like right there.

158
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,350
You're not a red sox fan.
You're just not.

159
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,630
You're a guy making money off of misery.
Um,

160
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,740
you're your own little corporation,
you know,

161
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,240
profiting off of war in a sports sense.
Jesus bill, you went big there. Yes,

162
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:02,130
I did. And I'll do it again. Anyways,

163
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,500
the Bruins playoff run starts tonight
and I have a lot of nerve given Shaun to

164
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,270
see shit considering I may be
watched four games this year. Um,

165
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,080
now that I got the little one and uh,

166
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,430
we're playing the Toronto Maple leafs

167
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,610
and those poor bastards are going to
have to fucking endure the highlight reel

168
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:25,480
of what happened the last time we played
them and just know that I was at that

169
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:30,070
fucking game. Um, I
actually know something.

170
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,490
It's funny, I feel like maple
leaf fans hate the Bruins.

171
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,580
Um, and uh, I don't hate the May
police. I actually liked the maple leaf.

172
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,530
I hate the Canadians.
That's it.

173
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,810
In a couple of knee breakers on
the penguins. Other than that,

174
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,140
and not even at the penguins have knee
breakers insists that they then turn

175
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:53,080
around and complain, but somebody
gets a little rough on the other team.

176
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,310
They were attacking Sydney.

177
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,960
They bug me. Um, that's it. Other than
that, I don't have a problem with anybody.

178
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:08,800
I'm looking forward to wonderful.
A seven game series.

179
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,030
We'll see how it goes, but uh, it
comes on at four o'clock. Here I am.

180
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:16,870
I'm balancing my entire fucking schedule.
Is that it?

181
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,820
Is that I always said my
entire fucking schedule is, uh,

182
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,740
is going to be based around that. My
daughter takes a nap from three to five,

183
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,800
so I figure I'll get to watch
the first period and then,

184
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,830
um, and then I'll probably
be fucked. Whose kid? No. Um,

185
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,860
I'm actually flying to the Rio tomorrow.

186
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,210
I'm flying out to Charlotte
for the rough and rowdy fight.

187
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,640
I'm going to be commentating,

188
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,120
watching regular people's
Americans on Americans fighting.

189
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,640
There's going to be over 40 fights and
I'm feeling that this is going to be like

190
00:12:57,641 --> 00:13:01,060
when I did the Joe Rogan
Doug Stan Hope, uh,

191
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,400
end of the universe
podcasts on election night.

192
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,090
That's the vibe that I feel
like it's going to be going on.

193
00:13:07,091 --> 00:13:08,770
So I'm just going to be,

194
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:12,220
I'm trying to get in as
many jokes as I can't.

195
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,020
It's already entertaining while getting
out of the way of the action. Um,

196
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,500
I'd never done any shit like this.
I remember when I was a kid,

197
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,630
my mother thought I should
be a sports commentator.

198
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,130
I don't think she pictured me doing,
starting my career in an event like this,

199
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,430
but I'm looking forward to
it. I really am. And uh,

200
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,340
it's a $15 paper view unless
you wait till the day of.

201
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:40,750
So today's the last day we
can get a flight 1599. After
that it goes up to 1999.

202
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:43,990
But if you're a college kid,
you know, a couple of two,

203
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,870
three your fence throwing like
five and a half bucks each.

204
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,610
Get yourself a Domino's pizza
and whatever else you want to do

205
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,260
as Mike goal liquid,
say an adult beverage and uh,

206
00:13:57,261 --> 00:14:00,910
enjoy the fights. Um, anyways,

207
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,820
plowing ahead here. Uh,
I've started my workout,

208
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:07,690
my serious,

209
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:12,520
my theories workout regimen to somehow
stave off the fact that I'm turning 50

210
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:15,910
and fucking June the big photo.
But Ba,

211
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,770
ba Ba ba Ba,

212
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:21,880
you fucking fucking old you fucking balls.

213
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:26,020
Hey Dan to the,
um,

214
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,910
I actually feel fortunate to be,

215
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:31,630
to have made it this long considered
has got a bunch of my friends did not.

216
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,200
And then also the direction
we seem to be going here.

217
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,490
Why are we bombing Syria?
Why are we going to do this?

218
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:45,730
How much further into this fucking
Middle East shit are we going to go?

219
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:51,310
I don't understand why France, US, Russia,

220
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,760
all of these fucking people.

221
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:56,780
Why the fuck do we keep
intervening over there?

222
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,373
You know what I mean?

223
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,450
People have been fighting with each other
forever and then we're going to come

224
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:08,770
in, hey, settle down. Settle down.
Give us the oil. Settle down.

225
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,410
You shouldn't do that to what another
give us the oil stopped doing that.

226
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,660
Frances President Emmanuel Macron says
he has proof that the Syrian government

227
00:15:22,241 --> 00:15:26,380
attack the town of Doma
with chemical weapons.

228
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:31,381
Last weekend he said he would decide
in due course whether to respond with

229
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,060
airstrikes. Um, I don't
know how these guys,

230
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,220
world leaders do that
shit. It's like, you know,

231
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:40,830
you're gonna respond with the airstrikes
and they're not all going to land on

232
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:44,460
the people that did it. And then you
have to go to bed that night going like,

233
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:49,070
well, I think most of them landed on
the people that were guilty. You know,

234
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,300
the others landed in a food court.
I think that's why they age. Um,

235
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,670
although I think Donald Trump is going
to age wonderfully during his presidency

236
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:03,090
because I don't think he
really understands the
ramifications of what the fuck

237
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:06,570
it is that he's saying or doing.
Um,

238
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,500
who fucked tweets about when a country's
going to strike another countries and

239
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:12,150
that's supposed to kind of be a secret

240
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,530
or the way he's trying to do the
three card Monte. It could be now.

241
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:19,500
It could be not at all or maybe later.

242
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,150
You know, it's funny, there's probably
Syrian people actually looking at his,

243
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,610
at his tweets,

244
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,690
you know, like, uh,

245
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,390
like looking at it like, like
they found clues. I'm sorry,

246
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:41,610
I just got this fucking email.

247
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,430
These goddamn fucking state of Wisconsin
just hit me with this huge goddamn tax

248
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:48,280
bill at. It's like, how the fuck do I
owe you guys all that God their money.

249
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,890
Yeah, I know. I know why they hit me
with that shit. I know why. I know why.

250
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,470
Because we're spending money in this
country in a bunch of other shit.

251
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:01,170
So then I come down there and
they fucking pull the pants down.

252
00:17:01,171 --> 00:17:03,930
They give Oh freckles a good spank.
And before I leave the state.

253
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,821
That's like a new thing.

254
00:17:05,821 --> 00:17:10,230
All of these scams do you
know in Pittsburgh they had
an entertainment tax for

255
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:13,080
awhile.
If you are an entertainer,

256
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,990
you spun plates and
you went to Pittsburgh,

257
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:20,700
they taxed you for entertaining people.
Literally doing your job.

258
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,770
When I was in Saint Louis one time I was
in a hotel and I actually took the time

259
00:17:26,771 --> 00:17:28,330
to look at the bill and this,

260
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:32,350
the city of Saint Louis or the
state of Missouri charged me.

261
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,380
Uh, what the fuck did they call it? A,

262
00:17:35,381 --> 00:17:38,890
an occupation tax on the room.

263
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,590
They tax me for occupying the room.
They just shaking like fucking third 20,

264
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:48,040
30 bucks out of your pocket.
We'll take that.

265
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,140
Thank you for coming here. Did you
get a chance to visit the fucking Oh,

266
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,920
um, I don't know. I'll tell you.

267
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,380
It's all the God damn scam.
What am I gonna do?

268
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,000
Am I going to take on a whole fucking
state? Michael Moore would do it.

269
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:12,990
Um, all right. The penguins, Jesus Christ.

270
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,700
What they went 18 did nothing
against the fucking fly is, um,

271
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,370
I didn't get to watch any
of the hockey last night.

272
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:24,360
I was editing season
three of f is for family.

273
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,400
Um, I think, I'm just going
to tell you right now,

274
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,050
and I can say this with total confidence.

275
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:33,630
This is without a doubt our best season.
It's a,

276
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,760
it's a noticeable jump between
the first and second seasons.

277
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,440
Um, and I can't wait for you guys
to see it, but it's animation.

278
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,600
So I'm be like Donald Trump.

279
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,010
You could be seeing these
episodes soon or maybe later.

280
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,330
Possibly not at all.
Or maybe they're on right now.

281
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,070
She got a giant fucking to pay.
Like he doesn't have to pay.

282
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,520
I think he did a comb over and then he
did some hair plugs and they didn't work.

283
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:05,040
But now the hair plugs of better
and I think maybe they worked,

284
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,810
but then he just has to kind of commit
to the comb over.

285
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,970
You know, I actually think
he kind of has a nice air,

286
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,740
you know, the way he gets died, all
golden when it goes orange, it's bad.

287
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,790
Bonnie is like the golden sort
of fucking a stray cats haircut.

288
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,140
You know, we're going to bomb this town
bomb. It is sad. I think it's a, uh,

289
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,700
I think it's a good look.
I could see him with like an upright bass.

290
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,360
I want to get one of those fucking, what'd
you guys do if somehow I got fucking,

291
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,470
oh, I actually cave and I get
fucking hair plugs, right?

292
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:53,030
And I add a giant red stray cats
fucking hairdo out of nowhere.

293
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,710
No, not out of nowhere. You would,

294
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,950
you would notice it like
pictures of me after shows going,

295
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:01,140
what's going on with
the top of bird's head.

296
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,740
And I refuse to like when
someone's slowly transitioning,

297
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,100
there's that thing of like, wow,
that's an interesting outfit.

298
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:11,160
And then people started, are you trend?
And then finally they'd say, yeah,

299
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:13,740
you know what I am.
I would,

300
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,950
I would do what Bruce Jenner
did except to my hair.

301
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,210
All right,
but what if I never fucking addressed it?

302
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:26,520
What if I never went on and talked
to Diane Store Sawyer? You know,

303
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,320
and just sat there going,
I was sorry I was story.

304
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,830
What if I never did that and refused
to ever address my new coauthor fucking

305
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:43,440
here and I tried to just, I
just, I erased all my podcast.

306
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,640
Any fucking evidence of me ever admitting
that I went bald and I would just say

307
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:50,720
that I was just refused to,
you know,

308
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,240
like Turkey when they refuse to
see. Yeah, that never happened.

309
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,450
If you say it happened,
you go into jail.

310
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,143
Okay.

311
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,890
How much would I be getting heckled
if I came out with a fucking ric flair

312
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:06,724
haircut?

313
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:14,620
Oh fuck. You know something
I was talking about Moto GP

314
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,520
and the, uh, what was it?
The Art Argentina Grand
Prix. Is that where it was?

315
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,470
What a fucking race that was.
I don't even, I don't even,

316
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,510
I haven't watched racing enough to
even understand what the fuck happened.

317
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,920
And I was dealing with my kids and all
of a sudden the race starts and there was

318
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:34,850
like one person in the front row and
nobody in like 30 rows back or something

319
00:21:34,851 --> 00:21:36,740
like that.
And then a bunch of people in the back,

320
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,870
Mark Marquez had stalled this bike.

321
00:21:38,871 --> 00:21:43,190
So according to the rules that you had
to leave and go restart it or something.

322
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:47,000
And he was driving around in circles,
refusing to fucking leave.

323
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,050
Um, so then he ended up, those race starts

324
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,040
okay.

325
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,810
And he gets penalized or
penalized depending on what
part of the country you're

326
00:21:56,811 --> 00:21:57,021
from.

327
00:21:57,021 --> 00:22:02,021
He got penal lies and he goes to the back
of the race and this fucking guy just

328
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,770
row. And he was like, I swear to God,

329
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:10,130
he was like 40 seconds ahead of everybody
who's going to win the race going away.

330
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,330
It was one of those tracks where it was,
uh,

331
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,200
it was still wet or whatever and he was
just riding way faster than everybody

332
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:22,640
else. I don't know how. And uh,
they said, hey buddy, buddy,

333
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,000
you a, you've got to go to the
back of it. This is so stupid.

334
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:27,620
I didn't want him talking about you
got to go to the back of the race.

335
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:30,830
So they send them all the way to the back,
goes to the pits first,

336
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,100
and then they send them to the back of
the race because he fucking ran over this

337
00:22:34,101 --> 00:22:34,934
guy.

338
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,950
You know, he basically, yeah,

339
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,470
went to go pass somebody who's,
he's bumping them out of the way,

340
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:42,620
like they're in cars except around
motorcycles. And he would wave like,

341
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:43,380
sorry about that,

342
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,920
that and continue on. And
they're like, hey buddy,

343
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,110
you got to go to the back of the
fucking race, right. The first time.

344
00:22:49,111 --> 00:22:53,280
I think today they, he bumped
into somebody that made
them sit there in the pits.

345
00:22:53,281 --> 00:22:55,110
I don't remember. They,
they, they, they, they

346
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,950
penalizes guy so many fucking times.
Long story short,

347
00:22:57,951 --> 00:22:59,600
he went from first place
all the way to last.

348
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,340
So now he's blowing by everybody
and he gets up to Valentino Rossi,

349
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,500
who's basically the Wayne Gretzky,

350
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,083
uh,

351
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,680
the Lewis Hamilton to fucking person
you're not supposed to touch a fuck with.

352
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,520
And he's trying to get around them and
Valentino Rossi. He's like, fuck you.

353
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,460
You're not getting around
me. And, uh, rather than,

354
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,270
than waiting for a straight away,
he tried to pass him on a turn.

355
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:29,570
Eddie just fucking slammed into him and
Valentino got pushed to the outside and

356
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:34,290
he had control the bike, but then he went
on the grass and he wiped out the fee,

357
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,510
uh, fell off his bike and Marquez turns
around waves like, sorry, pop that right.

358
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,610
Valentino gets up, he's Italian, he
goes up on blah blah, blah blah. Right.

359
00:23:44,611 --> 00:23:48,650
And then he picks his bike up. Now he's
ride, no, all the Valentino Rossi fins.

360
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,710
Like what the fuck is with this guy?
Mark?

361
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,960
Mark has gets penalized again I believe.

362
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,230
And uh,
so at the end of the fucking race,

363
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,760
Marquez walks down with somebody
else to Valentino's a pit area,

364
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:08,600
whatever they call it, the pageant, I
forget what they call it because of the p.

365
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,070
And Valentina is like, oh my God,
I am like, so not talking to you,

366
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,670
some of the mechanic or the chief
fucking steward stewardess down there or

367
00:24:17,671 --> 00:24:21,260
something. He's yelling at Marquez
and Marquez ends up walking away.

368
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,820
And then Valentino Rossi said he wasn't
man enough to come down by himself.

369
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:28,730
He came down with somebody else,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

370
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,150
And I'm sitting there agreeing with
Valentino Rossi and then all of a sudden

371
00:24:32,151 --> 00:24:34,940
everybody starts sending all these
fucking highlights from like three years

372
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:39,941
earlier when Rossi basically donkey kick
to Mark Marquez off his fucking bike or

373
00:24:40,611 --> 00:24:45,530
out of the goddamn race or something
like that. So it's, it just seemed like,

374
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,520
um, Lewis Hamilton behavior where
it's like, it's okay if I do it,

375
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,151
but if you do it,

376
00:24:50,151 --> 00:24:52,850
you're a fucking asshole and now I'm
going to have a hissy fit about it.

377
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,010
So I think I like Mark Marquez
better. You know, I respect Rossi.

378
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,540
You know the little I know about the
sport being the legend that he is a,

379
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,310
but I like Marquez. Fuck it. If he
did that two years earlier, yeah,

380
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:08,150
pass them on to turn,

381
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,270
knock him off his bike and give
them a wave. Who gives a shit?

382
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:16,250
I'm telling you guys, you
miss it out or this, this,

383
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:18,800
all of this took place in like 25 laps.

384
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,640
You can watch your race in like 40
minutes and you can watch these,

385
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:27,170
these unbelievable,
this unbelievable fucking sport.

386
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:30,930
I can't even tell you how
sold I am on motor GP. Um,

387
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,020
just to let you know,

388
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,640
there's moto GP two and three and they're
all going to get recorded and there's

389
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:41,540
going to be like five recordings of
them and there's a chance your, your,

390
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,620
your recorder's going to shut off,
which is what would have happened to me.

391
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:47,180
I would have missed the
end of the fucking race.

392
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:51,020
But fortunately I got to watch it live.
Um,

393
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,010
I don't understand. Trying to take one
of those races is practically impossible,

394
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,010
so I have to make sure I don't,
I don't lose the one here.

395
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:01,130
The Motogp of the Americas
is what they call it.

396
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,630
Why don't they say they say Argentina?
You know,

397
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,400
they say they say Italy,
why can't we say USA?

398
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,970
You know, what are we embarrassed? The
Americas? Where is it? Canada, Mexico,

399
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,610
Falkland Islands. Um,
anyways, check it out. If,

400
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,970
if you get a chance, um, you know,

401
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:28,780
usually this is the time when I actually
do a read or something and it's just I

402
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:31,690
don't have any advertising,
you know what I mean?

403
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,750
I'm like that real housewife on the real
housewives that just trashes too many

404
00:26:37,751 --> 00:26:41,130
fucking people and then the,
you know,

405
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,630
just doesn't have any friends anymore.
Um,

406
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,680
that's where the advertising
is slowly going okay.

407
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,300
On this podcast and

408
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,690
yeah,

409
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,020
I am, now that I've cleaned
up my act as far as my,

410
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,290
you know,
offstage behavior,

411
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,550
I am now going to clean up this
podcast in an effort to try to get my

412
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:05,810
advertising back.

413
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,300
Yeah.

414
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,900
I am not going to have any
sort of opinions. Okay.

415
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,180
Just stop right now and just talk about
how amazing and strong women are and how

416
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,660
whatever,
look at your,

417
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:26,070
your girlfriend or wife right now and
just look at whatever she's doing and just

418
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:31,071
realize how strong she is and really
just take time in your day to understand

419
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,990
how amazing women are

420
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,660
and how right they are and how
they do nothing wrong whatsoever,

421
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,000
ever.
And if they do something wrong,

422
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:50,120
just know that it's because
of something that you did.

423
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,040
I want everybody to close their eyes

424
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,060
and talk to Jesus right now.

425
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,670
Should I go that far? No, I
think that'd be too limiting.

426
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,770
I think if I just say
positive things about women.

427
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,310
Yeah,

428
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:16,480
I can't do this.
Fucking annoys the shit out of me.

429
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,020
A clutch. Is there anything
more annoying than a clutch?

430
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,960
It goes to my house. I don't have any
pockets. Can you hold all my shit?

431
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,620
Hey, why don't you bring
one of your fucking bags?

432
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,780
Why did you bring a bunch of
one of those recycling bags?

433
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,430
Once you throw that over
your fucking outfit,

434
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,220
maybe you'd be making some
new fashion statement, right?

435
00:28:36,221 --> 00:28:40,780
Like back in the day when women will
wear business suits and fucking sneakers

436
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,010
put on something nice and then have
like a little fucking grocery bag.

437
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,720
You don't stick sticks to
call your shit in there. Yeah.

438
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,370
Giant fucking fucking cell phone.
I already have my cell phone in my pocket.

439
00:28:56,371 --> 00:29:01,080
You want to meet you to radiate fucking
both sides of my scrotum. I mean,

440
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:05,370
not to mention my taint. Do you have any
sort of consideration for me whatsoever?

441
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:07,350
I am.
I just a fucking pack mule,

442
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:09,650
right?

443
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,900
Once you get a smaller phone,
you're gonna walk around with a clutch.

444
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:15,350
I say you go back to a flip phone.
That's what I say.

445
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:20,120
That's my big controversial
fucking take on this Thursday.

446
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,490
Uh, playoff hockey tonight.
Everybody playoff hockey.

447
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:27,440
The third game of the Red Sox Yankees,

448
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,750
90 million games that we're
going to play this year.

449
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:34,340
I got 50 bucks on every game with,

450
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,480
uh, my booking agent and, uh, Paul Versey

451
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,260
and I called the two of the panic
brothers because that first game,

452
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,820
they will literally go in like with
done. I'll they guy was so screwed. Uh,

453
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:49,420
bullpens,

454
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:53,380
admit the Yankees had major problems
and they'd like literally the next game.

455
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:55,770
It's just like, dude, we'll
go to the world series.

456
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,670
And then all of a sudden fucking,
uh,

457
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,190
Hanley Ramirez had set grand slam and
we'd go down from being like fucking down

458
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,920
eight to two and now it's eight to six.
And then it was all of a sudden,

459
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:09,730
it's like if we blow this, the
pulpits, the problem, it's like, dude,

460
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,280
there's this 150 games left.

461
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,300
I can't fucking do this.

462
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,160
But it's so funny to watch the Yankee fans
act like how red sox fans used to act.

463
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,290
Um,
they don't have any swag or anymore.

464
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,250
They're a bunch of fucking
nervous nellies. It's tremendous.

465
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,390
Which is why, once again,
we shouldn't have gotten to
that stupid fight with them.

466
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:37,800
Stupid. Why give them an emotional
point to rally around you.

467
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:39,060
The better Goddamn team.

468
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,720
But it doesn't mean that the better teams
going gonna win. It doesn't mean it.

469
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:46,240
Because when you start getting
involved in that stupid shit,

470
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:49,450
it's fucking baseball.
Nobody's going to get hurt.

471
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,730
Everybody's gonna come running out.

472
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,050
I was wanting to talk to people like
who come running out of the bullpen,

473
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,500
you know? Is there like a knowing
that by the time you get there,

474
00:30:59,501 --> 00:31:04,050
like the fights already been over
for fucking three minutes, you know,

475
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,150
and you can tell the way they come
running out. It's like, what are you,

476
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,750
you're going to just so you're
going to be sitting there,

477
00:31:09,751 --> 00:31:13,530
you're not pitching that day,
right? You're blowing bubbles.

478
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,240
You're coming up with fucking games.

479
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:19,110
You can play to get through the fucking
GAM thinking I'm looking at something

480
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:23,250
green and your buddies
guy art green monster. No.

481
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,470
Uh, their persons, a red sox
Saint Paddy's Day hadn't. Ah,

482
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,950
right. And all of a sudden
you're like, is that a fight?

483
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,730
Is that a fight in the phone?
Fucking rings. Hey Buddy. Yeah.

484
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:36,600
I don't know if you noticed,

485
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:41,340
but there's like a 40 on 40 fight
about a but a football field away.

486
00:31:41,341 --> 00:31:42,960
Why don't you come out to it?
It's good.

487
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,520
It's going to look good
for the team in half.

488
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:48,720
And he gets up without fucking stretching
and you see them jog out there.

489
00:31:48,721 --> 00:31:52,940
They're not going to come running
out there full fucking full speed.

490
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:54,230
They're going to pull a hamstring.

491
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,920
They're going to throw a punch and fuck
up their hand. They can't, their pictures,

492
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,300
their pitches, you, you, you're looking
at a Ken doll. It's, he, it's got it.

493
00:32:03,301 --> 00:32:08,170
There's no fucking, uh, no genitalia.
It's running out with that.

494
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,340
Every once in awhile you see somebody
come running out and that's usually the

495
00:32:12,341 --> 00:32:15,010
fucking warmup. Catchers, that
guy will come flying out of there.

496
00:32:15,011 --> 00:32:18,900
He's got to do something to keep, make
sure he stays on the Goddamn team, right?

497
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,430
That guy only catches the knuckle
baller. He's like, oh Geez,

498
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:25,030
is I get to do something?
Right?

499
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,960
Anyways,
a rough and Rowdy Charlotte,

500
00:32:31,961 --> 00:32:35,020
North Carolina in the house
that ric flair built. Um,

501
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:39,410
I cannot fucking wait and I am actually
going out to buy a little habit dash for

502
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:44,330
the fucking, uh, I'm, I'm going
all out for this thing and uh,

503
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,750
it's going to be a great fucking time.
All right?

504
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,700
It's going to be as great as
every woman on the planet is.

505
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,180
They're just great people.
Every single one of them.

506
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,630
None of them needs to do any
sort of self examination.

507
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:00,950
Anything that they're doing,

508
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,320
it's because of the man that's in their
life or maybe a man who isn't even in

509
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07,010
their life.

510
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,780
Maybe a man that they've never even met
before is the reason for their behavior.

511
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,480
Um, that's it. Everybody have a great
weekend. And Go fuck yourselves.

512
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,500
You con and I will.
I will talk to you on Monday.

513
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:27,620
I look forward to high level competition
tonight between the Boston Red Sox in

514
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:29,520
the New York Yankees.

515
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,060
Alright,
see Ya.

516
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,723
[inaudible]

517
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,693
[inaudible]

518
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:24,250
[inaudible] call you back

519
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:30,870
this way.

520
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,353
[inaudible]

521
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,743
cool.

522
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,650
It's like a boss.
Here's the story,

523
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,973
lady

524
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,320
gotta beat. Marsha. Got To get closer
than a quarter of an inch rubber.

525
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:23,250
That one Greg Brady

526
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,660
striving that fucking caprice classic or
whatever the fuck they had whipping it

527
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:28,620
around the parking lot.

528
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,400
I get closer than an engineer.
Marsha,

529
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:38,820
making fun of how broad can't drive
one of my favorite fucking episodes.

530
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,170
Well,
that's a typical male chauvinist reaction.

531
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,300
You prejudice against women drivers.

532
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:48,150
So I'm now not as long as they
stay off the roads, you prejudice.

533
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,580
It's not prejudice, it's just that
men are naturally superior drivers.

534
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,340
Two favorite episodes was the first half.

535
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,130
Not that Brady Bunch episode.

536
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,940
When Greg Brady was bringing the
fucking hammer down and it was gone.

537
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:04,030
Let me tell you three fucking
stepsister bitches something.

538
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,420
None of you brides know how to drive
and that includes your mother who I'm

539
00:36:07,421 --> 00:36:11,410
banging by the way,
who I'm banging by the way.

540
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:16,630
All right. With her weird ass
haircut, whatever the fuck you know.

541
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:22,690
But um, yeah, I had a date
with them and you know, it was,

542
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,030
I kind of felt like I was,

543
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,180
if you were in school
and I were the teacher,

544
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,270
did anybody ever have that fucking
haircut at other than her? I mean,

545
00:36:32,271 --> 00:36:34,970
that is like,
I don't know what it was.

546
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,480
She took like Mo from the three stooges
haircut and then she put a fucking sort

547
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:44,630
of mullet that she did a little
flip too on the back. Anyways,

548
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:46,940
let's get back to you brought,
so you don't know how to fucking drive.

549
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,310
That goes for you with the
fucking speech impediment.

550
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,330
You don't know how to fucking drive
Jan with your awful fucking Hasidic Jew

551
00:36:53,331 --> 00:36:58,240
fucking curls. I don't know what
you're trying to do, you know, and,

552
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,600
and,
and Marcia who,

553
00:36:59,601 --> 00:37:03,340
I don't know why I'm not banging you some
reason I skipped over you and started

554
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:07,280
banging your mother, right? None
of you bitches can fucking drive.

555
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,340
And I'm watching this episode going,
this Greg radius is shit Greg, Bro.

556
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,460
Fuck Fonzie. You know, with
this stupid fucking, you know,

557
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,440
spinning around a punch in a jukebox.

558
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,510
So play Shaboom Shaboom I don't give
a fuck about that. I like Greg Brady,

559
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,870
you know,
for as much as Fonzie was talking shit,

560
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,130
he was always nice to the ladies and he,
that's,

561
00:37:28,131 --> 00:37:30,190
that's seventh grade game with a woman.
Yeah.

562
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,020
[inaudible] [inaudible]

563
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,570
Greg Brady.
That's it.

564
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,700
That's how Greg ended up fucking their
mom because he didn't give a shit.

565
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,190
You didn't give a fuck Greg. Fuck
you Carol. You're not my mother.

566
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,600
You don't have to drive either. Oh my
God. Took him in that fucking groovy.

567
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,350
Adic they had started blowing
up twice. Hair got all curly.

568
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,080
So anyways,
that episode,

569
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,560
he's telling these fucking broads
that they don't know how to drive.

570
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:19,080
And then in the end of course,
cause they always have to cater to women,

571
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,340
these nerdy fucking writers. Okay. You
know, and then they, uh, they fucking,

572
00:38:24,341 --> 00:38:25,174
you know,

573
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:30,340
Marsha goes around this stupid fucking
track and they had a cone with a little

574
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:34,500
egg on it. You guys have seen this and
she fucking, you know, I forget whatever,

575
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,070
Marsha in the beginning,
and then

576
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,860
in the end just to fucking even it out.
So everybody's happy.

577
00:38:38,861 --> 00:38:42,340
And they could sell tide during the
commercials. They have Greg. Fuck up.

578
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:46,410
[inaudible]

579
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,840
knock the I golf. That's, that's
what I was trying to get to.

580
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,260
Wasn't that what I was trying to
get to that one on so fucking long.

581
00:38:52,261 --> 00:38:54,810
I can't even remember.
All I'm saying is

582
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,810
that the guy you want,
you don't,

583
00:38:59,811 --> 00:39:03,140
it doesn't fucking matter
how many yards you throw

584
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,940
in the regular season.
It doesn't

585
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,010
fucking matter.

586
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,960
[inaudible] and downs on the

587
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:51,810
[inaudible]. Hey, what's going on?

588
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,900
April 12th, 2010 and, uh,

589
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,960
I'm actually just putting this up here
right now to let you guys know that I'm

590
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:05,040
not doing a podcast this week. I
apologize. I'm calling in sick.

591
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,810
All right. I'm fucking,
you know, airborne cal.

592
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:14,630
Cal Ripkin voluntarily took himself out
of that game and he ended his streak.

593
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,840
I'm ending my podcast streak. Uh,
this is the first week that I, uh,

594
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,840
I'll ever willingly not do
a fucking podcast. You know,

595
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,590
it's like an NFL football. The
big question is, can you go,

596
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,760
we tape it up and we freeze it.
Can you go,

597
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,330
and this is the first time I
could tell you no, I can't,

598
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,130
I can't go this week.
Everybody. I apologize.

599
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,250
So we're going to have
a substitute this week.

600
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,590
I'm going to pass the mic
and I'm fucking with you.

601
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:48,510
I really should have had someone
stand in. I'm a, I'm spent.

602
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:54,550
All right, I'm back to drinking.
I'm disgusted with myself.

603
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,740
I, uh, I was in Atlanta this
week. I didn't drink Wednesday

604
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:04,210
and I didn't drink Thursday.
Okay.

605
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,560
And then Friday was coming
along and I was tired.

606
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:12,560
Now my buddy was opening for me
and I had a couple of drinks.

607
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:15,230
I had two beers,
then I switched to water,

608
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:18,950
which is a great thing and it usually
makes me stop. But the thing was,

609
00:41:18,951 --> 00:41:23,570
is I left the punchline in
Atlanta. Uh, that's where I was at.

610
00:41:23,571 --> 00:41:27,620
I was at the punchline and I walked
across the street to this club to 90.

611
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,250
Yeah. And Yeah. Well I dunno.

612
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:37,260
Somewhere walking from the punchline
across the parking lot to club to 90.

613
00:41:38,471 --> 00:41:42,570
I then switched back to, uh,

614
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:46,510
to alcohol.
I Dunno what happened.

615
00:41:46,511 --> 00:41:48,640
Jesus Christ hear my phone
ringing in the background.

616
00:41:48,641 --> 00:41:52,150
How many times can it ring before you
realize either I'm not home or I'm not

617
00:41:52,151 --> 00:41:55,720
picking it up. There's probably
some fucking telemarketer.

618
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:02,240
Oh Jesus. There you go. Person
finally quit. So anyways, uh,

619
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,500
any way I walk over there
and people are drinking.

620
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:09,850
So I add a couple more Budweisers and
then the fucking bartender over there.

621
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:14,440
If you guys live in the Atlanta area,
and I feel really bad telling you this.

622
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,773
All right.

623
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:21,350
Cause it's such a cool fucking thing
that I don't want it to get ruined and

624
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:25,950
become anything touristy. Ah, you know,

625
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,010
I can't remember what the name of
the thing was. Just go in there.

626
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:32,180
There's a bartender named Tommy and
just ask him if he can spin the wheel.

627
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,310
All right. This guy out of nowhere
says to me and Paul Versey,

628
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,590
who is opening up for me,
you fucking killed all weekend.

629
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,850
A deep just pulls out this drum head and
it's got an Arrow and it has a bunch of

630
00:42:46,851 --> 00:42:50,000
shit written all around the rim of the
drum hit and he goes, spin the air on.

631
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:52,250
You'd spin it and I didn't even,
I was so drunk,

632
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:56,840
I don't even know what I got and
Paul's fun at first he got something,

633
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:59,930
the guy goes, okay, you got
this. Then he has me spin it

634
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,240
and he goes, all right, you
got, you know you've got this.

635
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,730
And then he walks over
and he picks up this,

636
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,400
I dunno what it is.
You don't like that thing like that.

637
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:15,300
They put like a Yeager and you know when
you do like they have Yeager on tap and

638
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,134
all those things.

639
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:21,320
He basically picked up something like
that that had a door on the front of it

640
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:26,321
and he just puts it on top of his head
and he's just staring at us and all of a

641
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:32,151
sudden he opens the door and he has this
dumb cross eyed look on his face and he

642
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:35,040
starts singing slash rapping.
I don't know what,

643
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,440
and it doesn't even sound like English.

644
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,570
And at the end of every sentence that
kind of fucking rhymes and right as you

645
00:43:42,571 --> 00:43:45,300
start to figure out what he's saying,
he stopped,

646
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:49,050
makes a weird face and slams
the door right in his face.

647
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:54,660
It's the most fucked up thing. When he
first did it, I was like, all defensive,

648
00:43:54,661 --> 00:43:58,440
like is this Guy gonna make me look
like a fucking asshole? And then I,

649
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,040
and then right as I caught on that
he was just acting like an idiot.

650
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,380
He slammed the door on himself and it
was the best fucking laugh I've had in

651
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:11,970
like three months. I can't even imitate
what he did. And that was just for Paul.

652
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,770
So now he's standing,
he just slammed the door,

653
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:18,520
this fucking thing on his right
in his own face, this little door.

654
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,500
And now he's just standing
there looking at me,

655
00:44:21,501 --> 00:44:24,410
but he's not looking at me cause he's got
this fucking thing on him, on his head.

656
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:27,620
And I know I'm next and all of a
sudden he opens the door again.

657
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:31,680
He's got that same dumb look
on his face. And he said, ah,

658
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,220
Bill Byrd up [inaudible] Dah, Dah. I
can't even fucking do what he was doing.

659
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,790
And me and Paul at his point,
like pounding the bar,

660
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:42,720
fucking dying laughing and
you didn't want it to end in.

661
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,380
All of a sudden he just stops with this
fucked up look on his face and he slams

662
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:51,000
the door in his face again, club
to 90. The guy's name's Tommy.

663
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,040
Just hang out there.

664
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:56,580
I'm telling you what all the fucking
weird Shit I've seen in bars with people

665
00:44:56,581 --> 00:45:00,240
doing tricks with matchbooks people
telling you jokes and everything was the

666
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:04,410
most unique fucking thing I've
ever seen in my life. And um,

667
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,110
it's called the club to 90. Just just
go in there. Um, whatever. That's it.

668
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,110
The next night I was going to bring
actually my video camera and video tape it

669
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:14,100
and put it up on Youtube,

670
00:45:14,101 --> 00:45:18,270
but I didn't want to because youtube
ruins everything because everything then

671
00:45:18,271 --> 00:45:20,700
becomes mainstream and it can't be a

672
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,850
who's just this cool underground thing.

673
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:27,660
So what I did to keep it underground was
not videotape it and then fucking talk

674
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:31,950
about it on my podcast. What
an asshole. Um, so anyways,

675
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:36,450
so I went hard that night and then I
stayed out till like four in the morning

676
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,280
and we ended up driving
out of there and uh,

677
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,570
and verges going, come on,
hey, is anything open? I
want to get something to eat.

678
00:45:45,571 --> 00:45:48,390
I'm like, dude, I'm not eating this
fucking late. That she was like three,

679
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,530
I got to sleep by force was a little bit
before three. And he goes, no, no, no.

680
00:45:52,531 --> 00:45:54,040
He goes, I think Mcdonald's
opened. I'm like, dude,

681
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,510
it's not going to be open this late.
And he's like, all right, come on.

682
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:59,550
Just drive up there. So I say,
fuck it. I drive up there.

683
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,100
He sees the lights around and he see,

684
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:06,720
you see that one lonely fucking person
standing in there walking around doing

685
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:11,400
everything and he's all excited
to do the drive to use open. Yes.

686
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:15,510
It's fucking open, right? So we'd go, we'd
go to the drive through and he's like,

687
00:46:15,511 --> 00:46:17,880
dude, you going to get some like, Nah
Dude, I'm not kidding any of this shit.

688
00:46:17,881 --> 00:46:21,630
I can't eat this fucking late up to
too old to be in this light. Right?

689
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,210
So we go up to the drive through and
the guy goes, hey, welcome Mcdonald's.

690
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:25,044
Can I take your order?

691
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,290
And immediately my mouth just starts
going yet let me get two double

692
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:33,150
cheeseburgers, a small fry and a coke
and verse. He just starts laughing at me.

693
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,870
Cause two seconds ago I wasn't going
to get anything in the second I just

694
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:39,150
started smelling those
fries. I said, you know what?

695
00:46:39,151 --> 00:46:40,530
Actually now that I think of it,

696
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:44,280
I'm going to order about
1,280 calories of trans fats.

697
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:48,030
I think that that's what I'm gonna do.
So we get our shit

698
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,670
fucking drive back to the hotel, fucking
eat it in his room. And then I go to bed.

699
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,470
You know, I wake up the next day at
like 1230 and I'm not worth shit.

700
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,640
I'm not worth fucking shit. We
get up, we go to the waffle house.

701
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,830
This is what I did to my body this week.

702
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:08,790
This is why there's no podcast this
week. This is not a podcast. Okay?

703
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,860
So if you guys don't like this podcast,

704
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:13,050
don't write me and say
that podcasts sucked.

705
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:18,180
What you need to say is
you're unbelievably long
statement announcing why you

706
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:22,680
weren't going to do a podcast sucked.
All right?

707
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:29,130
All right. Get it right there. Can face.
So, uh, yeah, we go into the waffle.

708
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,160
We're both fucking

709
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:30,993
hung over.

710
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:34,660
I've been to the waffle house a bunch
of times because I traveled this fucking

711
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:35,494
country.

712
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:40,090
Paul Versey has never been to the fucking
waffle house because he doesn't work

713
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:43,390
this part of the country much.
Or maybe he just never went to it,

714
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:47,980
which I would understand because of the
piss yellow sign that they have with the

715
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,270
incredibly bland black
font. It is. Um, um,

716
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,110
as a question for you guys
and this non podcast, what,

717
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,910
when you guys look at like
fast food, don't, you know,

718
00:47:59,970 --> 00:48:03,100
at like some signs of like appealing and
they make you want to eat the food or

719
00:48:03,101 --> 00:48:06,310
at the very least try it.
We have an an earthquake.

720
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:12,060
Is that just wind and having a
lot of earthquakes lately? Um,

721
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,450
that was one of those little ones.

722
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:18,000
Every once in a while I'll get one
of those little ones out here and uh,

723
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,410
it just feels like,
you know,

724
00:48:19,411 --> 00:48:21,330
if your eyes are closed at
night and you get one of those,

725
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,710
you feel like if you opened your eyes,

726
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,610
they'd be some guy standing at the
end of your bed just shaking it like,

727
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:31,450
I'm gonna fucking kill
you. Um, anyway, so we go,

728
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:36,800
uh, which uh, Jesus Christ, I got
nothing. This is not a podcast everybody,

729
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:39,890
I can't even fucking think right now.
I had a Muffin,

730
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:44,650
a bag of m and m's or water
and some sort of chicken wrap.

731
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:48,730
All airport fucking food.
I've destroyed my body.

732
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:51,610
I think at least two of my organs
of shut down at this point.

733
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,750
I'm going to go with one kidney. And,
uh, let's see the pancreas now that's,

734
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,100
that's the fucking grand central
of the, uh, Oregon's isn't it?

735
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,050
What exactly does the pancreas do?

736
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,220
That's for all you geeks out there who
let me know that facetious is not the

737
00:49:07,221 --> 00:49:12,221
only word that has all
the vowels in a row.

738
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,350
You hear that Geeky?

739
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,590
The person who sent me that fucking email
that said the interest is legal bolt.

740
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:21,150
The word facetious. Is this the
only word in the English language?

741
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,510
We're all the, uh, all the vowels.

742
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:28,650
Not only all the vowels in the
English language, in the word,

743
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,620
they're actually in order. It's the
only word in the English language.

744
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:35,010
I'm sorry to tell you sir.
You're actually wrong. And A,

745
00:49:35,011 --> 00:49:36,630
I can't remember what the other word is,

746
00:49:36,631 --> 00:49:41,100
but at least two other nerds emailed me
to let me know that you were wrong. So,

747
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,970
uh, I'm not gonna read the emails
because this is not a podcast this week.

748
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:46,290
I am taking this week off.

749
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:51,560
So what you need to do is you need to
deepen the level of nerd that you fucking

750
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:55,440
hang out with before you make an ass of
yourself like that again on the podcast.

751
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:59,900
Lucky for you, I'm not trashing you
on another podcast or as you would be

752
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,910
Barris right now.
Fortunately for you,

753
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:05,990
this got buried on the back page
of this non podcast this week.

754
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:09,270
So anyways, what, which
have fast food restaurants.

755
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:13,830
You guys feel like the sign makes the
food look like the least appealing for me,

756
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:18,840
I would go with the waffle house because
they have like that piss yellow fucking

757
00:50:18,841 --> 00:50:21,540
sign and they have the
plaintiff's black font.

758
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:28,220
It's just horrible. Absolutely horrible.
And it makes me sick to stomach. Arby's

759
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,880
is another one that blood orange color,

760
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,470
that fucking hat. And they're
gray roast beef. And by the way,

761
00:50:36,471 --> 00:50:39,860
I ate there last night at about
fucking one in the morning.

762
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,320
Jesus Christ.

763
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,130
You know what I used to hate to was this
the subway back in the day when they

764
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:50,780
had those piss yellow counters in the
newspaper, articles all on the walls.

765
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:55,810
Remember that they literally had
urine colored tables with newspapers.

766
00:50:56,241 --> 00:51:00,590
The only thing was missing was a
homeless guy rolled up in the wallpaper,

767
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,420
pissing on the tables.
That was the,

768
00:51:02,421 --> 00:51:06,140
that was basically subconsciously what
they were creating. And not only that,

769
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:10,250
the pictures on the wall Onaway no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no. The newspapers.

770
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,470
Oh,
I'm fucking this up.

771
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,670
The subway used to have
pictures of Old New York on it.

772
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:19,850
That's what it had. Wow. I fucked that up.

773
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:23,810
The newspapers were actually the
tabletops of the old Wendy's.

774
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,710
There's a bunch of guys,
41 years old and older right now.

775
00:51:27,711 --> 00:51:29,860
Fucking punch in their dashboard going.
That's right.

776
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:32,720
I was going to fucking say that.
I remember that Shit.

777
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,780
You go in there and you'd, you'd order
the triple during one time. You know that.

778
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,800
I see.
You remember one time you don't,

779
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:44,801
one time I was standing in line at Wendy's
and I was making my girl crack up or

780
00:51:45,291 --> 00:51:48,170
maybe my girlfriend at the time,
I can't even fucking think this week.

781
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,790
I was making her laugh her ass off
because I was making fun of who the fuck

782
00:51:52,791 --> 00:51:57,110
orders a triple, uh, triple cheeseburger,
you know, I don't even know of him,

783
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:57,944
what I was saying,

784
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:03,130
but I had a dying laughing and I was so
site that I was making her laugh because

785
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:04,640
it was making me feel good.

786
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:09,320
I had a cry and laugh and then I had
said triple cheeseburger so many fucking

787
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:13,280
times that when I walked up to the
register, I ended up ordering it.

788
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:17,060
And then she looked at me like,
what the fuck did you do that for?

789
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:21,830
And then I felt stupid for ordering it,
but then I asked will felt, you know,

790
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:23,600
I didn't want to be like, oh
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

791
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:27,140
I didn't want to look like an asshole.
And then the glutinous side of me is like,

792
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:30,740
oh great, I get to eat at triple
cheeseburger, you know, like a fat fuck.

793
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,350
So anyways, I would go with Arby's and I
would go with the waffle house signage.

794
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,620
So it was you walk into the waffle house.

795
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:42,440
For those of you who have never
been to a waffle house, uh,

796
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:46,370
don't ever put your elbows on the table
because you won't be able to get them

797
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:51,371
off without taking off at least two
layers of skin because there's still

798
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,450
somebody kill me. You know,
I just had an urge to do,

799
00:52:56,451 --> 00:52:57,560
I'm wearing a thermal right now.

800
00:52:57,561 --> 00:53:00,980
I had the urge to take this thing
off and hang myself by the sleeves.

801
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,710
I got nothing. I got absolutely
nothing this week. This statement

802
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:17,320
is going to be a long
statement of so many ways.

803
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:20,150
We walk into the fucking
waffle house and yes,

804
00:53:20,151 --> 00:53:23,870
I did lose some energy in my voice.
I'm running out of batteries here.

805
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,510
Yeah, I'm sweating here. Uh,

806
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,810
we walked into the waffle house and
we're both fucking hung over it and I've

807
00:53:30,811 --> 00:53:35,490
been to the waffle house hundreds of
times, so I already know the menu. Paul,

808
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:37,110
on the other hand,
does not know the menu.

809
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,890
So the waitress comes over and she goes,
you guys ready to order?

810
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,900
And I'm like, yeah, yeah, actually
I'm ready to order it. So verse,

811
00:53:44,901 --> 00:53:49,350
he goes into a fuck at panic and
it's a big overwhelming fucking menu.

812
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:52,230
They have like 98
different kinds of of uh,

813
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:56,220
hashbrowns smothered covered fucking
sheets shit on or whatever the fuck you

814
00:53:56,221 --> 00:54:00,640
supposed to say there that he just, you
know, I order what I ordered and then he,

815
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:05,370
he didn't know what the fuck the dope,
these just looking at the pictures,

816
00:54:05,371 --> 00:54:09,660
pancakes, toast, eggs, and he
finally just goes, yet you have a,

817
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,480
what are the order?
He ordered eggs benedict

818
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:18,060
fucking waffle house.
You know,

819
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:24,120
who the fuck off? That's like trying to
order like a ribeye steak at Mcdonald's.

820
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:24,960
They don't have it.

821
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:29,460
Paul over easy or fucking scrambled.

822
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,680
I mean there's like toothless truckers in,

823
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:36,540
they're convicted felons has been rappers.
It's a,

824
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:40,560
it's a shit hole, but their
waffles it delicious. Special,

825
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,000
especially when you're hung
over their food. So fattening,

826
00:54:45,001 --> 00:54:47,730
I actually had a little hiccup
there as I was just describing it.

827
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:52,200
So anyways, and this is,
this is, this is the kicker.

828
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:56,220
Like that night I have three
fucking shows. All right.

829
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,600
But because I'm a professional,

830
00:54:57,601 --> 00:55:02,601
I'm able to push all the feelings that I
have of the horror that I've done to my

831
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:07,650
body over the last fucking 24
hours. I go onstage, kill it.

832
00:55:07,651 --> 00:55:11,910
Seven kill a 10. I do. I go to
Duke, no, seven, nine and 11,

833
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:12,810
the 11 o'clock show.

834
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:17,810
I literally have a splitting fucking
headache and all I can think of is Jerry

835
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:18,390
Lewis.

836
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:22,830
And now we never ever sat down in his
Tuxedo pants and he always gave him a

837
00:55:22,831 --> 00:55:26,760
fucking show. And I was like, you
know, instead of what would Jesus do,

838
00:55:26,761 --> 00:55:30,360
what would Jerry do?
He would give them a show lady.

839
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,770
So I plowed through that one.
And uh,

840
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,180
then that was the end of my weekend.

841
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,600
So you're probably thinking
to yourself right now.

842
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,720
Well then why he wished shoeing
a statement. Bill. You fucking,

843
00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:49,020
you will finish Saturday. It's fucking
Monday. Did you recuperate yesterday? No,

844
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:49,920
I did not.

845
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:55,370
I went to the masters yesterday and
watch Phil Mickelson when his third green

846
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,710
jacket.
And uh,

847
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:03,120
it was an incredible experience. I
went to the Superbowl Gulf, everybody.

848
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,340
And after having gone there and seen
how fucking beautiful that golf courses,

849
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:12,870
I don't know why they don't call the
Superbowl, the masters of football.

850
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,440
You know why?

851
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,440
Because nobody fucking watch his golf
to the level that they watched football.

852
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:18,300
That's why I knew the
answer to that question.

853
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,060
I'm just trying to tell you that
it was a beautiful course and,

854
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,980
and basically you don't get
tickets to the masters. All right?

855
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,700
Cause I want to tell you guys, this is
just like Royal Albert Hall that I saw.

856
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,960
This is another thing that if you're
into golf, you have to do at some point,

857
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,250
you don't get tickets.

858
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:40,720
What you do is you get a badge and you
have to get a badge from some sort of

859
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:43,210
dude who knows a member
who knows a fucking guy,

860
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:47,710
who knows a guy who fucking
knew a guy who knew a guy.

861
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:52,150
And when you go to pick up your tickets,
you actually fucking,

862
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:56,500
at least we did.
We actually drove to somebody's house.

863
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,630
And I remember I thought it was gonna be
like, some will call shit and it wasn't.

864
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,350
We're driving through this neighborhood

865
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,150
and I'm looking at the addresses and
I'm like, I think it's the next hat.

866
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:12,700
It's a house.
I must be on the wrong street.

867
00:57:12,701 --> 00:57:17,500
And then I look and there's this woman
sitting in a garage waving at us and I

868
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:18,311
was like,
all right,

869
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:23,230
well either this is the place where
we're supposed to be or this is the

870
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,180
friendliest fucking
neighborhood I've ever been to.

871
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:30,220
Or maybe I look like one of her neighbors
or maybe she has a rape fantasy and

872
00:57:30,221 --> 00:57:31,410
she ordered a redhead.

873
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:39,040
Cause you know how many Red
Ed Gigolos are out there?

874
00:57:39,041 --> 00:57:44,041
Everybody I'm telling you were
in demand where we're dying off.

875
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:48,790
Well, like the white rhinos
of fucking human beings.

876
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,620
People are trying to bang us before
we disappear. Let me think about it.

877
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,970
Think about the Dodo bird.

878
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,630
Think about if you actually
stuck your dick in a Dodo bird.

879
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,360
The the just the fuck you
Trump every story in a bar.

880
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:05,770
I fucked something that
doesn't exist anymore.

881
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,740
What do you a necrophiliac. No, you
fucking asshole. I fucked it. Dodo bird.

882
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,000
Um, anyways, now, right there,

883
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:18,670
I would have complained if
that was on a regular podcast,

884
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:20,440
I would have complained
about that last bit there.

885
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:24,220
But fortunately this is not a podcast on
just issuing a statement that I do not

886
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:28,810
have the energy to fucking do
this this week. So anyways,

887
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:33,220
we get these fucking badges and they
actually bring you into the house.

888
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,140
We sit in this library and I'm sitting
there and this woman is debriefing me

889
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:41,830
about these badges.
Okay.

890
00:58:41,831 --> 00:58:45,400
I'm already freaked out about going to
the masters because there's a level of

891
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:49,240
whiteness and a level of education that,
uh,

892
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:53,470
even intimidates me is why
it is I am now. Um, oh,

893
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:58,450
if aesthetically a e s t h e,
t,

894
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:02,620
I c a. L. L. Y. Aesthetically. I
don't know if I spelled it right,

895
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:04,900
but I know how to spell it when
I'm not fucking brain dead.

896
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:09,490
It's one of my spelling words.
Let's get smart America. Um,

897
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:15,220
aesthetically I'm very white.
Alabaster. If you asked my girlfriend,

898
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,090
that's how she describes me.
A porcelain ask.

899
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,080
That's how white I am. But, uh, there's,
this is the different kind of white,

900
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:29,770
this isn't a Thirstin howl the food kind
of white and a ivy league kind of white

901
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:36,470
Illuminati, you know, rubbing
elbows with the Kennedys.

902
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:39,500
We summer in the Hamptons,

903
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:44,030
we have a house on Martha's vineyard.
You know,

904
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:48,170
when Jesus comes back, he's going
to have to be buzzed into our house.

905
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,870
After we talked to our lawyer, our lawyer
will be present when Jesus judges me,

906
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,330
like that level of fucking white.

907
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:00,800
So I went on the Internet
and I actually was like the,

908
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:04,070
I know there's a dress code here and the
last thing I want to do when I go to a

909
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:08,450
place like that is I don't want to
come in there and disrespect the place.

910
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:12,590
I don't give a fuck about the approval of
those people. But you know what I mean?

911
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:16,880
You go into that place.
It's an unbelievable golf event.

912
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:20,420
I respect the history of an Arnold
Palmer, Jack Nicholas, Ben Hogan,

913
01:00:20,421 --> 01:00:21,290
all that type of stuff.

914
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:26,150
So I want to go there and show it the
respect that it deserves. All right.

915
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,660
And also, I don't want to walk in
there looking like a fucking bump.

916
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:31,580
So I go on the Internet and I check
out the dress code and it's literally

917
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,850
collared shirt, no jeans
allowed, all this shit.

918
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:39,560
So I for the first time in about
I think 20 years, I actually,

919
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,390
when I had some sort of a soup job,
I actually bought a pair of dockers,

920
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:54,170
dockers. Everybody I buy, at least I went
with the black ones. I did not buy khaki.

921
01:00:54,171 --> 01:00:56,840
I refuse to ever wear khaki.

922
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:01,430
There's only two people in the world
where a khaki animal experts in date

923
01:01:01,431 --> 01:01:04,160
rapists. All right, I'm not wearing khaki.

924
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:10,060
So I bought a pair of
black doctors and uh,

925
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,280
I had this blue like Nike Golf Shirt
and then I had the tiger woods,

926
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:21,200
um, the tiger woods, Nike had
the black one with the Red v.

927
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:25,940
Why am I acting like I'm walking the
red carpet from my movie date night that

928
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:29,510
came out last weekend, which is
a huge fucking hit. Everybody.

929
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:34,010
I'm so fucking site.
Date night was a huge head.

930
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:38,860
It made a ton of fucking money.
And if you went out and sought, um,

931
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,920
I, I want to say thank you because I hope
it's such a huge hit that they make a

932
01:01:42,921 --> 01:01:45,220
fucking sequel. And, uh,

933
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:50,260
maybe I'll be able to repop
reprise my role as detective Walsh.

934
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,700
You know, maybe I'll be, I'll,
I'll turn bad in the second one,

935
01:01:55,701 --> 01:01:59,270
like a fucking key Ho
and another 48 hours.

936
01:01:59,271 --> 01:02:02,870
Remember that I'll grow one of those.
A walrus mustaches.

937
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,670
I don't give a shit the first movie
I've really booked ever in my career.

938
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,210
I'm average in one every 18 years.
If I can go on a run with this thing,

939
01:02:11,211 --> 01:02:15,890
I'll be psyched. For those
of you who haven't seen it
and, uh, enjoy this podcast.

940
01:02:15,891 --> 01:02:19,530
This is not a podcast,
it's just a statement, uh,

941
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:22,590
but enjoy all the other free podcasts
season. That'd be like, you know what,

942
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,240
he never comes and tours in my area,
or I don't care to see his act live,

943
01:02:27,241 --> 01:02:29,250
but I would like to
somehow pay it forward.

944
01:02:29,251 --> 01:02:33,000
You could pay it forward by buying a
ticket to date night. You could even do,

945
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:35,630
we have bigger favor is if you're gonna,

946
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:38,340
if you've already seen it or you
don't even want to fucking see it,

947
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:40,350
you'd rather see another movie.
Do me a favor,

948
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:43,530
just buy two tickets to date night and
just go into the other movie that you

949
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:47,040
wanted to anyways,
just so it pads the stats,

950
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,980
um, date nights starting
Steve Corral and Tina Fey.

951
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:58,290
Is that a local Cineplex near you?
Please go see it. So anyways, um,

952
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,440
so we get the badges and a,
this is the deal.

953
01:03:01,441 --> 01:03:03,240
You're not allowed to
bring his cell phone in.

954
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:06,870
You're not allowed to bring a camera
and you're not allowed to bring video

955
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:09,390
equipment in.
You're not allowed to bring shit in.

956
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:13,470
All you're allowed to bring in is
yourself the close that cover you and some

957
01:03:13,471 --> 01:03:17,640
fucking cash and some sunblock.
That's it.

958
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:18,931
All right.

959
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:22,290
So you walk in there and you literally
get going through like a metal detector,

960
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:27,291
like you going through the airport and
immediately there's this sense of awe is

961
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:32,070
the president nearby because that's
what this security feels like.

962
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:33,623
And,
uh,

963
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,960
and the big thing with these badges is
it's not like you get the badge at the

964
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:40,350
person's house. So we're however the
fuck you get it and you get to keep it.

965
01:03:40,351 --> 01:03:43,320
You have to return the badge.
And when you have this badge,

966
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:48,590
you have the responsibility to not break
any rules because if they kick you out,

967
01:03:49,531 --> 01:03:52,710
they take your badge so
you'll never come again.

968
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:54,720
So not only can you never come again,

969
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:59,880
the person who's badge it was does not
get it back ever again no matter what

970
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:03,000
because you are obviously not good enough.

971
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:07,620
A judge of character considering that you
gave this badge to this person that we

972
01:04:07,621 --> 01:04:11,070
now have to object.
And when I went there,

973
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:14,550
all I heard was stories of people
that they had seen get eject some,

974
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,413
some ejected,

975
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:20,100
some guy actually got a cell phone in
there and it rang at some point during the

976
01:04:20,101 --> 01:04:24,750
match and people just
appear out of nowhere. Okay?

977
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:27,150
One guy puts you in a fucking choke hold,

978
01:04:27,151 --> 01:04:29,580
another guy snatches the
badge off your shirt in.

979
01:04:29,581 --> 01:04:33,630
The badge has to be
displayed at all times.

980
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:36,570
And you would think with all
those fucking people there,

981
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,180
if he didn't have it
displayed, you had, you know,

982
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:43,110
very small chance of someone's
stopping you. I didn't have my,

983
01:04:43,111 --> 01:04:47,100
I had mine in my pocket and I walked like
10 feet with it and all this guy just

984
01:04:47,101 --> 01:04:51,330
appeared on a nowhere with his masters
that green colored shirts or was your

985
01:04:51,331 --> 01:04:55,620
badge, where's your bad sir, sir,
do you have a badge? You know,

986
01:04:56,310 --> 01:05:00,180
fucking gun drawn. He may be reached in
my pocket with two fingers, you know,

987
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:05,280
pull it on kid, whatever. Um, so anyways,

988
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:08,100
so we walk out until we get there.

989
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:13,430
First thing we do is we walk into the
pro shop and I already told myself I was

990
01:05:13,591 --> 01:05:18,310
going to spend it like 400 bucks
and I got, if I, if I didn't,

991
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:23,080
it's exactly what I did. I got some
shot glasses, I got some golf balls,

992
01:05:23,081 --> 01:05:27,820
I got some hats for people. They actually
sell those masters. The flags, you know,

993
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:32,050
that they have on the pins all
around there just as a the masters,

994
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,170
2010, very clean, very elegant.

995
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:40,450
The Shit bought a bunch of those for
some friends and a couple of golf shirts,

996
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,970
you know, the usual bullshit. And
uh, then I bought one of those, uh,

997
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:49,120
the best in the best souvenir I ended up
getting is you actually cause you don't

998
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:53,410
want to stand up for fucking 12 hours
watching people golf. What's up Cleo?

999
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:57,090
Are you doing? I didn't know you
will lay in there. How you doing?

1000
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,870
You guys haven't heard
a fucking Moen lately.

1001
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:08,440
Anyways. Um, I just do that
for me. Um, so anyways,

1002
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,720
uh, they sell these, these
chairs there that you can uh,
sit on. Oh Jesus. You see,

1003
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:15,970
this is why this isn't a podcast
and hear what I just said.

1004
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,520
They sell these chairs that are,
you can set on,

1005
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:22,720
is that what you do with the chair bill?
And they actually,

1006
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:27,460
they end up being one of the
most coveted, um, souvenirs.

1007
01:06:27,461 --> 01:06:30,320
Because when you go to get on the plane
the next day, you see everybody got 'em.

1008
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,890
They get 'em slung over their shoulders,
the way they fold up,

1009
01:06:32,891 --> 01:06:36,040
it looks like you're carrying like a
yoga mat except at ways like fucking 20

1010
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:38,080
pounds. So anyways, let's,

1011
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:41,560
let's cut to the chase here cause I
gotta finish this statement early. Um,

1012
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,760
I went out onto the golf course and
those of you who are big fans of golf and

1013
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:49,330
you watched the masters every year,

1014
01:06:49,331 --> 01:06:54,160
you gotta go there because when
you go and you see the clubhouse,

1015
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:54,970
she can't go in it.

1016
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:59,970
But when you see it and you
just start walking the course,

1017
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,570
this is,
this is what I suggest.

1018
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:06,571
Get there at like eight in the morning
and start at 18 and just walk the course

1019
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:09,760
backwards all the way to the front.

1020
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:13,180
I didn't do that because I had
too much shit that I bought.

1021
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,400
And uh,

1022
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:19,840
I just walked two different
holes that I really liked,

1023
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:22,690
but that's what this guy told me to do.
Walk the whole fucking course.

1024
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:25,100
But we got there a little lake because uh,

1025
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:29,710
I was in a bar the night before watching
a guy with a box on his head sing songs

1026
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:34,690
that I couldn't really
understand. Um, but anyways,

1027
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,490
you go onto the course and I,

1028
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:40,120
I've never been to anything
like this as far as nature goes.

1029
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:45,370
I've seen it was like seeing famous people
except they were, they were fair ways.

1030
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:47,560
Like I walked

1031
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:52,240
up and around so when I came to 18,

1032
01:07:52,450 --> 01:07:57,450
I was inbetween where you tee
off and looking down the fairway,

1033
01:07:57,551 --> 01:08:00,640
you know when someone's just bringing
it home and is going to win the masters,

1034
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:05,710
there's a roadway where you walk across
and I looked right down that fairway and

1035
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:09,670
I don't know, it's one of those fucking
things we just like, this really exists,

1036
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,880
you know, it isn't, this is real.

1037
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:17,150
And then I'll let you go over the whole
number 12 I got the little pamphlet here.

1038
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:22,010
They've got all the holes are named the
12th hole. What the fuck do they call it?

1039
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:26,960
They have like the Golden Bell is the
name of this is how white this is.

1040
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:29,930
You guys want to hear the
names of the holes. Now,

1041
01:08:29,931 --> 01:08:33,140
usually when I talk about
holes on the podcast,

1042
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:39,220
it's a lot more crass than this whole
number one is called t all live.

1043
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:45,140
All right? That's not to whole.

1044
01:08:45,141 --> 01:08:47,420
Number two is called Pink Dogwood.

1045
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:51,020
Tell me there isn't a porno to
be made with some of these names.

1046
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:56,460
Flowering Peach.
It's the third hole.

1047
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,660
These are all mildly sexual art.

1048
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,810
They flowery crab apple.
Oh,

1049
01:09:02,811 --> 01:09:05,810
that's the one where like if you're
into watching guys fuck old women,

1050
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,610
this is really just going to get
disgusting. Fifth hole is Magnolia.

1051
01:09:10,611 --> 01:09:13,640
You get the point.
Juniper's is sixth

1052
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:19,610
pompous. I don't what the fuck
it yellow jasmine, but whatever.

1053
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,250
They got all these flowers and
everything's in bloom and it's just,

1054
01:09:22,251 --> 01:09:24,320
it's unbelievable.
It's unbelievable.

1055
01:09:24,350 --> 01:09:27,770
Walk around looking at all these famous
holes like I couldn't be like when I was

1056
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:32,440
coming up onto 12 to see that
little bridge there on a,

1057
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:35,570
whatever the fuck they call it,
the pink Petunia Golden Bell.

1058
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,570
It's just unbelievable when you see it.
It's literally iconic.

1059
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:41,360
The same feeling I got when
I saw Big Ben in London.

1060
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,540
How fucking awesome is my life
this past month when I saw Big Ben,

1061
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:47,390
you just stare at it.
You can't believe it.

1062
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:50,240
It's just something you've seen your
whole life and now you're standing there

1063
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:52,040
looking at it and I'm telling you

1064
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:56,930
the fucking urge. This is the thing
about it. There was so many things.

1065
01:09:56,931 --> 01:10:00,620
You can't talk to the golfers. Like
if tiger hit something, hit the ball,

1066
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:04,220
hits something, his wife, if
tiger hit the fucking ball,

1067
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,340
you could literally go like, uh, you
know, as he came walking up to a poly bag,

1068
01:10:08,530 --> 01:10:12,110
come on tiger. You could say something
like that maybe, but that's it.

1069
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:17,030
After you hit the ball, he
couldn't be like, you're the
man to a u turn. That's it.

1070
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:20,480
Someone would pair out of
nowhere. Chloroform, rag,
read over your fucking nose.

1071
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:24,200
Somebody yells, yanks off your
fucking badge. And that's it.

1072
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:29,330
They pummel you with Billy clubs that are,
that are the same colors,

1073
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:30,470
the masters green,

1074
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,130
and they just beat the shit out of you
and they toss you over the fucking fence.

1075
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:40,190
That's how it works. Um, but I
got a man with all those rules,

1076
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:44,570
all those rules, the urge to just do
something like that and get kicked out.

1077
01:10:44,571 --> 01:10:48,080
Like I almost had like Tourette's.
Um,

1078
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:52,730
cause what I ended up doing is I settled
on the 15th hole and I sat in the

1079
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:57,470
bleachers and I don't know what
that one's called, wispy pubic hair.

1080
01:10:57,530 --> 01:10:58,730
What the fuck do they call this one?

1081
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:03,910
The 15th fucking hall is called
Fire Firethorne and it had this,

1082
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,570
uh,
so this is basically what we did.

1083
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,560
We realized that there was so many
fucking people there and we had our chairs

1084
01:11:09,561 --> 01:11:12,740
that we had to lug around and a
$400 worth of shit in his bag.

1085
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:17,100
I wasn't going to walk 18 holes
and just follow tiger around.

1086
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:19,530
I didn't want to do it because
there's too many fucking people.

1087
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:24,770
And as people camped out around where
they tee off and they're camped out around

1088
01:11:25,411 --> 01:11:26,244
the green.

1089
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:31,020
So what you could basically do
is run down the fucking fairway.

1090
01:11:31,021 --> 01:11:32,130
If you can get there,

1091
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:37,250
knowing that all the golfers have a point
a to point B once they once you know,

1092
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,880
just to keep play moving,

1093
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,290
you on the other hand have specific areas
where you can crossover fairways and

1094
01:11:43,291 --> 01:11:46,530
that type of shit. And if you don't,
they fucking, they, they, they,

1095
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:50,820
they destroy you and they take your badge.
So,

1096
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,510
um, we just said fuck it. We're going
to go to 15. We're going to sit there.

1097
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:56,460
We can watch them hit their second shots,

1098
01:11:56,461 --> 01:12:00,580
a power five and we look over our
shoulder. We can't see them tee off on 60,

1099
01:12:00,581 --> 01:12:03,360
but we could see the results
of their shot. And uh,

1100
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:07,860
we sat there in the bleachers and
knowing that we had a good two and a half

1101
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:11,970
hours to wait until they came,
I think it was actually three hours.

1102
01:12:11,971 --> 01:12:14,570
So we just sat there and a,

1103
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:16,770
you would think it would be
boring as hell and it wasn't.

1104
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,290
You just shoot the shit with other people,

1105
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:24,270
older people who've gone to the master's
since like the early seventies late

1106
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:27,240
seventies one guy from like 1952 I
didn't get a chance to talk to them,

1107
01:12:27,241 --> 01:12:28,110
but they talk about,
you know,

1108
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:30,990
Nicholas went in [inaudible] 86
and I'll share with, you know,

1109
01:12:30,991 --> 01:12:33,090
if you're a sports fan,
it was fucking incredible.

1110
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:38,010
And meanwhile all we're doing is we're
sitting waiting for the bear trap taps to

1111
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:38,844
be turned on.

1112
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:43,410
And this is how this style
secret of this fucking places is.

1113
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:48,440
No one had any idea when they get
turned on somebody up in the clubhouse,

1114
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:53,811
in the inner fucking catacombs of the
clubhouse gives everybody the go ahead to

1115
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:58,350
turn on the beer taps. And they can't
even tell you when they, I don't know,

1116
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:03,030
maybe 1230 maybe one we're not sure.
And they don't have any advertising.

1117
01:13:03,031 --> 01:13:07,800
So just as domestic beer,
regular beer, the whole fucking
thing is just like, look,

1118
01:13:07,801 --> 01:13:12,000
we're in control. All
right, you want an import.

1119
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:16,740
This is important. You want to domestic.
This is domestic. What kind is it?

1120
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:20,970
I can't disclose that.
I'm not allowed to tell you when,

1121
01:13:20,971 --> 01:13:23,520
when you turned into bear on,
we're not allowed to tell you, sir,

1122
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:26,100
why are you being hostile?
You know?

1123
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:30,150
So we're just sitting there and there's
a couple of turtles outside the fucking

1124
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:32,310
pawn there and we start
gambling on the turtles.

1125
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:34,770
Which one's going to go in
the fucking water first.

1126
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:39,300
Then they turn on the beer and we start
getting shit faced and we're waiting for

1127
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:43,560
the first fucking golfers to come. And
then it's just like the Indy 500 you just,

1128
01:13:43,561 --> 01:13:46,320
you just,
you just bet on golfers.

1129
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:50,340
It's like the most elegant track you've
ever been to and you just wait and they

1130
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:54,570
come in through two at a
time. Ernie els, you know

1131
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:00,750
Kenny Perry's coming through
fucking Sergio Valenti,

1132
01:14:00,751 --> 01:14:03,570
whatever his fucking name is.
Either they just right in front of you,

1133
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:07,920
this shit and you're just sitting there
getting hammered betting on golfers in

1134
01:14:07,921 --> 01:14:11,350
fucking turtles. That's what I
did all day. Sitting in the sun.

1135
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,150
Fucking saw two holes in one,
or at least the results of them.

1136
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,180
I heard him hit the green or hits the
green and I hear the crowd go crazy.

1137
01:14:19,181 --> 01:14:23,410
I look over and I see it roll in the
cup and everybody goes fucking nuts. Um,

1138
01:14:23,411 --> 01:14:27,100
I lost 100 bucks in the first one and
100 on the next one. So I was even,

1139
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:31,560
and I gotta admit to when you sit there
and all of a sudden you look in there,

1140
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:34,090
you knew, know taggers come in
next cause you've got like the, uh,

1141
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:37,990
the whole list of golfers is fucking
unreal and you see him come over the hill.

1142
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:40,540
All right.
Like a fucking

1143
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:45,670
one of those deer hunters
say 15 horn fucking dare man.

1144
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,450
20 point are coming over the
hill. And I got it. My such man,

1145
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:51,190
I'm going to choose to
ride the fucking head.

1146
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:56,080
That was the other word is like tiger
comes over the damn hill he's wearing,

1147
01:14:56,220 --> 01:15:00,360
he's, you see him, he can't even see
him. He's so far away. You see a guy,

1148
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:04,810
you see a black guy who looks like a black
guy who was actually a mostly fucking

1149
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:06,640
Asian or whatever the hell he is.
I don't know what the hell he is.

1150
01:15:06,641 --> 01:15:11,320
You see some Tan Dude beyond the Tan
that a white guy can get coming over the

1151
01:15:11,321 --> 01:15:15,260
hill with a red shirt in the
fucking black pants on you.

1152
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:18,610
Like that's fucking tiger woods.
And a hush

1153
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,940
falls over the entire,

1154
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,020
the entire hole like is like 3000 people
sitting there and it's dead quiet.

1155
01:15:28,810 --> 01:15:32,530
And you just see that ball fucking just
flying. I saw an eagle, the fucking hall.

1156
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:36,640
I saw him, Eagle it. I saw
Kim, the Korean Dude Eagle it.

1157
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:40,390
Um,
I think I saw did it was an Ernie els.

1158
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:42,880
That was another thing that kinda sucked,

1159
01:15:42,881 --> 01:15:45,580
was kind of hard to tell if
it was their second or third.

1160
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:49,420
You just knew with guys like Kim and, and
uh, tiger was the way they drove that.

1161
01:15:49,421 --> 01:15:53,830
Who says second shot? Anyways, whatever.
It was fucking awesome. And uh,

1162
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:57,790
Phil Mickelson came in last cause he
was on the leaderboard and once he went

1163
01:15:57,791 --> 01:16:00,160
past us, I ran off the
bleachers, went down.

1164
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:03,970
And actually he's the only guy who
watched t off, watched him tee off on 16,

1165
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,320
and then we grabbed our shit.

1166
01:16:05,321 --> 01:16:08,380
And we ran over to 18 and
tiger had already finished,

1167
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:11,110
but we stood there
halfway down the f three,

1168
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:16,200
three quarters of the way up the 18th at
at Augusta and watch Mickelson tee off.

1169
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:20,150
We watched him hit his
second shot and then we will,

1170
01:16:20,151 --> 01:16:24,410
we couldn't see through the crowd
when he sunk the winning Putt, eh,

1171
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:28,030
but we stood there and I looked between
a bunch of fucking blue bloods heads and

1172
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:31,030
I watched him put the green jacket on and
get choked up when he talked about his

1173
01:16:31,031 --> 01:16:34,960
wife. And it was one of the most
incredible experiences I've ever had.

1174
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:39,610
And uh, it's making me really thankful
for the incredible fucking life I have.

1175
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:44,290
And A, I hope this isn't building
resentment with you guys. You know,

1176
01:16:45,930 --> 01:16:48,100
you just lay off drinking it
for a little bit. You know,

1177
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:52,630
you could get by one of those badges
by a stinking badge and go next year.

1178
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,420
Just do one thing, do one fucking
thing. You know, I don't fucking know.

1179
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,090
I don't know what I'm
saying. This, these are just,

1180
01:17:00,370 --> 01:17:03,070
this is just my statement that
I'm not doing a podcast this week.

1181
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:06,720
I'm not fucking doing it, but I
know you can. You can go there.

1182
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,630
Those cost me 600 bucks. I know that's
a lot of fucking money. I know it is,

1183
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:15,110
but think how much money you blow
each weekend in a bar. All right?

1184
01:17:16,370 --> 01:17:19,250
Figure out what you blow each weekend
in a bar. Here's a good way to do it.

1185
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:23,120
He's a nice healthy way and just just go
on the wagon for a while and then just

1186
01:17:23,121 --> 01:17:25,370
take the money that you
would've spent on booze.

1187
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:28,940
He put it into your Augusta Fund,
you know,

1188
01:17:29,810 --> 01:17:32,570
and just fucking drive there.
Do a fucking road trip.

1189
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:36,770
Get yourself a pair of dockers
and a golf shirt. All right.

1190
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,000
Have a nice and pressed and clean
drive like a goddamn maniac.

1191
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:44,060
Both you and your buddy, even if
you live in Seattle, tradeoff,

1192
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:49,430
drive all the fuck way down there. Go
into somebody's house, get debriefed,

1193
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:50,841
walk in there,

1194
01:17:50,841 --> 01:17:55,310
act like a gentleman and get
to see something that most
people never get to see.

1195
01:17:55,490 --> 01:17:57,530
And what's great is
there all the souvenirs.

1196
01:17:57,531 --> 01:17:59,330
They don't really sell
anything on the Internet.

1197
01:17:59,331 --> 01:18:03,500
So that's why you buy a ton of shit is
because everybody asks you to get him

1198
01:18:03,501 --> 01:18:06,080
some stuff and even if they don't,
you've got,

1199
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:09,680
you've got great gifts for the
rest of the year. You know,

1200
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:11,510
you could do all your
Christmas shopping right there.

1201
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,020
You get somebody a fucking
hat at the masters,

1202
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:17,900
they're going to be site because no one
else is going to have that fucking hat

1203
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:21,170
and unless they went there.
So there you go.

1204
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,790
That's the end of my statement for
this week. People 38 minutes statement

1205
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:30,560
actually flew back this morning and uh,

1206
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:34,580
I was, I was an idiot. I
guess something me like I was,

1207
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:38,390
I was a little more buzzed than I thought
it was and I was really tired and I

1208
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:41,150
got three hours sleep and fucking
embarrassed. I yelled at a cop

1209
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,030
when I drove out of the master's,
it was like,

1210
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:51,830
it was really late because we stuck
around to the end and it was like,

1211
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:53,210
it was,

1212
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:57,770
we sat through this fucking traffic
and all I had to do was make a left and

1213
01:18:57,771 --> 01:19:01,580
drive like 40 yards down the road and I
could jump on the fucking highway and I

1214
01:19:01,581 --> 01:19:04,940
was on my way and I was exhausted
and I wanted to go to sleep.

1215
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:08,960
And what ends up happening is one of
those deals where the cops decide that

1216
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:11,810
everybody's going to go, right?
We're forcing everyone, right?

1217
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,620
And I want to go left so I can go and
cut hair down the street and get on the

1218
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:18,930
highway. So I got my window down. I'm
like, I can't go left the guy or not.

1219
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:22,610
He could keep the keep going. So I'm
driving and I know what they're doing.

1220
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:25,460
So I get to the third cop and I
see a gas station. I'm just like,

1221
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,460
I just want to get some gas. Can
I get some gas guys? I keep it,

1222
01:19:28,461 --> 01:19:32,630
go and keep them moving. And I just
went to one, I can't get some gay,

1223
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,150
just like that.

1224
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:40,390
Fucking screamed at him as I drove by
because he was on foot and cause I was a

1225
01:19:41,181 --> 01:19:44,470
little drunk and then I drove
away and all of a sudden I was,

1226
01:19:44,490 --> 01:19:45,920
couldn't feel my legs go like that.

1227
01:19:45,921 --> 01:19:50,810
I just fucking do that as a Yankee
in the middle of fucking Georgia.

1228
01:19:50,811 --> 01:19:53,900
Did I just yell at that guy clearly
though? It was I just obnoxious.

1229
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:57,470
Then I was like, I don't give a
shit in the first left I could make.

1230
01:19:57,471 --> 01:20:02,330
I made a left and then I banged one of
the most illegal fucking you turns hybrid

1231
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:04,100
three point fucking turns.

1232
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:08,280
And there were two cops sitting right
there and my like, dude, dude, dude, dude,

1233
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:13,140
dude, which is universal for this,
a cop, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh, Doh.

1234
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,800
And I was like, yeah, I
don't give a fuck. He's like,

1235
01:20:16,801 --> 01:20:18,090
what's wrong with you and Michael Lim?

1236
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:20,120
I'm a little buzzed and
I'm a control freak.

1237
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,960
Don't fucking tell me where I can't go.

1238
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:24,060
I've been on that Goddamn
golf course every day.

1239
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:28,230
All I wanted to do is run out of the
bleachers on somebody approaching shot on

1240
01:20:28,231 --> 01:20:33,000
15 and do a fucking cannon ball right
to that little mini lake already had it

1241
01:20:33,001 --> 01:20:36,870
planned out was going to get my badge to
my buddy and tell him, do take a walk.

1242
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:40,530
Do what do you mean take? Just take
a fucking walk. And he'd see it,

1243
01:20:40,531 --> 01:20:41,700
my eyes and be like,
all right man.

1244
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,920
And he'd just grab our shit
and he'd just walk away.

1245
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,670
And then when I would do is I do a cannon
ball right into the fucking lake. Okay.

1246
01:20:47,671 --> 01:20:50,250
And I would immediately
be a fucking legend,

1247
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,940
an absolute fucking legend on the,

1248
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:58,830
on jackass.com if there's something, you
know, I'd be right up there with fan man,

1249
01:20:59,130 --> 01:21:03,460
that fucking kid at Yankee stadium who
jumped off into the, into the, the, the,

1250
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,980
the backstop netting.

1251
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:10,320
I Dunno who else that due to ran out
and grabbed the football and got slammed

1252
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:13,860
down to the ground by the
linebacker on Monday night football.

1253
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:17,910
I'd be one of those guys. I'd be
put on that fucking, you know,

1254
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:22,200
whacked out sports or whatever.
I would be on that shit forever.

1255
01:21:24,570 --> 01:21:27,930
And then when they asked me, when
they pulled me out of there, you know,

1256
01:21:27,931 --> 01:21:32,760
they went to grab my badge, I
wouldn't have it. Where's your badge?

1257
01:21:32,761 --> 01:21:36,630
I don't know. It must be at the
bottom of the pond there. Thurston.

1258
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,710
Why don't you take off your loafers and
roll up your slacks and go in there and

1259
01:21:40,711 --> 01:21:43,650
try and find it.
What's the word she going to do to me?

1260
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:49,080
Prosecute me to the full
extent of the law. You know,

1261
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:52,140
they know every big judge in the state.
I'd probably still be in fucking prison,

1262
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:55,370
but I've got to admit and
I don't know. So anyways,

1263
01:21:55,371 --> 01:21:58,470
so then I just drove the rest of the
fuck away home. I stopped at Arby's,

1264
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,260
went to bed at fucking 12 midnight,

1265
01:22:01,261 --> 01:22:04,890
had to get up at six 30 and a gun
on a fucking plane. I had a Muffin,

1266
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:08,070
I had a m and m's and there was
a baby crying in the hallway.

1267
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:11,580
And I don't give a shit. I know I
never care when babies cry on planes,

1268
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:12,743
I don't give a fuck.

1269
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:16,250
But there was some square had cut in
front of me who kept turning around and

1270
01:22:16,251 --> 01:22:18,360
looking at him. You know,
I was like, all right,

1271
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:22,740
that's the career woman who hates kids.
I see why she's looking at him.

1272
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:25,380
She didn't want to have kids.
So she's annoyed with their presence.

1273
01:22:25,381 --> 01:22:27,540
And then I see she has a
wedding ring and what's what's,

1274
01:22:27,541 --> 01:22:30,630
there's only one reason to get
married. That's they have kids. Okay.

1275
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:33,060
So I'm looking at her like she
must be the worst mother ever.

1276
01:22:33,270 --> 01:22:35,130
Cause every time this kid cries,
she turns around,

1277
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:38,820
starts looking for a mother
shooting alerts, shooting her look,

1278
01:22:38,821 --> 01:22:41,910
shaking your heads. And I just want to
be like, you know, it's a fucking baby.

1279
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:48,120
It's a fucking patient. A baby man.
He's a fucking baby. Some believable.

1280
01:22:48,121 --> 01:22:51,690
When I hate when people do that shit. It's
like, how do you not understand? Like,

1281
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:57,060
you know, we're in a pressurized
cabin. That thing does the Beta thing.

1282
01:22:57,180 --> 01:23:01,770
The baby does not have clearance ears.
It's a fucking baby. Stupid cunt.

1283
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:04,290
So at one point I fucking,

1284
01:23:04,291 --> 01:23:09,291
she looked and I gave her such a dirty
look for fucking given the mother a dirty

1285
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:12,310
look that when her
fucking eyes met my eyes,

1286
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:17,140
she looked at me like surprised at first
and then realized that she was being a

1287
01:23:17,141 --> 01:23:20,620
cunt. And then she tried to
play it off with this smile.
Like, yeah, isn't an acute,

1288
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:23,920
is an acute that the baby's crying
too late? I've already judged you.

1289
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:29,560
You're a horrible mother and you're
a horrible person. And this ends,

1290
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:31,300
this is the conclusion of my statement.

1291
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:34,930
43 minutes said that I am not
doing a podcast this week.

1292
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:39,930
I regret to inform all of you that do
to a circumstances beyond your control.

1293
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:45,010
Um,
our host this week,

1294
01:23:45,011 --> 01:23:50,011
Bill burr abused his body
to such a fucking level that
he had an inability to do

1295
01:23:50,111 --> 01:23:53,320
a podcast this week and only
had an ability to, you know,

1296
01:23:53,321 --> 01:23:56,110
I should have done it in, in,
in the spirit of the masters.

1297
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:59,920
What I should've done was I should have
issued an apology just like tiger woods

1298
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:04,660
and droned on for 45 minutes. Boring
the shit out of you. Oh, wait a minute.

1299
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:09,340
I think I already did that.
I believe I already did that.

1300
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:14,650
All right. That's the podcast
for this week. Uh, once again,

1301
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,320
I'm so sorry that I couldn't
give you a podcast this week.

1302
01:24:17,321 --> 01:24:22,240
I couldn't give you some laughs.
Um, I will become an fucking,

1303
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:26,200
I'll give you both barrels next week,
speaking of which,

1304
01:24:26,201 --> 01:24:30,520
I'm going to be at the funny
bone and a Newport, Kentucky, uh,

1305
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:34,900
right across the river from Cincinnati
and I gotta be honest with you guys.

1306
01:24:34,901 --> 01:24:38,650
I got a, I already have a new
killer hour. That's right. I set it.

1307
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:43,660
I set it. All right. Maybe
it's not a killer hour.

1308
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:47,560
It's like 40 minutes out of the hour.
I already have 40 new fucking minutes.

1309
01:24:47,561 --> 01:24:52,510
How do you like that shit?
I just taped to special in December.

1310
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:53,681
All right.

1311
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:58,030
We're midway through April and I already
can run my fucking mouth for 40 minutes

1312
01:24:58,450 --> 01:25:02,410
with some new shit provided I'm on.
If I'm off,

1313
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,360
I have eight new minutes.

1314
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,220
That's where my act, his act,
but I'm not going to lie to you.

1315
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:14,410
I talked about Tiger Woods for like 11
minutes the other night. All of his funny,

1316
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:19,000
crushing, destroying. I was so sites,
but in the back of my head, I'm like,

1317
01:25:19,001 --> 01:25:22,900
you realize that now after
he plays the masters,

1318
01:25:24,190 --> 01:25:29,170
uh, that, you know, I can only tell that
story for so long. It's basically mid May.

1319
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:31,720
It's going to be an old story.
It already is.

1320
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:34,390
I'm still talking about that
lady who got killed at seaworld.

1321
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:39,280
I'm going to give you a little preview
for what we'll be talking about the way,

1322
01:25:39,281 --> 01:25:42,460
talking about my trip to church
and went again, by the way,

1323
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:49,390
uh, when again, on Easter, I
went on Easter Sunday, you know,

1324
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,000
the girlfriend's mom wanted to go to
church. She didn't want to go by herself.

1325
01:25:52,001 --> 01:25:56,680
So I said, all right, I'll go with
you. We all went little happy family.

1326
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:00,310
I went there, sat there, bored shitless.

1327
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:03,070
It was extra packs took

1328
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:07,580
to eat that piece of
cardboard at the end of it.

1329
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:11,360
And whatever other offensive
thing you want me to say.

1330
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:14,750
Uh, I dunno. I literally
am like sitting here.

1331
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:19,100
I'm laying here right now and I have,
I'm like, my eyes are squinting like a,

1332
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,670
there's a doctor and he's like, you
know, I fucked up my elbow and he's like,

1333
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,430
it tell me, tell me, does this hurt? Does
this yet, yet you're hurt yet right there.

1334
01:26:26,990 --> 01:26:31,240
I'm literally doing that right now as
I'm doing this fucking podcast. Um,

1335
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,470
I got nothing.
All right,

1336
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,940
I got nothing for you this week and I'm
the first one to tell it to you. And, uh,

1337
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,530
oh, did I, you know what it actually did,

1338
01:26:40,531 --> 01:26:44,550
this started this podcast like six fucking
times. I forget if I said this, but, uh,

1339
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,550
somebody sent me a really
nasty email yelling,

1340
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:51,540
cursing me out because he sent me an
email and I didn't answer their email.

1341
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:53,760
And he said,
because you didn't answer my email.

1342
01:26:53,761 --> 01:26:58,310
I didn't go to see any of
your shows in Atlanta. And,

1343
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:03,520
uh, I don't know if I already talked
about this. I apologize if I didn't.

1344
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,750
Uh, sir, I don't give a
shit. All right. If you,

1345
01:27:06,751 --> 01:27:11,110
if you haven't learned anything from my
podcast is I really don't give a fuck.

1346
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:13,780
I don't give a fuck if you
listen to this or you don't.

1347
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:17,590
I don't give a fuck if you go to my
shows, but you don't. I don't give a fuck.

1348
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:22,980
You know, do I, do I not want people
to come to my shows? Of course I do.

1349
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:27,780
Do I not want people? Let's my podcast.
Of course. I don't. I want, fuck,

1350
01:27:27,781 --> 01:27:30,750
I ain't think I got, you
know, I got messed up there
and those double negatives.

1351
01:27:31,110 --> 01:27:34,320
I want people to come to my shows.
I want people to see my podcast.

1352
01:27:34,321 --> 01:27:39,270
But let me tell you some right now. Fuck.
Oh, I don't respond to fucking threats.

1353
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:42,510
Don't fucking threaten me or no fucking,
you know,

1354
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:47,610
try to put some sort of ominous bullshit
on how you want me to fucking behave

1355
01:27:47,611 --> 01:27:50,670
with your fucking email.
I don't give a fuck about email.

1356
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:53,610
I get a fucking hundreds of
emails every God damn week.

1357
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:57,600
And if I don't get to yours, I don't
fucking get to yours. So go fuck yourself.

1358
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:00,840
If you want to pout and not come
to my show, don't go to my show.

1359
01:28:00,841 --> 01:28:03,330
I don't give a fuck.
You sound like a content anyways.

1360
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:08,910
You probably go to my show and then
fucking judge it. It'd be like, oh,

1361
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,560
the first eight minutes,
we're good.

1362
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,540
And then I toured for minute 12 to shove
in teen. Go Fuck Yourself. All right,

1363
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:18,900
why don't you go stick your head
through your fucking computer monitor.

1364
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:23,400
God knows you're probably still have
one of those old ones, you know,

1365
01:28:23,401 --> 01:28:25,230
shaped like a fucking microwave.

1366
01:28:26,220 --> 01:28:28,990
Is that what you got as you work?

1367
01:28:28,991 --> 01:28:31,180
Look how fast people drive
in this fucking street.

1368
01:28:31,240 --> 01:28:34,350
I'm literally getting to that age,
yelling out the window.

1369
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:37,380
Kids stopped driving
like I did at your age.

1370
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:44,020
There's another good character
for a sketch. You know,

1371
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:48,520
crabby, honest, old man.
Honest, crabby, old man.

1372
01:28:52,870 --> 01:28:57,310
Stop treating me with the same disrespect
I had from my elders when I was at

1373
01:28:57,311 --> 01:29:01,920
your age. Um, or maybe not. Shit.

1374
01:29:01,921 --> 01:29:03,690
God knows.
SNL could turn that into,

1375
01:29:03,691 --> 01:29:07,680
I get 15 minutes sketch and then stretch
it into an hour and 40 minute movie.

1376
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:12,840
Um, all right, there we go. I burned
a bridge. I burned a bridge there.

1377
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:17,490
Like I was going to get cast on
that at 41. Uh, maybe I could,

1378
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:22,550
didn't feel harm again on old or what
I perceived to be old when he got on.

1379
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:26,340
He was probably like 34 at the time, which
was ancient to me. And now at my age,

1380
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:30,940
I would love to be, I would
love to be fucking 34 again, uh,

1381
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:34,860
to be that age. Um, you know, I remember,

1382
01:29:34,861 --> 01:29:37,230
you know what was great about
when I was a fuck when I was 34,

1383
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:41,280
I could run like a fucking seven,
nine 40,

1384
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:45,480
when I was 30,
when I was 34.

1385
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,570
It was a very good year.

1386
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:52,530
A fucking dog just licked the bottom
of my foot. It's a goddamn freak.

1387
01:29:53,970 --> 01:29:58,970
I didn't have a dog that shit on
the floor or needed to go outside.

1388
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,110
I did what I wanted.

1389
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:10,170
I went down water slides when I was 34.

1390
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:15,190
What's up Cleo? Are you doing, you know,

1391
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:18,750
site that wants to see you?
You know, it's like to see you,

1392
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,280
cause you were sake to see me. You're
always psyched to see me or you, you know,

1393
01:30:23,281 --> 01:30:24,720
my dog actually misses me.

1394
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:28,710
Comes into the bedroom at night
and it fucking looks around for me.

1395
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:33,930
Then it runs into my little office area
looking for me. Right? If I'm not around,

1396
01:30:33,931 --> 01:30:37,170
who you're going to wrestle with?
Let me see if I can get you to moan.

1397
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:42,280
You won't do it.
Will you know when you're ready?

1398
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:45,350
You like that fucking frog
and bugs bunny and big party.

1399
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:50,460
Then all of a sudden I bring in somewhere.
Hey Cleo,

1400
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:55,650
let me see if I can get you to
how you want to go outside. Cleo.

1401
01:30:58,110 --> 01:31:02,040
This is going to be worth it. People
just listen clear. You want to go say,

1402
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:08,040
Huh?
Cleo.

1403
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:14,570
Cleo. Hey, just getting psyched to Cleo.

1404
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:20,830
You want to go side
Cleo,

1405
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:26,650
cleo. I wanted a house. Come on, Cleo.

1406
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:30,773
You want to go side

1407
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:39,550
Cleo? But you fucking do it. Please clear

1408
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:42,093
your mind goes,
Hey,

1409
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,440
what am I saying?
Clear.

1410
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:56,160
Oh, you fucking burning me right
now. Cleo. Hey, fuck it. Cleo.

1411
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,753
You want to go outside?

1412
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:10,320
Cleo? You know what? Go Fuck
Yourself. Jesus Christ. What
was that? Three minutes.

1413
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:12,610
Yep. Below it. Cleo.

1414
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,720
Why won't you hold for these people?

1415
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,820
And in conclusion, uh, there
is no podcast this week.

1416
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,530
I regret to inform you don't come
over now. Don't come over now.

1417
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,240
You want some food,
you want to go outside,

1418
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:35,900
cleo.
Well let me have one more temp.

1419
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:38,740
Clearly you want to go outside?

1420
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:47,550
Hmm Cleo. Okay. Oh Jesus
screen or this is like,

1421
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:48,720
you know what you mean
right now you're just like,

1422
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,590
you know the hot chick that'll never
fuck you and she just keeps giving you a

1423
01:32:52,591 --> 01:32:56,490
glimmer of hope and you keep coming back.
You keep coming back,

1424
01:32:57,630 --> 01:32:59,760
whatever. I still love
you clear. You know?

1425
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:03,120
Even though he just made me look like
a fucking asshole. You really did.

1426
01:33:04,140 --> 01:33:08,670
It was literally the Buler.
Anybody, anybody. All right.

1427
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:12,390
That concludes my statement.
That's the statement I'm sticking by.

1428
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:16,440
It's all in the police report is tiger
woods would say, ah, there you go.

1429
01:33:16,441 --> 01:33:17,760
There's another thing you should do.

1430
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:20,610
Pick one of these fucking things to do
and if one of you guys ends up doing

1431
01:33:20,611 --> 01:33:23,250
something that I told you
to do and you enjoy it,

1432
01:33:23,251 --> 01:33:26,020
please send me an email like a year
from now. If you go to the masters,

1433
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:28,270
let me fucking, no. All right.

1434
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,610
Because I think I'm going
to go again next year.

1435
01:33:30,611 --> 01:33:32,890
That's how much fucking fun
I head or go to England,

1436
01:33:32,891 --> 01:33:37,720
do some shit to something for fuck
sakes. Alright, I'll talk to you next

1437
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:45,040
