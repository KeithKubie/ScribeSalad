with his spouse, Madeleine Tuttle, who is
a visionary artist from Switzerland.

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:18.605
She has her animal paintings
and various other paintings

00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:21.731
on display here if anybody
wants to take a look later.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.932
And we'll also have
The World Peace Diet books for sale

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:28.913
here at a subsidized rate.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.710
So without further ado,
I'd like to welcome Dr. Will Tuttle.

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.693
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.897
WILL TUTTLE: Thank you.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.510
Thank you so much, Chitanya.
And greetings everyone.

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:46.375
It's good to be with you here,
my first time ever in Google.

00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:49.807
And how many of you have actually read
The World Peace Diet,

00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:51.044
just so I have an idea?

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.887
Have any of you read the book before?

00:01:52.927 --> 00:01:54.054
No?
All right, good.

00:01:54.396 --> 00:01:57.082
So I'll just talk for a few minutes here

00:01:57.208 --> 00:02:02.229
about what I think are
the fundamentally essential ideas.

00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:07.020
And then we can have a short time
for Q&amp;A as well.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.986
So the basic idea
in The World Peace Diet,

00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:18.049
is that all of us are born into a culture
that has a hidden program

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.675
when it comes to food.

00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:23.033
And it actually has
a hidden underlying practice

00:02:23.258 --> 00:02:26.237
that is really, in many ways,
taboo to discuss.

00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:31.252
And how many of you would you say
have taken time somehow,

00:02:31.663 --> 00:02:36.226
in some way, to look behind
the curtain of our culture's food system?

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.373
The food system in the United States?

00:02:38.476 --> 00:02:40.031
Some of you?
A few of you have.

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:42.320
Some of you probably
don't want to do that.

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:45.195
It's quite shocking, I will say.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.725
But the basic idea is,
from my point of view,

00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:53.508
the greatest adventure I believe
we can take as human beings

00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:57.904
in our culture today is the adventure
of looking behind the curtain

00:02:58.104 --> 00:03:01.882
of our culture's food system, and
understanding the ramifications of this

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.793
for us as individuals, for our planet,
for our culture, for future generations.

00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:12.562
The web of relations that are impacted
by our food choices is enormous.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:17.904
And the significance of it I think
has been extremely underestimated.

00:03:19.218 --> 00:03:22.792
There's a basic idea, I think,
that all of you are familiar with.

00:03:22.993 --> 00:03:26.748
In the ancient Greek tradition, there was
- over the temple of Delphi a saying,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.384
'gnothi seauton'.
That means "know thyself."

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:35.538
The basic idea is that in order for us
to live lives of meaning, and purpose,

00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:39.592
and authenticity, we have to make
an effort to understand ourselves.

00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:41.477
And I think we all understand.

00:03:41.502 --> 00:03:43.502
Also, if we want to understand ourselves,

00:03:43.527 --> 00:03:46.259
we have to understand the culture
that we're raised in.

00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:48.294
Because in many ways,
we live in a culture,

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.701
but that culture lives in us.

00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:52.535
So for us to understand ourselves,
we need to understand

00:03:52.784 --> 00:03:55.669
the programming of our culture,
the underlying assumptions

00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:58.872
and the basic mentality of our culture.

00:03:58.897 --> 00:04:02.092
Because we're like little sponges
when we land here on this planet

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:04.637
and we start learning,
and learning the language,

00:04:04.662 --> 00:04:06.915
and learning what people eat,
and what they do,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.881
and what you don't do, and all of that.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.445
It's enormously powerful programming.

00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:16.418
And so to understand our culture,
the most powerful way

00:04:16.452 --> 00:04:18.391
-- and anthropologists understand this.

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.069
If you want to understand a culture,
deeply, directly,

00:04:21.282 --> 00:04:23.094
quickly look at their food.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.978
Because food is the most powerful
ritual in any culture.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:29.280
It's the primary way that in any culture

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.961
the values and norms are passed
from generation to generation.

00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:34.541
It's through the food rituals.

00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:38.259
And so when we look deeply into food,
we're looking really, in many ways,

00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.908
at the core of our culture's
underlying assumptions

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:44.188
about the nature of reality that
have been injected into all of us.

00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:46.569
That are, in many ways, invisible.

00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:48.563
So what I'd like to talk about today is,

00:04:48.696 --> 00:04:51.999
essentially, the ramifications
of our food choices.

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:55.668
And that they are much more vast
than we imagine.

00:04:56.198 --> 00:05:00.119
Not only the ramifications in the outer
world, like the Earth and in our culture,

00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:03.043
but specifically the ramifications
in the inner world.

00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:04.680
What does it do to us,

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.216
from the psychological, spiritual,
emotional, and these levels as well?

00:05:10.241 --> 00:05:13.089
So The World Peace Diet
is probably the only book,

00:05:13.123 --> 00:05:14.189
at least in English,

00:05:14.241 --> 00:05:18.125
that goes into this inner dimension
of our food choices in this way.

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:23.264
So what I'd like to do I guess is just--
because the basic dilemma I have,

00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:25.740
in many ways, in putting on
a lecture like this,

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:29.748
The World Peace Diet is available
over here at an amazing price.

00:05:29.906 --> 00:05:33.740
Madeleine said it's only $5.
Normally it's $22.

00:05:33.921 --> 00:05:35.562
We do have audio books.

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:38.676
And we have a special price, actually,
on the audio books

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:42.047
You can see us afterwards. It's me
basically reading the entire book.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.231
It takes 13 and 1/2 hours for me to read
The World Peace Diet pretty quickly.

00:05:46.452 --> 00:05:50.069
And I would like to give you
as much as I can of that.

00:05:50.094 --> 00:05:53.923
So I'll be speaking faster and faster
as time goes on here.

00:05:54.173 --> 00:05:55.942
So much I want to share with you,

00:05:55.967 --> 00:05:58.787
and there really isn't enough time
to give this big picture.

00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:03.149
But the basic idea is to understand

00:06:04.124 --> 00:06:07.122
at least the main part of this puzzle.

00:06:07.123 --> 00:06:13.897
And the essential idea
that's basically unnegotiable is

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:19.218
that in the United States alone, right
now, by a very conservative estimate,

00:06:19.344 --> 00:06:21.884
we are killing
75 million animals for food.

00:06:21.918 --> 00:06:25.362
That is routinely and relentlessly
happening every single day.

00:06:25.396 --> 00:06:27.874
There's no big headline
in the New York Times

00:06:27.968 --> 00:06:31.846
saying, wow, 75 million animals
were somehow killed yesterday.

00:06:32.238 --> 00:06:33.714
I think it is huge news.

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:36.843
It's probably the biggest news actually,
in our entire culture.

00:06:36.884 --> 00:06:43.364
But because it's happening every day,
routinely and relentlessly like I said,

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:45.093
it's just not news.

00:06:45.188 --> 00:06:48.968
Cause this is something that's happening
because we, the people, are choosing.

00:06:49.317 --> 00:06:53.637
We're taking out our wallets and saying,
I want the flesh of animals for food.

00:06:53.662 --> 00:06:57.137
Or in many cases, the dairy products
and eggs are secretions of animals.

00:06:57.273 --> 00:07:01.272
And so we don't realize
that this has an enormous impact.

00:07:01.307 --> 00:07:04.498
By killing 75 million animals
a day for food, means essentially

00:07:04.647 --> 00:07:09.489
that we have put into place we have built
a massive industrialized killing machine

00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:13.410
that reaches its tentacles into every nook
and cranny of our outer world,

00:07:13.435 --> 00:07:17.123
from the bottoms of the oceans,
deep in to the Amazon Rainforest,

00:07:17.593 --> 00:07:19.178
and everywhere on this planet.

00:07:19.374 --> 00:07:22.596
As well as very, very deeply
into our own internal landscape

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:25.877
of our feelings, and thoughts,
and yearnings and mythology

00:07:26.202 --> 00:07:28.593
within ourselves as individuals
and as a culture.

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:33.707
So if we begin to understand this,
if we begin to understand

00:07:33.874 --> 00:07:37.905
the ramifications of killing 75 million
animals every day for food,

00:07:38.255 --> 00:07:40.089
we begin to understand, I believe,

00:07:40.747 --> 00:07:43.363
why we have the problems
that we have as a culture.

00:07:43.512 --> 00:07:46.897
And why we are so essentially inept
at solving them.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.896
Why we just don't exhibit
very much intelligence at all

00:07:51.026 --> 00:07:54.519
or creativity because of the food.

00:07:54.544 --> 00:07:57.180
The food program is injected
into every one.

00:07:57.463 --> 00:07:59.799
And basically, when we leave here,
we go outside.

00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:02.513
We see people eating meat,
dairy products, and eggs.

00:08:02.538 --> 00:08:06.254
We have to realize that obviously,
the only reason anyone does this

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:08.459
is because of the culture
they're born into.

00:08:08.484 --> 00:08:13.527
This culture essentially gives us this
as what we are told to do.

00:08:13.552 --> 00:08:15.629
I remember as a little kid

00:08:15.772 --> 00:08:19.457
growing up in Massachusetts,
I was about maybe seven years old.

00:08:19.502 --> 00:08:22.538
And I said to my mother, Mom,
the kind of foods we're eating,

00:08:22.563 --> 00:08:23.898
is this what everybody eats?

00:08:23.923 --> 00:08:27.186
And we were eating lots of meat,
dairy products, eggs, typical meals.

00:08:27.229 --> 00:08:30.451
And my mother said, 'Yeah.
This is what everybody eats.'

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:31.992
And I said, OK, thanks.

00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:35.990
And she came back a little while later
and said, well, actually,

00:08:36.551 --> 00:08:39.301
there are vegetarians.

00:08:39.391 --> 00:08:41.576
And she said that word
in a way that I knew

00:08:41.857 --> 00:08:43.957
that these people lived on another planet.

00:08:44.136 --> 00:08:47.051
She said, I've never met one.
You'll never meet one either.

00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:49.866
They're kind of like hypothetical people.

00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:53.009
Where would they get their protein?
They couldn't possibly exist.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.259
So that was the reality I grew up with.
And my mother was totally right.

00:08:57.284 --> 00:09:00.725
I never met a vegetarian
my whole life growing up.

00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:02.702
Or even heard the word again.

00:09:02.727 --> 00:09:06.100
And when I was a little bit older
-- or around that same age actually--

00:09:06.134 --> 00:09:08.959
I was teaching my little--
I was feeding my little sister.

00:09:09.469 --> 00:09:11.490
She was maybe two or three.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.105
My mother said, make sure
she eats her protein.

00:09:14.746 --> 00:09:17.512
She was in a high chair
and I had this little fork

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.525
and I was putting the food in her mouth.

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.628
And I remember my mother said,
make sure she eats her protein.

00:09:22.665 --> 00:09:26.316
And I knew if she didn't get her protein,
she would die within 24 hours

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:27.704
of a protein deficiency.

00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:30.394
And, of course,
she didn't really want to eat it.

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:32.964
Every time I'd put it in her mouth,
she'd spit it out.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:36.333
I was making like an airplane.
Here comes the protein.

00:09:37.431 --> 00:09:40.606
She'd spit it out. So pretty soon
I was jamming it down her throat.

00:09:40.631 --> 00:09:41.983
You got to eat your protein.

00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:45.155
I don't want to be responsible
if you die of a protein deficiency.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:50.773
But the idea here is that essentially,
from our families, from every institution

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:54.805
in our culture-- religion, education,
government, media, corporations--

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.492
we are injected with this notion,
with these official stories

00:09:58.527 --> 00:10:00.739
that if we don't eat meat, we'll die.

00:10:00.764 --> 00:10:02.927
We won't get enough protein
or enough calcium

00:10:02.952 --> 00:10:04.512
if we don't eat enough dairy.

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:08.013
Even though there's no actual scientific
validity to any of these ideas,

00:10:08.038 --> 00:10:09.582
they are the official stories

00:10:09.647 --> 00:10:12.740
that are literally forced down
on our throats in many ways.

00:10:12.765 --> 00:10:15.480
I know for sure
because I did it to my sister.

00:10:15.646 --> 00:10:19.386
And I'm so glad to say actually that
my little sister is now a grandmother.

00:10:19.512 --> 00:10:22.416
And she's a vegan.
And her daughter's a vegan.

00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:25.265
And her grandson's a vegan.
And my mother's a vegan.

00:10:25.451 --> 00:10:28.472
So they've somehow, at least
made some changes in their lives.

00:10:28.575 --> 00:10:31.980
But to understand
the power of this program.

00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:36.014
And for me, the only way
I could ever change was

00:10:36.158 --> 00:10:40.202
that I had the opportunity
right out of college.

00:10:42.182 --> 00:10:44.866
I left home, basically.
I went on a spiritual pilgrimage.

00:10:44.891 --> 00:10:46.726
I thought, I try to get
to California.

00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:49.515
And that's where everything's happening
is back in 1975.

00:10:49.911 --> 00:10:52.791
And I ended up at a community
called The Farm in Tennessee,

00:10:52.856 --> 00:10:55.827
which at that time was the largest
hippie commune in the world.

00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:57.626
About 1,000 people were living there.

00:10:57.651 --> 00:11:00.575
And they were eating--
what we would call today, a vegan diet.

00:11:00.609 --> 00:11:03.038
They didn't eat any meat,
dairy products, or eggs.

00:11:03.063 --> 00:11:06.355
They said they were vegetarians.
And I said,  why are you doing this?

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.288
And they said,
there's two main reasons.

00:11:08.313 --> 00:11:10.107
One is there's a lot of people hungry

00:11:10.132 --> 00:11:12.794
and we feed the grain
to animals while people starve.

00:11:12.819 --> 00:11:14.548
And that doesn't seem right to us.

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:18.201
And the other reason is that do you know
what these poor animals go through?

00:11:18.405 --> 00:11:20.818
And I kind of knew because
when I was about 13,

00:11:21.001 --> 00:11:25.416
I'd gone away to a summer camp in Vermont
for a couple of years.

00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:27.701
And they taught me
how to catch my own chicken.

00:11:27.726 --> 00:11:30.830
How to put her down on the ground,
have my axe, cut her head off.

00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:33.325
Put her through the scald tank
and eat the chickens.

00:11:33.372 --> 00:11:35.455
And we even gathered around every year,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.105
a dairy cow who wasn't giving
enough milk anymore.

00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:42.463
And we had a gun and we just put it right
here and we just shot her in the head.

00:11:42.607 --> 00:11:49.577
It was very shocking as a little kid,
13 years old, to not only witness this,

00:11:49.902 --> 00:11:52.065
but to actually be participating in it.

00:11:52.483 --> 00:11:54.542
And that's the whole thing.

00:11:54.721 --> 00:11:57.847
Like meals, we don't just watch
adults eating meat and dairy.

00:11:57.872 --> 00:11:59.592
They make us eat it, too.

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:04.096
We're forced to participate
in acts of enormous violence and killing.

00:12:04.345 --> 00:12:08.064
Either eating the flesh of these animals,
and then also killing them.

00:12:08.856 --> 00:12:13.795
But I never thought, even when we killed
this cow and it was so shocking,

00:12:14.002 --> 00:12:18.108
just because the sheer amount actually,
of blood that came out of her.

00:12:19.849 --> 00:12:22.953
I never thought for a moment
that what we were doing wasn't right.

00:12:23.032 --> 00:12:26.450
I knew we were doing the right thing,
that God gave us these animals.

00:12:26.626 --> 00:12:29.098
That they taste good.

00:12:29.481 --> 00:12:33.197
That if you don't eat them, you will die
of a protein deficiency, and so forth.

00:12:33.222 --> 00:12:35.351
So I knew what we were doing
was in alignment

00:12:35.376 --> 00:12:36.993
with the harmony of the universe.

00:12:37.018 --> 00:12:41.097
We were meant to eat animals.
So I knew there was nothing wrong with it.

00:12:41.122 --> 00:12:46.543
But I was just shocked at the sheer
suffering that these cow--

00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:48.894
The second year we were there, this cow.

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:52.336
We tried to bring her up to a place
to kill her and she broke the chain.

00:12:52.361 --> 00:12:55.150
We were pulling her with a pickup truck
and she snapped it.

00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:58.440
I could see, wow,
they really don't want to be killed.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.596
I guess that'd be the same for me, too.

00:13:01.098 --> 00:13:05.524
And I saw how they have to cut
their arteries right here.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.846
That's really what happens to all animals.

00:13:08.005 --> 00:13:10.307
I saw all this.
I saw directly.

00:13:10.605 --> 00:13:13.394
The guy said, if you don't cut
these arteries immediately,

00:13:13.493 --> 00:13:15.369
no one will eat the flesh.

00:13:15.534 --> 00:13:18.901
It will be soggy. It will be disgusting.
You've got to bleed them out.

00:13:19.268 --> 00:13:23.026
So as soon as she hit the ground,
after we shot her--

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.056
and feces and urine were pouring out--

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:27.973
then he cut her head off with this big,
long knife.

00:13:28.131 --> 00:13:32.347
Blood was going all the way, 20 feet
in the air probably, from her heart.

00:13:32.372 --> 00:13:33.389
Pumping it.

00:13:33.502 --> 00:13:37.388
And he said, the heart has to pump
the blood out or the meat will be soggy.

00:13:37.413 --> 00:13:42.628
So I realized, now after being a vegan
for 32 years, Madeleine and I traveled

00:13:42.837 --> 00:13:47.698
to lots of operations,
factory farms, slaughter houses.

00:13:47.723 --> 00:13:50.027
I just like to see
what's actually happening.

00:13:50.272 --> 00:13:53.492
And the reason that animals suffer
so much actually, is that fact.

00:13:53.517 --> 00:13:55.691
That we humans
don't want to eat soggy meat.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:57.788
So you can't just kill an animal somehow,

00:13:57.813 --> 00:14:00.110
come back a little later,
and then cut her up.

00:14:00.135 --> 00:14:03.979
They have to be hanging upside down
by one leg, which they all are

00:14:04.004 --> 00:14:07.750
-- chickens, pigs, cows, all the animals,
whatever they are-- lambs.

00:14:07.869 --> 00:14:12.786
And then, this happens,
and they die by bleeding to death,

00:14:12.939 --> 00:14:15.339
which is one of the worst
possible ways to die.

00:14:16.008 --> 00:14:18.658
But we don't see that. We just get

00:14:18.838 --> 00:14:23.817
these sanitized little pieces of flesh
in Saran wrap and Styrofoam.

00:14:23.842 --> 00:14:26.458
And we don't know what that
poor animal went through.

00:14:26.504 --> 00:14:29.315
And I saw this in this dairy
when I was 13 years old,

00:14:29.973 --> 00:14:32.850
but I couldn't begin to question
the whole thing.

00:14:33.179 --> 00:14:35.004
It was just so deeply ingrained in me.

00:14:35.084 --> 00:14:38.554
So what I'm saying is it wasn't
until I got to The Farm in Tennessee

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.180
and there was 1,000 people,
probably 200 kids.

00:14:41.205 --> 00:14:44.145
A lot of them were vegan from birth
and they were doing great.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.222
They were not dying
of a protein deficiency.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.113
I saw for myself, there they were.
They were doing fine.

00:14:49.252 --> 00:14:53.723
And so when I asked them why they were
doing it, besides the world hunger.

00:14:53.748 --> 00:14:57.139
He said, do you know what these animals
go through? The suffering?

00:14:57.164 --> 00:14:59.870
And he just--
remember, just in a few sentences--

00:15:00.128 --> 00:15:04.942
I got this little glimpse
of the massive hell realms

00:15:05.096 --> 00:15:09.572
that we construct for animals
to kill 75 million animals a day.

00:15:09.744 --> 00:15:12.654
These are animals that are stuck away
in these stinking sheds

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.743
where we don't see them.
But they're mutilated in horrific ways.

00:15:16.995 --> 00:15:20.555
They're castrated without anesthesia.
Their noses are bashed.

00:15:20.768 --> 00:15:24.193
Their tails are docked.
Their ears are clipped.

00:15:24.218 --> 00:15:28.603
Their beaks are seared off,
just horrible mutilations,

00:15:29.034 --> 00:15:31.759
and drugs, and violence.

00:15:35.364 --> 00:15:40.306
It's just an extremely horrific life.
And then they're taken off and killed.

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:46.210
So seeing that, understanding that, and
then having this example of 1,000 people

00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:49.192
that are just doing great
on a plant-based diet, that was it.

00:15:49.217 --> 00:15:50.677
That was a no-brainer for me.

00:15:50.745 --> 00:15:53.849
And I've never eaten meat again
in my life since that day in 1975.

00:15:54.807 --> 00:15:57.556
And I heard many years later
when I met Madeleine--

00:15:57.735 --> 00:16:00.484
she came over from Switzerland-
that she actually

00:16:00.641 --> 00:16:04.663
has never eaten meat again
either starting that same month and year.

00:16:04.688 --> 00:16:06.996
I'm not sure
if it was the same day in 1975.

00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:11.634
And then about five years later,
I came to San Francisco.

00:16:12.353 --> 00:16:15.403
And I learned more about
what dairy cows go through,

00:16:15.428 --> 00:16:17.942
what hens go through
for eggs and for dairy products.

00:16:17.967 --> 00:16:19.718
So I became a vegan in 1980.

00:16:19.743 --> 00:16:21.876
I don't eat dairy and eggs either.

00:16:22.008 --> 00:16:25.493
And a few years later after that,
I went to Korea and shaved my head,

00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:27.763
became a Zen monk,
lived in a monastery there.

00:16:28.131 --> 00:16:31.305
And I found myself, for the second time
in my life, in a community

00:16:31.777 --> 00:16:34.669
that was practicing
what we would call today, veganism.

00:16:34.714 --> 00:16:36.301
Again, they didn't call it that.

00:16:36.326 --> 00:16:39.669
But there was no meat, no dairy,
no eggs, no wool, no silk, no leather.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.148
You wouldn't even kill mosquitoes
if you could help it.

00:16:43.254 --> 00:16:45.440
Kind of try to take them outside,
let them go.

00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:47.809
There was this whole idea
of trying to live a life

00:16:47.834 --> 00:16:50.339
as much as possible
of kindness and compassion.

00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:52.088
And they've been doing this.

00:16:52.275 --> 00:16:56.340
It wasn't this new California hippie idea
like I thought it was at The Farm.

00:16:56.666 --> 00:16:58.983
I realized
this is an ancient spiritual teaching.

00:16:59.232 --> 00:17:02.671
It goes back
many thousands of years, really.

00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:05.485
But in this particular community
in South Korea,

00:17:05.673 --> 00:17:07.946
they have been living
this way for 650 years.

00:17:08.645 --> 00:17:11.872
So when I came back eventually,
to the United States, to California.

00:17:11.897 --> 00:17:14.865
And I got my PhD at Berkeley,
and taught college, and so forth.

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:20.994
I realized that what veganism is
essentially an ancient teaching of ahimsa.

00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:24.275
The Sanskrit word "ahimsa"
means nonviolence.

00:17:24.698 --> 00:17:27.235
Or I think another way of saying it
is compassion.

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:32.588
Living my life as best as I can
to be an expression of kindness

00:17:32.962 --> 00:17:35.384
or of nonviolence, or non-harmfulness.

00:17:35.817 --> 00:17:40.386
And that this is really the foundational
wisdom in our society.

00:17:40.411 --> 00:17:43.088
Not really in our society,
but in our species.

00:17:43.113 --> 00:17:45.008
It's definitely not in our society.

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:49.423
But in our species that
every religious teaching on this planet,

00:17:49.822 --> 00:17:53.213
if you go deeply into what
the great religions were talking about,

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.402
you could probably boil it down
to one sentence, which would be

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.750
something like, whatever you most want
for yourself, give that to others.

00:18:01.504 --> 00:18:04.959
This basic idea, whatever I most want
for myself, to give that to others.

00:18:04.984 --> 00:18:06.958
If I want to be loved, then to be loving.

00:18:06.983 --> 00:18:09.567
If I want to have an abundant life,
then be generous.

00:18:09.592 --> 00:18:12.184
If I want to be free, let other's be free.
Free others.

00:18:12.327 --> 00:18:15.549
But we're born and raised in a culture
that we don't get that.

00:18:15.574 --> 00:18:19.016
We are taught, essentially, by the rituals
in our lives, by meals

00:18:19.041 --> 00:18:22.579
and many other ways, too, but I think
meals are the most foundational way,

00:18:24.202 --> 00:18:29.360
to manipulate, control, dominate, oppress,
exploit, get what we can, be separate.

00:18:29.928 --> 00:18:35.766
And I think that now it's the time for us,
as a species, and as individuals

00:18:35.841 --> 00:18:38.748
within our culture,
to question the official stories.

00:18:38.814 --> 00:18:41.382
And the most powerful way
I think anyone can do this

00:18:41.562 --> 00:18:43.192
is to question the food system.

00:18:43.361 --> 00:18:48.875
Because animals who are abused for food
really suffer enormously at our hands.

00:18:49.204 --> 00:18:51.641
But there's many other levels
of this suffering.

00:18:52.723 --> 00:18:57.112
Actually, when I came back here-- and I'll
just finish this little thing up here.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.001
So I started with Madeleine
traveling around the United States

00:19:02.171 --> 00:19:05.889
after teaching college for a number of
years, and doing lectures and concerts.

00:19:05.914 --> 00:19:07.568
I'm a musician also, and composer.

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:12.211
I just started getting this vision.

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:15.305
And I said, someone's going to write
a book about the big picture

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:17.725
of our culture's mistreatment
of animals for food.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.288
It will be great to read that book
when it comes out.

00:19:20.313 --> 00:19:22.461
The years went by
and the book never came out.

00:19:22.486 --> 00:19:25.329
Finally Madeleine said, Will,
if you want to read that book,

00:19:25.354 --> 00:19:26.956
you'll have to write it yourself.

00:19:26.981 --> 00:19:28.327
Which I didn't want to hear,

00:19:28.352 --> 00:19:32.182
but I spent five years writing the book
that ended up being The World Peace Diet.

00:19:32.207 --> 00:19:38.024
The basic idea is that besides the outer
ramifications of our food choices

00:19:38.049 --> 00:19:41.139
that people have written books about,
like the three big ones are

00:19:41.164 --> 00:19:44.215
it's not good for your health,
it's not good for the environment,

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:47.939
and it's not good for the animals
who suffer so much because of this.

00:19:48.205 --> 00:19:50.203
But the inner ramifications of this,

00:19:50.376 --> 00:19:52.788
what it does to us
psychologically and so forth.

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:57.017
So basically, what I'd like to do here
in the next few minutes

00:19:57.173 --> 00:19:59.005
is talk about these ramifications.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.410
First, the outer ones.

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:04.735
The outer ramifications, environmentally--
there's a whole chapter.

00:20:05.016 --> 00:20:07.069
I really could talk
a long time about this.

00:20:07.094 --> 00:20:08.843
But just to sum it up briefly.

00:20:09.265 --> 00:20:13.664
We see this. We actually have now,
in our 17th year of living full-time

00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:16.690
in a rolling home, a house on wheels.

00:20:16.727 --> 00:20:19.048
It's called an RV,
with solar panels on the roof.

00:20:19.073 --> 00:20:20.919
We get most of our energy
from the sun.

00:20:20.944 --> 00:20:27.128
And as we travel around, most of
North America has been really enslaved.

00:20:27.738 --> 00:20:33.646
The land has been converted into huge
fields that grow primarily two crops,

00:20:34.195 --> 00:20:37.311
genetically engineered corn
and genetically engineered soybeans.

00:20:37.933 --> 00:20:41.570
That's most of what you see.
There's also some other grains.

00:20:41.692 --> 00:20:46.902
But probably 80% to 85%, to 90% to 95%
depending on which grain it is,

00:20:47.162 --> 00:20:53.729
of this enormous amount of crops
that are grown are not fed to people.

00:20:54.005 --> 00:20:56.912
They're fed to animals who you don't see.

00:20:57.038 --> 00:21:01.415
They're hyperconfined in these stinking
sheds by tens or hundreds of thousands.

00:21:02.088 --> 00:21:06.043
But it's an incredibly inefficient system.
Environmentally it's devastating.

00:21:06.255 --> 00:21:09.522
The primary driving force
behind global warming,

00:21:09.903 --> 00:21:14.497
behind species extinction,
behind water and air pollution

00:21:15.036 --> 00:21:19.133
environmentally is this system
of animal agriculture.

00:21:19.297 --> 00:21:22.814
Because it takes so much land
to grow all this grain.

00:21:22.839 --> 00:21:24.618
This land is doused with chemicals,

00:21:24.643 --> 00:21:27.265
herbicides, pesticides,
fungicides, all kinds of things.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.915
So it's a war against nature. No species
is allowed to live there except one.

00:21:31.051 --> 00:21:32.821
So nature's trying to make diversity

00:21:32.846 --> 00:21:35.141
and we're killing off everything
except soybeans.

00:21:35.166 --> 00:21:38.355
So all the plants, all the animals,
all that runoff into the water

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.061
creating huge dead zones,
beautification of the water

00:21:41.538 --> 00:21:47.319
where nothing can live there anymore
because of all the chemical fertilizers

00:21:47.505 --> 00:21:49.600
that are used on this land.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.725
And then, the animals are very inefficient
at converting,

00:21:53.273 --> 00:21:58.005
essentially very healthy things--
fiber, amino acids, proteins,

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.499
carbohydrates, lipids,
all the different fats.

00:22:00.524 --> 00:22:02.383
They convert that into what?

00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:05.245
Saturated fat, cholesterol,
acidifying animal protein,

00:22:05.445 --> 00:22:08.445
and huge amounts of sewage,
which end up, again,

00:22:08.655 --> 00:22:12.039
polluting both surface water
and groundwater.

00:22:12.624 --> 00:22:15.726
One large pig operation, for example,
creates more sewage

00:22:15.883 --> 00:22:19.602
than the entire New York City.
And yet, it's basically unregulated.

00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:22.976
These big factory farms
do not want to be regulated.

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.758
And so they're not regulated because
the government and the industry

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:29.586
is so corrupt, essentially.

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.477
So we have a situation where
massive amounts of direct pollution

00:22:34.502 --> 00:22:37.920
are being caused, as well as huge amounts
of methane and nitrous oxide,

00:22:37.945 --> 00:22:41.434
both of which are now recognized
to be much more powerful greenhouse gases

00:22:41.459 --> 00:22:45.819
than carbon dioxide are being gassed out
all the time from animal agriculture.

00:22:46.343 --> 00:22:49.585
As well as the fact that
we're cutting down huge amounts of forest.

00:22:49.776 --> 00:22:52.215
Already not only temperate forests,
but rainforests.

00:22:52.304 --> 00:22:54.903
Rainforests right now,
like in the Amazonian basin,

00:22:55.069 --> 00:23:00.372
we're losing, by a conservative estimate,
about an acre per second of rainforest

00:23:00.601 --> 00:23:02.398
is being cut down or burned.

00:23:02.663 --> 00:23:06.216
And the primary driving motivation
for that is people want to eat meat,

00:23:06.251 --> 00:23:07.695
dairy products, and eggs.

00:23:07.729 --> 00:23:12.621
Because the big cash crop now is soybeans.
And this is not soybeans for tofu.

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:19.094
This is soybeans for feeding
factory-farmed or confined pigs,

00:23:19.299 --> 00:23:21.904
cows, chickens, and surprisingly fish.

00:23:22.174 --> 00:23:25.080
Fish eat a huge amount of grain.

00:23:26.132 --> 00:23:28.910
Most people don't realize that,
but I've seen these places.

00:23:29.122 --> 00:23:32.589
So we're seeing a devastation,
when you cut down an acre of rainforest,

00:23:32.614 --> 00:23:36.441
like we're doing an acre per second,
you're not just cutting down some trees.

00:23:36.466 --> 00:23:40.653
We're cutting down whole ecosystems
that took millions of years to develop.

00:23:40.741 --> 00:23:44.363
They are incredibly complex, precious--
it's insane what we're doing.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.462
But just to grow soybeans to feed
of these cows, and pigs,

00:23:47.487 --> 00:23:50.942
and chickens and fish, who are then
fed to humans, and fed to each other.

00:23:51.497 --> 00:23:55.187
Huge amount of fish is fed to pigs
and cows to fatten them up.

00:23:55.561 --> 00:23:59.778
So besides that, the other thing is
the devastation of the oceans.

00:23:59.903 --> 00:24:02.217
People don't realize it,
it's not really covered.

00:24:02.242 --> 00:24:05.052
None of this stuff is covered
in the mass media very well

00:24:05.077 --> 00:24:08.090
because, obviously, we have
a very wealthy pharmaceutical

00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:12.309
and food system that doesn't want
people to understand these things.

00:24:12.457 --> 00:24:17.934
But the oceans are being basically,
clear cut, in a sense, of species of fish.

00:24:18.105 --> 00:24:23.986
The largest fishes, like tuna, salmon,
many of the other ones,

00:24:24.176 --> 00:24:29.999
are teetering on the brink of collapse.
There aren't many fish left.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.531
So for that reason, in the United States
now, 2/3 of the fish

00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:35.555
that we're eating are factory farmed.

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.371
And it's called aquaculture.
I've been to this operations.

00:24:38.653 --> 00:24:41.088
There's both offshore aquaculture
and onshore.

00:24:41.113 --> 00:24:43.140
They're both environmentally devastating.

00:24:43.165 --> 00:24:46.156
I don't have time to go into it,
but just having that many fish

00:24:46.181 --> 00:24:48.967
concentrated in one area,
huge amounts of feces, lots of

00:24:48.992 --> 00:24:54.037
chemicals, pesticides, herbicides,
and antibiotics are fed to these animals.

00:24:54.248 --> 00:25:00.311
And then there's also onshore operations,
which I have seen those direct

00:25:00.336 --> 00:25:01.988
These gigantic swimming pools.

00:25:02.013 --> 00:25:05.403
And I look into them, I thought
there was nothing there but black water.

00:25:05.428 --> 00:25:09.181
They look like they're just swimming pools
filled with black water.

00:25:09.516 --> 00:25:12.828
But I realized, as I kept looking,
that they're packed with fish.

00:25:12.853 --> 00:25:14.586
The fish are just crammed in there.

00:25:14.621 --> 00:25:17.831
They're swimming in their own feces.
That's why the water's black.

00:25:17.856 --> 00:25:20.862
And the workers are dumping in lots of
antibiotics and so forth.

00:25:20.887 --> 00:25:24.562
So it's very, very toxic stuff,
actually, to be eating.

00:25:24.893 --> 00:25:29.499
And fish concentrate toxins in their flesh
literally tens or hundreds of thousands,

00:25:29.524 --> 00:25:31.349
sometimes even millions of times more

00:25:31.374 --> 00:25:34.935
than is in the surrounding water
for a variety of reasons.

00:25:35.186 --> 00:25:37.747
Probably because they're breathing
the waters as well.

00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:45.626
So the underlying message here is that
environmentally, animal agriculture

00:25:45.829 --> 00:25:48.674
is devastating this planet
far more than anything.

00:25:48.861 --> 00:25:52.766
According to scientists,
there's no disagreement on this.

00:25:52.924 --> 00:25:56.142
If everyone in the world ate
the kind of diet that people

00:25:56.348 --> 00:26:00.423
in the United States eat, we would need
 probably between 2 and 1/2 and 3 Earth's

00:26:00.551 --> 00:26:02.366
to even begin to sustain that.

00:26:02.518 --> 00:26:05.735
So in the United States, in particular,
we're eating way more,

00:26:05.877 --> 00:26:07.414
in a sense, than our share.

00:26:08.783 --> 00:26:12.496
There's no greater way to reduce
our environmental footprint

00:26:12.787 --> 00:26:16.478
than to reduce the amount of meat, dairy
products, and eggs that we're eating.

00:26:16.503 --> 00:26:21.330
The amount of water is typically, again,
by conservative estimate, about 30 to 1.

00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:25.125
In other words, 1 person eating
a vegan diet, excuse me, 30 people

00:26:25.267 --> 00:26:30.049
eating a vegan diet or 1 person eating a
standard American diet in terms of water.

00:26:30.204 --> 00:26:32.767
It's about 15 to 20 to
in terms of petroleum.

00:26:32.945 --> 00:26:37.175
And it's about 20 to 1 in terms of land
and pollution in general.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.257
About 20 to 1.

00:26:38.285 --> 00:26:41.876
So just basically understanding that
from the environmental point of view.

00:26:42.009 --> 00:26:46.954
From the cultural point of view, just
briefly, the fact is, as I said earlier,

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.596
we're feeding most of the grain to
animals while people are going hungry.

00:26:50.621 --> 00:26:54.671
So we have a situation today, which to me,
it should be a cause for celebration.

00:26:54.913 --> 00:26:58.360
Which is the fact that we live
on an incredibly abundant Earth.

00:26:58.517 --> 00:27:01.876
An Earth that can easily support
everybody. We're not taught that.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:05.988
We're growing enough food right now to
feed between 12 and 15 billion people.

00:27:06.147 --> 00:27:08.649
Every year we grow plenty of food
to feed everybody,

00:27:08.674 --> 00:27:10.634
twice as many people than we even have.

00:27:10.659 --> 00:27:12.612
But we have this message all the time,

00:27:12.637 --> 00:27:15.155
there's not enough to eat,
people are starving.

00:27:15.192 --> 00:27:17.675
A billion people are starving
or malnourished.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:22.801
That's true, about 900 million.
But roughly a billion people.

00:27:23.489 --> 00:27:27.079
And so in that end of the bell curve,
the poorest billion.

00:27:27.252 --> 00:27:31.017
And on the other end of the bell curve,
the richest billion are also suffering,

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:35.862
ironically from diseases that come from
feeding most of the grains and legumes

00:27:35.975 --> 00:27:39.456
that are grown to animals, who then
convert it to what I said earlier,

00:27:39.579 --> 00:27:42.111
to unhealthy substances.

00:27:42.266 --> 00:27:45.540
So the people in our culture,
the wealthy cultures today,

00:27:45.706 --> 00:27:48.142
are suffering from epidemics
as you all know.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.974
I don't have to go into this,
of heart disease, strokes,

00:27:51.112 --> 00:27:54.600
cancers of various kinds-- primarily
prostate, breast, and colon cancer,

00:27:54.860 --> 00:28:01.539
diverticulitis, arthritis, obesity,
diabetes, autoimmune diseases,

00:28:01.738 --> 00:28:04.206
liver disease, kidney disease.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:09.360
All of these diseases are definitively
linked to eating animal foods and diets

00:28:09.455 --> 00:28:11.166
that are high in animal foods.

00:28:11.757 --> 00:28:16.539
So this is, again, enriching
a tiny minority of people.

00:28:18.881 --> 00:28:24.479
The bottom line for us, as human beings,
it's sowing the seeds of conflict and war.

00:28:24.504 --> 00:28:27.925
Because you cannot have a situation
where you have some people who are

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.751
literally eating so high off the hog
that they're taking most of the resources,

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:35.311
most of the land, most of the water.
I mean, water has become the new oil.

00:28:35.476 --> 00:28:38.101
It's very serious, the water shortages.

00:28:38.318 --> 00:28:41.101
It takes huge amounts of water
to irrigate these crops,

00:28:41.322 --> 00:28:44.153
to feed the animals, to slaughter them.
So they're taking

00:28:44.416 --> 00:28:48.967
a gigantic amount of resources while
other people see their babies starving.

00:28:49.311 --> 00:28:52.716
That kind of inequality and inequity
is the driving force

00:28:52.904 --> 00:28:55.342
behind global conflict and war.

00:28:56.258 --> 00:28:59.231
Again, which enriches a few people
making a lot of weapons.

00:28:59.429 --> 00:29:02.492
But for us, as people, it's not good.
It's not a good idea.

00:29:03.068 --> 00:29:07.882
Besides the war and violence
that is inherent in this whole system.

00:29:08.094 --> 00:29:10.913
And you've got to remember also,
that it's very easy for us

00:29:10.938 --> 00:29:14.563
in the industrialized countries of the
world. We have high-powered economies.

00:29:14.588 --> 00:29:19.070
We can easily drive up the price of grain
and feed it to animals to eat meat,

00:29:19.241 --> 00:29:21.756
dairy products, and eggs
to a point that's too high

00:29:21.781 --> 00:29:25.669
in the global grain markets for people
in less powerful economies to afford.

00:29:25.694 --> 00:29:28.178
They just cannot afford it
and they starve.

00:29:28.311 --> 00:29:31.812
And it's directly because we are buying it
and feeding it to our animals.

00:29:31.837 --> 00:29:34.700
And they're not going hungry.
They always have plenty to eat.

00:29:34.725 --> 00:29:37.618
So we have to understand
the underlying force here.

00:29:37.759 --> 00:29:40.419
And the other thing that
is vitally important understand

00:29:40.478 --> 00:29:43.531
is that in order to be killing
75 million animals a day for food,

00:29:43.684 --> 00:29:46.312
we have to have a whole army
of our brothers and sisters

00:29:46.337 --> 00:29:47.503
who have to do the work.

00:29:47.528 --> 00:29:50.279
They have to stand there
and stab animals all day.

00:29:50.413 --> 00:29:52.842
Or electroshock them, or mutilate them.

00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:57.032
And these workers have the highest rates
of work-related injuries.

00:29:57.259 --> 00:30:00.724
They have the highest rates of suicide,
drug addiction, alcoholism,

00:30:00.749 --> 00:30:02.867
spousal abuse, and child abuse.

00:30:03.383 --> 00:30:07.256
According to psychologists, they suffer--
it's a new disease. They just recently

00:30:07.302 --> 00:30:11.918
put a name to, it's perpetrator-induced
traumatic stress disorder.

00:30:12.321 --> 00:30:16.031
They are paid to be perpetrators
of horrific violence.

00:30:16.189 --> 00:30:18.478
This is work that brings out
the worst in them.

00:30:18.521 --> 00:30:21.624
And they may not be typically
violent people to begin with.

00:30:21.672 --> 00:30:24.737
But after just stabbing animals all day,
soon they go home

00:30:24.762 --> 00:30:27.627
and start doing the same thing
to people, and their families,

00:30:27.652 --> 00:30:29.607
and communities, and neighborhoods.

00:30:29.632 --> 00:30:32.906
And so like Martin Luther King said,
I think this is one of-- again,

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:36.669
the essential wisdoms of ourselves,
as human beings. We know this is true.

00:30:36.821 --> 00:30:39.884
He said, violence anywhere
hurts everybody everywhere

00:30:40.103 --> 00:30:41.780
because we're all interconnected.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.961
And what veganism is about,
essentially is the same teaching,

00:30:46.134 --> 00:30:50.156
which is compassion and kindness anywhere
blesses everyone, everywhere

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:53.207
because we're all interconnected.
We understand that.

00:30:53.343 --> 00:30:56.778
I think in our bones we know
that our welfare is interconnected.

00:30:56.968 --> 00:31:00.491
The more that we live our lives
so that we're aware that the ripples

00:31:00.516 --> 00:31:02.925
that radiate out from our lives,
from our behavior,

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.031
from our words and actions,
what we pay for and buy, that that,

00:31:06.056 --> 00:31:10.094
instead of causing misery, and terror,
and pain, and suffering, and violence

00:31:10.233 --> 00:31:15.408
to others, to do the best we can that
it causes abundance, and sustainability,

00:31:15.609 --> 00:31:20.097
and joy, and creativity.
That that's going to come back to us.

00:31:20.122 --> 00:31:23.764
Because what I said earlier,
whatever we most want for ourselves,

00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:25.249
we should give to others.

00:31:25.274 --> 00:31:28.284
Another way of saying that is,
whatever you sow, you will reap.

00:31:28.601 --> 00:31:30.694
Whatever you put out, it will come back.

00:31:30.731 --> 00:31:34.320
We are born and raised in a culture
that does not get that. We pretend

00:31:34.345 --> 00:31:38.890
that we can sow seeds of violence
and have it never come back.

00:31:39.123 --> 00:31:42.531
And yet, what I believe is
the great adventure, as I said earlier,

00:31:42.556 --> 00:31:46.283
for us to go on is to realize that these
animals, and also the starving people.

00:31:46.497 --> 00:31:50.180
But in general, especially the animals
who we're causing so much suffering to.

00:31:50.372 --> 00:31:53.434
It's not just the animals-- pigs,
cows, chickens that suffer.

00:31:53.459 --> 00:31:54.746
It's also wildlife.

00:31:54.771 --> 00:31:58.872
We're having right now a mass extinction
of species caused by the loss of habitat,

00:31:58.918 --> 00:32:02.875
of elephants, and giraffes, and wolves,
and coyotes, are prairie dogs,

00:32:02.998 --> 00:32:06.454
and pretty much
the entire ecosystems of this planet.

00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:09.342
The animals are losing their habitat
because of this.

00:32:09.367 --> 00:32:11.057
And so they are suffering as well.

00:32:11.239 --> 00:32:15.499
So the point is that these animals
who we are causing so much suffering to,

00:32:15.639 --> 00:32:19.247
they do not retaliate.
So we, essentially, think,

00:32:19.272 --> 00:32:22.399
well, they don't retaliate, so we can do
whatever we want to them.

00:32:22.424 --> 00:32:25.535
We can hyperconfine them, mutilate them,
kill them, and so forth.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.780
We don't realize that our violence
towards them always retaliates.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.201
It does always come back.

00:32:30.226 --> 00:32:33.057
It comes back in these ways
that we're not aware of it.

00:32:33.082 --> 00:32:37.281
It comes back as heart disease
and physical diseases of various kinds,

00:32:37.311 --> 00:32:40.417
psychological diseases, cultural
diseases, environmental disease.

00:32:40.814 --> 00:32:45.827
And so I think what we're seeing today is
an awakening of our inherent wisdom

00:32:45.936 --> 00:32:47.685
to realize these interconnections.

00:32:47.812 --> 00:32:51.490
And actually, begin to understand
how the violence does come back.

00:32:51.687 --> 00:32:55.688
So now, after having talked about
some of the outer ramifications,

00:32:55.904 --> 00:32:59.735
I'd like to talk about the inner ones
just briefly. Basically, like I said,

00:32:59.967 --> 00:33:03.719
in order to be killing 75 million animals
every day for food, we have to have

00:33:03.958 --> 00:33:08.683
a culture where everyone votes for that,
pays for that, and doesn't question that.

00:33:08.708 --> 00:33:10.723
We take out our wallet and pay for that.

00:33:11.188 --> 00:33:13.365
What kind of a mentality
do we have to have?

00:33:13.783 --> 00:33:17.239
We have been injected
with this mentality by our culture.

00:33:17.739 --> 00:33:19.376
And it's not in our best interest.

00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:23.832
I think the greatest gift we can give
to ourselves, and to our loved ones,

00:33:23.971 --> 00:33:28.899
and to our culture is to understand
these ideas, and to be able to question.

00:33:29.085 --> 00:33:32.553
Did you see the movie,
it was called The Matrix?

00:33:34.498 --> 00:33:37.524
In the beginning, Neo--
it's been a long time since I saw it.

00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:40.542
In the beginning, Neo gets
captured by these government agents.

00:33:40.738 --> 00:33:44.912
And they-- in order to track him, I guess
they inject a bug into him, or something.

00:33:45.573 --> 00:33:51.835
And then his friends get it out of him.
That's one of the first things they do.

00:33:52.324 --> 00:33:54.116
And that's what we're talking about.

00:33:54.398 --> 00:33:59.574
All of us have been injected
with this toxic program of seeing beings

00:33:59.739 --> 00:34:01.834
merely as things to be eaten and used.

00:34:02.229 --> 00:34:05.803
And it really is far more devastating
than we realize. And the greatest gift

00:34:06.021 --> 00:34:09.725
I think we can give to each other is
to help each other get that out of us.

00:34:09.865 --> 00:34:14.700
Because if we can do that as individuals,
we can create a culture that is

00:34:14.835 --> 00:34:18.045
at a whole much higher level
in terms of our wisdom,

00:34:18.212 --> 00:34:22.013
our ability to live sustainably
with freedom, and joy, and compassion.

00:34:22.138 --> 00:34:29.116
Because the basic mentality
is injected into us by the food rituals

00:34:29.231 --> 00:34:32.053
that we're obliged to engage in
just growing up here.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.739
Number one
it's a mentality of reductionism.

00:34:35.012 --> 00:34:37.989
The subtext of every meal,
what's basically being taught

00:34:38.137 --> 00:34:40.913
in a meal ritual
is certain beings are not beings.

00:34:41.252 --> 00:34:44.673
Certain beings are merely things.
They're commodities, you buy and sell.

00:34:44.698 --> 00:34:47.780
When you're eating bacon,
for example, we're eating pigs.

00:34:47.805 --> 00:34:51.012
We don't think of it we're eating pigs.
We're just eating bacon.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.705
Pork bellies are sold as commodities,

00:34:53.843 --> 00:34:57.538
like you sell--whatever.
Rocks and machines.

00:34:59.249 --> 00:35:01.917
And so we don't see a pig as a being

00:35:02.053 --> 00:35:05.959
with interest,with wisdom, with emotions,
who loves her babies

00:35:06.162 --> 00:35:09.539
and wants the best for them
and wants to care for them.

00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:13.428
And lives in a community
with other animals of the same species

00:35:13.637 --> 00:35:17.801
that have complex social relationships.
We just see a piece of meat.

00:35:18.394 --> 00:35:25.178
Can you imagine really, the devastation
this does to our own basic intelligence?

00:35:25.527 --> 00:35:26.866
It's incredible.

00:35:27.038 --> 00:35:31.273
It just slams-- the basic intelligence
of this cultures is wilted and crushed

00:35:31.584 --> 00:35:36.186
by being raised in a culture where
we're forced to see a being as a thing.

00:35:36.211 --> 00:35:38.391
Merely a thing.
So that's the foundation.

00:35:38.416 --> 00:35:40.911
It's the reductionism
and commodification of life.

00:35:40.964 --> 00:35:43.638
It's also, essentially,
a mentality of exclusion.

00:35:43.805 --> 00:35:46.240
We practice every day, just excluding.

00:35:46.364 --> 00:35:51.220
I don't care about them. They're
just things. We get very good at this.

00:35:51.245 --> 00:35:53.907
There's an old German saying,
'Übung macht den Meister.'

00:35:53.932 --> 00:35:57.714
That means "practice makes the master."
Whatever we practice, we'll get good at.

00:35:57.739 --> 00:35:59.122
So we get very good at that.

00:35:59.147 --> 00:36:02.126
Another very important thing
to understand is that it's also

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:06.162
essentially a mentality
of elitism and privilege.

00:36:06.526 --> 00:36:11.597
The subtext of every meal is
certain beings are inherently superior.

00:36:12.215 --> 00:36:15.231
Other beings are inherently inferior.
Those who are superior

00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:19.950
use, exploit, dominate, and control
however they want the inferior beings.

00:36:20.386 --> 00:36:23.044
And the way that is enacted is
through eating them.

00:36:23.444 --> 00:36:25.501
Eating their flesh.
Eating their secretions.

00:36:25.855 --> 00:36:28.825
Dominating, humiliating, destroying them.

00:36:28.932 --> 00:36:31.252
They're stealing from them
in every possible way.

00:36:31.277 --> 00:36:35.231
Stealing their purposes, their babies,
their time, their life, everything.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.261
They have nothing.
We steal everything.

00:36:37.286 --> 00:36:39.469
We are the powerful ones.
They have nothing.

00:36:39.919 --> 00:36:42.640
This is what we're taught
at a very deep level.

00:36:42.753 --> 00:36:45.373
Sociologists say the biggest problem
in our culture

00:36:45.398 --> 00:36:48.116
-- and I think this is obvious--
is this massive inequity.

00:36:48.141 --> 00:36:50.486
Some people are so rich
they don't know what to do

00:36:50.511 --> 00:36:53.338
with their money.
Other people can't even get enough to eat.

00:36:53.363 --> 00:36:58.165
And yet, every meal reinforces inequity,
inequality, privilege, and elitism.

00:36:58.205 --> 00:36:59.816
That's the fundamental teaching.

00:36:59.972 --> 00:37:04.514
How can we expect as a culture to evolve
to the point where we actually create

00:37:04.753 --> 00:37:08.707
the possibility for peace, and freedom,
and justice, and equality

00:37:08.953 --> 00:37:12.434
when every meal-- and meals are
our most powerful connection with nature,

00:37:12.536 --> 00:37:16.439
with our culture, with the universe--
is the opposite of that?

00:37:16.857 --> 00:37:20.390
We have to look at the food
and transform the food.

00:37:20.546 --> 00:37:23.064
If we transform the food,
everything else will go.

00:37:23.483 --> 00:37:24.890
That's the hardest thing.

00:37:25.034 --> 00:37:28.202
That's why most people don't want to come
to a lecture like this.

00:37:28.227 --> 00:37:31.442
They're like, I don't want to hear
about this. It's too threatening.

00:37:31.801 --> 00:37:34.385
I may be very smart,
but I don't want to look at that.

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:38.438
We have to be willing to look, I think,
at what's hardest to look at.

00:37:38.729 --> 00:37:41.902
And that's the great joy,
I think, of this whole thing.

00:37:42.045 --> 00:37:43.216
The underlying message.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.815
I'm feeling like--
I'm going to wrap it up here.

00:37:47.043 --> 00:37:51.222
The message that I feel
called to give here is not so much

00:37:51.247 --> 00:37:53.872
a negative message.
It might sound kind of negative.

00:37:53.897 --> 00:37:56.442
I talk about all these bad things
that are happening.

00:37:56.467 --> 00:37:58.480
But the underlying message
is very positive

00:37:58.544 --> 00:38:00.544
because we can transform our culture.

00:38:00.569 --> 00:38:03.845
We can transform our lives relatively
easily once we understand this.

00:38:04.294 --> 00:38:07.442
If we change our food, we change
at the deepest level.

00:38:07.794 --> 00:38:11.421
That's the fundamental, primal level
of indoctrination in our culture,

00:38:11.565 --> 00:38:13.264
of connection to the Earth.

00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:18.075
And so what I've just been saying,
the reductionism, commodification,

00:38:18.293 --> 00:38:21.481
exclusion, and predation is another.

00:38:21.506 --> 00:38:23.662
We're taught essentially
that we're predatory.

00:38:24.342 --> 00:38:29.877
A predator is the exact opposite of what
the spiritual--every religion, the idea

00:38:29.902 --> 00:38:33.857
of someone who is evolved spiritually,
or ethically, or intellectually, morally,

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.181
is someone who looks with eyes to help
others to bless, to create a better world.

00:38:38.556 --> 00:38:41.786
And yet, the predator is one,
how can I harm you for my benefit?

00:38:41.924 --> 00:38:45.846
How can I destroy and take from you?
This is the antithesis.

00:38:45.957 --> 00:38:48.611
And yet, we're taught
essentially that we're predators.

00:38:49.189 --> 00:38:52.543
Why do we wonder why we create
predatory economic systems?

00:38:53.129 --> 00:38:56.909
And then the other powerful thing,
I think, important to understand is

00:38:56.938 --> 00:39:00.855
that the subtext of every meal is the
repression and domination and exploitation

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:05.457
of what I refer to as Sophia.
Sophia is the feminine principle.

00:39:05.986 --> 00:39:10.035
The feminine wisdom within I think
all of us, whether we're men or women,

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:14.035
we have within us living
a feminine wisdom.

00:39:14.248 --> 00:39:16.811
And that is the wisdom
that yearns to protect life.

00:39:16.836 --> 00:39:20.030
A mother, when she gives birth to a baby,
this wisdom just kicks in

00:39:20.055 --> 00:39:23.025
and she loves that baby,
she wants to protect that little baby.

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.156
And we want to protect
the life of the Earth.

00:39:25.181 --> 00:39:26.826
We want to protect the rainforest.

00:39:26.851 --> 00:39:30.031
We want to have a world to give
to the future generations.

00:39:30.056 --> 00:39:36.633
Sophia is the Greek goddess of wisdom,
this ancient idea that lives

00:39:36.755 --> 00:39:39.993
within all of us of a wisdom
that is within all of us.

00:39:40.192 --> 00:39:44.097
And we have to understand that animal
agriculture, from the very beginning,

00:39:44.286 --> 00:39:49.037
it was about men
dominating female animals.

00:39:49.062 --> 00:39:51.499
And today it's the same.
It's the female animals

00:39:51.524 --> 00:39:54.066
in animal agriculture that suffer
by far the worst.

00:39:54.443 --> 00:39:59.383
They're impregnated against their will
after 9 months of-- in the case of cows,

00:39:59.598 --> 00:40:01.095
giving birth to a baby.

00:40:01.164 --> 00:40:04.699
Whether the dairy's organic or not,
it doesn't matter. They steal the baby.

00:40:04.724 --> 00:40:06.906
They impregnate her again
on the rape rack.

00:40:06.931 --> 00:40:09.248
They steal the baby again,
impregnate her again.

00:40:09.318 --> 00:40:12.400
A female cow, for example,
would live normally 25 years.

00:40:12.972 --> 00:40:16.504
After 4, 5, at the most 6 years
on any dairy, organic or not.

00:40:16.631 --> 00:40:19.557
She's killed because her production
starts declining.

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:24.432
So this is incredible violence
towards the feminine.

00:40:24.595 --> 00:40:28.068
It's about dominating, exploiting
not just female beings,

00:40:28.242 --> 00:40:32.419
but female reproductive organs--uteruses,
vaginas, mammary glands--exploiting them.

00:40:32.918 --> 00:40:36.266
You couldn't have animal agriculture
without the complete domination

00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:38.834
of the reproductive organs
and cycles of animals--

00:40:39.056 --> 00:40:42.942
pigs, mammals in general, birds, and fish.

00:40:43.786 --> 00:40:47.503
So what we have to realize is
that when we do this on the outer level,

00:40:47.821 --> 00:40:49.785
we do the same thing on the inner level.

00:40:49.942 --> 00:40:53.881
That our own feminine wisdom is repressed
when we repress these animals.

00:40:54.285 --> 00:41:00.097
And so we have, today, a culture
where Sophia, our natural wisdom

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.319
that celebrates and protects life,
is so suppressed as little children

00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:08.195
being forced to eat meat, dairy products,
and eggs that we have created a culture

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:10.619
where we can be doing
what I've been talking about.

00:41:10.644 --> 00:41:13.991
We can destroy the oceans,
and no one cares.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.303
We cut down the rainforest,
and everybody goes, well, so what?

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.705
Have people starving.
Have corporations that, literally,

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:25.444
are targeting our children with
advertising campaigns that use violence,

00:41:25.469 --> 00:41:29.616
and pornography, and all kinds of things.
And we just let that happen.

00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:32.933
And I think what we're seeing today,
which is very positive,

00:41:33.087 --> 00:41:35.495
is the resurrection,
in many ways, of Sophia.

00:41:35.623 --> 00:41:40.962
We see that Sophia is caring and kindness
and compassion and protectiveness.

00:41:41.401 --> 00:41:45.276
And that, I think, is what's underlying
the vegan movement.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:50.696
I think a lot of the movements that we see
to protect life is the same thing.

00:41:50.824 --> 00:41:53.908
So those are some of the main ideas
in the beginning of the book.

00:41:53.933 --> 00:41:56.677
Trying to zip through
a few other main points.

00:41:56.702 --> 00:41:59.296
There's a chapter
about the history of all this,

00:41:59.321 --> 00:42:01.379
which is incredibly important
to understand.

00:42:01.404 --> 00:42:03.363
I don't have time,
but it is in the book.

00:42:03.402 --> 00:42:07.462
But the basic idea is that we've only
been owning animals as property for food.

00:42:07.621 --> 00:42:08.812
It's called herding.

00:42:08.837 --> 00:42:11.842
We've only been herding animals
for about 8,000 to 10,000 years.

00:42:11.867 --> 00:42:13.513
So it's a relatively new thing.

00:42:13.538 --> 00:42:16.756
It was the last revolution I believe
this culture ever went through.

00:42:16.985 --> 00:42:20.643
And it was a revolution of reductionism,
of reducing beings to things.

00:42:21.322 --> 00:42:25.208
And what happened simultaneously with this
revolution, it took thousands of years.

00:42:25.233 --> 00:42:28.360
It was a very slow revolution, probably
took 7,000 or 8,000 years.

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.915
But by the time historic period emerged,
which began like 3,000 years ago--

00:42:33.028 --> 00:42:38.421
we see it well in place we have a wealthy,
elite class that comes out of this.

00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:42.455
They're wealthy and elite because
they own capital. What's capita?

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.649
Anyone know what capital,
where that word comes from--the root?

00:42:46.171 --> 00:42:48.434
AUDIENCE: Heads.
WILL TUTTLE: Right, head.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.556
Yeah, capitalism and capital,
it means literally head in Latin,

00:42:52.746 --> 00:42:56.623
of sheep, goats, cows.
They have the wealth.

00:42:56.828 --> 00:43:00.261
They invented two more institutions.

00:43:00.696 --> 00:43:04.235
One is--the ancient Sanskrit word
for it is "gavyaa".

00:43:04.622 --> 00:43:09.310
That word is translated as "war." It means
literally, the desire for more cows.

00:43:09.335 --> 00:43:13.122
So this wealthy elite that emerged, they
learned that if they saw some other guy

00:43:13.147 --> 00:43:16.104
that had a lot of cows, it was the first
get-rich quick scheme.

00:43:16.129 --> 00:43:18.828
I'll just go attack him.
I'll get a bunch of my shepherds

00:43:18.853 --> 00:43:21.893
and we make soldiers out of them.
We attack there. And then,

00:43:22.072 --> 00:43:26.371
if we win the war-- we had the first
wars that ever happened on the planet.

00:43:26.424 --> 00:43:28.286
If we win that war, then we get rich.

00:43:28.373 --> 00:43:31.449
We get all that capital.
Becomes my capital.

00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:35.364
And the people who happen to be in that--

00:43:36.033 --> 00:43:38.986
affiliated with that rich guy--

00:43:41.473 --> 00:43:44.171
we own animals.
Now it's a short step to owning people.

00:43:44.196 --> 00:43:46.867
So the second institution
that was invented was slavery.

00:43:46.892 --> 00:43:49.590
So now we enslave these people.
They become our property.

00:43:49.688 --> 00:43:51.050
So they just took the women.

00:43:51.075 --> 00:43:54.477
They started  impregnating them
like they do their cows, and just making

00:43:54.634 --> 00:43:56.351
as many slave babies as possible.

00:43:56.518 --> 00:43:59.736
The males, they just castrated them
like they did the livestock.

00:43:59.761 --> 00:44:02.060
And they became slaves
that work in the fields.

00:44:02.085 --> 00:44:05.082
And we had a beginning,
of a very warlike, violent society.

00:44:05.172 --> 00:44:07.132
Women, also their status was reduced.

00:44:07.265 --> 00:44:10.862
They became--unfortunately,
bought and sold like chattel property.

00:44:11.644 --> 00:44:15.015
And this culture spread throughout
the whole Eastern Mediterranean,

00:44:15.182 --> 00:44:18.828
to the Northern Mediterranean, to Central
Asia, to Europe, came over here.

00:44:18.978 --> 00:44:22.673
And then spread from here. It's been
spreading over the entire planet.

00:44:22.798 --> 00:44:26.800
It's still spreading through Monsanto,
Cargill, Burger King, McDonald's,

00:44:26.923 --> 00:44:32.008
Kentucky Fried Chicken, Smithfield Foods,
this whole--I call it the military,

00:44:32.176 --> 00:44:35.579
industrial meat, medical,
pharmaceutical, media complex.

00:44:35.755 --> 00:44:39.009
It's this vast complex. And it gets
very wealthy on this whole thing.

00:44:39.172 --> 00:44:43.008
But it's not good for us-- the people,
the planet, the future generations,

00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:45.924
animals, ecosystems.
This is the thing we have to realize.

00:44:46.112 --> 00:44:51.675
If we're really serious about creating
 a world that reflects what I believe

00:44:51.798 --> 00:44:53.240
is our natural intelligence,

00:44:53.392 --> 00:44:57.800
to understand that the food program
suppresses that so much.

00:44:57.911 --> 00:45:01.798
To question the food program
and our intelligence can come back.

00:45:01.984 --> 00:45:05.016
So there's a lot more in there.

00:45:05.142 --> 00:45:08.737
There's a chapter that goes into the fact
that whatever problems we have

00:45:08.861 --> 00:45:11.391
in the outer world,
we also see in the inner world.

00:45:11.416 --> 00:45:15.247
And whatever problems that we're doing--
the problems we have in the outer world,

00:45:15.272 --> 00:45:18.786
we're inflicting on animals. So we have,
for example, an obesity epidemic.

00:45:18.811 --> 00:45:20.643
And what do we do to animals for food?

00:45:20.668 --> 00:45:23.556
They're sold by the pound, so we have
great technologies

00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:25.344
to make them very fat, very quickly.

00:45:25.369 --> 00:45:28.999
So we're sowing the seeds of obesity
in billions of animals and we get obese.

00:45:29.199 --> 00:45:32.204
We sow the seeds of osteoporosis
and we got osteoporosis.

00:45:32.394 --> 00:45:35.705
We force these animals to overproduce
milk and eggs, and so that sucks

00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:39.595
the calcium out of their bones.
Dairy cows, they say for example,

00:45:39.643 --> 00:45:41.964
after they kill them,
and only five years old,

00:45:41.989 --> 00:45:45.704
the slaughter house workers say they can
break their bones in their bare hands

00:45:45.729 --> 00:45:47.418
they have such severe osteoporosis.

00:45:47.443 --> 00:45:50.955
Because they're sucking all this calcium
out of their bodies for the milk.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:54.144
The same thing with chickens.
There's a lot of calcium in eggs.

00:45:54.169 --> 00:45:57.143
We force these diseases
on these animals and we get them.

00:45:57.168 --> 00:45:59.853
We force many social diseases,
psychological diseases.

00:45:59.893 --> 00:46:04.976
We find the pharmaceutical industry
making enormous profits on drugs.

00:46:06.047 --> 00:46:08.643
Let me close with this.
The three main profit centers

00:46:08.828 --> 00:46:12.616
for the pharmaceutical industry
are huge amounts of drugs for animals.

00:46:12.641 --> 00:46:16.897
There's over 10,000 different drugs,
hormones, antibiotics.

00:46:16.922 --> 00:46:21.978
Now about 85% to 90% of antibiotics
are used on animals, forced on them.

00:46:22.227 --> 00:46:26.640
So that's one of their big profit
centers is that, drugs to these animals.

00:46:26.753 --> 00:46:30.561
And the second big one is people eat
the flesh of these animals and dairy

00:46:30.586 --> 00:46:33.932
products and eggs, so they get
the diseases that I was talking earlier.

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:37.671
So they need medications for cancer,
heart disease, diabetes, and all that.

00:46:37.696 --> 00:46:40.263
So they get huge profits there.
Then the third one--

00:46:40.288 --> 00:46:44.811
the biggest one actually of all three
is the profits for people with depression,

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.737
and pain, and insomnia, and anxiety,
and panic attacks, and all these things.

00:46:48.762 --> 00:46:51.387
And they eat again,
the flesh and secretion of animals

00:46:51.412 --> 00:46:52.762
that are experiencing, what?

00:46:52.787 --> 00:46:58.351
Depression, insomnia, pain, fear, terror,
despair, anxiety, and so forth.

00:46:58.376 --> 00:47:01.219
So as we sow, so shall we reap.

00:47:01.244 --> 00:47:04.576
And yet, we have a tiny, wealthy elite
getting very rich off of that

00:47:04.601 --> 00:47:07.476
reaping of the violence
and the whole thing.

00:47:09.119 --> 00:47:13.632
There's a chapter that goes
into the basic-- it's called

00:47:13.657 --> 00:47:16.029
"The Intelligence
of Human Physiology."

00:47:16.054 --> 00:47:18.233
What are our bodies
actually designed to eat?

00:47:18.269 --> 00:47:21.056
That's the longest chapter
in the book. And  it's in there.

00:47:21.081 --> 00:47:24.688
But the beauty of that is just
to realize that all of us have been given

00:47:24.884 --> 00:47:30.258
the gift of a physical body that doesn't
require any animal to suffer to feed us.

00:47:30.283 --> 00:47:33.810
And yet, we're born into a culture
where we're taught, essentially forced,

00:47:33.835 --> 00:47:36.346
to take that gift we've been given
and throw it back

00:47:36.371 --> 00:47:38.568
 in the face
of the benevolent creator and say,

00:47:38.593 --> 00:47:41.175
I'm going to stab and kill animals
anyway to feed them.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:45.483
And we reap a lot of negative
repercussions from that.

00:47:45.508 --> 00:47:48.578
So to really learn,
what are we designed to eat?

00:47:49.203 --> 00:47:51.446
And again, I could talk
a long time about that.

00:47:51.563 --> 00:47:55.357
So there's many other ramifications
of this in other chapters

00:47:55.509 --> 00:47:58.046
in The World Peace Diet,
but that's the basic idea.

00:47:58.097 --> 00:48:02.332
And I think I'm pretty much out of time
here for-- yeah, that's perfect.

00:48:02.709 --> 00:48:06.029
So I have a few minutes, perhaps,
for questions.

00:48:07.008 --> 00:48:08.841
Perhaps if there are any questions.

00:48:09.165 --> 00:48:12.931
And also, we do have copies
of The World Peace

00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:16.101
-- actually, The World Peace Diet
is over here. It's a great price.

00:48:16.126 --> 00:48:19.944
And it was printed on
100%post-consumer recycled paper.

00:48:20.079 --> 00:48:22.500
So no trees were cut down
for The World Peace Diet.

00:48:22.979 --> 00:48:24.325
And we have the audio books.

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:28.006
We have CDs of music.
I play the piano and compose music.

00:48:28.031 --> 00:48:30.585
And art cards and art prints
of Madeleine's paintings.

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.589
And a sign-up sheet
if you want to get on her email list.

00:48:33.778 --> 00:48:37.425
We have, also, information about
The World Peace Diet Facilitator Training

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:40.554
and Mastery Program if you want to
understand this more in-depth.

00:48:40.579 --> 00:48:44.602
We've a whole network of World Peace Diet
study groups around the North America--

00:48:44.627 --> 00:48:48.354
actually, around the world. There's other
cultures as well that are doing this.

00:48:48.411 --> 00:48:51.100
And the book's being translated
into many languages also.

00:48:51.125 --> 00:48:55.093
So we're not just talking
about these ideas. But the idea is

00:48:55.174 --> 00:48:59.697
to actually try to live our lives
in alignment with our own inner wisdom.

00:48:59.744 --> 00:49:02.746
So that means, if we're eating
a regular diet, to move

00:49:02.771 --> 00:49:06.635
toward becoming a vegetarian. If we're
vegetarian, to move toward becoming vegan.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.861
If we're a vegan, to move toward becoming
a vegan educator or advocate in some way,

00:49:11.045 --> 00:49:15.501
to help spread this idea. Because I think
the more we understand these ideas

00:49:15.684 --> 00:49:19.967
and can bring our lives into alignment
with those ideas, the better chance

00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:24.335
we'll have to actually pass a planet
on to our children that'll be healthy.

00:49:24.436 --> 00:49:27.259
And we'll be able to live healthy
and happy lives ourselves.

00:49:27.363 --> 00:49:30.992
Because the underlying idea
is these universal understandings,

00:49:31.017 --> 00:49:33.872
these universal teachings that
we are all interconnected.

00:49:33.897 --> 00:49:37.931
That all life is interrelated. And that
as we bless others, we will be blessed.

00:49:38.311 --> 00:49:41.792
So does anyone have a question briefly?
I only have a couple minutes here.

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:44.934
And if you want to ask a question,
please go to this microphone.

00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:48.278
AUDIENCE: Thanks very much for coming
and speaking, and for your work.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.898
My question is--
there are several parts to it.

00:49:51.046 --> 00:49:57.389
But the basic part is why veganism,
in a sense that why does one have to go

00:49:57.582 --> 00:50:03.438
that far to break free of the lack
of consciousness in the current system?

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.904
So there have been cultures for
thousands of years that hunted animals,

00:50:08.155 --> 00:50:12.499
but did not inflict the kinds of harm that
are caused by modern day agribusiness.

00:50:13.116 --> 00:50:17.584
I've heard of Native American practices
of saying a prayer and asking forgiveness

00:50:17.805 --> 00:50:22.551
from an animal that they had hunted,
which has a degree of consciousness to it.

00:50:22.907 --> 00:50:26.845
Which may not be as nonviolent.
Also wondering if there are some people

00:50:27.019 --> 00:50:30.813
who actually require animal protein
for some reason, for particular reasons?

00:50:32.686 --> 00:50:36.250
People who have chickens at home and get
their eggs, for example.

00:50:36.543 --> 00:50:38.124
It's now part of a larger system.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:39.881
WILL TUTTLE: Right.

00:50:39.906 --> 00:50:41.395
A bunch of questions there.

00:50:41.873 --> 00:50:45.624
Most of all of those are addressed
in The World Peace Diet.

00:50:46.094 --> 00:50:49.375
I'm a little concerned on how long
I can answer these questions

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:51.042
in a short amount of time.

00:50:51.067 --> 00:50:58.043
But basically, I would say
moving toward veganism--

00:50:59.348 --> 00:51:02.953
veganism, to me, is a mentality
of radical inclusion. It's saying

00:51:02.978 --> 00:51:06.953
I'm going to include all living beings in
the sphere of my kindness and compassion.

00:51:06.978 --> 00:51:10.866
And it's also, I think, in many ways,
coming home to our essential true nature

00:51:11.671 --> 00:51:16.877
where I look with eyes that see beings
rather than seeing things.

00:51:17.346 --> 00:51:21.958
And I think anything less than that,
I mean, it's an ideal.

00:51:22.144 --> 00:51:26.526
It's a very high ideal. So I just think
it's the goal to move toward.

00:51:26.739 --> 00:51:31.054
You can be living on the outer level
of a totally vegan life, like no meat,

00:51:31.134 --> 00:51:34.324
no dairy, no eggs, no going to the zoo,
no going to the circus,

00:51:34.349 --> 00:51:36.125
not buying leather, all these things.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:39.225
But still, I get angry with people
or I judge them, or whatever.

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:40.679
That's still not vegan.

00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:46.240
The idea is really, I think, a very
sophisticated level in a sense to evolve

00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:49.145
emotionally, intellectually,
and spiritually to the point

00:51:49.301 --> 00:51:52.858
where we're living a life as much as
possible of kindness and compassion.

00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:58.037
So I think that there maybe have been
other cultures in the past that did

00:51:58.068 --> 00:52:01.179
certain things. I'm not sure.
We don't know what happened on 9/11.

00:52:01.204 --> 00:52:05.487
There's so many arguments about
what happened a 1000, or 10,000 years ago.

00:52:05.963 --> 00:52:08.742
People said that people
ate a lot of meat in the old days,

00:52:08.767 --> 00:52:10.537
and there may be some truth to that.

00:52:10.676 --> 00:52:15.176
A lot of recent research coming out from
non-meat-eating anthropologists is that

00:52:15.364 --> 00:52:17.404
actually cultures that we thought

00:52:17.429 --> 00:52:20.336
were mostly eating meat actually
were not eating mostly meat.

00:52:20.361 --> 00:52:22.790
They were actually eating
mostly plant-based foods.

00:52:22.815 --> 00:52:26.489
And whether there's a necessity
to eat meat, I don't think that's true.

00:52:26.613 --> 00:52:31.842
I've talked a lot of doctors
and researchers who disagree with that.

00:52:31.867 --> 00:52:33.939
That there's any human
being on this planet

00:52:33.964 --> 00:52:35.780
that needs to eat meat for any reason.

00:52:36.343 --> 00:52:38.928
Animals do not contribute any nutrient

00:52:39.176 --> 00:52:41.644
that they didn't get from plants
originally.

00:52:41.669 --> 00:52:47.276
 All the amino acids,
all the vitamins, minerals, fiber,

00:52:49.169 --> 00:52:53.461
essential fatty acids, carbohydrates,
all originates with plants.

00:52:53.486 --> 00:52:56.773
The only two exceptions of that
that we're aware of at this point

00:52:57.022 --> 00:53:00.709
are vitamin D, which is essentially
from the sun, and vitamin B12,

00:53:00.835 --> 00:53:04.610
which is created by bacteria which
normally we'd get in the water.

00:53:04.635 --> 00:53:08.029
But since we chlorinate it and kill
all the bacteria, and perhaps also

00:53:08.054 --> 00:53:14.200
through foods in general. But essentially,
animals don't contribute anything.

00:53:14.386 --> 00:53:16.303
I mean, the animals tend to concentrate

00:53:16.469 --> 00:53:19.532
toxins in their flesh, which we're getting
when we eat them.

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:23.045
As well as the meta-- the whole chapter
called "The Metaphysical Toxins"

00:53:23.342 --> 00:53:25.615
of eating terror, and fear, and pain.

00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:28.399
I mean, if I'm convinced in my mind

00:53:28.424 --> 00:53:31.602
that I'm not going to be healthy
unless I eat something, then sure.

00:53:31.627 --> 00:53:34.726
I could convince myself
that I was sick so I could tell my mother,

00:53:34.751 --> 00:53:37.277
I don't feel good today.
I don't want to go to school.

00:53:37.302 --> 00:53:40.338
Pretty soon I felt terrible because
I didn't want to lie to her.

00:53:40.391 --> 00:53:43.239
We have to realize that the placebo
effect is very powerful.

00:53:43.264 --> 00:53:45.343
What our minds believe
will be the reality.

00:53:45.368 --> 00:53:47.683
But instead of looking at the past

00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:50.596
to determine our behavior,
why don't we look at the future,

00:53:50.755 --> 00:53:54.913
see the kind of world we want to build,
and move forward, move toward that?

00:53:54.938 --> 00:53:58.212
We can feed everyone on a plant-based die
on a fraction of the land,

00:53:58.507 --> 00:54:00.661
with a fraction of the pollution.
Let's do it.

00:54:00.686 --> 00:54:03.411
Why do we have to look back
and say, well, they did this.

00:54:03.436 --> 00:54:05.831
People look at animals and say,
animals eat meat.

00:54:05.856 --> 00:54:08.511
But we don't say, well,
no animal is building computers.

00:54:08.668 --> 00:54:12.623
But we're building computers. We
don't have to look to these other things.

00:54:13.326 --> 00:54:16.670
The idea is to look ahead
and look what we want to create.

00:54:17.261 --> 00:54:19.636
I have a whole chapter
in The World Peace Diet

00:54:19.661 --> 00:54:22.288
of dealing with
all the rationalizations and objections

00:54:22.313 --> 00:54:24.818
that naturally come up
when people hear these ideas.

00:54:24.843 --> 00:54:28.393
We have certain ones that are told to us.
Jesus ate meat, so it must be OK.

00:54:28.418 --> 00:54:31.574
The Indians were very spiritual.
They ate meat, so it must be good.

00:54:31.599 --> 00:54:34.813
Or plants have feelings, too.
If you eat your carrots, I eat my cow,

00:54:34.838 --> 00:54:36.937
it's the same thing.
They all have feelings.

00:54:36.962 --> 00:54:41.094
There's certain standard objections
that just keep our Sophia repressed.

00:54:42.483 --> 00:54:45.706
and the other thing I'll just mention,
which I think is fascinating.

00:54:45.731 --> 00:54:49.354
Have you heard of Joseph Campbell,
the well-known mythologist? He gave

00:54:49.379 --> 00:54:54.691
a fascinating series of interviews
to Bill Moyer back in the '80s, I think.

00:54:54.942 --> 00:54:59.362
And it was so interesting because I used
to teach college classes in mythology,

00:54:59.387 --> 00:55:01.482
and I read a lot of Campbell's books.

00:55:01.514 --> 00:55:05.076
At one point Bill Moyer asked him,
he said, so, Joseph.

00:55:06.762 --> 00:55:10.404
Human beings seem to be the myth-creating
animal. We create myths.

00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:13.839
We create these stories that tell us how
things happened

00:55:13.864 --> 00:55:17.183
and why they happened, and all of that.
What is the main reason?

00:55:17.208 --> 00:55:19.383
If you could say, what is one main reason

00:55:19.408 --> 00:55:22.864
that human beings create myths,
what would it be?

00:55:22.979 --> 00:55:27.194
And Joseph Campbell said,
the one main reason that human beings

00:55:27.357 --> 00:55:34.249
create myths, these stories that explain
reality, was to rationalize and justify

00:55:34.563 --> 00:55:38.982
killing animals for food.
I went, wow.

00:55:39.404 --> 00:55:44.011
Because this is something that's always
been very hard for us to deal with.

00:55:44.255 --> 00:55:48.465
And we've created an elaborate land of
milk and honey, and Krishna and the Cow,

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:51.670
and all kinds of things to explain
and rationalize this behavior.

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:55.439
But I think we can get beyond that level.

00:55:55.464 --> 00:55:57.816
Thank you. Great question.
Really appreciate it.

00:55:57.841 --> 00:56:00.348
AUDIENCE: With your permission,
I'd like to look back

00:56:00.373 --> 00:56:02.094
to the past again if you don't mind.

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:08.612
So you mentioned that herding agriculture
is a relatively recent invention, and has

00:56:08.637 --> 00:56:12.857
a lot of not very positive effects on
human health, and welfare, and so forth.

00:56:13.701 --> 00:56:17.465
There are actually a number
of anthropologists who have looked at

00:56:17.793 --> 00:56:20.753
agricultural more generally,
like Jared Diamond, and so forth.

00:56:20.981 --> 00:56:23.792
And basically, concluded
that it was a terrible idea.

00:56:24.019 --> 00:56:28.501
That not just animals, but agriculture
in general, cereal grains and so forth.

00:56:29.126 --> 00:56:33.829
I'm just wondering what your feeling is
about that, the general aspect

00:56:34.306 --> 00:56:37.993
of pre-agricultural versus
post-agricultural health

00:56:38.082 --> 00:56:39.570
not just looking at animals.

00:56:39.694 --> 00:56:41.696
WILL TUTTLE: Yeah.
That's a great question.

00:56:41.721 --> 00:56:44.619
Basically, these people
that are writing this,

00:56:45.088 --> 00:56:47.458
I don't think they have
The World Peace Diet view.

00:56:48.421 --> 00:56:50.784
They're meat eaters.
Jared Diamond's a meat eater.

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.304
And so there's a tendency to look at
things from that perspective of,

00:56:54.535 --> 00:56:56.869
we're meat eaters
and this is how we see it.

00:56:57.066 --> 00:57:02.443
And to sort of say all agriculture is
sort of bad. It's unnatural.

00:57:02.643 --> 00:57:07.753
We should go back kind of to living
just gathering like people did.

00:57:08.171 --> 00:57:12.689
But I think, basically,
there's two kinds of agriculture.

00:57:12.714 --> 00:57:13.842
They're very different.

00:57:13.867 --> 00:57:16.695
And we have a tendency to just--
someone says, I'm a farmer.

00:57:16.745 --> 00:57:19.381
Oh, you're a farmer.
What kind of a farmer?

00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:23.034
Because there's plant agriculture's
and there's animal agriculture.

00:57:23.354 --> 00:57:27.007
And from the very beginning, plant
agriculture was essentially women's work.

00:57:27.658 --> 00:57:31.972
And it was work that was working
essentially with nature.

00:57:32.285 --> 00:57:36.056
I mean, you plant something
and this miracle happens.

00:57:36.222 --> 00:57:39.004
You plant one seed
and a thousand seeds come.

00:57:39.029 --> 00:57:41.488
And then you plant one of those
and a thousand more.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.118
Working with the abundance of nature.
You're working with cycles of nature.

00:57:45.752 --> 00:57:50.818
And with the essential abundance
and fertility of nature.

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:55.600
Whereas, with animal agriculture,
was essentially men's work.

00:57:55.852 --> 00:57:59.414
And the animals were always fighting back.
They were always resisting.

00:57:59.439 --> 00:58:02.278
They did not want to be killed,
to have their babies stolen.

00:58:02.303 --> 00:58:05.361
They did not want to be raped
and impregnated against their will.

00:58:05.645 --> 00:58:07.411
So men had to violate them.

00:58:07.568 --> 00:58:09.667
They had to hit them.
They had to rape them.

00:58:09.692 --> 00:58:13.591
They had to hold them down
and brand them, just incredible violence.

00:58:14.097 --> 00:58:18.626
And so we created a culture
mainly of meat-eating where the grains--

00:58:18.879 --> 00:58:22.441
we're feeding the grains to these animals.

00:58:22.658 --> 00:58:27.683
But all of us know, if we were to go--
anyone who goes into a well-tended

00:58:27.912 --> 00:58:31.346
and loved garden of vegetables,
it's a wonderful place to be.

00:58:31.415 --> 00:58:34.588
It's beautiful. There's biodiversity.
There's life happening there.

00:58:34.613 --> 00:58:38.012
Any one of us went into a slaughterhouse,
it's like, let me out of here.

00:58:38.037 --> 00:58:41.371
It's a horrible, terrible thing.
So I think we have to realize

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:44.493
that these are fundamentally
different ways of agriculture.

00:58:45.034 --> 00:58:48.444
And I think that we are here, personally,

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:51.493
to work in harmony with nature,
to create gardens.

00:58:51.691 --> 00:58:55.569
And the new forms of gardening
that are developing-- veganic gardening

00:58:55.776 --> 00:58:58.910
where we use no animal inputs at all,
food forests, which--

00:58:59.058 --> 00:59:01.965
there's some people in Canada,
we were just visiting them,

00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:04.516
and other places that are building
these food forests

00:59:04.811 --> 00:59:06.901
where you're growing huge amounts of food.

00:59:06.926 --> 00:59:09.323
And it doesn't even look like
it's anything there.

00:59:09.348 --> 00:59:13.245
They have fruit trees and then
other vegetables, and flowers,

00:59:13.284 --> 00:59:16.356
and things just all going together
and creating these ecosystems.

00:59:16.381 --> 00:59:19.305
As we understand these things
more and more, we realize

00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:22.490
we can grow enough food to feed everyone
on a fraction of the land.

00:59:22.515 --> 00:59:26.000
If people ate a plant-based diet,
we could have forests coming back,

00:59:26.025 --> 00:59:30.081
the rainforests coming back, the oceans
coming back. We wouldn't need to kill fish

00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:33.843
Cows, for example, are eating more fish
in the US than human beings are

00:59:33.868 --> 00:59:37.158
because we're feeding the fish
to the cows, so they'll give more milk.

00:59:37.595 --> 00:59:40.670
And it's an incredibly violent,
devastating project.

00:59:40.837 --> 00:59:44.046
And we're doing plant agriculture the way
we do animal agriculture.

00:59:44.071 --> 00:59:46.652
Since we're an animal agriculture
society essentially,

00:59:47.424 --> 00:59:51.480
 we do plant agriculture
with monocropping and violence,

00:59:51.514 --> 00:59:54.369
with all these chemicals,
and herbicides, and fungicides.

00:59:54.496 --> 00:59:57.401
It's a war against nature.
We're killing everything else.

00:59:57.448 --> 01:00:00.963
We don't want any other animals.
Any black birds, we try to kill them off.

01:00:00.988 --> 01:00:05.143
So we're looking with the lens
of animal agriculture at all agriculture.

01:00:05.264 --> 01:00:07.720
And you're right. I mean, he's right.
It's terrible.

01:00:07.745 --> 01:00:12.621
But that's because we did animal culture.
We didn't do plant agriculture properly.

01:00:12.772 --> 01:00:15.989
And I think we have the chance to do that.
But much love to you all.

01:00:16.014 --> 01:00:18.778
Thanks so much for being here,
and I'm happy to sign books

01:00:18.828 --> 01:00:21.567
if anyone wants to get a book,
or an audio book, or music,

01:00:21.646 --> 01:00:24.958
or cards, or anything. It's a great deal.
I mean, you can't go wrong.

01:00:24.983 --> 01:00:27.870
And yeah, I'm happy to answer
any questions anybody has also.

01:00:27.895 --> 01:00:29.962
So please stay around.
Bunch of love to you.

01:00:29.996 --> 01:00:32.902
Thanks, again. Thanks for coming.
Thank you.
