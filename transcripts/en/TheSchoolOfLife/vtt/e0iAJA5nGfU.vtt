00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.020
A party at the house of a friend, eleven o’clock,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.299
on a still-warm evening. A metre away from you, a group of people are chatting animatedly.

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.449
Someone is telling an anecdote, it might be something about a train ride they took or

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.900
the mishaps on someone’s bicycle, and their companions break in occasionally with rich

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.880
laughter and stories of their own. The group as a whole seem confident and attractive and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.470
the main narrator especially so. But there
may as well be a high solid brick wall or

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.580
a lamprey-filled moat between you and they.  There is resolutely no way you could ever

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.180
move in to say hello. You smile your characteristic weak, loser’s smile, pretend to study the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.110
bookshelf – and leave the gathering ten
minutes later. Much of the advice is about

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.980
what one might say in the circumstances. It could be better to start somewhere else: with

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.250
what one should think. Chronic shyness is
a guess about what other people are like.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.660
Though it doesn’t feel like it when it has
flooded us, it reflects a rationally-founded

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.630
assessment as to the nature and intentions of other members of our species. It is not

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.770
a chemical imbalance or an impulse: it’s
a philosophy – albeit a deeply unhelpful

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.770
one.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.000
Its essential assumption is that other people are self-sufficient, that they do not lack

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.630
for company, that they are not alone with
anything, that they understand all they need

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.760
to know – and that they do not share in
any of our frailties, hesitations, secret

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.410
longings or confusions. This echoes, in an
adult form, the assumptions a child might

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.450
make of their teacher, a competent stern grown-up who appears never to have been young, silly,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.310
tender or interested in a pillow fight.This
lack of faith in the humanity of others is

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.940
a natural tendency of our minds. We go by
the external cues – and few people feel

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.970
safe enough to display their  vulnerabilities. We therefore come to assume that we are living

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.190
among superior, metal-plated cyborgs rather than fragile, water-filled uncertain entities.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.620
We cannot believe that most of what we know of our own minds, especially the self-doubt,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.659
the anxiety and the sadness, must exist in
those of strangers too. We forget that we

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:32.459
also give off few signals as to what we’re
really like. We too are filled with emotions

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.590
and interests that we inadvertently end up
hiding, that others might not normally expect

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.680
of us – and that could easily lead a stranger to misjudge us and feel intimidated. But we’re

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.790
slow to convert this crucial insight into
a social strategy, into a confidence-inducing

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.989
knowledge that others must also, as we do, harbour requisite doses of warmth, longing,

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.430
curiosity and sorrow – the ingredients from which new friendships are built. A seemingly

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.169
happily-married person might have a lot of agony around the course of their relationship;

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:12.150
a pugnacious sportsman might suffer from chronic anxiety and shame; a CEO might have vivid

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.010
memories of their struggles and a lot of space in their imagination for people whose careers

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.829
have yet to take off. A very intellectual
person might – internally – be longing

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.489
for a new friend who could patiently encourage them to dance (or forgive their inept girations).

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.659
Our error is to suppose that the way a person seems is the whole of who they are: our anxiety

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:41.450
closes off the core fact that we are all much more approachable than we seem. The key to

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.059
self-belief – and to the mindset of being
able to talk to strangers successfully – doesn’t

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:52.870
lie in strenuously insisting on our own merits; its source is a more accurate and less forbidding

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.600
mode of imagining the inner lives, and especially the inner troubles, of strangers.
