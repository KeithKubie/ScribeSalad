00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.076
There are going to be about 9.6 billion
people in the world by the year 2050.

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:08.789
And if you look at the way
that yields are increasing,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.839
they're not increasing fast enough
to feed 9.6 billion people.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.149
So while past gains in
agriculture productivity

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.949
have come from using more
water and using more land,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.350
we're at a point where we don't
have those resources anymore.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.629
The three common themes that matter
are controlling the environment,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.309
measuring the environment and
analyzing what's going on.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.229
Farm View is bringing
all that together.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.809
Take a comprehensive view. Bring
all these technologies together.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.759
We use robotics for controlling.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.329
We use different types of sensor
technologies for the measurement

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.849
and often the sensors are
deployed by the robots.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.810
And then we use machine
learning for the analysis.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.639
We can grow more food with
less water and less land.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.579
So one of the things
we need to do

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.706
is transfer the kinds of research
we do in the United States

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:52.786
to parts of the world
that really need it.

00:00:52.857 --> 00:00:55.397
So that they can
create better crops

00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:57.029
that then go to their
local growers.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.509
That the growers can grow then
using their traditional methods

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.629
or however their food system
currently works.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.000
We just give them a better plant
that makes them more productive.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.829
Locally, there are
many small farms

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.869
that are right on the edge
of being able to survive.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.457
And with the increase in
efficiency that we can provide

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.473
with better sensing and better
technologies they can stay in business.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.122
When we do this kind of work,

00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:25.369
we have to work with
experts from other fields.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.429
Land grant universities,
government agencies,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.449
local growers who are
producing crops.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.882
We have a wide range of
partners that we work with

00:01:31.933 --> 00:01:33.649
to really bring this
stuff into the field

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.239
and make sure that we're actually solving
problems that need to be solved.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.179
Being that conduit
from these basic fundamental research

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.276
to solving real problems

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.164
is one of the big impacts that
Carnegie Mellon can have on the world.
