00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:17.634
A lot of people call me
a "justice architect."

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:20.802
But I don't design prisons.

00:00:21.786 --> 00:00:23.461
I don't design jails.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.058
I don't design detention centers,
and I don't even design courthouses.

00:00:28.872 --> 00:00:32.799
All the same, I get a call every week,

00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:37.172
saying, "OK, but you design
better prisons, right?

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:40.116
You know, like those pretty ones
they're building in Europe."

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.188
And I always pause.

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.864
And I invite them,

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:47.161
and I invite you today,

00:00:47.617 --> 00:00:49.950
to imagine a world without prisons.

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:54.402
What does that justice feel and look like?

00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:58.086
What do we need to build to get there?

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:03.395
I'd like to show you some ideas today
of things that we're building.

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:06.371
And I'm going to start
with an early prototype.

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:08.553
This I built when I was five.

00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:10.391
I call it "the healing hut."

00:01:11.212 --> 00:01:14.319
And I built it after I got
sent home from school

00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:18.013
for punching this kid in the face
because he called me the N-word.

00:01:18.037 --> 00:01:19.304
OK, he deserved it.

00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:22.267
It happened a lot, though,

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:27.107
because my family had desegregated
a white community in rural Virginia.

00:01:28.093 --> 00:01:30.433
And I was really scared.

00:01:30.893 --> 00:01:32.069
I was afraid.

00:01:32.498 --> 00:01:33.648
I was angry.

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:37.744
And so I would run into the forest,
and I would build these little huts.

00:01:37.768 --> 00:01:42.094
They were made out of twigs and leaves
and blankets I had taken from my mom.

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:46.094
And as the light would stream
into my refuge,

00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:48.750
I would feel at peace.

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:53.504
Despite my efforts to comfort myself,

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:56.617
I still left my community
as soon as I could,

00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:58.664
and I went to architecture school

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:02.358
and then into a professional career
designing shopping centers,

00:02:02.382 --> 00:02:03.783
homes for the wealthy

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:05.339
and office buildings,

00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:09.657
until I stepped into a prison
for the first time.

00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:14.241
It was the Chester State
Correctional Institution in Pennsylvania.

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:16.331
And my friend, she invited me there

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:18.514
to work with some
of her incarcerated students

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:21.937
and teach them about
the positive power of design.

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:24.772
The irony is so obvious, right?

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:28.252
As I approached this concrete building,
these tiny little windows,

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:31.759
barbed wire, high walls,
observation towers,

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.021
and on the inside,
these cold, hard spaces,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.300
little light or air,

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.180
the guards are screaming,
the doors are clanking,

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:46.461
there's a wall of cells filled with
so many black and brown bodies.

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:50.114
And I realized that what I was seeing

00:02:50.138 --> 00:02:54.875
was the end result of our racist policies
that had caused mass incarceration.

00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.315
But as an architect, what I was seeing

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:02.172
was how a prison is the worst
building type we could have created

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:04.744
to address the harm
that we're doing to one another.

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.718
I thought, "Well, could I design
an alternative to this,

00:03:08.742 --> 00:03:10.743
other than building a prettier prison?"

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:13.463
It didn't feel good to me;
it still doesn't feel good.

00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:16.958
But back then, I just
didn't know what to do.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:19.107
What do we build instead of this?

00:03:20.348 --> 00:03:23.281
And then I heard
about restorative justice.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.966
I felt at peace again,

00:03:26.632 --> 00:03:29.458
because here was an alternative system

00:03:29.482 --> 00:03:34.163
that says when a crime is committed,
it is a breach of relationship,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.061
that the needs of those
who have been harmed

00:03:37.085 --> 00:03:38.965
must be addressed first;

00:03:39.657 --> 00:03:42.244
that those who have committed the offense

00:03:42.268 --> 00:03:44.624
have an obligation to make amends.

00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:47.488
And what they are
are really intense dialogues,

00:03:47.512 --> 00:03:52.739
where all stakeholders come together
to find a way to repair the breach.

00:03:53.695 --> 00:03:57.052
Early data shows that
restorative justice builds empathy;

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.540
that it reduces violent reoffending
by up to 75 percent;

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.500
that it eases PTSD in survivors
of the most severe violence.

00:04:06.877 --> 00:04:08.806
And because of these reasons,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.656
we see prosecutors and judges
and district attorneys

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.252
starting to divert cases out of court
and into restorative justice

00:04:15.276 --> 00:04:18.656
so that some people never
touch the system altogether.

00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:22.713
And so I thought, "Well, damn --
why aren't we designing for this system?"

00:04:22.737 --> 00:04:23.999
(Applause)

00:04:24.023 --> 00:04:26.522
Instead of building prisons,

00:04:26.546 --> 00:04:29.994
we should be building spaces
to amplify restorative justice.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.148
And so I started in schools,

00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:37.029
because suspensions and expulsions

00:04:37.053 --> 00:04:40.340
have been fueling the pathway
to prison for decades.

00:04:40.953 --> 00:04:43.840
And many school districts --
probably some of your own --

00:04:43.864 --> 00:04:46.870
are turning to restorative justice
as an alternative.

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:51.601
So, my first project -- I just turned
this dirty little storage room

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:55.379
into a peacemaking room
for a program in a high school

00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:57.203
in my hometown of Oakland.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.058
And after we were done, the director said

00:05:01.082 --> 00:05:03.670
that the circles
she was holding in this space

00:05:03.694 --> 00:05:06.693
were more powerful in bringing
the community together

00:05:06.717 --> 00:05:10.288
after fighting at school
and gun violence in the community,

00:05:10.673 --> 00:05:13.736
and that students and teachers
started to come here

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.427
just because they saw it
as a space of refuge.

00:05:17.434 --> 00:05:22.845
So what was happening is that the space
was amplifying the effects of the process.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.692
OK, then I did something
that architects always do, y'all.

00:05:29.323 --> 00:05:32.871
I was like, I'm going to build
something massive now, right?

00:05:32.895 --> 00:05:37.679
I'm going to build the world's first
restorative justice center all by myself.

00:05:38.173 --> 00:05:41.188
And it's going to be
a beautiful figure on the skyline,

00:05:41.212 --> 00:05:43.037
like a beacon in the night.

00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:46.934
Thousands of people will come here
instead of going to court.

00:05:46.958 --> 00:05:49.704
I will single-handedly
end mass incarceration

00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:51.955
and win lots of design awards.

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.752
(Laughter)

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:56.329
And then I checked myself --

00:05:56.353 --> 00:05:57.815
(Laughter)

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.266
because here's the deal:

00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:03.523
we are incarcerating more
of our citizens per capita

00:06:03.547 --> 00:06:05.156
than any country in the world.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.458
And the fastest-growing
population there are black women.

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:12.601
Ninety-five percent
of all these folks are coming home.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.931
And most of them are survivors of severe
sexual, physical and emotional abuse.

00:06:20.323 --> 00:06:22.870
They have literally been
on both sides of the harm.

00:06:23.577 --> 00:06:25.950
So I thought, uh, maybe I should ask them

00:06:25.974 --> 00:06:28.212
what we should build instead of prisons.

00:06:29.317 --> 00:06:33.515
So I returned with
a restorative justice expert,

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.643
and we started to run
the country's first design studios

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:38.537
with incarcerated men and women

00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:41.607
around the intersection
of restorative justice and design.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.649
And it was transformative for me.

00:06:43.673 --> 00:06:48.080
I saw all these people behind walls
in a totally different way.

00:06:48.998 --> 00:06:52.784
These were souls deeply committed
to their personal transformation

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:54.274
and being accountable.

00:06:54.602 --> 00:06:57.336
They were creative, they were visionary.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.443
Danny is one of those souls.

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:05.871
He's been incarcerated
at San Quentin for 27 years

00:07:05.895 --> 00:07:08.557
for taking a life at the age of 21.

00:07:09.474 --> 00:07:11.093
From the very beginning,

00:07:11.117 --> 00:07:14.085
he's been focused
on being accountable for that act

00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:16.959
and doing his best to make amends
from behind bars.

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:24.379
He brought that work into a design
for a community center

00:07:24.403 --> 00:07:26.536
for reconciliation and wellness.

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:29.125
It was a beautiful design, right?

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:32.577
So it's this green campus
filled with these circular structures

00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:34.458
for victim and offender dialogue.

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:37.664
And when he presented the project to me,

00:07:37.688 --> 00:07:39.115
he started crying.

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:45.572
He said, "After being in the brutality
of San Quentin for so long,

00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:48.220
we don't think reconciliation will happen.

00:07:49.611 --> 00:07:53.832
This design is for a place that fulfills
the promise of restorative justice.

00:07:55.331 --> 00:07:56.931
And it feels closer now."

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.656
I know for a fact

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.950
that just the visualization of spaces
for restorative justice and healing

00:08:05.974 --> 00:08:07.133
are transformative.

00:08:07.157 --> 00:08:09.680
I've seen it in our workshops
over and over again.

00:08:09.704 --> 00:08:13.458
But I think we know that just visualizing
these spaces is not enough.

00:08:13.482 --> 00:08:15.153
We have to build them.

00:08:16.188 --> 00:08:19.455
And so I started to look
for justice innovators.

00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:22.270
They are not easy to find.

00:08:22.732 --> 00:08:23.938
But I found one.

00:08:24.544 --> 00:08:26.847
I found the Center for Court Innovation.

00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:30.594
They were bringing Native American
peacemaking practices

00:08:30.618 --> 00:08:32.371
into a non-Native community

00:08:32.395 --> 00:08:34.998
for the very first time
in the United States.

00:08:35.022 --> 00:08:37.061
And I approached them, and I said,

00:08:37.085 --> 00:08:40.045
"OK, well, as you set up your process,

00:08:40.069 --> 00:08:43.863
could I work with the community
to design a peacemaking center?"

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:47.006
And they said yes.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.363
Thank God, because
I had no backup to these guys.

00:08:51.466 --> 00:08:55.164
And so, in the Near Westside
of Syracuse, New York,

00:08:55.188 --> 00:08:58.879
we started to run design workshops
with the community

00:08:58.903 --> 00:09:02.204
to both locate and reenvision
an old drug house

00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:04.095
to be a peacemaking center.

00:09:04.537 --> 00:09:07.752
The Near Westside
Peacemaking Project is complete.

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:10.220
And they are already running
over 80 circles a year,

00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:12.425
with a very interesting outcome,

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:14.118
and that it is the space itself

00:09:14.142 --> 00:09:16.547
that's convincing people
to engage in peacemaking

00:09:16.571 --> 00:09:18.594
for the very first time in their lives.

00:09:19.807 --> 00:09:22.918
Isabel and her daughter are some
of those community members.

00:09:22.942 --> 00:09:25.609
And they had been referred to peacemaking

00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:29.283
to heal their relationship
after a history of family abuse,

00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:30.666
sexual abuse

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.516
and other issues that they'd been having
in their own family

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.766
and the community.

00:09:35.133 --> 00:09:37.760
And, you know, Isabel didn't want
to do peacemaking.

00:09:37.784 --> 00:09:40.069
She was like, "This is just
like going to court.

00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:41.656
What is this peacemaking stuff?"

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.776
But when she showed up,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.069
she was stressed, she was anxious.

00:09:46.093 --> 00:09:48.681
But when she got in,
she kind of looked around,

00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:50.053
and she settled in.

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.776
And she turned
to the coordinator and said,

00:09:53.446 --> 00:09:56.326
"I feel comfortable here -- at ease.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.580
It's homey."

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.967
Isabel and her daughter
made a decision that day

00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:05.783
to engage and complete
the peacemaking process.

00:10:05.807 --> 00:10:08.815
And today, their relationship
is transformed;

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:11.038
they're doing really well
and they're healing.

00:10:12.955 --> 00:10:15.330
So after this project,
I didn't go into a thing

00:10:15.354 --> 00:10:17.701
where I'm going to make a huge
peacemaking center.

00:10:17.725 --> 00:10:22.022
I did want to have peacemaking
centers in every community.

00:10:22.847 --> 00:10:24.826
But then a new idea emerged.

00:10:25.744 --> 00:10:30.197
I was doing a workshop
in Santa Rita Jail in California,

00:10:30.221 --> 00:10:33.966
and one of our incarcerated
designers, Doug, said,

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.411
"Yeah, you know, repairing the harm,
getting back on my feet, healing --

00:10:37.435 --> 00:10:38.751
really important.

00:10:38.775 --> 00:10:41.219
But the reality is, Deanna,
when I get home,

00:10:41.243 --> 00:10:43.664
I don't have anywhere to go.

00:10:43.688 --> 00:10:45.918
I have no job -- who's going to hire me?

00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:47.686
I'm just going to end up back here."

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.410
And you know what, he's right,

00:10:49.434 --> 00:10:53.656
because 60 to 75 percent of those
returning to their communities

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.918
will be unemployed
a year after their release.

00:10:57.315 --> 00:11:00.942
We also know, if you can't meet
your basic economic needs,

00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:02.463
you're going to commit crime --

00:11:02.487 --> 00:11:03.843
any of us would do that.

00:11:05.173 --> 00:11:08.839
So instead of building prisons,

00:11:08.863 --> 00:11:13.474
what we could build are spaces
for job training and entrepreneurship.

00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:16.655
These are spaces for what we call
"restorative economics."

00:11:17.387 --> 00:11:20.252
Located in East Oakland, California,

00:11:20.276 --> 00:11:23.046
"Restore Oakland" will be
the country’s first center

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.664
for restorative justice
and restorative economics.

00:11:25.688 --> 00:11:31.728
(Applause)

00:11:31.752 --> 00:11:33.355
So here's what we're going to do.

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:36.585
We're going to gut this building
and turn it into three things.

00:11:36.609 --> 00:11:38.887
First, a restaurant called "Colors,"

00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:41.760
that will break the racial divide
in the restaurant industry

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:43.784
by training low-wage restaurant workers

00:11:43.808 --> 00:11:45.752
to get living-wage jobs in fine dining.

00:11:45.776 --> 00:11:48.450
It does not matter if you have
a criminal record or not.

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:52.514
On the second floor,
we have bright, open, airy spaces

00:11:52.538 --> 00:11:55.705
to support a constellation
of activist organizations

00:11:55.729 --> 00:11:59.164
to amplify their cry
of "Healthcare Not Handcuffs,"

00:11:59.188 --> 00:12:00.778
and "Housing as a human right."

00:12:01.276 --> 00:12:06.768
And third, the county's first
dedicated space for restorative justice,

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:10.379
filled with nature, color,
texture and spaces of refuge

00:12:10.403 --> 00:12:12.331
to support the dialogues here.

00:12:12.804 --> 00:12:15.438
This project breaks ground
in just two months.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.422
And we have plans to replicate it

00:12:17.446 --> 00:12:20.962
in Washington D.C., Detroit,
New York and New Orleans.

00:12:20.986 --> 00:12:26.424
(Applause)

00:12:30.609 --> 00:12:33.680
So you've seen two things
we can build instead of prisons.

00:12:33.704 --> 00:12:36.228
And look, the price point is better.

00:12:36.252 --> 00:12:40.852
For one jail, we can build
30 restorative justice centers.

00:12:40.876 --> 00:12:42.356
(Applause)

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.966
That is a better use of your tax dollars.

00:12:45.982 --> 00:12:48.115
So I want to build all of these.

00:12:48.712 --> 00:12:51.131
But building buildings
is a really heavy lift.

00:12:51.155 --> 00:12:52.305
It takes time.

00:12:53.188 --> 00:12:56.061
And what was happening
in the communities that I was serving

00:12:56.085 --> 00:13:00.818
is we were losing people every week
to gun violence and mass incarceration.

00:13:01.521 --> 00:13:05.724
We needed to serve more people and faster
and keep them out of the system.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.307
And a new idea emerged from the community,

00:13:09.331 --> 00:13:11.931
one that was a lot lighter on its feet.

00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:16.843
Instead of building prisons,
we could build villages on wheels.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.219
It's called the Pop-Up Resource Village,

00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:24.116
and it brings an entire
constellation of resources

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.347
to isolated communities
in the greater San Francisco area,

00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:30.966
including mobile medical,
social services and pop-up shops.

00:13:32.022 --> 00:13:33.378
And so what we're doing now

00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:36.164
is we're building this whole village
with the community,

00:13:36.188 --> 00:13:41.053
starting with transforming municipal buses
into classrooms on wheels

00:13:41.077 --> 00:13:44.982
that bring GED and high school
education across turf lines.

00:13:45.006 --> 00:13:46.157
(Applause)

00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:49.074
We will serve thousands
of more students with this.

00:13:49.581 --> 00:13:51.792
We're creating mobile spaces of refuge

00:13:51.816 --> 00:13:54.459
for women released from jail
in the middle of the night,

00:13:54.483 --> 00:13:55.800
at their most vulnerable.

00:13:56.246 --> 00:14:00.109
Next summer, the village will launch,
and it pops up every single week,

00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:03.344
expanding to more and more
communities as it goes.

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:05.355
So look out for it.

00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:10.387
(Applause)

00:14:10.411 --> 00:14:13.177
So what do we build instead of prisons?

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:15.339
We've looked at three things:

00:14:15.363 --> 00:14:16.783
peacemaking centers,

00:14:16.807 --> 00:14:20.212
centers for restorative justice
and restorative economics

00:14:20.236 --> 00:14:21.569
and pop-up villages.

00:14:23.038 --> 00:14:26.434
But I'm telling you,
I have a list a mile long.

00:14:27.403 --> 00:14:30.990
This is customized housing for youth
transitioning out of foster care.

00:14:31.014 --> 00:14:34.291
These are reentry centers for women
to reunite with their children.

00:14:34.315 --> 00:14:37.249
These are spaces
for survivors of violence.

00:14:37.807 --> 00:14:40.934
These are spaces
that address the root causes

00:14:40.958 --> 00:14:42.569
of mass incarceration.

00:14:42.593 --> 00:14:46.497
And not a single one of them
is a jail or a prison.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.522
Activist, philosopher, writer
Cornel West says

00:14:53.363 --> 00:14:55.934
that "Justice is what love
looks like in public."

00:14:56.871 --> 00:15:01.291
So with this in mind,
I ask you one more time

00:15:01.315 --> 00:15:04.013
to imagine a world without prisons,

00:15:05.038 --> 00:15:08.712
and join me in creating all the things
that we could build instead.

00:15:09.545 --> 00:15:10.696
Thank you.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.613
(Applause)
