- [Ray] I should first give equal billing
to Eva Wittenberg who did a lot of this

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:15.980
work with me. Can you identify yourself
there? Yay, right there. One of the big

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.070
questions for anthropogeny is, "How did
language evolve in our species?"

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.400
This is a big question. My almost
five-year-old granddaughter asked a couple

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.910
of weeks ago, she asked, "How did people
make up words when there weren't words

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.250
before?" So I mean it's an obvious
question. Well here's the thing.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.680
Languages are learned by children and
their progress looks like learning other

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.670
things like motor skills and social
skills. So a lot of people think there's

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.630
nothing more to it than that. Humans just
got to be good at learning stuff. So I

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.510
want to restate the question not, "How did
human language evolve?" but, "How did

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.060
humans evolve so as to be able to learn
language as well as all those other

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.200
things?" And in order to answer this, you
have to ask another question, "When you

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.090
learn a language, what do you end up
knowing?" For starters knowing a language

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.430
is being able to map between patterns of
sounds or gestures on one hand and

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.200
meanings, or thoughts or concepts whatever
they are. So something like this. So when

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.700
you're speaking, you're going upwards in
this picture from meanings to producing

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.420
sounds, and when you're understanding,
you're going downward. Now let me add a

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.250
little bit of the big picture. Conceptual
structures are also linked to perception

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.610
and action. So you can talk about what you
see and you can talk about what actions

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.190
you plan to carry out and so on. Now just
for fun, what do you get if you take away

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.910
phonetic patterns like this? Well you get
an organism that can perceive, and have

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.460
thoughts and act based on those thoughts.
And I think this is a plausible sketch of

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.960
ape cognition, which is pretty
sophisticated, but it doesn't have

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.510
language. So the evolution of language had
to involve at least a new ability to map

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.130
concepts to sounds and gestures
and to use these communicatively.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.220
Well we've been hearing this all day.
Well linguists actually think there's a

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.750
good deal more to that than language.
First comes phonological structure, which

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.240
is the systematized organization of sounds
or gestures, and we just heard about that

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.255
from David Perlmutter in ASL.

00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:29.830
Second one is morphology, the
internal structure of words such that a

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.959
word like, say "procedurally" can be seen
as built from "proceed" plus "ure" to form

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:39.930
"procedure," plus "al" to perform
procedural, plus "ly" to perform

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.420
"procedurally." And the third one is
syntax, the organization of words into

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.490
phrases and sentences. So syntax
determines things like canonical word

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:54.160
order. So if you hear something like,"The
boy kissed the girl," you know who did

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.220
the kissing and who got kissed. It also
allows you to elaborate descriptions of

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.470
characters and events into phrases. So
something like, "The boy in the blue hat

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.850
and red sneakers tried to kiss the girl
that he loved," and you still know that

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.710
the boy did the kissing, even though the
word "boy" is nowhere near "kiss," and you

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.780
also know that he the loved the girl even
though "boy" is nowhere near "love." So

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.760
language in modern humans involves this
part circled in red of the network of

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.150
cognitive organization. And what's evolved
in humans is the ability to learn to do

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.690
this kind of thing to turn thoughts into
sounds by structuring them into words

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.550
and phrases and to be able to pull
thoughts out of the sounds that other

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:42.640
people make. Well how could this have
happened? Basically there's no direct

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.520
evidence for what our ancestors talked
about and when they started talking. There

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:55.870
aren't any fossil vowels. The usual way to
test evolutionary scenarios is comparison

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.120
to other species. But here it isn't too
helpful as we've heard already today,

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.690
modern apes don't learn very much in the
way of human languages, and they certainly

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:11.160
don't invent language spontaneously as
deaf children do in the absence of sign

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.174
language input as we also
have heard about today.

00:06:14.174 --> 00:06:20.020
So there's a big cognitive gap between
apes and humans here. Another way to form

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.830
plausible hypothesis about evolution is
through reverse engineering, figuring out

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.210
what components could have been useful in
the absence of others. So think about the

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.120
eye. A primitive retina would have been
useful for vision without the muscles that

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.752
move the eyeball although it might be
more limited than our modern vision. On

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.830
the other hand, without a retina the
muscles wouldn't help you see at all. So

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.910
it makes sense that something like the
retina probably evolved before the

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.450
muscles. I want to propose something like
that for language. So a primitive system

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.680
for communicating thoughts via sounds or
gestures is useful without phonology,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.370
morphology or syntax. These components can
improve an existing communication system,

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.620
but they're useless on their own. So if
the components of language evolved in some

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.810
order it makes sense that the connection
between phonetics and meaning came first,

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:16.440
and then these further refinements going
from there to. . . So the hypothesis is

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.090
that this is the kind of system that some
ancestors of modern humans could learn.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.570
I can't prove that this is the way
language evolved, but what I'll try to do

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.200
today is to show you the simpler systems
of this sort exist in the languages of

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.220
today and show you a little bit
about how these systems work.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.200
And the basic idea comes from Derek
Bickerton. He proposed that there's a form

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.230
of language that he called
"protolanguage," which surfaces in many

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.821
different circumstances, and he proposed
that this form of language is a relic of

00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:54.192
early stages in the human or Hominid
system. I'm going to suggest that this

00:07:54.192 --> 00:08:00.289
form of language is a subset of the full
language system. It omits morphology and

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:04.710
syntax and I'll call it a linear grammar.
What is a linear grammar like?

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:10.820
Well it has words and the words have to
come in some order. They map to meanings

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.910
but there's no structure. There aren't
syntactic phrases like, "The boy in the

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.840
blue hat and red sneakers," or structure
inside words as we saw with the word

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.910
"procedurally." Now in this kind of
language, word order could still matter.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.590
You could say, "Boy kissed girl," and
mean that the boy did the kissing and the

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:36.200
girl got kissed, not vice versa, but it
wouldn't be because the subject precedes

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.280
the verb and the verb precedes the object.
Because a linear grammar can't have

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.839
syntactic things like nouns, and verbs,
and subjects and objects. What it still

00:08:44.839 --> 00:08:51.138
has is semantic notions like the word
denoting an actor here, "the boy" precedes

00:08:51.138 --> 00:08:55.345
the word denoting the action namely
"kiss." That is this kind of language

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:00.641
would map directly between linear order
and phonology and the meaning. Now a

00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:04.760
linear grammar doesn't have morphology,
so it can't have things likes tenses and

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.380
agreement on verbs. So you'll get, "Boy
kiss girl," not "Boy kissed girl" or "Boy

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.100
kisses girl." You'll leave it up to the
context to indicate when this kissing took

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.620
place. And you might also expect not to
have functional items like definite

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.440
articles, which perform more of a
syntactic role, namely marking noun

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:28.840
phrases than a semantic one. And a linear
grammar is linear, so it can't have

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:34.400
subordinate clauses like the relative
clause in "The girl that he loved." You

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.890
might still express this thought but
maybe as two sentences. You might say

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.973
something like, "Boy love girl. Kiss
girl." Something like that. Well I want to

00:09:43.973 --> 00:09:48.660
tell you about some systems that look like
this. The first one is pidgins. These are

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.370
the early stages of contact languages as
we also heard about earlier today. This is

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:58.360
great. This symposium just set up my
talk perfectly. Pidgins are often

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:04.370
described as having no subordination, no
morphology, no grammatical words like

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.750
"the," and they have unstable word order
that's governed by semantic principles

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.980
like actor before action.
If the context permits, you can leave out

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.250
characters in the action. So if you
already knew about the girl you might

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.770
just say, "Boy kiss," where English would
make you use a pronoun like, "The boy

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:25.770
kissed her." So from the perspective of
linear grammar we can ask, "Is there any

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.450
evidence that pidgins have parts of speech
like nouns and verbs? Is there any

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.690
evidence for syntactic phrases?" And my
preliminary conclusion is there's very

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:42.500
little evidence for it and suggests that
pidgins would be a good example of a

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.690
linear grammar. Later on of course
contact languages add many features of

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.010
more complex languages like
conventionalized word order, grammatical

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.830
categories, syntactic subordination
again as we heard today. And these kinds

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.883
of languages are called creoles. And Eva
and I see the transition form from a

00:11:00.883 --> 00:11:07.020
pidgin to creole as going not from it's
not a language it's just junk to a

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.128
language. Now it's a language. But just
adding some syntactic and morphological

00:11:11.128 --> 00:11:16.396
principles that weren't there in the
pidgin just goosing it up a little bit.

00:11:16.396 --> 00:11:22.675
For a second case, Wolfgang Klein and
Clive Perdue did a multi-language

00:11:22.675 --> 00:11:27.915
longitudinal study of immigrants all over
Europe learning second languages. And they

00:11:27.915 --> 00:11:31.753
found that all speakers achieved a stage
of what you might call semi-proficiency

00:11:31.753 --> 00:11:37.652
that Klein and Perdue called the "basic
variety." Many speakers went on to improve

00:11:37.652 --> 00:11:42.187
on it, but others just stopped there.
That's as far as they got. And in this

00:11:42.187 --> 00:11:46.416
stage as they describe it there's no
inflection or morphology, no tenses, no

00:11:46.416 --> 00:11:50.536
plurals and so on, no sentential
subordination. You can leave out known

00:11:50.536 --> 00:11:55.552
characters freely. There's simple and
semantically-based principles of word

00:11:55.552 --> 00:11:58.161
order including
our favorite

00:11:58.161 --> 00:12:02.580
actor before action. That is from
our standpoint the basic variety also

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:11.220
looks like another kind of linear grammar.
Third case is home sign. As we've heard

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.040
already the languages invented by deaf
children who have no exposure to a signed

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.560
language and Susan Goldin-Meadow has
shown that they have at most rudimentary

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:26.050
morphology. They freely emit known
characters. And on our analysis they only

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.810
have a semantic distinction of object
versus action not a syntactic distinction

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:37.440
of noun versus verb. The word order is
kind of probabilistic, but if anything

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.767
it's based on semantic roles. Home signers
do produce some sentences with multiple

00:12:42.767 --> 00:12:47.164
verbs or action words if you don't think
they have verbs. Goldin-Meadow has in the

00:12:47.164 --> 00:12:51.290
past described these as embedding. We
think these are rudimentary serial verb

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:56.080
constructions, which I can't explain to
non-linguists, I'm sorry without

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:04.140
embedding. So it looks to us like a linear
grammar with possibly a bit of morphology

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.830
added. And I should add to be perfectly
honest Goldin-Meadow does't agree with us

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.520
altogether. So this is controversial.
Another case we've looked at is village

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.460
sign languages, which develop in isolated
communities where there's a significant

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.520
occurrence of hereditary deafness. And the
best known of these is ABSL, which we've

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.510
just heard about from Mark Aronoff. I'm
going to talk about Central Taurus Sign

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.650
Language or CTSL, which is spoken in a
couple of remote villages in the mountains

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:37.460
of Turkey. This language came to my
attention two years ago thorough my

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:42.260
student Rabia Ergin who remarkably has
deaf family members who live in the

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.240
village and speak it. You want to raise
your hand, Rabia, our new celebrity? There

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.800
she is. Rabia, along with Naomi Caselli,
Irit Meir and some of the people from

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:56.587
Carol Padden's group from about which
we've heard already have been documenting

00:13:56.587 --> 00:14:01.500
this language. And what they find is that
the language has a fair amount of

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.075
morphology, but there's very little
evidence for syntactic structure in

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:11.770
sentences involving one character.
So somebody jumped or somebody fell down

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:17.060
or something. The word order is normally
the actor preceding the action. If there

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.620
are two character sentences with inanimate
patients like, "The boy rolled the ball,"

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:25.720
it's normally well maybe you put in the
actor maybe you don't,  and then you put

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:30.450
in the thing that's acted upon and then
the action. But if there are two animate

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.890
characters, so the semantics alone can't
resolve the potential ambiguity, word

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.270
order isn't very stable. It's a bit vague
whether they boy kissed the girl or vice

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:45.100
versa. And there's a lot of reliance.
People rely a lot on pragmatics and

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.250
context. In fact, there's a very strong
tendency to mention only one of the

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:55.050
characters in an event no matter how many
there are. So a CTSL looks like a linear

00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:00.060
grammar augmented by a substantial amount
of morphology and this isn't too far off

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.710
what we've seen in ABSL and the earlier
stages of Nicaraguan sign languages we

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:10.580
heard from Annie Senghas. Now what's cool
I think is that these less complex

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.130
systems aren't confined to emerging
languages. Townsend and Bever discuss what

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.550
they call "semantically-based interpretive
strategies" that influence language

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:24.830
comprehension. Hearers tend to rely in
part on semantically based principles of

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.420
word order like actor precedes action
which is why on our story they have more

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.590
difficulty with constructions such as
reversible passives and object relatives.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.990
Again, for the non-linguist, it doesn't
matter. Where the actor doesn't precede

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.140
the action. That's the crucial thing.
Similarly Fernanda Ferreira and her

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:48.030
colleagues discussed what they call good
enough parsing where people apparently

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.960
rely on linear order and semantic
plausibility rather than syntactic

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.760
structure. And it's well-known that we see
similar symptoms in language comprehension

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.720
by a grammatic aphasics. And Heather
van der Lely has argued that a particular

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.380
population of children with specific
language impairment behave as though

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.910
they're processing language through
something like a linear grammar.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:15.130
The literature describes these so-called
strategies or heuristics as something

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.540
separate from language, but there's still
mappings between phonology and meaning.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:26.890
They're just simpler ones that bypass
syntax. So we conjecture that the language

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.860
processor makes use of both syntactic
grammar and the simpler linear grammar.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.450
And when the two kinds of rules produce
conflicting analysis interpretation is

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:41.250
slower and less stable even when the
syntax wins out. And when the syntactic

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.800
rules break down under conditions of
stress or disability then the linear

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.840
grammar is still there doing its thing.
We've also come across two full-blown

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.530
languages whose grammar appears to be
close to a linear grammar. And others have

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:58.310
come along that I haven't looked at very
closely yet. But one of them is Riau

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.750
Indonesian. This is a vernacular with
several million speakers described by

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:08.290
David Gil. Gil argues that this language
has no syntactic parts of speech, no

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:13.040
inflection or morphology like tense, or
plural or agreement. Known characters in

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.300
the discourse are freely omitted, and
things that English expresses with

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:22.560
syntactic subordination are expressed in
Riau by simply jamming simple sentences

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:28.350
together like "Boy kiss love girl." The
word order is pretty free, but actors tend

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:34.290
to precede actions and actions tend to
precede patients. But here's some

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.150
illustration of the freedom of this
language. If you have the expression

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.290
"chicken eat," this can mean all of
these different things depending on the

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:46.100
context. And the ones at the bottom, where
you say, "Chicken eat," and you mean

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.970
someone is eating with the chicken. They
require a lot, or where the chicken is

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:56.740
eating, they require a lot of contextual
support, but people do say these things.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.100
So this again looks like a linear grammar.
So here's basically a full language that's

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.320
syntactically simple in our sense.
Another example is the controversial case

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.480
of Pirahá studied extensively by
Dan Everett. This has exuberant

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:16.220
morphology, so it's not simple in this
respect. It seems to have a syntactic

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.530
noun-verb distinction and fairly fixed
word order, but no definite or indefinite

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:26.570
articles, no markers of plurality, no
agreement. Now Everett's most famous

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:33.090
claim is that Pirahá likes recursion that
is subordinate clauses. Everything that's

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.900
expressed in English with recursive syntax
either just jam simple sentences together

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.320
or require some sort of circumlocution. So
this looks like a syntactically relatively

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:49.630
simple language, though not a simple as
Riau Indonesian. So to sum up we find

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:54.400
that's remarkably similar grammatical
systems turn up in all these different

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.840
scenarios, and it suggests that linear
grammar is quite a robust phenomenon

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:04.260
entrenched in the modern human brain. It
provides a scaffolding on top of which

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.740
fully syntactic languages can develop
either in an individual as in the case of

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.875
the basic variety or in a community as
we've seen with sign languages and

00:19:13.875 --> 00:19:18.310
creoles, and it provides a sort of safety
net when syntactic grammar is damaged as

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.491
we've seen with aphasia and specific
language impairment. And we've also seen

00:19:22.491 --> 00:19:27.540
that you can say a lot without syntax for
example in Riau Indonesian though having

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.340
syntax gives you a lot more fancy tools
for expressing yourself. So let me go back

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.310
to the original question about the
evolution of the human ability to learn

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:41.660
language. I suggest that we can think
about it through reverse engineering

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.952
asking what kind of system there could
have been that preceded the modern human

00:19:45.952 --> 00:19:50.042
language faculty. And I think linear
grammar's a good candidate. As I said at

00:19:50.042 --> 00:19:56.790
the beginning, I have no idea how we could
prove it nor when the Hominid line

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.500
achieved either linear grammar or
syntactic grammar. Maybe some day we'll

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.580
get better evidence from genetics.
But for now I'm happy to see it as an

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:11.280
intriguing hypothesis. So altogether then
we think this is telling us a lot of

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.315
interesting and new things about the
texture of the human faculty, and I'm

00:20:15.315 --> 00:20:18.423
eager to get on with filling
in the picture further. Thank you.
