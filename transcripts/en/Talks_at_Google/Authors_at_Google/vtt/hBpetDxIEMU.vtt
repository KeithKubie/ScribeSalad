00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; MERRILL: I'm Douglas Merrill. I'm a VP
of Engineering here at Google, and as side

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.090
note I have a PhD in Cognitive Science. In
my dissertation, I spend about a chapter and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.800
a half fairly but superlatively sighting you
and saying why I think you're wrong, so. For

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.339
the record every time Steven and I have argued
he is being right, and I'm sure it was the

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:26.279
case this time as well. Steven is the Johnstone
Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard,

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.980
I believe. Is that roughly correct? He recently
devolved. He was at MIT for many years, but

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.940
that's okay just to make it shorter. I asked
Steven what he wanted me to say if anything

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.440
in particular and he wants me to definitely
call out two things. One, well, and he wanted

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.949
me to call out one thing, which is that he
was listed by Time Magazine as one of the

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:54.059
most 100 Most Influential People of All Time,
which I find fairly creepy. But Steven wanted

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:06.110
me to mention that he appeared on Colbert
and didn't suck. And with that it's a great,

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.180
great, great honor to introduce one of the
fathers of the field of actually understanding

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:21.899
how human mind works, Steven Pinker.
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Thank you so much. It's a real

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.190
pleasure and honor to be here. This old wood
cut of the story of the blind man and the

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.829
elephant is a reminder that any complex subject
can be studied in many ways. And that is certainly

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:40.460
true for a subject as complex as human nature.
Anthropology can study universal patterns

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.969
of the belief and behavior across the world's
societies as well as the ways in which they

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.630
defer. Biology can document how the process
of evolution selected the genes that helped

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.950
to wire the brain. Psychology, my own field,
can get people to disclose their foibles in

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.009
laboratory studies, and even fiction can illuminate
human nature by showing the universal themes

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.500
and plots that obsess people in their myths
and stories. This afternoon, I'm going to

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.110
give you the view from language: what kind
of insight we can gain into thought, emotion

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.400
and social relations from words and how we
use them. I'll talk about grammar as a window

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.320
into thought, swearing as a window into emotion,
and innuendo as a window into social relationships.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.480
And in each case, I'll start with a puzzle
in language show how it reveals a much deeper

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.080
feature of the human mind using specific examples
from English, the language of which all of

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.760
us are familiar. But examples that have close
counterparts in many languages and that follow

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.080
an overall logic that can be found in all
languages. So let's begin with language as

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.830
a window into thought. And the puzzle I will
start off with comes from a delightful book

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.830
by Richard Lederer called "Crazy English"
which has the following passage: "You have

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.920
to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language
where a house can burn up as it burns down,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.120
and in which you fill in a form by filling
it out. Why is it called 'after dark' when

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.120
it is really after light? Things that we claim
are underwater and underground are surrounded

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.080
by, not under the water and ground." So the
first puzzle is why languages talk about the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.860
physical world in such crazy ways. And the
answer I'm going to suggest is that there

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.030
is a theory of physics embedded in our language:
A concept of space in our prepositions, a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.326
concept of matter in our nouns, a concept
of space in our propositions, a concept of

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:36.120
a matter in our nouns, a concept of time in
our tenses, and a concept of causality in

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.640
our verbs. That understanding the intuitive
physics in language helps to explain not just

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.970
the quirks of language itself but the mental
models that humans use to make sense of their

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:53.740
lives. So, let's start off with space. How
do we locate an object relative to a place,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:59.900
a reference location or coordinate frame?
Well, you can imagine an ideal hypothetical

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.560
system of prepositions where every proposition
was composed of six syllables: one each for

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.670
distance in the up-down, left-right and front-back
direction, and then one each for the angle

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:19.590
of pitch, roll and yaw. Needless to say, no
language uses this system. Instead, location

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.120
is digitized. Languages make distinctions
like near versus far, on versus off, in versus

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.900
out, on versus under. Which is why Groucho
could say, "If I could held you any closer,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.520
I'd be on the other side of you." Also scale
is relative. You can use the same spatial

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.469
term across to refer to an ant walking across
a hand or a bus driving across the country.

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:47.610
And the interpretation of the word "there"
will defer in a sentence like put it there,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.860
depending on whether the person uttering it
is a crane operator or a brain surgeon. Also

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.810
shape is schematic. In reality, all objects
are 3-dimentional arrangements of matter.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.020
But language idealizes them as essentially
1-deminsional, 2-dimensional, or 3-dimensional.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.629
So we've got a line which courses a 1-dimentional,
but also a road which is conceived up as 1-dimentional

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:17.930
with a little width flashing it out, and a
beam which is also conceived as 1-dimentional

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.130
but with a finite thickness flashing it out.
In contrast, we've got a surface which is

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.020
2-dimentional or a slab also construed as
2-dimentional with some finite thickness.

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.620
This idealized geometry governs are used of
prepositions. So, for example the preposition

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.810
"along" requires an essentially 1-dimentional
object. You can say the ant walked along the

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.650
line or along the road or along the beam,
but not the ant walked along the plate or

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.900
along the ball which sounds a little anomalous.
It governs the way we apply nouns to shape.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.080
So we don't refer to a wire as a cylinder
as a long, skinny cylinder, nor a CD is a

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.990
cylinder, a short fat one even though geometrically
speaking that's what they are. But because

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.539
we ignore certain dimensions as insubstantial
and idealize the shape as one of the remaining

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.969
dimensions. And I think it goes into our overall
sense of shape, what we conceive of as similar

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:17.349
to what else, as when a child says, "I don't
want a little crayon box. I want the box that

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:23.099
looks like audience." That is not the eight
box of eight crayon box of Crayola, but the

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.050
sixty-four Crayon box where the crayons are
arranged in pitched rows like the balcony

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:34.879
of an auditorium. A fourth quirk is that the
boundaries of object are treated like objects

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:38.849
themselves. And this is something you may
have heard of, heard from Ray Jackendoff,

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.849
my colleague who I understood stands--spoke
here recently. We have words like "edge" which

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:48.169
refer to the 1-D boundary of a 2-D surface.
And so, we could say the ant walked along

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:53.370
the edge of the plate, even if we can't see
the ant walked along the plate. Or, and word

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.419
like "end" which is the boundary either of
a 1-D ribbon or a 2-D beam, as long it's essentially

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:03.789
1-D. And you could even cut the end off a
ribbon, which geometrically speaking ought

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:08.870
to be impossible but we conceive of the end
as if it was an object itself. That explains

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.620
the mystery of why we say, "underwater" and
"underground" when the thing is surrounded

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:18.180
by water or ground. It's because the word
"water" or "ground" can refer to the 2-D surface

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:24.719
of the 3-D volume, not just the 3-D volume
itself, and you can be under that surface.

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:28.999
So why is the language of space so crazy?
Well, I think the main reason is that preposition

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:34.550
divide up space into regions with different
causal consequences. And the clearest illustration

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.979
of that comes from a story that I clipped
out at the Boston Globe a few years ago: Woman

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:44.660
rescued from frozen pond dies. A woman who
fell through thin ice Sunday and was under

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.900
water for 90 minutes died yesterday. The Lincoln
Fire Department said a miscommunication between

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:55.389
the caller who reported the accident and the
dispatcher significantly delayed her rescue.

00:07:55.389 --> 00:08:00.400
The rescue workers believed that a woman had
fallen on the ice, not through it, and that

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.319
left the rescuers combing the woods to find
the scene of the accident. So that digital

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:09.029
distinction between "on" and "through" in
this case was literally a matter of life and

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:14.810
death even though it involved just a couple
of feet in analog space. Let me turn to substance

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:22.969
in language. Language distinguishes stuff
from things. Indeed, language taxonomises

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:29.749
matter into four categories. There are countable
things as an apple; masses as in much apple

00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:35.979
sauce; plurals as in many apples; and collections
as in a dozen apples. These aren't so much

00:08:35.979 --> 00:08:44.040
different kinds of matter as different frames
or attitudes in looking at matter which is

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:49.540
why we can look at the same mass of little
rocks and think of it either as pebbles, a

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:55.580
collection of individuals or as gravel, an
amorphous stuff, and why we have the cliche

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:01.730
about the person who can't see the forest
for the trees. In Crazy English, Lederer asks,

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:08.100
"Why does a man with hair on his head have
more hair than a man with hairs on his head?"

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.820
Why is the language of substance so crazy?
Well, words for matter allow people to agree

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:20.070
on how to package and quantify the continuous
material world. In an obvious context in which

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:25.790
we see that is at the supermarket where chunks
of matter have to be transacted and they can

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:30.460
be priced per item, which is what a count
noun does; by weight, which is what a mass

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.290
noun does; or by the dozen, which is what
a collective noun does. And in fact, that

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:41.040
same mindset that we apply to packaging matter
in the physical world, we also apply to abstract

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.580
concepts. So just as we have the distinction
between pebbles and gravel, we have a distinction

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:52.100
between many opinions as if they were discrete
object and much advice as if it was an amorphous

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:57.890
mass. We do the same thing to happenings in
time. We package the flow of experience in

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:03.090
the same way that we package the continuum
of matter. For example, let's say I would

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:08.630
ask you, how many events took place in the
morning of 9/11 in New York City? One answer

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:15.030
is there was one event, because a single plan
was executed. You can demarcate events by

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:19.970
the realization of a plan. Another answer
is two, because two buildings were destroyed.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:26.340
You can demarcate time by salient physical
events. This might seem like the height of

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:33.290
pointless semantic nitpicking or hairsplitting,
but in fact it is a question with consequences

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.570
because the lease holder for the World Trade
Center had an insurance policy that entitled

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:43.970
them to 3.5 billion dollars per destructive
event. If 9/11 comprised one event, he stood

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:48.600
to gain three and half billion. If it comprised
two events, he stood to gain seven billion.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.510
And in a number of court cases tied up for
many years, the lawyers debated this issue

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:59.150
in semantics. So if anyone says, "How much
is a semantic distinction worth?" The answer

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:08.320
is $3.5 billion. Well, this brings me to the
language of time. And this illustration reminds

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.640
us the time in many ways is conceived like
space, and happenings are conceived like matter

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:18.170
as if there's a kind of "time-stuff" that
could be chopped into the equivalent of objects,

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:23.600
except we call them events. We see this in
the many spatial metaphors for time like "the

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.990
deadline is coming," or "we're approaching
the deadline." We see it in kind of errors

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.660
that children make like, "Can I have any reading
behind the dinner?" That is, after the dinner

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:39.490
as if events were stretched out in front of
us. And we see it in the semantics of verb

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:46.170
tense. Now, verb tense, in many ways follows
a semantics that is parallel to the semantics

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:52.120
of space and matter in the case of prepositions
and nouns. First, time is digitized, and second

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.610
time is relative. That is, no language has
tenses for precise intervals of time like

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:06.670
an hour, nor for locations in time like November
7, 2007. Instead, location in time is trichotomized

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:12.870
in English into three regions to find relative
to the moment of speaking. An event can be

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:20.150
located in the specious present, an interval
of about three seconds in which we don't make

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:27.570
temporal distinctions. It's the basic unit
of nouns. This is the--specious present is

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:34.690
a term from William James, and it refers to
an interval of time that embraces a deliberate

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:39.560
action like a handshake, a quick decision
like how long you alight on a channel while

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.570
channel surfing and decide whether to click
again, to the decay of unrehearsed short-term

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:50.550
memory to a line of poetry, and to a musical
motif like the opening notes of Beethoven's

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:56.770
Fifth which we don't perceive as just one
note, one note, one note but rather as a coherent

00:12:56.770 --> 00:13:04.840
motif. Then there's the past stretching backwards
indefinitely. So, every event from four seconds

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:12.500
ago back to the big bang is treated as identical
by the English language, which is why Groucho

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:20.860
could say, "I've had a wonderful evening,
but this wasn't it."

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:26.020
And then, there's the future until eternity,
that is, everything from four seconds from

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:33.290
now until the heat death of the universe all
lumped together. There are not only locations

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:38.240
in time, what I just referred to, but shapes
in time what linguist call "aspect," that

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:46.010
is, how a happening begins, unfolds, and ends.
Shape in time, like shape in space is treated

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:53.860
schematically. We conceive of some happenings
as amorphously spread out in time without

00:13:53.860 --> 00:14:00.310
any crisp beginning or end, such as, the verb,
"to shake." We conceive of other events as

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:05.760
momentaneous or a punctate, such as to swat
a fly. And then, still other events like to

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:12.090
cross the street have no crisp beginning,
but are terminated until some goal has been

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:18.560
achieved. In this case, you get to the other
side. Now the stretches of time that are defined

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.730
by verbs can also be mentally packaged. In
the same way, that we can take a noun "beer"

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:29.720
which just refers to the stuff generically
and then package it in a unit by use of the

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:35.300
word "one" as in one beer, turned a mass noun
into a count noun. You can take an amorphous

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:42.390
stretch of time like "shake it" and with the
use of particle like "out" turn it into an

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:49.310
accomplishment that ends at a defined boundary
as in "shake it up," that is, shake it until

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:56.570
up to completion. Likewise, we can take "wring
it" which is indefinite in terms of when it

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:01.570
ends, and give an endpoint with the particle
"out" and say, "wring it out," that is, until

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:07.950
it's dry. And that is why, a house can burn
up as it burns down, and you can fill in a

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:14.730
form by filling it out. Finally, the boundary
of an event can be treated like an event itself,

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.300
just as with space. Just as I can cut off
the end of a ribbon which is geometrically

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.510
impossible, I can start the end of my talk
which is temporally impossible if you think

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:30.260
of end as simply the instant of termination.
Why is it called "after dark" when it is really

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:37.790
after light? Well, dark is--refers not just
to the interval of darkness but to the boundary

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.760
of the interval of darkness, and it's exactly
isomorphic to why in the language of space

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.400
we can say "underwater" when the thing is
surrounded by water. Why is the language of

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.310
time so crazy? Well, we identify locations
in time coarsely, because stretches of time

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:59.810
relative to the moment of speaking have different
consequences for knowledge and action. And

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:05.440
a fancy-shmancy way of putting it would be
that there's a bit of metaphysics and epistemology

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:12.120
that's packed into our tense system. It's
not purely a chronological concept. In particular,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.610
that present tense corresponds to our own
consciousness, to what you can experience

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:25.360
as you're alive and awake and aware, and are
registering your own consciousness. The past

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.490
is not just an interval in time, but that
which is thought to be knowable and factual

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:37.530
and unchangeable. As in a report of the Scott
Peterson murder case as it was unfolding,

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:42.210
where investigators noted that Peterson used
the past tense when referring to his wife

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:47.910
and unborn son before their bodies were found,
abruptly correcting himself. His use of the

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:54.780
past tense betrayed his knowledge of what
he knew had taken place while he was testifying.

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:58.850
The future conversely we conceive of is not
just any old stretch of time but that which

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.670
is unknowable, hypothetical, and willable.
As when Winston Churchill said, "We shall

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.360
fight on the beaches. We shall fight on the
landing grounds. We shall fight in the fields

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.520
and in the streets. We shall fight in the
hills. We shall never surrender." It's deliberately

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.389
ambiguous whether he was simply making a prediction
as to what would happen on a future date,

00:17:17.389 --> 00:17:25.949
or whether he was making a declaration of
resolve and will. Those two can't be distinguished,

00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:33.440
and the future tense in English and many other
languages systematically conflates them. And

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.050
finally, we turn to causality of language
where the model of causality in our verbs

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:44.169
can be summarized in this diagram, that is,
an actor directly impinges on an entity, making

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:51.750
it move or change. The psychologist, Phillip
Wolff, has done a simple experiment to show

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:57.750
how this works. He had computer animations.
In one case, Sarah grabbed the doorknob and

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:02.490
physically swung the door open; in the other
case, she opened the window and a breeze blew

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:07.710
the door open. If you ask people, "Did Sarah
cause the door to open?" In both cases, people

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:13.960
say yes. If you then express causality inside
the verb by saying, "Did Sarah open the door?"

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.169
Then in the case where she manhandled the
door, they say yes. In the case where it was

00:18:19.169 --> 00:18:26.429
more circuitous, they say no. Why is the language
of causality so crazy? Well, directly caused

00:18:26.429 --> 00:18:31.080
events are the ones that are most likely to
be foreseeable and intended; hence, those

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.220
for which we can hold people responsible.
And a nice illustration of that comes from

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:43.429
an episode in American History in 1881, which
shows that when the directness of causation

00:18:43.429 --> 00:18:49.750
is fuzzy, so is our sense of moral and legal
responsibility. President James Garfield was

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:57.090
waiting for a train in a Baltimore Station,
and Charles Guiteau stalking him, fired two

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:03.970
shots into him. Now, the bullets missed his
major organs and arteries, and his wound needn't

00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:09.919
have been fatal even in Garfield's time. However,
he was subjected to the harebrained medical

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:15.460
practices of the day, which included probing
his wound with unwashed hands and feeding

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:21.419
him through this rectum instead of through
his mouth. So, he wasted away on his deathbed

00:19:21.419 --> 00:19:27.730
for three months before finally succumbing
of infection and starvation. At the assassin's

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:36.620
murder trial, he said--the assassin said,
"The doctors killed him. I just shot him."

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:42.380
The jury was unpersuaded and Guiteau hanged,
but nonetheless, this is another illustration

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:47.909
of the life and death consequences of the
semantics of a verb. So to sum up language

00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:52.790
as a window into cognition, there's a theory
of physics embedded in our language, a conception

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:57.830
of space in terms of places and object and
qualitative relationships, a conception of

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:03.200
matter in terms of stuff and things, stretched
along 1, 2, or 3 dimensions, a conception

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.210
of time in terms of processes and events,
located and stretched along a single dimension,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:13.070
and a conception of causality in terms of
the direct impingement of an actor upon an

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:19.309
entity. This way of construing reality differs
from real physics but it corresponds to human

00:20:19.309 --> 00:20:24.909
goals and purposes; the causal texture of
the environment, what is knowable, factual,

00:20:24.909 --> 00:20:31.399
and willable; to ways of packaging and measuring
our experience; and to ways of assigning responsibility

00:20:31.399 --> 00:20:37.429
for events. Let me now turn to Part II. Language
is a window into emotion. And again, I'll

00:20:37.429 --> 00:20:43.379
begin with a puzzle of language. Four years
ago, the Golden Global Awards were broadcast

00:20:43.379 --> 00:20:50.779
on live network television on NBC. And accepting
an award on behalf of the rock group, U2,

00:20:50.779 --> 00:20:56.919
its leader Bono said in accepting the award,
"This is really, really fucking brilliant."

00:20:56.919 --> 00:21:02.149
Now, the switchboards lit up like a Christmas
tree. The case eventually landed up on the

00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:07.899
desk of the FCC, which had to decide whether
to fine the network for failing to bleep out

00:21:07.899 --> 00:21:14.190
the offending word. And somewhat surprisingly,
the FCC chose not to fine NBC, saying that

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:19.640
their regulations defined indecency as, "Material
that describes or depicts sexual or excretory

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:25.009
organs or activities," and that the "fucking"
in "fucking brilliant" is, "An adjective or

00:21:25.009 --> 00:21:35.669
expletive to emphasized an exclamation." Well,
cultural conservatives were enraged, and there

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:41.570
were a number of bills filed in Congress to
close that loophole. Of which my favorite

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:49.379
is, House Resolution 3687: The Clean Airwaves
Act, which I will now read in its entirety.

00:21:49.379 --> 00:21:54.950
You can look it up. "Be it enacted by the
Senate and House of Representatives of the

00:21:54.950 --> 00:22:00.960
United States of America in Congress assembled,
that section 1464 of title 18, United States

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:06.820
Code is amended: (1) by inserting '(a)' before
'Whoever'; and (2) The term 'profane,' used

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:15.200
with respect to language, includes the words,
'shit,' 'piss,' fuck,' 'cunt, 'asshole,' and

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:25.509
the phrases 'cock sucker,' 'mother fucker,'
and 'ass-hole,' compound use including hyphenated

00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:31.529
compounds of such words and phrases with each
other or with other words or phrases, and

00:22:31.529 --> 00:22:37.110
other grammatical forms of such words and
phrases including verb, adjective, gerund,

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:45.019
participle, and infinitive forms." Unfortunately,
the "fucking" in "fucking brilliant" is an

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:55.919
adverb, and that's the one part of speech
that they forgot to include on the list. So,

00:22:55.919 --> 00:23:02.250
grammar matters, linguistic is important.
And the question is, why do people get so

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:09.179
upset about certain words? It's not as if
anyone hasn't heard them, and indeed, words

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:15.159
for sex and excretion have been the main legal
battleground of free speech in the past century.

00:23:15.159 --> 00:23:22.039
There's a paradox. You can turn on a late
night television and watch Leno or Letterman

00:23:22.039 --> 00:23:26.460
or Stewart called George Bush a moron or a
liar, and they didn't have to worry about

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.690
getting their tongues cut out or being burn
at the stake or worse. But if they were to

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:37.559
use particular words to refer to excretion
or sexuality, the network would be subject

00:23:37.559 --> 00:23:42.789
to ruinous fines. So what's going on there?
Well, that brings us to the language of swearing?

00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:48.929
And I'll begin with the cognitive neuroscience
of swearing; that is, how is the brain engaged

00:23:48.929 --> 00:23:56.129
when people use or hear a taboo word? The
main generalization is the taboo words activate

00:23:56.129 --> 00:24:00.899
brain areas associated with negative emotion.
They seem to be registered more in the right

00:24:00.899 --> 00:24:06.950
hemisphere, which we as independently been
connected with negative emotion. In production,

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:12.389
they seem to involve the basal ganglia. That's
the area that is overactive in Tourette syndrome,

00:24:12.389 --> 00:24:20.639
for example. The basal ganglia being complex
networks of ganglia buried deep in both halves

00:24:20.639 --> 00:24:26.899
of the brain that are involved in packaging
sequences of behavior. In perception, they

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:33.440
seemed to involve the amygdala, a two, small
almond-shaped organs also evolutionary quite

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:39.700
ancient buried deep within the brain. Also,
taboo words are processed involuntarily. You

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:46.630
can't help but hear a taboo word with all
of its emotional baggage. And the way that

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:51.789
psychologists demonstrates that something
is involuntarily is to use the "Stroop Test,"

00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:56.989
a phenomenon that is, familiar to any psychology
undergraduate and that has been the subject

00:24:56.989 --> 00:25:03.049
of more than 4,000 scientific papers. So,
the test is simple. You simply have to name

00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:07.980
the color in which a series of words is printed.
And we'll try it right now. I'll give you

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:13.650
a list of words with each word. Simply name
the color in which it's printed ignoring what

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.619
the word says. Okay? Let's start off. Red,
black...

00:25:17.619 --> 00:25:24.360
&gt;&gt; Green, blue, black, blue, red, green.
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Easy. Okay? Now, try it again,

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:36.499
same instruction: name the color in which
the word is printed.

00:25:36.499 --> 00:25:41.749
Much, much harder. The explanation is that
to a literate adult, reading is automatic.

00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:49.260
You can't process a written word as a squiggle
even if you try to. The meaning always gets

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.831
through despite your best intentions. And
here's a third version of the Stroop Test.

00:25:53.831 --> 00:25:58.590
I mentioned there were 5,000 papers on it.
My favorite comes from a psychologist named

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:05.130
Don McCoy at UCLA. And again, the instruction
is identical. Just name the color in which

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:16.340
the word is printed. Black...
People are slowed down on this version of

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:21.700
the Stroop Test almost as much as when the
word is printed in a competing color. So the

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.970
essence of swearing is using languages as
a kind of weapon to force a listener to think

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:33.119
an unpleasant or at least an emotionally charged
thought exploiting the automatic nature of

00:26:33.119 --> 00:26:40.720
speech or printed word recognition. Well,
this then breaks down the problem of swearing

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.399
into two problems: What kinds of concepts
trigger negative emotions, and why would a

00:26:45.399 --> 00:26:50.159
speaker want to trigger a negative emotion
in his listeners. Well, let's start with the

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:55.450
contents of swearing. Anyone who speaks more
than one language knows that taboo words differ

00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:00.570
from language to language. If you translate
the curses of one language into another, the

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:05.210
results can often be comical. Nonetheless,
there are certain common patterns, certain

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:12.419
things that supply the meanings of taboo words
across all cultures. There's the supernatural

00:27:12.419 --> 00:27:19.240
as in our own "damn, hell, and Jesus Christ,"
which nowadays are fairly mild taboo words

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:24.929
but they are continued to be more potent in
religious societies, especially Catholic ones.

00:27:24.929 --> 00:27:29.870
For example, where I grew up in Quebec, in
the version of French spoken there when you

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:37.039
stub your toe, you say, "damn chalice" or
"damn tabernacle." And this involves the emotions

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:44.429
of awe and fear at the supernatural and the
trappings of deities. There are bodily effluvia

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:50.900
and organs, which are familiar sources of
taboo words in English. It's not surprising

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:55.879
that people would have an emotional reaction
to bodily effluvia because epidemiologists

00:27:55.879 --> 00:28:01.490
tell us that they are major vectors of disease.
There are many parasitic and infectious diseases

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:08.350
that are spread by bodily fluids. We have
evolved an emotion to defend ourselves against

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:15.249
this rude of disease transmission, namely,
the emotion of disgust. There are, in many

00:28:15.249 --> 00:28:21.259
languages, taboo words for disease, death,
danger, and infirmity. In older periods of

00:28:21.259 --> 00:28:25.549
English, we have the curse of "A pox on you!"
or "A plague on both your houses!" from Romeo

00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:33.950
and Juliet. In Yiddish, you can curse by shouting
out "Cholerya, Cholera". And even in contemporary

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:38.980
English, there's a bit of taboo that surrounds
the word for our most dreaded malady "cancer"

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:44.429
and when often reads in an obituary of someone
passing away from a long illness. Both the

00:28:44.429 --> 00:28:49.769
passing away and the long illness are ways
of--are showed that there's some taboo status

00:28:49.769 --> 00:28:55.320
to the words "die" and "cancer". And this
involves the emotion of dread of death and

00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:03.320
disease. There is, of course, sexuality as
in some of our most obscene taboo words. And

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.609
when people hear this, their first reaction
is: But why should thoughts about sex be associated

00:29:07.609 --> 00:29:12.990
with negative emotions? Isn't sex between
consenting adults, a form of a good, clean

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:19.909
fun? Well, not in the full sweep of human
experience where sexuality can also be associated

00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:26.350
with exploitation, illegitimacy, incest, jealousy,
spousal abuse, cuckoldry, desertion, child

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:34.690
abuse, feuding, rape. Sex is an emotionally
fraught activity, and it's not surprising

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:39.019
that people should continue to have strong
emotions surrounding it which we can call

00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:45.850
revulsion at sexual depravity. Then there
are words for disfavored people in groups,

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:51.929
including the most taboo word in contemporary
respectable American English, the word so

00:29:51.929 --> 00:29:56.769
incendiary that you can't even mention it.
You have to use a word to refer to the word,

00:29:56.769 --> 00:30:05.419
that is, the n-word. And the words for minorities,
for infidels, for cripples, for enemies, for

00:30:05.419 --> 00:30:11.190
subordinated peoples are often taboo in English
not just--in many languages, I should say.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:17.429
In English, we have not only a "nigger," but
also various other racial epithets, and that,

00:30:17.429 --> 00:30:23.190
of course, invoke the emotions of hatred and
contempt. Okay. So, those are the kinds of

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:27.039
negative thoughts that people inflict on one
another through language. Why would they want

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:33.820
to? What is the motive for this kind of verbal
aggression? Well, there are at least five

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:40.299
ways to swear, probably more, but five ways
in which people deploy this weapon. Beginning

00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:45.149
with dysphemistic swearing, and what does
that mean? The difference between say "shit"

00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:51.399
and "feces" or "fuck" and "copulate". Now,
you all know what euphemism is. The logic

00:30:51.399 --> 00:30:55.480
behind the euphemism is we have to talk about
this first for a specific purpose. But let's

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:02.529
avoid thinking about how awful it is. The
logic is a dysphemism is exactly the opposite.

00:31:02.529 --> 00:31:07.019
It's, "I want you to think about how awful
this is." And the English language gives you

00:31:07.019 --> 00:31:15.159
the means of doing either. A good illustration
is in the 34 euphemisms for feces. Now, people

00:31:15.159 --> 00:31:21.100
don't like to think about feces anymore than
they like to smell it or touch it. Nonetheless,

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:27.029
we are incarnate beings for whom feces is
a part of life and you can't get through life

00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:33.570
without at least some occasions in which you're
forced to refer to the stuff. The solution

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:41.369
is to have a specialized vocabulary, each
one of which is specific to the need to discuss

00:31:41.369 --> 00:31:48.419
feces for a specific purpose in a particular
context. So, we got generic terms like waste,

00:31:48.419 --> 00:31:54.269
fecal mater, and filth; formal terms often
from Latin like feces and excrement; terms

00:31:54.269 --> 00:32:01.429
that you use with children like poop and doo-doo;
terms that you use to adults about children

00:32:01.429 --> 00:32:07.859
like soil and dirt; terms in the medical context
like stool and bowel movement. Many terms

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:11.850
that you have to use in connection with animals
depending on whether you're referring large

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:19.030
units like pats; small units like droppings;
scientific context like scat; an agricultural

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:24.582
context like manure. And in this golden age
of recycling, the need has arisen for a term

00:32:24.582 --> 00:32:30.419
to refer to human feces being recycled as
fertilizer. And so far, three euphemisms have

00:32:30.419 --> 00:32:42.230
appeared: night soil, humanure, and my favorite,
human boisolids. So that's why we need euphemism.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:47.190
Indeed, if you were to use the wrong euphemism
in a particular context, the results would

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:52.450
be rather odd. For example, if at the next
doctor's appointment, the nurse came up to

00:32:52.450 --> 00:33:00.609
you and said, "The medical lab will need a
doo-doo sample." You'd be little surprised.

00:33:00.609 --> 00:33:04.440
As you would be if you bought a gardening
magazine and it said, "For nice plump tomatoes,

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:12.460
fertilize your plants with cattle bowel movement."
But we also need dysphemisms. There are times

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:18.590
in life were the point for politeness has
passed, and one wants to remind listeners

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:24.090
of how disagreeable what is being referred
to truly is. For example, you might open your

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:30.590
window and yell at some boor, "Will you pick
up your dog shit?" Or recount an experience

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.729
like, "The plumber was working under the sink,
and I had to look at the crack in his ass

00:33:33.729 --> 00:33:38.619
the whole time." Or you can imagine a wife
snooping on her husband's email and saying,

00:33:38.619 --> 00:33:43.029
"So while I've been taking care of the kids,
you've been fucking your secretary!" The offense

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:48.129
is deliberate and the English language gives
us the means of expressing that strong emotion

00:33:48.129 --> 00:33:55.019
when the need arises. So dysphemistic swearing,
there's also abusive swearing were you deliberately

00:33:55.019 --> 00:34:00.009
use language as a weapon to intimidate or
humiliate someone. And there are moments in

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:09.869
life when the temptation arises to abuse or
intimidate someone. And scholars who have

00:34:09.869 --> 00:34:18.510
studied Maladicta, swearing curses, imprecations
have often commented on how a shear linguistic

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:25.649
ingenuity that goes into them. All of the
classic poetic devices, metaphor, imagery,

00:34:25.649 --> 00:34:32.679
connotation, alliteration, meter, rhyme, all
of them are put to use in obscene imprecations.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:37.960
For example, you can liken people to effluvia,
and their associated organs and accessories

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:42.841
is when you talk, refer to someone as a piece
of shit and asshole or a dickhead. You can

00:34:42.841 --> 00:34:49.659
advise them to engage in undignified activities
such as to "eat shit, shove it up your ass,

00:34:49.659 --> 00:34:56.419
or fuck yourself." You can accuse them of
having engaged in undignified sexual activities,

00:34:56.419 --> 00:35:03.290
and every undignified sexual activity has
an obscene imprecation. For example, incest

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:09.589
as in mother fucker; sodomy as in bugger;
fellatio as in cocksucker; masturbation as

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:13.940
in jerk and wanker; and my favorite comes
from bestiality. And this is a curse that

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:20.119
was last used in 1585, but I suggest that
it would be revive. And the next time someone

00:35:20.119 --> 00:35:26.150
cuts you off in traffic, instead of using
one of those hackney cliches, I suggest you

00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:34.450
advise the person to kiss the cunt of a cow,
which not only at least bring some fresh imagery

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:43.359
to the situation. But I think it has a rather
pleasing alliteration. There's idiomatic swearing,

00:35:43.359 --> 00:35:49.140
which is he mildest form of swearing, such
as shit out of luck, get your shit together,

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:54.270
piss-poor, pissed off, my ass, a pain in the
ass, sweet fuck-all, what the fuck, which,

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:59.099
it's actually rather puzzling what those--exactly
those words are doing in those--that syntactic

00:35:59.099 --> 00:36:05.450
context. But clearly what's happening is the
words are simply being used for their ability

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:14.859
to arouse the interest and shock the listener.
Also, it can be used merely to assert a kind

00:36:14.859 --> 00:36:21.619
of macho or cool pose, or more--in a more
friendly manner among peers, to express informality.

00:36:21.619 --> 00:36:26.740
Just say this is the kind of setting where
you don't have to watch what you say. Closely

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.280
related to idiomatic swearing is emphatic
swearing where the taboo word again is used

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:38.171
to arouse a listener's attention to call,
focus on the following noun. As in this--or

00:36:38.171 --> 00:36:42.560
adjectives, this is really, really fucking
brilliant. He thinks he's a fucking scoutmaster,

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:50.609
Rip Van fuckin' winkle. Close the fucking
door, and so on. And the overuse of emphatic

00:36:50.609 --> 00:36:58.510
and idiomatic swearing leads to the form of
English sometimes called fuck patois. As in

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:02.350
the story of the soldier who said, "I come
home to my fucking house after three fucking

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:07.119
years in the fucking war, and what do I fucking-well
find? My wife in bed, engaged in illicit sexual

00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:18.750
relations with a male!"

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:23.750
Then there's cathartic swearing, the phenomenon
were when you cut your thumb together with

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:29.309
a bagel or you spill a glass of beer in your
lap, the topic of your conversation abruptly

00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:36.490
switches to theology or sexuality, or excretion.
Now, if you ask people why they swear in that

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:43.230
way, they'll say it lets off steam, it releases
tension, the hydraulic theory of the mind.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:47.510
The problem with this theory is that, it can
be no more than a metaphor, because neurobiologist

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:54.280
haven't literally found a boiler full of steam
in the skull or a set of valves and pipes,

00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:01.280
just brain cells that fire in patterns. So,
more satisfying is the rage-circuit theory

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:07.470
that throughout the mammalian class there
is a reflex in which an animal, when suddenly

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:13.539
injured or confined, engages in a furious
struggle accompanied by a sudden angry noise

00:38:13.539 --> 00:38:22.260
presumably to startle or intimidate an attacker.
Any one who has a sat on their pet cat or

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:28.650
caught a dog's tail in a door is well familiar
with this reflex. In humans, the idea is that

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:35.870
this reflex also triggers the language system
which has taken over control of our vocal

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:41.400
track. So in addition to uttering a yelp,
we might articulate the yelp using a word

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:46.500
for a strong negative emotion, one that we
ordinarily inhibit ourselves from saying.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:52.079
And I think there's a lot to the rage-circuit
theory, but has one problem which is the cathartic

00:38:52.079 --> 00:38:57.339
swearing is conventional. You have to learn
what to yell in a particular language when

00:38:57.339 --> 00:39:01.890
a particular accident befalls you. So in English,
for example, if you hit your thumb with a

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:07.589
hammer, you don't shout out whore or cunt,
although there are lots of languages in which

00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:14.900
you do. And indeed, the cathartic swear word
is specific to the cause of the misfortune.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:20.650
So if someone cuts you off in traffic, you
might say asshole, but if you stub your toe,

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:27.789
you'd be more likely to say shit or damn,
or fuck. So, this leads to the response-cry

00:39:27.789 --> 00:39:33.030
theory from the great sociologist, Erving
Goffman that cathartic swearing is communicative;

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:41.829
it is not just an overflow of emotion. It
basically informs a real or virtual audience

00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:46.730
that you are currently in a throws of some
very strong emotion, indeed so strong that

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:51.940
you can't completely control it, nonetheless,
you are signaling exactly what emotion you're

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:57.770
feeling. And so it belongs together with other
response-cries in the language like aha, mmm,

00:39:57.770 --> 00:40:05.260
ouch, whoops, wow, yes, and yuck. And therefore
it has that communicative function. So to

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:10.230
sum-up language as a window into emotion,
humans are prone to strong negative emotions.

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:17.289
So language tells us awe of the supernatural,
disgust at bodily effluvia, dread of disease,

00:40:17.289 --> 00:40:23.829
hatred of disfavored people and groups, revulsion
at depraved sexual acts. Nonetheless, people

00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:28.809
sometimes want to impose these thoughts on
others to gain their attention, to intimidate

00:40:28.809 --> 00:40:34.710
or humiliate them, to remind them of the awfulness
of the objects and activities, or to advertise

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:40.740
that one has the normal reactions to misfortunes.
Okay. Part three, language as a window into

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:47.180
social relations. Again, I'll begin with the
puzzle of language, this one comes from the

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:52.500
film Fargo, from an early scene in which a
kidnaper has a hostage in the backseat of

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:57.779
his car, is pulled over by a police officer
because he's missing his plates. He's asked

00:40:57.779 --> 00:41:04.150
to show his driver's license, he hands over
his wallet with the driver's license visible

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:09.230
and a $50 bill extending ever so slightly
and he says to the officer, "I was thinking

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:13.740
that maybe the best thing would be to take
care of it here in Brainerd." Which of course

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:19.789
everyone interprets is a veiled bribe. Now,
this is an example of an indirect speech act,

00:41:19.789 --> 00:41:26.049
a case in which you don't blurt out exactly
what you say but you veil it in innuendo expecting

00:41:26.049 --> 00:41:32.529
your listener to listen between the lines.
Another example, "If you could pass the guacamole,

00:41:32.529 --> 00:41:37.260
that would be awesome." This is a polite request
when you think about it, it doesn't make a

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:46.550
whole lot of sense. But nonetheless, it is
instantly understood as a request. "We're

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:51.650
counting on you to show leadership in our
Campaign for the Future." Anyone who's been

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:57.369
unfortunate enough to sit through a fund raising
dinner is familiar with euphemistic snoring

00:41:57.369 --> 00:42:05.079
like that that is a solicitation for a donation.
"Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"

00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:10.170
This has been recognized as a sexual come
on for so long that in 1932, James Thurber

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:15.260
could draw a cartoon with a confused young
man saying to his date, "You wait here and

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:23.690
I'll bring the etchings down." And then, "Nice
store you got there. It would be a real shame

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:28.490
if something happened to it," is something
that we all recognize as veiled threat. So

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:34.559
the puzzle is why are bribes, request, seductions,
solicitations, and threats so often veiled,

00:42:34.559 --> 00:42:40.730
when both parties know exactly what they mean?
This isn't just an academic puzzle but it

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.000
has a great deal of practical importance such
as in the crafting and interpretation of a

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.500
language of treaties and diplomacy, and in
the prosecution of extortion, bribery, and

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:57.089
sexual harassment which are often conveyed
by innuendo rather than overtly. The solution

00:42:57.089 --> 00:43:04.020
turns out to be more complicated than I thought
when I tried to explain the phenomenon, and

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:09.430
I think there are at least three components
to the solution. The logic of plausible deniability,

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:14.950
the logic of relationship negotiation, and
the logic of mutual knowledge, and I'll explain

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:20.500
what I mean by each of those. Let me start
with the--with, what the game theorist and

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:25.100
noble prize winner, Thomas Schelling called
the identification problem. Now, how do you

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:30.040
deal with another intelligent agent when you
don't know his or her values? Bribing a police

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:35.059
officer being a prime example. Imagine that
you had two choices, when you're pulled over,

00:43:35.059 --> 00:43:43.490
either to utter a blatant naked bribe or not
to bribe the officer. What will happen? Well,

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:49.289
it depends very much on what kind of officer
you get. You could get a dishonest officer

00:43:49.289 --> 00:43:56.420
who might--would accept the bribe, giving
you the very high payoff of going free or

00:43:56.420 --> 00:44:00.910
you might have an honest officer who not only
would rebuff the bribe but might arrest you

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:05.240
for attempting to bribe an officer in which
you'd have a very high cost of an arrest for

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:12.860
bribery. So, neither option in this row is--I'm
sorry--neither row is appealing. Both of them

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:18.069
involve a significant cost. But given this
situation, you're better off with a traffic

00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:23.140
ticket than risking the arrest for bribery.
But now imagine you had a third option, namely

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:28.950
to issue a veiled bribe through innuendo,
like I was wondering if maybe we could take

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:34.391
care of it here. Well, if you have a dishonest
officer, he could sniff out the bribe in the

00:44:34.391 --> 00:44:40.440
innuendo and you get a very high payoff of
going free from an overt bribe. If you have

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:45.079
an honest officer, even if he suspected the
bribe he couldn't make it stick in court because

00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:49.210
of the demand of proving something beyond
a reasonable doubt, and so the worst you would

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:54.390
get is a traffic ticket. So you get the high
payoff of an overt bribe with a relatively

00:44:54.390 --> 00:45:00.369
small cost of not bribing at all, all combined
in one option so the veiled bribe is the rational

00:45:00.369 --> 00:45:10.260
choice. This is the logic of plausible deniability.
But the reason it's not enough is that what

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:19.119
about non-legal contexts? It's not as if we
spend our lives in legal jeopardy of a particular

00:45:19.119 --> 00:45:24.140
pre-defined legal penalties or proving something
in a court of law. What about when you want

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:28.940
to bribe someone in everyday life. Now you
might say, "Well, why a law-abiding citizen

00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:34.580
want to offer a bribe in everyday life?" Well,
how about this? You want to go to the hottest

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:39.950
restaurant in town. You have no reservation.
Why not slip the maitre d' a $20 bill and

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:45.359
see if you can be seated immediately in exchange
for the 20? Well, this was the assignment

00:45:45.359 --> 00:45:50.809
given to the food writer, Bruce Feiler by
Gourmet Magazine on a dare from the editor,

00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:55.130
and he had to write up his experiences in
doing that. And I found that write-up, as

00:45:55.130 --> 00:46:01.200
a psychologist, utterly fascinating. First
of all, it was marked by extreme anxiety.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:08.490
As far as I know, no one has ever been sent
to jail for attempting to bribe a maitre d'.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:13.440
Nonetheless, he begins his article as follows:
"I am nervous. Truly nervous. As the taxi

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.599
bounces through the trendier neighborhoods
of Manhattan, I keep imagining the possible

00:46:17.599 --> 00:46:23.260
retorts of some incensed maitre d': What kind
of establishment do you think this is? How

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:30.990
dare you insult me? Do you think you can get
in with that?" Second, when you did screw

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:37.619
up the courage to offer a bribe, he instinctively
veiled it in an innuendo. He would say things

00:46:37.619 --> 00:46:43.809
like: "I hope you can fit us in." Or, "Can
you speed up my wait?" Or, "I was wondering

00:46:43.809 --> 00:46:50.260
if you might have a cancellation." Or, "This
is really important night for me." The third

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:56.049
interesting finding was the outcome, which
is that he was invariably seated in between

00:46:56.049 --> 00:47:00.690
two and four minutes to the astonishment of
his girlfriend. This is something that's worth

00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:05.640
knowing next time you want to gets in a chic
San Francisco restaurant on a Saturday night

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:11.650
with no reservations. So what's going on here?
Well, here's a general theory that language

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:17.690
has to do two things. You have to convey the
particular content like a bribe, a command,

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:22.140
or a proposition. At the same time, you have
to negotiate the kind of relationship you

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:27.029
have with the person. The solution is to use
language at these two levels. The literal

00:47:27.029 --> 00:47:32.569
form is consistent with the safest relationship
you have with the listener. The speaker then

00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:37.549
counts on the listener reading between the
lines to entertain a proposition that may

00:47:37.549 --> 00:47:43.859
be incompatible with that relationship. And
politeness is a straightforward case. What's

00:47:43.859 --> 00:47:48.279
going on with "If you could pass the guacamole,
that would be awesome." For one thing, you

00:47:48.279 --> 00:47:56.750
have to admit it's kind of an overstatement.
It would literally be inspiring awe. Also,

00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:01.589
why are you pondering a hypothetical possible
worlds right there and then at the dinner

00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:10.040
table? Well, the listener, amusing that the
speaker is not mad, figures that the speaker

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:14.420
says an outcome is good; therefore, he must
be requesting it. The overall effect is that

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:20.060
the intended content mainly the imperative
gets through. But crucially without the presumption

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:24.829
of dominance, that is, without the impression
that you are treating your listener as some

00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:30.860
kind of underling or flunky. So if dominance
is one of the relations that people try to

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.269
avoid in their speech, what are the other
relationships that people are sensitive to?

00:48:35.269 --> 00:48:39.980
Well, an anthropologist named Alan Fiske has
argued that dominance is one of three major

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:46.500
types of human relationships that characterize
social interaction in all of the world's cultures.

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:51.539
Each prescribes a distinct way of distributing
resources. Each has a distinct evolutionary

00:48:51.539 --> 00:48:57.760
basis. And each applies most naturally to
certain people but can be extended via language

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:05.470
to others. So, there's dominance whose ethos
is "don't mess with me," and which must have

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:11.510
come from the dominance hierarchies that are
ubiquitous among the primates. There's a very

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:17.609
different mindset of communality where the
ethos is "share and share alike," which is

00:49:17.609 --> 00:49:22.789
probably the product of kin selection and
mutualism, and is naturally applied to kin,

00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:27.880
spouses, and close friends. And then there's
reciprocity. The ethos of "if you scratch

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:35.450
my back and I'll scratch yours," the tit for
tat trading of goods and services in a business-like

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:42.900
manner that follows the loss of reciprocal
altruism. Now, critically, people distinguish

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:46.970
these kinds of relationships. And a behavior
that's acceptable in one relationship type

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:53.369
can be anomalous in another. So at a cocktail
party, you might go over to your girlfriend's

00:49:53.369 --> 00:49:57.250
plate and help yourself to a shrimp off her
plate. But you wouldn't go up to your boss

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:03.520
and help yourself to a shrimp off his plate,
because that would be confusing the communality

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:10.640
relationship that couples have with the dominance
relationship that a supervisor commands. Or

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.279
at the end of a dinner party, if you were
to pull out your wallet and offer to pay your

00:50:14.279 --> 00:50:18.920
host for the cost of the food, that would
not be perceived as polite. That would be

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.779
perceived as rude. And the reason is that
it applies the reciprocity mindset that would

00:50:23.779 --> 00:50:30.950
be appropriate on a store to a communal friendly
gathering where the ethos is communality.

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:35.900
Now, when in those situations where relationships
are ambiguous, divergent understanding can

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:41.809
be costly. That is, we experience an unpleasant
emotion. We have a name for it: awkwardness,

00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:47.049
when the two parties aren't sure of the relationship
type. For example, there could be moments

00:50:47.049 --> 00:50:51.450
of awkwardness in the work place where an
employee doesn't know whether he can refer

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:57.970
to his boss on a first name basis or invite
him after work for a beer. It's well-known

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:03.589
that good friends should not engage in a business
transaction like one selling his car to the

00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:08.590
other, that it put a strain on the friendship,
because these are reciprocity and communality

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:14.839
are diametrically opposed ways of dealing
with resources. The conflict between dominance

00:51:14.839 --> 00:51:23.119
and sex is when a supervisor solicits an employee,
defines the battleground for sexual harassment.

00:51:23.119 --> 00:51:29.779
And the conflict between friendship and sex
is what makes dating such a fraught domain

00:51:29.779 --> 00:51:36.609
in the subject of so many situation comedies.
Well, this gives rise to a social identification

00:51:36.609 --> 00:51:41.800
problem where the social costs of awkwardness
from mismatched relationship type can duplicate

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:48.119
the payoff matrix of the legal identification
problem that is raised by bribing a cop. And

00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:52.430
bribing a maitre d' is a perfect example where
the clash is between the authorities that

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:59.160
a maitre d' ordinarily exerts over its fiefdom
and the reciprocity that you are raising by

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:05.770
the possibility of the bribe. So, once again,
your choices are: offer a bribe. If your choice

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:09.870
is would just offer a bribe or don't offer
a bribe, the results would depend on whether

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:14.250
you got a corrupt maitre d' who would accept
it and seat you immediately, or a scrupulous

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:19.049
maitre d' who would say, "How dare you insult
me. What kind of establishment do you think

00:52:19.049 --> 00:52:25.690
that is?" If you don't offer a bribe, you
accept the dominance relationship of the maitre

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:30.410
d' and you avoid the awkwardness but you'll
just have the long wait for the table. If

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:34.869
you offer the bribe, then if you have a corrupt
maitre d' who consummates the reciprocity

00:52:34.869 --> 00:52:39.329
relationship, you get the quick table. When
you have the scrupulous ones who continue

00:52:39.329 --> 00:52:44.910
to maintain dominance when you're suggesting
reciprocity, you get that unpleasant emotion

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:52.420
called "awkwardness." If you say, "I was hoping
there might be a cancellation," on the other

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:56.710
hand, the corrupt maitre d' could sense the
bribe and you get the high benefit of the

00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:01.000
quick table. The scrupulous one could choice
to ignore it, and the worst that you'd have

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.970
is the long wait preserving the harmony of
relationship type. So this is--I think there's

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:13.740
one problem that still remains, even solving
the maitre d' problem, which is that people

00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:18.950
aren't naïve. How do you deal with the problem
of meta-knowledge the fact that usually both

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:25.090
parties know when an overture has been made
by innuendo? Life isn't a court of law. You

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:31.549
don't have to prove it beyond a reasonable
doubt. And so, any deniability is not in fact

00:53:31.549 --> 00:53:38.329
all that plausible at all. Why should an obvious
indirect overture feel less awkward than an

00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:44.549
overture that is in so many words and that--and
hence is on the record. Now, illustrate that

00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:50.340
with a scene from the romantic comedy "When
Harry Met Sally." Early on the film when the

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:55.490
couple has just met, Harry makes a sexual
comment and Sally says, "You're coming on

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:59.829
to me." And he says, "What do you want me
to about it? I take it back. Okay? I take

00:53:59.829 --> 00:54:04.500
it back." And she says, "You can't take it
back." And he says, "Why not?" She says, "Because

00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:09.359
it's already out there." He says, "Oh, jeez.
What are we supposed to do? Call the cops?

00:54:09.359 --> 00:54:14.160
It's already out there." So the puzzle is
what is the status of an overture that is

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:20.000
sensed to be "out there" or "on the record"
or "once said, can't be unsaid," that makes

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.260
it so much worse than a veiled overture that's
implicated indirectly? Well, there are a number

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:30.650
of answers, but I think the most compelling
is the concept that logicians and economist

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:36.510
sometimes call "mutual knowledge or common
knowledge" which must be differentiated from

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:42.850
identical individual knowledge. In the individual
knowledge: A knows X and B know X. In mutual

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:48.890
knowledge: A knows X, B knows X, A knows that
B knows X, B knows that A knows X, A knows

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:57.529
that B knows that A knows X add in as an item.
Now, this is a distinction with a difference

00:54:57.529 --> 00:55:04.839
that there are qualitative differences between
shared identical knowledge and mutual or common

00:55:04.839 --> 00:55:10.519
knowledge in a technical sense. And a couple
of everyday examples are: 1) why do democracy

00:55:10.519 --> 00:55:17.210
enshrine freedom of assembly as a fundamental
right and why are so many political revolutions

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:22.579
instigated when a crowd assembles in a public
square. Well, before the assembly, everyone

00:55:22.579 --> 00:55:27.539
may have known that they were disgruntled,
but when everyone comes together for that

00:55:27.539 --> 00:55:33.859
reason, now everyone knows that everyone else
knows that everyone is disgruntled. That mutual

00:55:33.859 --> 00:55:38.569
knowledge can embolden people to challenge
the authority relationship and bring down

00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:44.099
a dictator who would otherwise be able to
pick people off one at the time. Likewise,

00:55:44.099 --> 00:55:49.670
the whole point of the Emperor's New Clothes
story depends on the concept of mutual knowledge.

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:53.960
With the little voice said the Emperor is
naked. He wasn't telling anyone anything they

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:59.750
didn't already know, individually. But, he
was conveying information nonetheless. Now,

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:04.349
everyone knew that everyone else knew and
that everyone else knew that they knew, once

00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:08.450
again that could change the relationship and
they could challenge the authority of the

00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:14.339
Emperor. The moral of this is that language
is a very good way of exploding individual

00:56:14.339 --> 00:56:20.539
knowledge into mutual knowledge. The hypothesis
is that innuendoes merely provide individual

00:56:20.539 --> 00:56:25.640
knowledge where as direct speech provides
mutual knowledge and it's mutual knowledge

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:31.700
that is a trigger for maintaining or changing
a relationship. So, if Harry were to say,

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:36.410
"Would you like to come up and see my etchings,"
Sally knows that she has turned down an overture.

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:41.549
Harry knows that she has turned down an overture.
But does Sally know that Harry knows? She

00:56:41.549 --> 00:56:46.250
could think to herself, "Maybe Harry thinks
I'm naive." And does Harry know that Sally

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:52.490
knows that he knows? Harry might wonder, "Maybe
Sally thinks I'm dense." There is no mutual

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:56.910
knowledge and they can maintain the fiction
of a friendship. Whereas if Harry where to

00:56:56.910 --> 00:57:01.360
have said, "Would you like to come up and
have sex?" Then, Harry knows that Sally knows

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:05.940
that Harry knows that Sally knows, they cannot
maintain the fiction of a friendship. And

00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:10.750
I think this is what's behind the intuition
that with overt speech, you can't take it

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:16.280
back, it's out there. To sum up language as
a window into social relationships, people

00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:21.299
have to convey messages while unsure of their
relationship, indirect speech could minimize

00:57:21.299 --> 00:57:26.960
the risks in legal context with tangible costs
like bribes and threats. The same thing could

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:32.450
happen in everyday life because relationship
mismatches could have an emotional cost. And

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:37.390
finally, indirect speech prevents individual
knowledge from becoming mutual knowledge and

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:42.410
its mutual knowledge that's the basis for
a relationship. Okay, we'll now I'm going

00:57:42.410 --> 00:57:52.500
to begin the end of my talk. In a psychology,
one often faces the problem of overcoming

00:57:52.500 --> 00:58:00.180
people's familiarity with their own mental
processes and way of life to nullify the anesthetic

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:05.820
of familiarity, to make a familiar seem strange.
And one way of doing that is by framing the

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:13.279
problem, in terms of being a Martian scientist.
How would a Martian biologist arriving on

00:58:13.279 --> 00:58:19.140
earth with no preconceptions characterize
our species? Today's question is how would

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:25.690
a Martian linguist describe our species documenting
our nature just from the way we use language?

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:31.180
Well, I think you could say a lot when it
comes to human cognition, the Martian linguist

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:35.809
would say that humans have an intuitive theory
of the physical world. They locate things

00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:41.529
in space by identifying places and locating
objects in qualitative relationships to them.

00:58:41.529 --> 00:58:46.910
They construe matter as formless stuff or
discrete things which are stretched along

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:51.869
one, two or three dimensions. They order and
package events in time, relative to their

00:58:51.869 --> 00:58:57.609
own motion, moment of consciousness, and they
explain events by identifying their causes

00:58:57.609 --> 00:59:03.940
namely an actor that impinges on an entity.
Human intuitive physics differs from real

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:09.039
physics, but it helps them to reason and agree
about aspects of reality relevant to their

00:59:09.039 --> 00:59:15.109
purposes, their understanding of cause and
effect, what they can know, change and will,

00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:22.059
how they package and quantify their experience
and how they assign moral responsibility.

00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:28.400
People not only have ideas, but they steep
them with emotion. They stand in awe of deities.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:35.740
They are terrified by disease, death and infirmity.
They are revolted by bodily secretions. They

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:41.950
loathe enemies, traitors and subordinate peoples.
They take a prurient interest in sexuality

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:47.720
in all its variations. Despite having negative
reactions to so many thoughts, humans willingly

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:52.240
inflict these thoughts on one another; to
remind them of the unpleasant nature of certain

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:57.780
things, to intimidate or denigrate them, to
get their attention, or to advertise their

00:59:57.780 --> 01:00:04.220
reactions to life's frustrations and setbacks.
When it comes to human social life, humans

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:10.450
are very, very touchy about their relationships.
With some of their fellows typically kin,

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:16.740
lovers and friends, humans freely share and
do favors. With others, they jockey for dominance.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:22.640
With still others, they trade goods and services
on a tit-for-tat basis. People distinguish

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:27.240
these relationships sharply. When one person
breaches the logic of a relationship with

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:32.829
another, they both suffer an emotional cost.
Nonetheless humans often risk these breaches,

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:38.720
sometimes to get on with the business of life,
sometimes to renegotiate their relationship.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:43.980
Finally, humans think a lot about what other
humans thinks about them, and their relationship

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:49.180
are ratified by this mutual knowledge. They
know that others know they know what kind

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:54.470
of relationship they share. As a result, to
perverse their relationships while transacting

01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:59.869
the business of their lives, humans often
engage in hypocrisy and taboo. And those are

01:00:59.869 --> 01:01:04.470
some of the ways in which language can serve
as a window into human nature. Thank you very

01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:18.549
much. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Do you guys want to have some questions?

01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:23.150
Can we have a few minutes for questions?
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Any questions? You can, gracefully,

01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:24.150
yes.
&gt;&gt; Hi.

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.710
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yes, where are you? There you are.
&gt;&gt; I'm over here.

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:28.440
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yes.
&gt;&gt; I want to thank you for speaking today.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.849
It was awesome.
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Thank you.

01:01:30.849 --> 01:01:39.019
&gt;&gt; I have a question about your description
about why swearing has the impact it us, oh,

01:01:39.019 --> 01:01:46.920
you know, we're disgusted by effluvia. What
that doesn't explain is why a person who perfectly

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.850
understands multiple words for effluvia will
find some of them swearing.

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:56.710
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And some of them perfectly an objectionable.

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:59.309
Do you have a comment on that?
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yeah, you know, it's a very good,

01:01:59.309 --> 01:02:04.099
a very pointed question. So, it can't simply
be that the word is associated with the referent.

01:02:04.099 --> 01:02:12.220
In addition, I think there is the taboo words,
have the, the--communicative intent, packaged

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:20.529
into them that says, I am referring to this
with full, with the intention of arouse it

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:27.440
in you the emotional reaction that the referent
ordinarily arouses. So in addition to the

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.319
semantics of what in the world it points to,
there's this additional communicative of message

01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:37.420
of here's why I'm doing it in order to offend
you. That is absolutely, you're right, that's

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:42.190
absolutely crucial to the distinction between
a taboo word and its polite euphemism.

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:47.910
&gt;&gt; So, congratulations. I think you've just
done 90 percent of this swearing that's ever

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:53.960
been done in this room in 20 minutes.
&gt;&gt; PINKER: I insist, that I don't swear, I

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:55.480
talk about swearing.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.549
&gt;&gt; PINKER: See, and if you've taken philosophy
or recognized the use versus mentioned distinction?

01:02:59.549 --> 01:03:07.970
&gt;&gt; I'll keep that trick in mind. I'm wondering
whether part of your claim is also that these

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:13.190
swear words basically span the space of important
negative emotions or whether, you know, there

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:16.979
are gaps, are there important negative emotions
that aren't accounted for by swearing?

01:03:16.979 --> 01:03:21.559
&gt;&gt; PINKER: I think, in a particular language,
they don't span the space, they sample from

01:03:21.559 --> 01:03:27.490
it. Across the world's languages, I suspect
they would span the space that is if--I mean,

01:03:27.490 --> 01:03:33.370
it's kind a surprising to hear, you know,
"cholera" as a taboo word in Yiddish and also

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:38.180
in Polish, and what has to look across languages
to get the full spectrum. But, there are enough

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:44.141
of them that I suspect you would. In a hundred
agriculturists, for example, their taboo words

01:03:44.141 --> 01:03:49.170
for dangerous animals, you can't, you can't
mention the name of the word impolite company,

01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:53.730
the name of the animal, for example.
&gt;&gt; Yes, do you have any favorite theories

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:58.650
or experiments about either of the following,
one is use of swear words to cover for a small

01:03:58.650 --> 01:03:59.769
vocabulary...
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yeah.

01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:04.430
&gt;&gt; For pejoratives and exclamations. The second
is a dampening effect for if someone who subjected

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:08.701
to a lot of curse words in a recent past,
the next one doesn't have as much of an emotional

01:04:08.701 --> 01:04:11.740
effect on them.
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yeah. That's certainly true, and

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:19.730
I think especially emphatic swearing and idiomatic
swearing can often be used to make up for

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:28.339
a, otherwise, limited linguistic resources
because the challenge of a speaker is to retain

01:04:28.339 --> 01:04:31.650
the listeners' attention of why should I listen
to you as opposed to all the other people

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:36.289
that they could listen to. And a cheap way
of doing that is to exploit this little buzz

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:44.300
that a taboo word arouses and just like other
ways of trying to keep listeners listening

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:46.920
to you as opposed to all the other people
that they could be listening to you can rely

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:52.249
on that. I think that it's not enough just
to hear the swear words, I think that they

01:04:52.249 --> 01:04:59.349
have to be heard in a context in which one
knows that they're not being used in an aggressive

01:04:59.349 --> 01:05:08.339
or taboo-breaking fashion. So one of them
could be the use of taboo words in these idioms

01:05:08.339 --> 01:05:20.019
which clearly in [INDISTINCT] of soldiers
and athletes and Australians and teenagers.

01:05:20.019 --> 01:05:24.160
They lose some of their stimulant and you
could see that happening over time. In Mainstream

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.680
English its happened too "bloody and damn"
both of which were Taboo in the first half

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:34.670
of 20th Century as in when Rhett Butler said,
"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn," and

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:43.460
it was considered shocking at a time. In Australia,
New Zealand, "bugger" is a perfectly acceptable

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:49.329
word, so that can happen and also of course
there's the phenomenon of the targets of taboo

01:05:49.329 --> 01:05:57.990
epithets appropriating the word in affectionate
conversation among themselves therefore nullifying

01:05:57.990 --> 01:06:03.779
it as in the affectionate use of nigger among
African-Americans or [INDISTINCT] dyke, bitch

01:06:03.779 --> 01:06:06.519
and so on. That's another way in which they
can be defanged.

01:06:06.519 --> 01:06:15.839
&gt;&gt; So mainly thinking of something else, there
is the opposite effect of euphemistic decay

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:20.480
whether euphemism has become proxies to the
other things. Like, playground language dot

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.649
and going people special because that's a...
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yes.

01:06:23.649 --> 01:06:27.089
&gt;&gt; That now means retarded.
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yes, I call that the euphemism

01:06:27.089 --> 01:06:28.089
treadmill.
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:06:28.089 --> 01:06:33.309
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Where when the referent continues
to be emotionally charged, the euphemism will

01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:39.430
cease to become a euphemism and will in turn
become offensive. So, yeah, you're right.

01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:44.641
A complete answer would say that it doesn't
always work and sometimes the referent can

01:06:44.641 --> 01:06:48.309
just taint any word that is used in connection
with it even a new one.

01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:54.339
&gt;&gt; So what I was actually going to ask about
was one of the things that's very popular

01:06:54.339 --> 01:06:57.770
at the moment in the computing world is what
we call social software or social networks

01:06:57.770 --> 01:07:02.089
but we're tying to construct models for people
to communicate with each other and it strikes

01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:05.599
me that from what you said about representing
human relations, we're making a mess of it

01:07:05.599 --> 01:07:10.410
by just calling one friend or, you know, not
expressing the nuances here. Are we not losing

01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:14.880
here or do you think we could express these
euphemistic things in terms that we can understand.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:20.220
&gt;&gt; PINKER: It might be possible because there
is the--of this three relationships, an enormous

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:26.460
amount of cultural--a number of cultural practices
in social life comes in to a kind of mind

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:33.470
manipulation to try to force or seduce people
to accept one or another of these relationship

01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:39.019
types. So for example, the use of kinship
terms, like, you know, sisterhood is powerful,

01:07:39.019 --> 01:07:44.421
brother can you spare a dime is one way of
getting a stranger into the mindset of communality.

01:07:44.421 --> 01:07:52.130
Wearing--signs of dominants, the, you know,
the headdresses and epaulettes and shoulder

01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:59.509
pads, I think I have some shoulder pads here
are ways of conveying a smidgeon of dominance

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:04.559
in a relationship that otherwise would be
a egalitarian and there are numerous techniques

01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:13.160
some verbal, some almost have to be non-verbal
in order to be effective where we try to manipulate

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:17.609
people to accept one or the other. So they
are--I think we've got these three switch

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:24.630
settings in our brain, but what triggers them
can be as often a subject of benign and sometimes

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:29.219
not so benign manipulation, so it could be
possible. Yeah.

01:08:29.219 --> 01:08:36.819
&gt;&gt; So I think there are a lot of common instances
where the words decay, you started talking

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:43.270
about how a word had a very strong potent
effect at some point in over time it lost

01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:51.190
that, are there many examples of the opposite
when a common word becomes, you know, tainted

01:08:51.190 --> 01:08:56.850
and attracts that. I was told, you know, once
that, you know, the words like shit where

01:08:56.850 --> 01:09:00.700
just sort of everyday, Anglo-Saxon words and
that they acquired that power.

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:08.190
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yes, that's exactly right. And
one reads in sources before more or less before

01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:13.600
the reformation I think that might be a dividing
line where which marked the transition from

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:20.380
religious to sexual and scatological wearing
in Protestant but not in Catholic countries

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:26.850
were it was routine religious wearing but
it may have been then that words as you note

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:32.600
shit and fuck and cunt were actually unexceptionable
words in English and they took on a taboo

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:37.980
status. Something like that in more recent
times is what happened to the word nigger

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:43.369
over the last little while which is why you
can get library wars surrounding Huckleberry

01:09:43.369 --> 01:09:49.409
Finn where the casual use of nigger in Huckleberry
Finn, it certainly wasn't a respectful term

01:09:49.409 --> 01:09:56.219
but it didn't have that same aura of racism
and contempt that it has now and nigger probably

01:09:56.219 --> 01:10:01.139
are our most taboo word might be an example
of that. I think it might be true of other

01:10:01.139 --> 01:10:11.380
term seemed to be kind of misogynistic and
where we have--increased activity as in Don

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:16.739
Imus using the word "ho" out of context where
it caused him his job because of our heightened

01:10:16.739 --> 01:10:22.429
sensitivities to racial and gender bias. So
you can almost see a transition where originally

01:10:22.429 --> 01:10:27.330
people really were worried about God and hell
than they were worried about sexuality and

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:31.760
excretion, now they're worried about sexism
and racism.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:36.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there seemed to be sort of power
relationships, I was wondering if there's

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:39.780
sort of more ordinary and a more ordinary
example?

01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:44.989
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Well, I think some of them are--I
don't know if they are power so much as say,

01:10:44.989 --> 01:10:49.270
imposed by those in power to retain power
so much as...

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:51.810
&gt;&gt; Dominance, yeah. Yeah, dominance.
&gt;&gt; PINKER: It could be dominants but I think

01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:58.180
it's also just what people are kind of edgy
about and that creates the opening I think

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:02.910
for using certain words to get a rise out
of people, so I suspect I don't know. I haven't

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:08.610
really thought about but I suspect it's more
of a kind of what's in the air than the authorities

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:12.610
kind of imposing it from the top down, it
would be my hunch.

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:21.550
&gt;&gt; You spoke a lot about the connection between
swear words and negative emotions, I wonder

01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:25.300
also about the connection between swear words
and humor, or swear words and laughter, you

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:29.510
may have noticed that it caused a lot of laughter
in this room when you mentioned a lot of those

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:34.630
words. It's also something that you hear a
lot maybe in a comedy show just to kind of

01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:37.140
invoke that laughter, I wonder if you have
any comments on that.

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:42.219
&gt;&gt; PINKER: That's right. It is also talking
about lazy ways of getting a laugh out of

01:11:42.219 --> 01:11:47.500
people often taboo words can do that. I think
it's probably because--by the way, just an

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:54.060
aside is that laughter is also a very good
way of generating mutual knowledge and I would

01:11:54.060 --> 01:12:01.940
argue that the evolutionary function of laughter
is to generate mutual knowledge. It's involuntary.

01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:08.330
It's conspicuous. It's more common in social
settings than in isolation. It's contagious

01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:15.179
and so on. But why--why do you laugh in public?
In particular what's the common denominator

01:12:15.179 --> 01:12:20.170
with swearing? I think it's the reduction
of dignity just about all humor involve some

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:26.600
kind of reduction in dignity. You either take
someone down a few pegs, making him the butt

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:36.250
of a joke or to maintain communality and negate
dominance among friends. You tease your friends

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:42.619
or deprecate yourself but descent and dignity
is, I think, the common denominator in human--in

01:12:42.619 --> 01:12:51.400
humor I'm sorry--and the undignified nature
of what you refer to in swearing is, I mean,

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:56.750
an ingredient of taboo language.
&gt;&gt; I came in a little late so I apologize

01:12:56.750 --> 01:13:00.090
if you've already addressed this in the beginning,
but I was wondering if you could speak to

01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:04.139
the tone in which language is delivered and
not necessarily just the word selection. So

01:13:04.139 --> 01:13:08.030
something as innocuous says, "What are you
doing?" "Hey, what are you doing?" "What are

01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:11.470
you doing?" "Hey, what are you doing?" Like...
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yeah.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:17.300
&gt;&gt; For example.
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Yes, well that's the porosity which

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:26.050
often can be used both for emphasis, for stressing
a particular part of your utterance which

01:13:26.050 --> 01:13:31.190
the listener ought to attend too often in
contrast with some implied set of alternatives

01:13:31.190 --> 01:13:40.070
is a very powerful rhetorical tool and superimposed
on that is the elocutionary force of an utterance,

01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:44.110
question versus statement versus command.
And a third dimension on top of those two

01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:52.130
is emotion: anger, sarcasms, irony and so
on. That's one of the reasons why written

01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:58.369
language can so easily be misunderstood if
you don't have those intonational cues, why

01:13:58.369 --> 01:14:03.790
we have crude approximations like italics
and exclamation points but it really is an

01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:11.250
essential ingredient to linguistic communication.
And of course put to grammatical uses in languages

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:17.230
like Chinese in which tone is used as a way
of contrasting vowels. In connection to today's

01:14:17.230 --> 01:14:23.810
talk I suspect that tone of voice is one of
the ways in which you learn which words are

01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:32.090
taboo as a child namely if some epithet is
being uttered in an angry and contemptuous

01:14:32.090 --> 01:14:40.420
tone of voice that it is more likely to be
registered as a taboo imprecation. Likewise,

01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:46.270
in cathartic swearing, how do you know which
of the taboo words that you utter when you

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:51.330
stub your tone and so on? Well, it's the--I
think accompaniment of the word and emotional

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:57.710
tone of voice that register that association
in the brain.

01:14:57.710 --> 01:14:59.170
&gt;&gt; And I would just like to say thank you
very much for coming.

01:14:59.170 --> 01:15:02.310
&gt;&gt; PINKER: Thanks for having me here today.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
