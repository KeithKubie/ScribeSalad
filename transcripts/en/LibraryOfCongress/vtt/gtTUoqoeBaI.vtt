00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.880
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: Well thanks
again for joining us today

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.890
to celebrate the birthday of a very
special writer, Flannery O'Connor.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.010 position:56%
My name is Anya Creightney and I am
the program specialist of the Poetry

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.260
and Literature Center at
the Library of Congress.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.530
I am also a proud partner
in this series, representing

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.710
and celebrating the careers of many

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.930
of our most valuable
literary voices.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.560
I'm especially happy
today as this event,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.690
Flannery O'Connor's literary
birthday celebration,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.330
has been two years in the making.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.630
The event was originally
slated for last year and due

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.880
to scheduling conflicts we
initially abandoned our concept

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.500
of celebrating Flannery.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.240
But ultimately genuine
curiosity and admiration

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.300
of O'Connor kept Flannery
in our minds.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.550
So it's with unique, so it
is with this unique pleasure

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.060
that I welcome our
participants Emily Mitchell

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.940
and Bonnie Jo Campbell here today.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.290 position:56%
Before sharing a little bit about
the organization of today's program,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.940
I just want to tell you a
little bit about our authors.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.430
Bonnie Jo Campbell is
the author of two novels.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.370
Once Upon a River, a national
best seller, and Q Road.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.890 position:56%
Her critically acclaimed short
fiction collections include American

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.060
Salvage, Women and Other
Animals, and most recently,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.580
Mothers Tell Your Daughters,
published in the fall of 2015

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.760
and also on sale in the back.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.190
Emily Mitchell's debut novel,
the Last Summer of the World,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.050
was published by Norton
in 2007 and was a finalist

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.330
for the New York Public
Library Young Lions Award.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.090
Her first collection of
short stories, Viral,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.840
was published in June 2015 and was
described by the New York Book,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.980
excuse me, New York Times
Book Review as quote alluring,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.620
the best stories here pushed
towards true heartbreak, end quote.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.490
Emily teaches locally at
the University of Maryland.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.060
And now, just for a
little event breakdown

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.000
so that you're all with us.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.990
Each writer will lecture
for approximately 20 minutes

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.760
and both will conclude by
sharing excerpts of her work.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.270
Afterward we will break
slightly with tradition

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.680
and both authors will take
questions from the audience

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.550
after their reading, so be thinking

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.580
or notating your questions
during their lecture.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.230
And lastly before I turn it over,
I just want to remind everyone

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.530
to turn off their cell phones
or anything that would interrupt

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.790
with today's programming.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.850
And let me also remind you that the
Poetry and Literature Center puts

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.270
on 30 to 40 public programs
just like this one every year.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.110
So, if you're interested
to find more

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.320
out about this particular series
or others, please put your name

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.900
on our email list in
the back of the room.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.610
And without further ado, you guys
will help me welcome our writers.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.290
And first up is Emily Mitchell,
followed by Bonnie Jo Campbell.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.090
Thank you.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.500
[ Applause ]

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.720
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell:
Gosh, thank you to Anya

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.490
for that lovely introduction.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.710
I am so pleased and a little
daunted to be here today.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.490
In Flannery O'Connor's story, A
Late Encounter with the Enemy,

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.760
the reader meets General
Tennessee Flintrock Sash,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.540
a 104-year-old Confederate veteran.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.150
And the 64-year-old granddaughter

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.000
with whom he lives,
Sally Poker Sash.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.110
Thank you.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.110
General Sash we learn
was in fact not a general

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.710
in the Civil War or
in any other war.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.400 position:56%
He acquired his much admired uniform
as part of the promotional pageantry

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.590
from a movie premiere
just 12 years earlier.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.330
Now, in the narrative
present of the story,

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.710
the wheelchair bound general is
attending Sally Poker's belated

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.460
graduation from teaching college.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.660
He has been left in the care of
a young boy called John Wesley

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.910
who has been tasked to bring him
up onto the stage for the ceremony.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.420
The graduates in their heavy
robes, looked as if the last beads

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.440
of ignorance were being
sweated out of them.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.280
The sun blazed off the
fenders of automobiles and beat

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.660
from the columns of
buildings and pulled the eye

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.540
from one spot of glare to another.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.620
It pulled Sally Poker's toward
the big red Coca Cola machine

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.000
that had been set up by
the side of the auditorium.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.850
Here she saw the General parked,
scowling and hatless in his chair

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.910
in the blazing sun,
while John Wesley,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.350
his blouse loose behind
his hip and cheek pressed

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.810
to the red machine was
drinking a Coca Cola.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.330 position:56%
She broke from the line and galloped
to him and snatched the bottle away.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.340
She shook the boy and
thrust in his blouse

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.050
and put the hat on
the old man's head.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.390
Now get him in there, she
said, pointing one rigid finger

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.030
to the side door of the building.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.490 position:56%
For his part, the General felt as if
there were a little hole beginning

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.830
to develop and widen
in the top of his head.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.220
The boy wheeled rapidly down a walk
and up a ramp and into a building

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.170
and bumped him over
the stage entrance

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.170
and into position where
he had been told.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.900
And the General glared in front
of him at heads that all seemed

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.380
that to flow together and eyes that
moved from one face to another.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.440 position:56%
Several figures in black robes came
and picked up his hand and shook it.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.790
A black procession was following
up each aisle and forming

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.660
to stately music in a
pool in front of him.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.050
The music seemed to be entering
his head through the little hole

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.440
and he thought for a second
that the procession would try

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.460
to enter it too.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.940
He didn't know what
procession this was,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.100
but there was something
familiar about it.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.700
It must be familiar to him since it
had come to meet him and he didn't

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.470
like the black procession.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.250
And any procession that came to
meet him, he thought irritably,

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.730
ought to have floats with
beautiful girls on them.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.120
Like the floats before the premier.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.740
It must be something
connected with history

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.900
like they were always having.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.050
He had no use for any of it.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.870
What happened then wasn't anything

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.570
to a man living now
and he was living now.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.870
When all the procession had
flowed into the black pool,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.420
a black figure began
orating in front of it.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.060
The figure was telling something
about history and the General made

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.170
up his mind he wouldn't listen.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.420
But the words kept seeping through
the little hole in his head.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.170
He heard his own name mentioned

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:17.630
and his chair was shuffled
forward roughly,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.740
and the boy scout took a big bow.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.270
They called his name
and the fat brat bowed.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.350
God damn you, the old
man tried to say,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.770
get out of my way, I can stand up.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.350
But he was jerked back again
and before he could get up

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.480
and take his bow, he supposed
the noise they made was for him.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.560
If he was over he didn't intend
to listen to any more of it.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.940
If it hadn't been for the little
hole in the top of his head,

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.570
none of the words would
have gotten to him.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.880
He thought of putting a finger up
there into the hole to block them,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.330
but the hole was a little wider
than his finger and it felt

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.580
as if it was getting deeper.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.480
Another black robe had taken
the place of the first one

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.610
and was talking now and he
heard his name mentioned again,

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.390 position:56%
but they were not talking about him,
but they were talking about history.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.130
If we forget our past,
the speaker was saying,

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.780
we won't remember our
future and it will be

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.570
as well for we won't have one.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.980
The General heard some
of these words gradually.

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.910
He had forgotten history and he
didn't intend to remember it again.

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:21.720
He had forgotten the name and
face of his wife and the names

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.670
and faces of his children.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.920
Or even if he had a
wife and children.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.550
And he had forgotten the name and
places and the places themselves.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.850
And what had happened at them.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:35.840
He was considerably irked
by the hole in his head.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.550
He had not expected to have a
hole in his head at this event.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:44.600
It was the slow black music
that had put it there.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.830
And though most of the
music had stopped outside,

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:52.320
there was still a little of it in
the hole going deeper and moving

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.640
around in his thoughts,
letting the words he heard

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.150
into the dark places of his brain.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.830 position:56%
He had heard the words, Chickamauga.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.430
Shiloh, Johnston, and Lee.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.520
And he knew he was
inspiring all these words

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.180
that meant nothing to him.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.250
He wondered if he had been a
General at Chickamauga or at Lee.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.700
Then he tried to see himself and
the horse mounted in the middle

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.900
of the float full of beautiful
girls being driven slowly

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.030
through downtown Atlanta.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:24.060 position:56%
Instead, the old words began to stir
in his head as if they were trying

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.110
to wrench themselves out
of place and come to life.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:33.630 position:56%
The speaker was through with that
war and had gone on to the next one.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.470 position:56%
And now, he was approaching another.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:39.480 position:56%
And all of his words, like the black
procession were vaguely familiar

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.110
and irritating.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.090
There was a long finger of music

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.010
in the General's head
probing various spots

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.980
that were words letting in
a little light on the words

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.890
and helping them to live.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.220
The words that, the words began

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.570
to come towards him
and he said, Damn it.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.350
I ain't going to have it.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.140
And he started edging
backwards to get out of the way.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.020
Then he saw the figure in the black
robe sit down and there was a noise

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.110
and the black pool in front
of him began to rumble

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.590
and to flow towards him from either
side, like the black slow music.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:12.890
And he said, Stop, damn it.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.450
I can't do but one thing at a time.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.310
He couldn't protect
himself from the words

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.180
and attend to the procession too.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.700
And the words were
coming at him fast.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.810
He felt that he was
running backwards

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.890
and the words were coming
at him like musket fire.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:31.030
Just escaping him, but
getting nearer and nearer.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.510
He turned around and began
to run as fast as he could,

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.890
but he found himself
running towards the words.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.460
He was running into a
regular volley of them

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.750
and meeting them with quick curses.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:47.920
As the music swirled towards him
the entire past opened up on him

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.560
out of nowhere, and he felt his
body riddled in a 100 places

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.450
with the sharp stabs of pain.

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.380
And he fell down, returning
a curse for every hit.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.550
He saw his wife's narrow face
looking at him critically

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.040
through her round gold
framed glasses.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.860
He saw one of his squinting
bald headed sons

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.690
and his mother run towards
him with an anxious look.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:14.490
And a succession of places,
Chickamauga, Shiloh, Marthasville,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:18.040
rush at him as if the past
was the only future now

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.400
and he had to endure it.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.250
Then suddenly he saw that the
black procession was almost on him.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.860
He recognized it.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.400
For it had been dogging
him all his days.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.870
He made a desperate effort
to see over it and find

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.370
out what comes after
the past and that.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.390 position:56%
He made a such a desperate effort to
see over it and find out what comes

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.220
after the past, that his
hand clenched the sword

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.470
until the blade touched bone.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.800
The graduates were crossing
the stage in a lone file

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.280
to receive their scrolls and
shake the President's hand.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:58.150
As Sally Poker was near the end,
crossed, she glanced at the General

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.380
and saw him sitting fixed and
fierce, his eyes wide open

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.650
and she turned her
head forward again

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:09.440
and held it a perceptible degree
higher and received her scroll.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.500 position:56%
Once it was over, and she was out of
the auditorium and in the sun again,

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.620
she located her kin and they waited
together on the bench in the shade

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.280
for John Wesley to
wheel the old man out.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.160
That crafty scout had bumped him
out the back way and rolled him

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.050
at high speed down a flagstone path
and was waiting now with the corpse

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.130
in the long line at
the Coca Cola machine.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:40.350
As I said, I am pleased and a
little daunted to be here today.

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:46.150
I'm by no means an expert on
Flannery O'Connor and I'm certain

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.950 position:56%
that there are people here
listening who know a great deal more

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.510
about her life and works than I do.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.300
But what I am is somebody
who writes short stories

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.850
and aspires to write them well.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:02.280
And in that capacity I want to
talk a little bit about O'Connor

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.440
and what her work means to me.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.400
The passage I just read exemplifies
some of the aspects of her work

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.430
that I admire the most and
that I found the most valuable

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.790
to my own development as a writer.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.870
O'Connor is justly known
as a writer who evokes

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.630
with tremendous precision
the conventions and manners

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.600
of her own time and place.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.830
But she's also I think a
great writer of ghost stories.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:33.530
She is a great observer
and chronicler of the ways

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:39.150
in which human beings and perhaps
American human beings especially

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.450
are haunted.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.870
We are haunted by the past and
we are haunted by those aspects

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:49.570 position:56%
of the world that we are least happy
to acknowledge and quickest to deny.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.720
And this haunting in
only intensified

00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:03.390
and perhaps is even caused by
our concerted efforts to escape,

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:10.080
to be reborn and renewed, to
transcend, to overcome by an act

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.250
of personal determination.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.530
The more we insist
that we have moved on,

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:21.330
that we are as General Sash puts
it, living now, the more what we,

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.000
what we wish to deny dogs us.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.190
O'Connor characters draw to
themselves the vary things

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.040
that they dread the most.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.080
The people and events which disrupt
their comfortable assumptions.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.600
And in O'Connor's view, of course,

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.580
such disruption is precisely
what we need in order

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.480
that we might have the
possibility of experiencing grace.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:46.040
I first came across O'Connor's
stories and essays in college

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.170
and I found in her uncompromising
depictions the permission

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.470
that I needed to pursue
my own fledgling fiction.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:55.870
I learned from her that
your characters need not

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.900
to likable to be fascinating.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.560
That the purpose of
a story is to reveal

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.440
and not necessarily to resolve.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.040
I learned that the
meaning of a story must be

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.930
to use O'Connor's words,
experienced meaning.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.290
A story she says is a
way to say something

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.860
that can't be said any other way.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.290
I learned that a story
must grow its own meaning

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.610
over the course of its unfolding.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.570
The characters and the objects
in the story accumulating meaning

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.450 position:56%
from the action of the story itself.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:30.190 position:56%
But most importantly, I learned that
the boundary between the present

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.410
and the past is very thin indeed

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.120
and sometimes it disintegrates
altogether.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:42.020
So I'm going to finish with a short
story from my first collection

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.280
that I think owes its existence
to O'Connor in this respect.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:58.370
It's called, A Boy My
Sister Dated in High School.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:01.860
A boy my sister dated in
high school slapped her

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.120
across the face during an argument.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.700
They were sitting in the
front seat of his car,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.370
parked by the basketball
court behind our house,

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.140
and she made a sarcastic reply
to something he had said.

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.110
And before she knew what was
happening, he'd raised his hand

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.290
and swung it, open-palmed,
against her cheek.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:24.260
She didn't tell me about
this until years later

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.820
after we had both left home.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:31.720 position:56%
When she did tell me, I felt at
once angry and then strangely guilty

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.550
because the boy in question was
extraordinarily good-looking

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.790
and I remembered having been
impressed in a shallow way

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.200
that I never spoke about that
my sister was dating someone

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.500
so handsome.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.120
I was jealous of a lot of things
about my sister in those days:

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.510 position:56%
her beauty and her ease with people,

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.470
how spontaneously funny she
could be, how well she was liked.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:57.430
She fit in at our school and
in our town, in her own body,

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.430
in a way that I could not seem
to manage, quiet and bookish

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.590
and peculiar as I was
then and remain.

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:08.390
Still, there was never a time
when I didn't love her very much

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.960
and when I wouldn't have
done whatever I could

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.220
to support and defend her.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.200
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.070
I asked, when she finally told did.

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:20.520
When the boy she was
dating hit my sister,

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.290
it made a sharp cracking sound,
just like it does in the movies.

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:28.200
She raised her hand and touched
the side of her own face.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.910
The expanse of skin where
he'd struck her buzzed

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.130
and tingled, felt weirdly alive.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:37.520
It didn't hurt or, and even
the actual slap itself hadn't

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.640
really hurt.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.460
Instead, she was shocked, surprised
because she had not expected this,

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.610
and then confused about
what she should do next.

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.970
She looked over at the boy she
was dating, who had just hit her.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:55.920
He was leaning way back against,
away from her against the car door

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:01.010
as if he was afraid, either of
her or of what he had just done.

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.370
In her eyes was an expression of
shock and remorse much more intense

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:08.510
than anything she herself
seemed to be feeling.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.390
He too had been surprised,

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:13.160
and he looked like he
might be about to cry.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.520
At that moment it came
into her mind that maybe,

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.650
in punishment for what he had done,
the gods had magically frozen him

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.600
in his current physical position:
curled up like a frightened fetus

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.330
with his eyes bugged out and
his mouth hanging slightly open.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.050
Perhaps he would be
stuck like that forever.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.520
In her mind she envisioned
having to explain

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.130
to the boy's mother how her
son had come to be paralyzed

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.210
in this posture: He hit me,
she would say, and then, well,

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.470
now he doesn't seem
able to move or speak.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.940
I'm sorry.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.270
She thought of him in various
scenes over the course of his life

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.080 position:56%
to come-in school, at home, in
church-still fixed in that attitude.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.260
And the absurdity of
these images together

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.090
with the amazement she still felt

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.180
at what had just occurred made
her suddenly snort with laughter.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.560
Her laughter seemed to free
the boy from his paralysis.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.860
"Oh, God," he said.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.160
"I'm so sorry.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.460
I'm so, so sorry.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.050
I didn't mean-" He reached out
towards her as though he wanted

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.240
to take back what he'd done,
but then he withdrew his hand.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.830
"I'm sorry," he said again.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.130
He hung his head.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.890
"I guess you should take
me home," my sister said.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.460
Suddenly she felt like crying.

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.880
He nodded and started the car.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.060
When they pulled up in
front of my parents' house,

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.450
he turned off the engine.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.710
He looked over at her mournfully.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.240
She suddenly thought that
he was making a huge,

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.170
self-centered melodrama
out of something

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:38.300
that really wasn't so important.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.870
He wanted to be a terrible,
unforgivable villain

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.510
and she did not want to
give him that satisfaction.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:44.810
"Look," she said.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:46.110
"I'm okay.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.410
It doesn't hurt.

00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:48.710
I'm not, like, scarred
for life or anything."

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.010
"Really?" he asked.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.310
"Really," she said.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.150
She leaned over and
kissed him on the cheek.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.700
He clasped her hands gratefully.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.480
They smiled at each other

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.020
because that was what
they were used to doing.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.850
When they smiled, it
felt for a moment,

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:07.700
it felt as if a moment before they
had been drowning in some cold,

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.200
unpleasant sea, and now they
were back on solid ground,

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:12.960
back in the world they knew.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.670
A wave of relief swept over them.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.860
"You were being kind
of a bitch," he said.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.250
"I was," she conceded.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.930
"And you were being
a class-one a-hole."

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:24.550
She opened the door and got out.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.220
"Can I call you tomorrow?"

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.820
he said after her.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.450
"Yes," she said and went inside.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.350
She could hardly even feel where
he had hit her at all anymore.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.950 position:56%
Because they had made up and because
she wasn't hurt, she didn't feel

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.650
like she needed to mention
to anyone what had happened.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.660
If she said anything to
our mother, she thought,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.060
she would only overreact.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:47.440
She would call the school,
and maybe the boy's parents.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.090
She would say things about violence
against women and the patriarchy,

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:54.260
the kind of embarrassing things
that my sister had to do her best

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.000
to ignore so she would
not be an outcast

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.670
in the conservative
suburb where we lived.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:02.440
If she told our mother and
she started making a fuss,

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.940
it would definitely mean that she

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.330
and the boy would break
up and stop dating.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.530
They were both part of
a big group of friends.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.790
And she did not want to
cause problems in that group

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:13.930
over something that was
really, truly no big deal

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.120
but that might become a big deal
if the parents were involved.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.430
It wasn't like she was some
battered or abused woman,

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.460
like she saw on television
talk shows

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.000
or heard about on the local news.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.080
Probably, in a few months,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.720
she wouldn't even remember
that it had happened.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.470
So she said nothing and
the boy never did it again

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.050
and after a while they broke
up for unrelated reasons

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.930
and started dating other
people without much drama

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.000
or distress to either of them.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.620
They finished high school,
went on to different colleges.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.440
They didn't keep in touch.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.370
But during that time, unlike
what she had expected,

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:53.410
the memory of being hit by the boy
didn't just fade away and vanish.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:56.020
It wasn't that she thought
about it all the time

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.320
or that it ruined her life

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.430
or that she could never trust a
man again or anything like that.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:04.580
But from time to time it would
come into her mind, that day,

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.040
the moment of surprised
confusion afterward.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.100
And she came to feel, especially
as she got a little older,

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.580
that she had let herself down
by the way she had reacted.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.640
This was the feeling that
grew incrementally inside her.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.990
She should not have tried
to make him feel better

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.590
by telling him it was no big deal.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.070
She should not have kept
it from their friends just

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.070
so they could all continue
to get along.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.150
From the beginning she had
failed to stand up for herself,

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.950
and now she knew, or
felt like she knew,

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:36.230
about herself that she
would let someone do

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.750
that and do nothing about it.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.520
She would be obliging.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.780
She would comply.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:46.210
This guilt about how she
hadn't stood up for herself was

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.590
like a small stone that
she had to carry around.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.960
That was how she pictured it.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.650
Small and round, but heavy.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.760
And she came to believe, she
said, when she finally told me

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.010
about it all those years later.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.510
That maybe if she told people
about it, as she was doing now,

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.590
it would get smaller and lighter.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.370
That sharing would diminish
it, make it, make it smaller,

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.830
make it maybe even vanish.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.990
And I thought, but
did not say: maybe,

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.240
or maybe it will make it multiply.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.040
Thank you.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:32.050
[ Applause ]

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.460
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell:
That was awesome.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:43.790
I can never figure out if it's
right with the glasses or without.

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.120
Some middle age or something.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.390
Okay, when the Library of
Congress asked me to talk

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:55.310
about Flannery O'Connor I shouted
into the phone, I'm unworthy.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.960
And I fanned myself
with a very short story.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.380
And I'm not an academic, I said,
I'm just a gal who loves stories

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.980
and chickens and the work
of Flannery O'Connor.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.540
And the truth is when I think
about Flannery O'Connor,

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:15.500
I think about a barnyard fowl
and I will stand by my claim

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.010
that each chicken is
a unique individual.

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:22.570
And I'm hoping someday to write a
book about women and their birds.

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:26.680
And the essay, in the essay
called Flannery's Fowl,

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.930
I will describe how she smuggled
ducklings onto the airplane

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.740
for the children of her
friends, the Fitzgeralds.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:40.160
And how as a kid she taught
a chicken to walk backwards.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.780
It was the high point of her
life she said decades later.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:51.180
She was wrong that nobody, wrong
in saying that nobody would want

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.400
to hear about her life
in the future.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.220
A life lived quote between the
house and the chicken yard,

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.240
which I think is the name of the
biography, the recent biography.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.760
She wrote in an unsentimental
essay called The King of the Birds.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.760
About the arrogance and
beauty of her peacocks

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.570
and she wrote a poem, too.

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:14.600
She sent a copy to her friend,
this is my first and last poem.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:20.420
I think poetry is a filthy habit
for a fiction writer to get in to.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:24.260
Let me read a little bit
from The Displaced Person,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.080
which I think is the best depiction
of the peculiar sort of farm life

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.710
that Flannery knew so well.

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:34.200
It was reflected in
a lot of her stories.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.310
So this is from The
Displaced Person.

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.460
The peacock was following Mrs.
Shortley up the road to the hill

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:43.580
where she meant to stand.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:48.340
Moving one behind the other, they
looked like a complete procession.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:51.830
Her arms were folded as
she mounted the prominence.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.910
She might have been the giant
wife of the countryside come

00:25:55.910 --> 00:26:00.360
out at some sign of danger
to see what the trouble was.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.870
She stood on two tremendous legs

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.350
with the grand self-confidence
of a mountain.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.570
And rose up narrowing bulges of
granite to two icy blue points

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:15.570
of light that pierced
forward, surveying everything.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.460
She ignored the white afternoon sun

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:20.780
that was creeping behind
a ragged wall of clouds

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:23.650
as if it pretended
to be an intruder.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.670
And cast her gaze down
the red clay road

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.560
that turned off from the highway.

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.220 position:56%
The peacock stopped just behind her.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.890
His tail glittering
green, gold and blue

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.040
in the sunlight lifted just enough

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.360
so that it would not
touch the ground.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.660
It flowed out on either
side like a floating train.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:47.030
And his head on the long, blue,
reed like neck was drawn back

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:50.390
as if his attention were
fixed in the distance

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.710
on something no one else could see.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.180
Mrs. Shortley was watching
a black car turn

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.450
through the gate from the highway.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:04.240
Over by the toolshed about 15 feet
away two negroes, Astor and Sulk,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.460
had stopped work to watch.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:08.120 position:56%
They were hidden by a mulberry tree,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.220
but Mrs. Shortley knew
they were there.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.620
Mrs. McIntyre was coming down the
steps of her house to meet the car.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.170
She had on her largest
smile but Mrs. Shortley,

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:23.800
even from her distance, could
detect a nervous slide in it.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.380
These people who were
coming were only hired help,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.080
like the Shortleys
themselves or like the negroes.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.710
Yet, here was the owner of
the place out to welcome them.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:37.330
Here she was, wearing her best
clothes and a string of beads

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:41.080
and now bounding forward
with her mouth stretched.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.010
The car stopped at the
walk just as she did

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.410
and the priest was
the first to get out.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:51.440
He was a long-legged black-suited
old man with a white hat on

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.740 position:56%
and a collar that he wore backwards,

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.970
which Mrs. Shortley knew
was what priests did

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:59.940
who wanted to be known as priests.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.890
It was this priest who had arranged
for these people to come here.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.970
He opened the back door of the car

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.490
and out jumped two
children, a boy and a girl.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.580
And then stepping more
slowly a woman

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.640
in brown, shaped like a peanut.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.060
Then the front door opened

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.030
and out stepped the man,
the displaced person.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.790
He was short and a
little sway backed

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.110
and wore gold-rimmed spectacles.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.540
Mrs. Shortley's vision
narrowed on him and then widened

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.870
to include the woman and the
two children in a group picture.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.750
The first thing that struck
her as very peculiar was

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.660
that they looked like other people.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.070
Every time she had seen
them in her imagination,

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:46.480
the image she had got was of
three bears walking single file

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.170
with wooden shoes on like
Dutchmen and sailor hats

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.400
and bright coats with
a lot of buttons.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.610
But the woman had on a dress
she might have worn herself.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.450
And the children were dressed
like anybody from around here.

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.140
The man had on khaki
pants and a blue shirt.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.260
Suddenly as Mrs. McIntyre
held out her hand to him,

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.110
he bowed down from the
waist and kissed it.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.590
Mrs. Shortley jerked her own
hand up toward her mouth.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:17.610
And then after a second,
brought it down

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.710
and rubbed it vigorously
on her seat.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.590
If Mr. Shortley had
tried to kiss her hand,

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:28.010
Mrs. McIntyre would have knocked
him into the middle of next week.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:31.290
But then Mr. Shortley wouldn't
have kissed her hand anyway.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:37.930
He didn't have time to mess around.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:40.960
Everybody in that story,
The Displaced Person,

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.800
can be judged by that last peacock
that roams Mrs. McIntrye's farm.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:51.060 position:56%
The priest, who is probably the most
likeable character Flannery ever

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.080
wrote, is obsessed by its beauty.

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.990
And this is a quote,
this from the book.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:00.780
The priest let his eyes
wander towards the birds.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:02.690
They had reached the
middle of the lawn.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:06.930
The cock stops suddenly and
curving his neck backwards,

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:12.170
he raised his tail and spread it
with a shimmering timerous noise.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:19.230 position:56%
Tears of small pregnant suns floated
in a green gold haze over his head.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:23.790
The priest stood transfixed,
his jaw slack.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:29.730 position:56%
Mrs. McIntyre wondered where she had
ever seen such an idiotic old man.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.250
Christ will come like that,
he said in a loud, gay voice

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:38.740
and wiped his hand over his
mouth and stood there gaping.

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.590
One of Mrs. McIntyre's
black employees

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:46.280
who she calls only the old man,
drives her crazy by talking to

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.970
and reminiscing with the peacock.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.960
Meanwhile she only
tolerates the remaining cock

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.020
because she fears her
dead husband, the judge.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.770
Never in her 39 years
of Flannery's life,

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.240
did she tire of watching her birds.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.470
Never did she tire of watching
other people watch them.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:11.300
This from her essay, Some people
are genuinely affected by the sight

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:14.850
of a peacock, but do
not care to admit it.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:17.840
Others appear to be incensed by it.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.850
Perhaps they have a suspicion

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:26.020
that the bird has formed some
unfavorable opinion of them.

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.520
Flannery shows us that
characters we love

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.630
in fiction may be precisely
the ones we would not want

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:35.130
to spend time with in real life.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.250
She shows us that platitudes
and clichés,

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:42.880
these things we've always taught
to avoid can make great writing.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.840
When Mrs. Hitchcock says,
there's no place like home.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.730
Hazel Mulch replies you might
as well go one place as another.

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.060
And of course, Mrs.
Hopewell it says,

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.060
it takes all kinds
to make the world.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:32:00.120
And Mrs. Hitchcock
says, how time flies.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.640
Nothing is the way it used to
be, says Mr. Shiflet when talking

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.170
to the elder, Lucy Nell Crader.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:09.520
Mrs. Freeman says, Well I
wouldn't have said they was,

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.920
and I wouldn't have
said they wasn't.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.600
I'm just going to read a little
section from Good Country People.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.660
We've just met Hulga,
this sullen, one legged,

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:22.760
educated daughter,
called here The Girl.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:27.420
When Mrs. Hopewell said to Mrs.
Freeman that life was like that,

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:31.000
Mrs. Freeman would say,
I always said so myself.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.430
Nothing had been arrived
at by anyone

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:36.170 position:56%
that had not been arrived at by her.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.870 position:56%
When Mrs. Hopewell said to her after
they had been on the place a while,

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:43.730
You know, you know you're
the wheel behind the wheel.

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:45.030
And winked.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.950
And Mrs. Freeman had
said, I know it.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:48.780
I've always been quick.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.030
It's some that are
quicker than others.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:53.860
Everybody is different,
Mrs. Hopewell said.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.960
Yes, most people is,
Mrs. Freeman said.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.880
It takes all kinds
to make the world.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.630
I always said it did myself.

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:06.390
The girl was used to this
kind of dialogue for breakfast

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.080
and more of it for dinner.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:11.890
Sometimes they had
it for supper, too.

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.900 position:56%
Flannery O'Connor said in her
essay, Some Aspects of the Grotesque

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.310
in Southern Fiction, I
think if there is any value

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.710
in hearing writers talk it will be
in hearing what they can witness

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:25.310
and not what they can
theorize about.

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:31.530
I traveled with Flannery
on my recent book tour.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.290
Or rather with a lifesize
two-dimensional foam board

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.510
of Flannery that I could
carry in my station wagon

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.860
to bookstores and college campuses.

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:43.260
You can see there's, I
have a Facebook page,

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:46.390
called Travels with Flannery.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.690
So, she remained upright

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.520
and modestly dressed in
hotels while I slept.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.050
She remained sober while I drank.

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:59.580
On Sunday she prayed without me.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:04.290
As in life she did not suffer fools
gladly and kept a stern expression.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.880
And always kept her clothes on.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.490
I was planning to cut her into
5 pieces and carry her here

00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:13.400
in my luggage, but I just couldn't.

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.580
In her brief life, Flannery wrote
and published two books of stories

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.400
that portrayed a gritty
strange aspect of southern life,

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.760
starting with A Good
Man is Hard to Find.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.370
And she had two novels,
starting with Wise Blood.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:33.530
Last year, last March, I had
two collections for myself.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:37.120
Mine detailing gritty difficult
lives in small Michigan towns

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.860
and I was also the
author of two novels.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:43.100
I was having trouble
finishing my fifth book.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.320
I was having lots of
trouble and then I realized

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:50.770
that it felt not only
difficult, it felt wrong.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:53.850
That I had the opportunity
to publish a third collection

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.200
of stories and Flannery had not.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.980
And I think that's why I
made the Flannery here.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.420
I felt like she needed
another trip out.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.790
Nearly everything I want to say

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.240
about the writing life
Flannery has said more precisely

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.680
and more cleverly.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.290 position:56%
She addresses the fears writers have

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.390
about being labeled
regional writers.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:18.010
The woods are full of regional
writers and it is the horror

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:22.610
of every serious southern writer
that he will become one, she said.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:28.180 position:56%
But she also said, The best American
fiction has always been regional.

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.900
In her essay, The Writer and
His Country, she says simply,

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:34.850
in the greatest fiction the
writer's moral sense coincides

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:37.360
with his dramatic sense.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.900
And most impressively she
made it clear she intended

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:41.570
to judge no writing contests.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:46.800
I don't know if you guys know that
writers are always asked to judge.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.310
She something very Bartelby-esque.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:54.780
She said, that is not
something I would care to do.

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:58.720
I don't know if you can ever trust
what fiction writers tell you.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:02.060
After all, we just make
things up for a living.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.100
Flannery's always said her
works were pure fabrication,

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.300
but in studying her life, we draw
natural lines between her life

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:10.230
and her single mother and her life

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.600
with her single mother
on a farm full of birds.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:19.640
Her brief dalliance with a textbook
salesman, if not a Bible salesman.

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.090
Her experience with a Polish
refugee working on the farm.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:28.840
It is a lousy thing to do
to a writer, gaping this way

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:32.810
at her real life, but
it is irresistible.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:38.980
I think it is a perhaps
our kind of pornography.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:40.820
Last year the Guardian
chose ten books

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.620
to represent the genre Rural Noir.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.320
Rural Noir, Tom Baldwin
wrote, is a term used

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.300
to describe dark dangerous
stories set in the countryside.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.690
He went on to say, if your book
has an all-terrain vehicle chase

00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:00.740
or a fist fight over a deer
rifle in the middle of a swamp,

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.650
somebody is going to
call it Rural Noir.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:07.760
Maybe some of you have
watched 30 Rock or they have

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.750
that show the Rural Juror.

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:12.900
Yeah, we should probably
say Country Noir.

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:18.850
The Guardian chose Flannery for the
top ten as well as James M. Cain,

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:23.530
Larry Brown, and Daniel Woodrell.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:27.260
I'm thinking through an
essay about the connection

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.340
between the literature of the south
and the literature of the Midwest.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.840
Particularly that of the places
like Michigan where folks

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.520
from the south came
and settled to work

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.480
in the auto plants
in the last century.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.980 position:56%
In the old days we might have
talked about the literary grotesque,

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.710
and I wonder if maybe that's
just what the Rural Noir is,

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.960
is another word for that.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.310
Flannery proposes that the southern
writers were more interesting

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:53.180
because the south lost
the Civil War.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.190
The south had had its fall.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.780
And I kind of wonder if
maybe the upper Midwest,

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.980
the seat of American
manufacturing and trade unions

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:06.840 position:56%
and that fabulous middle class we
used to have, has had its own plunge

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.180
and economic fall from grace.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.470
Something we writers are asked
to do in our hometowns is

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:17.390
to visit book groups at
well-appointed homes.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:21.610
And talk to upper middle class,
middle aged ladies about our books

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:26.730
over wine and artichoke
and spinach dip.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.300
And there's a question I am always
asked in one form or another,

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.950
one that I will paraphrase
for you here.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:36.420
Why do you write about
such awful people?

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.050
When a reader told Flannery
her stories left a bad taste

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:48.500 position:56%
in her mouth, Flannery replied,
well you weren't supposed to eat it.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:55.080
And maybe most famously, she said,
the truth is not changed according

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.210
to our ability to stomach
it emotionally.

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:02.420
About her novel, Wise Blood,
she said, I am not afraid

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:04.710 position:56%
that the book will be controversial,

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.830
I am afraid it will
not be controversial.

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:11.150
The publishers have not always
helped promote a thoughtful reading

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:12.450
of her work.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:16.840
I saw a cover of the Violent
Bear It Away and it had

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.500
as an italics subtitle,
a vivid obsessive novel

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:25.170
of the depravity of the deep south.

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:31.470
Today is Good Friday and
Flannery O'Connor was a devout

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.670
and good Catholic.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:39.740
Communion with the body of Christ
was not a metaphor for her.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.540
Flannery said that after stories
were written and published,

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.720
they didn't belong to the author
anymore, they belonged to God.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:51.370
And maybe that's how she saw it.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:55.540 position:56%
But how I see it is that her stories
belong to all of us, Catholics

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.780
and Hindus and heathens alike.

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:01.970
And I hope that we can all
agree on Good Friday at the end

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:05.110
of the dark season, that
we can thank the Lord

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.020
for Flannery O'Connor.

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.820
I'm going to read from the
title story of my book,

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.040
just a piece of it from the middle.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.870
And this story from the book,
Mothers Tell Your Daughters.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:23.050 position:56%
And this story is told from the
point of a dominating old farm woman

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.120
who has had a stroke
and cannot talk.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.830
She's furious about her
condition and she is thinking hard

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:36.340 position:56%
at her sullen, over educated
daughter, a woman's study professor,

00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.470
hoping that the ungrateful
girl can read her mind.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:44.450
So you might say it was
inspired by Flannery.

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:46.690
This is just a chunk
out of the middle.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:48.440
It's one of these stories
nobody should have ever tried

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.740
to write this story.

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:53.210
Like from the point somebody lying
in bed, I kind of want to stage it

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:54.940
as a play now, just to be perverse.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:41:01.170
Oh and one thing that
poor Flannery does,

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:04.190
maybe somebody ask the question,
I want to write something

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:07.940
about Flannery and sex
and the lack of it.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:12.890
Cause my books are all full of it.

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:14.190
All the marbles.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:16.120
So this is all inside her head.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:20.870
All the men added together
made the solid world.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:25.490 position:56%
They were the marbles in the jar and
women were whatever sand or water

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:29.510
or air claim the space
left between them.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.930
That's how I saw things
as a young woman.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.210
That was my women's studies.

00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:39.780
Now I've come to know that women
are like vodka, poured over men

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.930
who melt away like ice cubes.

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:46.860
It was a man who broke my
nose, bent it like it is now.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:51.430
I let you kids think that big
paint gelding had kicked me again.

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:56.310 position:56%
Patchy Pete was that horse's name,
black and white like a Holstein cow.

00:41:56.310 --> 00:42:02.610
I bought him for $200 and ended up
selling him for $200 after a year

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:05.870
of getting kicked and
bitten and thrown.

00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:09.550
I would have dressed him out for
dog food or fed him to you kids

00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:12.970
if he hadn't been so gorgeous,
but a good looking horse,

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:18.280
like a good looking man, can always
find a place in somebody's stable.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.600 position:56%
Men climbed into my bed after they
fenced my pasture, after they messed

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.630
with the furnace, and
changed the oil

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:31.170
in my Chevy truck and
my Ford tractor.

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:34.940
They climbed into my bed after
their wives threw them out.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.630
We needed their help.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:41.040
There was so much work to do around
here and mostly they were nice.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.810
I'm still alive if barely and a lot

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:48.700
of angry wives are long dead
including Bill Thorue's wife

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.960
who wore herself out
bitching about me

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.640 position:56%
if you want to know the truth of it.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.390
When I was a teenager, my
friend Julia said one day,

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:59.490
we've got to look pretty.

00:42:59.490 --> 00:43:01.920
I shaved my legs for the first time

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.050
and it took a long while
to stop the bleeding.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:09.960
Us and two other friends
got ahold of a six pack,

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.150
though we didn't like
the taste of beer.

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:15.510
We carried the bottles to where
some men lived and reclined

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:18.000
on their couch with
our ankles crossed.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.180
We didn't know how to talk to men.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.080
So we just smiled and
silence hung above the bag

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:26.910
of pretzels they brought out,
until the men started to laugh

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:29.410
until we laughed with them.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:34.060
They were older and muscular and
smelled of smoke and solvents

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.170
from the repair shops
where they worked.

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:39.630
One man had a glass eye.

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.700
He said he'd been shot.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:45.920
When they popped out we were all
possessed by a powerful desire

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.800
to hold the blind thing
in our hands.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.290
Julia touched it first
and passed it around.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:58.760
She got pregnant right away and the
rest of us followed and for a lot

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.360
of years we raised our children,
fed our husbands worked hard

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.750
at low-paying jobs, or at
jobs that didn't pay at all.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:10.070
And learned just how
tired a body could be.

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:14.380
Those men took me by surprise
but I never looked back,

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.830
I never stopped singing love songs,

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.370
I never longed for
a time before men.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:25.430
Men's machines still sing to me,
revving chain saw, motor boat,

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:30.120
log splitter, roto tiller,
leaf blower, generator humming,

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:35.840 position:56%
cordless drill, rattle trap tractor,
power washer, hedge trimmer,

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:40.570
biting grinder, motorcycles
with mufflers torn off,

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:44.230
diesel trucks chugging
in the driveway.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:48.770
You remember those men who came to
me after a fishing trip up north

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:52.040
and filled my wringer
washer with smelt?

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.170
Come out with us and
play, men used to call,

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:58.720
like tomcats, and out I went.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.740
That old wringer washer was never
the same after all them fish.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:06.920
The men who came around never
passed up an easy target

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.560
so they killed all the rabbits.

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:15.250
I meant to sew a blanket from the
soft skins to replace my own skin

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:19.750
which I imagine wadded up
under the bed in my room,

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:25.800
smeared with menstrual blood, stiff
with sperm, stretched by pregnancy.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.520
For years I'd warmed myself
in the borrowed skins of men.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:35.550
I was good at cutting pelts
from flesh, muscle from bone.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:39.890
After partying all night, a passed
out man might resemble a great cut

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:44.260
of meat in my bed or
on the couch or floor,

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.800
leathery brown shoulders
and a fish white behind.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:54.940
Men inhaled great swathes of
oxygen, exhaled smoke and sweat,

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:59.120
so sometimes I could
scarcely catch my breath.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.510
I remember finding you
and your brothers fishing

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:04.060
through a man's wallet
like grubby elves.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.980
Shoo, shoo, I said
and the men slept on.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.850
After your daddy left, I tried
to raise you to know man and not

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:16.930
to fear them, so you
wouldn't be taken by surprise.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:21.000 position:56%
I figured that if any of them
bothered you, you would make a fuss.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.460
The way you made a fuss when I
wanted you to get out of bed early

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:29.020
and haul buckets of water from
the creek when the pipes froze.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.360
Of course, you were
scared of your daddy.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.810
He was a fiercesome man
and he scare me too.

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:38.300 position:56%
But you could have whined and glared
at them other men the way you did

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.720
at your poor, worn out
ma, who tried to feed

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.060
and clothe you with no money.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:46.350 position:56%
How was I supposed to know there was
trouble with the way they pulled you

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:50.040
onto their laps, if you never
told me, you didn't like it.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.250
It seemed to me like
you were having fun

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:54.640
when they said how pretty you were.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:59.510
You never were the kind of kid
who smiled, so I couldn't tell.

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:13.390
It was wonderful.

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:15.870
So we're going to go ahead
and open it up for questions.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:18.310
So those who you have
questions raise your hand

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:20.990

Anyone want to start us off?

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:30.290

Was your story Pushcart [inaudible].

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:44.330
Was your story published
in the Pushcart series?

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:45.630
I've read it somewhere.

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:47.430

can you hear me okay?

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:56.410
[ Multiple voices ]

00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:02.360
Yeah, it was published in Guernica
online and then in my collections.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:05.140
If you've seen it anywhere,
you would have seen it there.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.440
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.110
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell:
Online if you did see it.

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:15.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I did.

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:17.930
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell: I know and
if you guys don't have questions,

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:20.310
we'll just start quoting Flannery.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:21.610
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell: We
can certainly do that.

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:27.040
I mean, you can't really
go wrong with her, so.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.440
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell: Yeah, and
I can tell you, I can tell you

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.330
that on the plane, on
the plane coming here,

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:34.660
this book set off the detectors
and we could not figure out why.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:35.960
But they kept searching my luggage

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.360
and they said books never
set off the detectors,

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.790
but this couldn't make it through.

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.090
So --

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:49.310
&gt;&gt; I love both of your
presentations and your own stories.

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:52.390
They're so Flannery
O'Connorish, I love them.

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.090
A Good Man is Hard
to Find as a cliché

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.150
that gets, that becomes pivotal.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:02.890
I love that you picked
out the element

00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:06.240
of cliché for humor in her work.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.150
I mean, who else does that?

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:11.330
It's just, except maybe, it
sounds like you have the talent

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:13.990
for weaving us together too.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:19.490
But I wonder if you'd both of you
talk about, and we laugh out loud

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.490
at the worst things
with Flannery O'Connor.

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:28.740
Woman a woman with this same path
dies on the bus for example or when

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.600
in a Good Man is Hard to Find,

the misfit says, she'd have been a
good woman if there'd been somebody

00:49:34.810 --> 00:49:37.400
to shoot her every day of her life.

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:42.980
We laugh. It turns us into
sort of horrible people,

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.170
but I wonder if you'd talk
about the role of humor

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:52.050
and her blend of it
a little bit more.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.350 position:56%
Because I think it's so distinctive.

&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell: Do you
have anything right off the bat?

00:50:00.110 --> 00:50:02.460
First we can say we love it.

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:07.200
I mean, Flannery was famously,
I mean famously funny.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.410
You know, and she told
apparently, she, you know,

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.420
I always read those letters

00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:14.090
and thought they were
the definitive letters.

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:15.420
Apparently not.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.470
Apparently many things
were taken out of them.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:22.230
She was very famous for telling
off color jokes, and racial jokes.

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.640
And so she had a sense of humor

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:27.510
that was definitely not
politically correct.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:33.860 position:56%
And it's funny what I learned over
time is that we read her differently

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.560
than she was hoping
we would read her.

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.310
And because of the
Catholicism, you know,

00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:43.650
she doesn't see dying as so bad.

00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:48.520
You know, as maybe we
more earth bound folks do.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.310
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell: I mean, I think,
you know, it's also that you know,

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:57.000
that it's always seemed to me
that one of her great projects is

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.470
to break us away from
sentimentality.

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:02.710
And that the combination
of, you know, I mean,

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:06.130
I think it's interesting, you say
it turns us into horrible people.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:10.120
I mean, in a way that's absolutely
right, but then in another way,

00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:14.070
when we're laughing at something
that's so kind of out there,

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:16.300
and you know, it's
outside of the bounds

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.850
of what we normally want
to acknowledge exists.

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:24.300
We let go of our assumptions for
a minute and I feel like that's

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:27.150
so important to her stories to
kind of get us to this space

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.930
where the things we
thought we thought,

00:51:28.930 --> 00:51:34.090
are no longer available
to us in an easy way.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.340
You know, we sort of see the
characters going through that.

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.850
And then there's as readers,
we go through it with them.

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:43.090
And so those, I think, it's that
combination of getting us to laugh

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:46.290
at things that, oh my God, I can't
believe I'm finding this funny.

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:48.590
And yet we do, right.

00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:52.080
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell: Yeah,
and maybe it was something,

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.500
I mean she did feel that in her
stories she would have liked

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.510
to saved us all and
turned us into Catholics.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:03.040
And I think she felt that we had to
go somewhere very extreme in order

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:08.170
to get to the place where we could
be acted upon by her stories.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.890
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell: Yeah, I
think that's exactly right.

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:17.190 position:56%
And I mean, from time to time I come
across that in other writer's work.

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.490
You know, the [inaudible].

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:21.600
And you know, and there's a young
short story writer called Susan

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.600
Rebecca who also can do that.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:28.990
And it feels to me and in
both of those cases that comes

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:30.290
from Flannery O'Connor, right.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:33.580
So that desire to take the reader
to some place really, you know,

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:36.760
quite strange and very,
very unnerving.

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:47.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you both.

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:48.730
It was so illuminating, the talk.

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:55.100
I was struck by both of you kind of
alluding to the notion of the past.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.460
And in Cynthia Faulkner's quote

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:01.040
that the past is never really
dead and it's not even past.

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:05.290
And I'm wondering if O'Connor's
fiction maybe in your own,

00:53:05.290 --> 00:53:08.370
why she seems to be so interested
in people who are uncomfortable

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:12.830
with their present who
are disrupted by it.

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:19.040
You know living in the
present state that they're at.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.910
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell: That's
a really good question.

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:30.520
And I think, you know, it does seem
to me as though she's interested

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:36.370
in maybe the way we kind of try
to, you know, the discomfort.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:41.920
I mean, I was just thinking
about, you know, I'm just thinking

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:43.900
about this as I'm talking
that the discomfort

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.280
of the present is maybe
related to the way we try

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.580
to get away from the past.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.130
The way, you know, that we
sort of don't really want

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.770
to acknowledge but it's there.

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:51.430
I mean, it's there anyway.

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:56.160
So, you know, say, A Late Encounter
with the Enemy, it's like the idea

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.460
of the Coca Cola machine.

00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:03.410 position:56%
You know, sort of in this, you know,
in this midst of this like very,

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:05.040
kind of, you know, what comes
across as this very somber event.

00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:09.530
And it just seems to
everybody, it seems so wrong

00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:12.360
that it's there, right,
that it clashes.

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.910
So I don't know, does that seem?

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:15.210
I mean --

00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:16.510
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell: Yeah.

00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:18.790
I'm not sure and I do think
that it relates to those,

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:22.140
the use of clichés which is
the response that you make

00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:25.620
when you actually don't want
to take the situation anew.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:29.580
And even in that character
who, that Mrs. Freeman

00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:34.040
who you can't even tell her a thing
that she hasn't already heard of.

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.360
I don't know, she does
it better than I do.

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.310
But I also think it has
something to do with the south.

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:44.970
It has something to do with the,
you know, I'm no one to talk

00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:46.920
about the south, though I did hang

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.930
out with hillbilly
girls in my youth.

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:56.390
Smoked a lot with them, and did
other things with their brothers.

00:54:56.390 --> 00:55:02.070
Did I just say that at
the Library of Congress?

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:05.980
But, in the, I think that Flannery
O'Connor would see that at the kind

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:08.170
of the downfall of the south.

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:11.890
It has something to do with
that, of always looking back.

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:14.430
But yeah, that's a great
observation, you know,

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:16.230 position:56%
you should write a paper about that.

00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:19.050
That's, everything about
Flannery O'Connor makes me want

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:20.350
to write a paper.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:23.590
Though I'm not one to write
papers, so if I could teach a class

00:55:23.590 --> 00:55:26.350
and assign my students to
write all these papers,

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:28.650
that'd be really great.

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.060
&gt;&gt; This isn't a question really,
but I'm hoping you can kind

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:45.090
of since you've probably been
researching Flannery O'Connor,

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:48.350
you could kind of fill
in the gaps here.

00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:51.660 position:56%
I remember a short story she wrote
about a child going to a freak show?

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:55.240
And seeing what she called
hermaphrodite, I guess.

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.540
But that brings to mind,
when you were talking

00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:00.710
about her not being sentimental and
being objective and just observing

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:08.070 position:56%
and seeing how people react to these
strange grotesque kind of scenes.

00:56:08.070 --> 00:56:09.370
I don't even know what
my question is.

00:56:09.370 --> 00:56:10.670
I was just wondering,
do you know that story,

00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:11.970
could you tell me more about it?

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:13.270
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell: You
know, I can't remember.

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:14.570
Which story was that?

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:15.870
It's not The River, is it?

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:17.170
Because I know The
River, I know he drowns,

00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:18.470
I know the kid drowns at the end.

00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:19.770
They all do.

00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:21.070
The minute.

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:22.370
Well it's heartbreaking.

00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:24.220 position:56%
For a while I couldn't read Flannery
O'Connor, because it was like okay,

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:27.240
you see something cute,
you know it's going down.

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:30.250
Sweet kid.

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:33.150
Yeah, well, I mean, that's
absolutely a great place for her

00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:36.910
to be at a freak show where
we, everything has risen to,

00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:40.970
where we're taken to
a very extreme place.

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:45.050
And I know, what a --

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:47.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and it allows the reader
to kind of observe these things.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.510
Otherwise I think they would
probably hide their eyes

00:56:48.510 --> 00:56:53.170
or they'd hide behind
a cliché or something.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.700
You know, and ignore it or try
to take it as best they could.

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.000
I don't know.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.300
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell:
Yeah, we can definitely,

00:56:57.300 --> 00:57:03.040
we could say she is the reigning
queen of the unsentimental.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.390
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell: Yeah, I
mean I think that she also kind

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:11.630
of helps you as a reader to cope
with the truly a horrifying things

00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:13.690
in the world by setting
them so beautifully.

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:17.650
I mean, you know, because, you
know, in preparation for this talk,

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:22.470
you know, I was reading, you know,
sort of back through her stories,

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:24.200
reading A Good Man is
Hard to Find again.

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.190 position:56%
And you know, and one of these
things among the sort of many things

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:29.310
where I was saddened
by how well she does,

00:57:29.310 --> 00:57:33.530
is sort of every aspect
in short fiction.

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:38.130
She sets the, the human
world, right.

00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:40.820
I mean, I think it's funny,
the point about the way

00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:44.010
in which character are
first cliché is so apt.

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:46.240
But the natural world
is not cliché, right.

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:51.490
And so she gives you these kind
of crystal clear, you know,

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:56.770
incredibly compelling descriptions
of the setting, the places,

00:57:56.770 --> 00:58:00.590
you know, the natural
world, the sky.

00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:05.350
You know, the number of brilliant
ways she describes the sun in just

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:08.500
that one collection is so stunning.

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:13.390
And yet somehow that allows you to,
you know, this hideousness is set

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.630
within this world that's
very complicated you know,

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:18.090
sort of that evokes a
variety of feelings.

00:58:18.090 --> 00:58:21.470 position:56%
I think that that's like normally
she couldn't handle it, as a reader,

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:24.250 position:56%
you know, like you would permanently
be in a state you described

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:26.230
like that, sort of
I can't read this.

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:27.530
They're too hard.

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:34.020
You know, but there is a sort
of beauty that surrounds it

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.320
that gives you some access to that.

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.620
Helps you through basically,
I think.

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.210
&gt;&gt; What Emily just said
is exactly what I would.

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:52.100
I just OD'd on Eudora Welty.

00:58:52.100 --> 00:58:55.610
Not just reading but
listening to every single one

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:56.970
of her stories and
collected stories.

00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:58.830
It took weeks.

00:58:58.830 --> 00:59:02.460
But what you just said, is exactly
what I think what one would say

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:03.760
about Eudora Welty.

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:08.230
And I wonder if both of you
would comment this group

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:09.930
of southern gothic writers?

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:11.830
And how you see them.

00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:15.670
Did they inter, I'm not
sure, whether they interacted

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:20.040
with each other or
spoke about each other.

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.340
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell:
They knew about each other.

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:27.400
I mean, she refers to Faulkner, but
I don't think she refers, I mean,

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.700
it's, I'm trying to think.

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:31.980
I reread that essay,
the one I mentioned

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.240
with the southern grotesque and
I think there was another one

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:38.770
where she addressed the
Georgia writers or something.

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:41.280
I'm not sure, you know, I
just, it's funny to think

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.290
that she wasn't really
interested in a lot of society.

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:47.880
I mean, she went to Yaddo once
and did not want to go again.

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.650
And in fact, she caused
some hullabaloo there

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:52.130
that I was trying to read about.

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:53.630
She caused some problem.

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:56.530
I mean I think she turned
somebody in for being a communist.

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:59.220
Something, I don't know, I
shouldn't, see I shouldn't say this

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.480
at the Library of Congress.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.870
Talk to me after, we'll
go to the bar.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:07.080
But there was something, she was
involved in some scandal there.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:11.000
But she, I know that even when
famous writers came to town,

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.380
she didn't necessarily
want to see them.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:18.840
She wanted to read their works and
she didn't want to visit with them.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:24.600
So, I think she felt, you
know, that we are each other,

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.060 position:56%
each other's colleagues on the page.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:29.670
I think she felt collegial,

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:32.600
I mean you like to think why
do we have all these sort

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.650
of British depictions of all kinds

01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:36.400
of famous people at
dinners together?

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:39.030
We should have at least
a depiction of some kind.

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:42.560
Somebody should do a sitcom
that's all the southern writers,

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.860
you know the southern writers.

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.040
It could be called the Rural Juror.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.080
And it would be all the
southern writers getting together

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:52.450
and we could figure out what
they'd say to one another.

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:54.850
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell: Yeah, I mean,
whether that really ever happened

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:57.940
or not, it should be depicted.

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:07.040 position:56%
But, you know, it's good to know, I
think when I was also rereading some

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.810
of her nonfiction, you know,

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:11.820
when you're writing short
stories the writer she brings

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:17.290
up is the most prominently
in that essay is Kafka.

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:20.700
You know, that was for me, I'm
always, you know, as a writer,

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:25.740
and therefore as a reader
looking for the ways

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:30.560
in which more realistic fiction
works its way into the work

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:36.050
of writers you think of as being
so devastatingly realistic.

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:39.070
You know, that, you know, but
that completely makes sense to me

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:42.440
that O'Connor would be thinking
about Kafka as you know,

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.580
as a you know as an influence
and an example of how

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:51.000
to write realistically about the
day when you wake up and it turns

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.040
out that you're a cockroach.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:57.950
You know, so, so to, I mean I
don't, I think I don't know much

01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:00.830
about her relationships with other
writers but that was very striking

01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:05.040
to me that that was
who she thought about.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.340
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell: I
just, because I happened

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.540
to remember this quote,
although she did say

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:13.730
that for Kafka she felt one only
needs read a little of Kafka.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:18.660
But she, and she admired Kafka, but
she also said he was like a ladder

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.790
with the bottom rungs missing.

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:25.060
And you know, she really
admired Conrad most of all.

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:27.930
That really surprised me,
that it was, but maybe it is,

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:30.640
he is kind of Old Testamenty,
you know.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.610
I mean, is she like
the Old Testament?

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:35.530
That's what I keep coming back to.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:38.390 position:56%
But that's, you know, and
sometimes people, you know, they're,

01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:39.730
their where there's reviewers.

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:41.030
Even recently.

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.800
I found brand new reviews

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.670
of Flannery O'Connor stories
in Catholic magazines.

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:51.510 position:56%
And, you know, one said great, the
season, you know, read in the season

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:55.140
of Lent, to show the
darkness of the human soul.

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:57.800
And then read, then there was
one that said don't read it.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:03.810
You know, it's just awful and, you
know, why must she show violence.

01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:08.590
And that made me wonder if he
had read the Old Testament.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:13.880
But she, you know, she talks a
little about the writers she loves,

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.270
but not as much as you would think.

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:18.570
I mean, did you find that?

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:22.250
And maybe it doesn't appear
as much in her letters.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:26.180
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell: Yeah, you know,
I mean, you know, certainly, yeah,

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:30.630
I mean, it's just it's not an
aspect of her work or her writing

01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.550
that I'm particularly
familiar with, I'm afraid.

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:39.160
You know, but she does seem
as though you know, that she.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:43.880
Before the presentation,
you know, I was talking,

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:48.020
to Anya about one thing I had
wanted to work into my talk

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.370
and wasn't quite able

01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:52.490
to was O'Connor's rejection
of her rejection.

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:56.280
You know, where she had submitted
Wise Blood to a publisher

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.640
who I think was Knopf and then
he come back and said well,

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.080
we might be interested
if you're willing

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:04.050
to make the following
extensive revisions.

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:06.700 position:56%
And she wrote back and would say no.

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:12.630 position:56%
You know, this is an odd book and if
you want to publish a strange book,

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.370
then you're welcome to
do so, but I'm not going

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:19.180
to make all these changes
that you are suggesting.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.430
Because this is the
book that I wrote,

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:25.510
this is how I want
it to be presented.

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:29.200 position:56%
And at that that, that sort of
independence of mind is so striking.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.280
You know that she was kind
of committed to her own work

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:36.480
and her own vision that, you
know, that she was willing

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.310
to just, no, this is the book.

01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:42.390
So you know, so obviously
all writers have influence,

01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:47.770
but she really seemed like she
knew what she wanted, you know.

01:04:47.770 --> 01:04:49.530
And whatever other
writers were doing

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:51.580
and whatever manuscripts
were saying to her,

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.880
was less important than that.

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.950
&gt;&gt; Anya Creightney: So I think
we'll close with this question.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:04.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you were talking about the
Old Testament, about Wise Blood,

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.180
and things, the way that
she perceived the experience

01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.860
of being raised in the south
and of being of the south.

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:11.570
And something really came to me

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:14.880
that I thought you guys
might both discuss a little.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:20.180
Which is as a Catholic, but in
Wise Blood, the description is one

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:24.250
of evangelical religion,
at least largely.

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:27.750
And just in terms of this
very personal experience,

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:33.000
this very you know, redemption
was you know, brought up again,

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.480
and again, in a way that would
be recognizable to anybody

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.560
who spent time in that
part of our culture.

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:45.200
And, yet obviously the Catholic
influence was enormous to her

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.370
and I wonder if either
of you have thoughts

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:52.620
on how she describes this
evangelical tradition as opposed

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:56.000
to the tradition of Catholicism?

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.000
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Jo Campbell: Well,
I can say that Flannery said

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.270
that she was not a true southern
writer because she was a Catholic.

01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:05.810
She said that's the
thing that stops her

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:07.880
from truly being a southern writer.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.800
And she didn't think
much of the evangelicals.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.210
I mean, she had a quote,
you know, people,

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:19.830
she used another writer's work, and
said, well there was some writer

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:21.600
who wrote a book called
the Rotting Hill

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.230
or maybe she made that
up, I'm not sure.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.920
The Rotting Hill, and she
said, you know, people assume,

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.590
people seem to assume
that one writes about rot,

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:33.590
because one likes rot, when in
fact I might write about rot

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:35.380
because I disapprove of rot.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.360
It was a very harsh
thing she had to say,

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:42.630
but I think that she wished these
evangelicals would be pushed

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:46.040
to the limit that would make
them turn into Catholics.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.700
And it's funny, I don't mean to
keep hitting the Catholic thing,

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:52.340
but the more you read and the
more you read about what she said,

01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:57.880
is the work feels very, very
different the more you read it.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:02.060
Feels more of a certain kind of
Catholicism that I don't know

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:06.040
if even, that the Catholics
as a group even accepted.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:10.770
But yeah, she really does want
people to be redeemed and saved

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:14.050
in this profound way,
but she as I recall,

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:15.980
there are very few
Catholic characters.

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.390
The priest in The Displaced
Person is one

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:21.550
of the very few Catholics
that appear in there.

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:25.810
But I know that she that she
is looking for that redemption,

01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:29.060
and maybe she's willing to see it
in other places, but I'm not sure.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:34.490
&gt;&gt; Emily Mitchell: Yeah, I mean,
well it seems to me you know,

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:37.900
she is so critical in
the religion you know,

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:40.940
in evangelical religion
as she depicts it.

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:44.830
Is the idea of making a
declaration of being renewed?

01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:48.010
You know, that the idea
that you say, you know,

01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:50.040 position:56%
you'll say it and then you're saved.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.250
And that, that, you
know, the kind, I mean,

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:56.010
the stories in a way you know, as
they're depicted, you know, people,

01:07:56.010 --> 01:08:01.880
I mean, I think in Wise Blood, it's
full of people saying you know,

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.760
various things about
a transformation

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.280
that has occurred in them.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:09.800
And then actually what the
stories show, you know, Wise Blood

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:13.620 position:56%
and also again in her short stories,

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:18.470
is the way in which the characters
need to be like to be brought

01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:24.370
to a moment of experiencing
their powerlessness in order

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:26.880
to actually be transformed.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:30.860
You know, and that, to me,
that feels very relevant,

01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:35.060
not to just evangelicalism
but to you know,

01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:38.040
contemporary culture much
more broadly that we really,

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.770
we have this great desire to
say that we've been transformed

01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:44.510
through you know, subconsciously,
deliberately,

01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:45.810
you know, by deciding it.

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:49.850
And she really doesn't buy that
at all, I think that's a lot

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:52.790
of you know, a lot of what the
stories have shown is the way

01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:54.090
in which that doesn't work.

01:08:54.090 --> 01:08:58.020
Right? In which the
epiphany is wrong.

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:02.350
You know, and just, you
know, it's just not true.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.340
