1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,770
The Joe Rogan experience. Okay. So
time out real quick. Okay. Real quick.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,970
Quick story of time with rich.
So I landed right and you know,

3
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:13,880
if you know Boston and the deal in Boston.
Yeah. Uh, so I landed and you know, I uh,

4
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:17,100
a buddy of mine picked me up from the
airport and I got to where I was staying.

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,770
I was saying in the mission district,
glued all the sun. First of all,

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,280
it was fucking great. The Sun was
awesome, right? I was like, oh my gosh,

7
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:24,630
some gray skies.

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,600
And then I looked down literally
homeless people everywhere.

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,500
And what is going on with that?
Like it just,

10
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:34,980
it blew my mind because it literally,

11
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,590
so I went to the gym in
the morning and I was like,

12
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,610
there's like a 7:00 AM and I saw probably
just as many homeless people living in

13
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:47,090
tents next to buildings as there
were people commuting to work. Yeah.

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,830
Like thousand it. Oh yeah.
It's, it's amazing. Have you
been a skid row yet? No. God,

15
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,130
I'm scared.
You got to go.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,140
You should go while you're here
because it's like the Grand Canyon,

17
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,150
like the Grand Canyon of homeless people.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,770
I want to go there because just you can't
believe the, it's like, did you watch a,

19
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,730
the battle of Winterfell game of
Thrones? No, don't tell. No spoiler. No.

20
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:09,060
Won't give any spoilers. I'll have to
have come with a better. Okay. Yeah.

21
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,170
Here's a better analogy. Did you
ever see a I am legend? Yes. Okay.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,520
Remember when all the fucking crazy
Zombie before running at once. Yeah.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,900
That's what it's like. Are
you serious? I'm telling you,

24
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:22,150
you can't believe the volume doesn't
someone even like in Boston, listen,

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,540
they freeze to death and
die. Yeah, exactly. So No.

26
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,250
In Boston we, we hide our homeless
people. We have like shelters and stuff.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,300
We hide them. Yeah. For the most part, you
know, downtown crossing area, parks sheet,

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,430
whatever. They'd like to junkies that
like have that be the whole gangster lean.

29
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,800
They just lean in, close their eyes and
stuff right there. Most part. Right.

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,590
And then we, you know, it gets cold,
they scatter. I don't know where they go,

31
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,810
but you don't really see them that
much, you know, I'm not being rude,

32
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:48,350
like I don't mind her seeing
just straight, but like insane.

33
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,980
But they're in your face,
man.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,040
If San Francisco is the craziest,
it's, it was insane. So like, honestly,

35
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,610
and I know one of my friends, he said,
listen, you know, um, come to my house,

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,190
you know, whatever, we're gonna hang
out for a bit at school. No problem.

37
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,500
Went to his house like,
Hey, you know, small place,

38
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:08,340
not batting a thousand square
feet. I'm like, pretty nice.
He goes, yeah, you know,

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,920
I'm kind of, you know, things were
a little tough. Can I, you know,

40
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:13,140
can I borrow some, uh, some money?
He's like, borrow money from me.

41
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,290
What are you talking about dude? This is,
you live in, you know, you're doing okay.

42
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,750
He's like, yeah, we're living
paycheck to paycheck. I was like,

43
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:21,870
what are we talking about? I'm like,
this is a, this is like a, you know,

44
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,830
you got a decent place.

45
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,160
The house we were in was a one point
$6 million house and it was this big,

46
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,810
and I'm like San Francisco,
so let's do things expensive man.

47
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,710
And then another friend of mine said,
listen, Hey, come to my house. You know,

48
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,900
and I pull up to the house.
It's a warehouse.

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,080
Like you live in a warehouse
that's actually cool. You
can live like blade. It's,

50
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,230
it's clearly snipes lives with Kris
Kristofferson. It's, yeah, you're right.

51
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:53,190
You're right. Have the motorcycle. He
had the fucking charger, dodge charger.

52
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,380
But it sounds cool when you have kids
living in a warehouse and isn't that great

53
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,350
know? So, so that's
the thing is that like,

54
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,560
it's a common thing I've noticed for
people to live in either abandoned

55
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:05,820
buildings, warehouses and cars. Yeah.

56
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,070
You don't have people that live in cars
and the amount of smashed windows that

57
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,430
I've seen here, it's, I
couldn't believe it. Well,

58
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,980
most of those people living in cars
are actually stand up comedians.

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,850
Everybody has a fucking story.
Like so many comics come
here and before, you know,

60
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:25,120
when they first settled in,
they live in the car. That's
super normal. Yeah, that's,

61
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,750
that's just crazy. Like modest. 10 of
my friends really lived in their car.

62
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:29,803
Do they live in cards?

63
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,720
They're used to at least and then
got an apartment bigger time.

64
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
Well that's an issue
we're having around here.

65
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,960
We're having around here with
these people that live in caravans.

66
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:40,540
They live in these mobile home
types. I've seen them. Yes.

67
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,190
There's like if you drive
around this community, yeah.

68
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,680
Go down certain streets and you just
see these mobile caravans. Yeah.

69
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:51,970
And they have like, like towels over the
windows. And I saw the math and science.

70
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:56,140
Yeah. Yeah. These are dirty people. Some
of these fuckers I don't. So how come?

71
00:03:56,141 --> 00:04:00,740
So again, in Boston we just kind of say,
hey, there's no likely of loitering. Well,

72
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,180
they're kicking people out now because
businesses are complaining because there

73
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:08,140
was one business where this guy had
parked his caravan right in front of it.

74
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,820
That's where a buddy of mine works.

75
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,000
And this dude had laid out his,
uh,

76
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,370
like a blanket on their front lawn
and was sunning himself in front of US

77
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,850
Caravan. So the front of his
building became this guy's lawn.

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,460
So this guy in this caravan was
literally using, they were sharing grass.

79
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,730
So he's got this multimillion dollar
building and he's sharing it with a

80
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:33,940
homeless guy who's cooking meth
or I don't know if it's math,

81
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:38,470
but some white noxious smoke the place.

82
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,360
Yeah, it's, I couldn't so it, it's, it was
different for me. The weather is awesome,

83
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,030
but like that was a big thing. And I
feel like as I'm walking around more,

84
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:48,190
if I see a large standing body of water,

85
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,940
I'm like there's a homeless guy living
there too, that people just everywhere,

86
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,740
everywhere.
I'm telling you what you saw is nothing.

87
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,670
When you got to go to skid row, it's
what does, this is a skid row, skid row,

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,460
Google maps, skid row. I
just started snooping around.

89
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:03,890
They must've cleaned it up right before
the drugs. Really. Cause usually, yeah.

90
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,020
Yeah. That ain't shit. Let me tell
you something man. It's, look at that.

91
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,960
Look at all that to the right and
to the left. It's fucking gross.

92
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,050
So how do people have businesses there?
They don't or they just deal with it.

93
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,280
They just deal with it.
Most of them,

94
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,530
most of those people that just put
all like gates and locks and shit,

95
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,020
what's on skid row. But that's why
it's can you where you just were Jamie?

96
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:27,160
We just were, um, well it's a
lot of warehouses and shit and,

97
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:30,610
but the interesting thing is this
area is getting air quotes gentrified.

98
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,450
So this is where a lot of
businesses are going now.

99
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:38,800
They're opening up apartment buildings
and a buddy of mine has lived there.

100
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,040
My friend Magnus Magnus Walker,
he's a famous car guy too.

101
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,770
I don't know if you know who he is. He's
got all these videos of Porsche's all.

102
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:46,090
He rebuilt old Porsches.

103
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,840
He's got this crazy dreadlocks
and beard and crazy Englishman,

104
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,760
but he's been living down there forever.
He,

105
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:55,600
and he has this warehouse where
he has it set up where, you know,

106
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,330
his living space is one, one part of
the warehouse. Then down below, yes,

107
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,670
these cars. Right. And
he has it all set up.

108
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:06,200
But if you drive down some of these roads,

109
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,830
you'll see like these super expensive
apartment buildings that are going up now

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,960
and then a block over.

111
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,740
You see these homeless encampments and
people think it's like cute to be around

112
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,520
like all this dirt. What does this, there
we go. Nice. Look here, look at that.

113
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:21,920
So that's someone's apartment.
What's going on here? Yeah,

114
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,820
they just set up tents and then the cops
kicked them out and they just come back

115
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:27,530
and they move and then they come back.
But they,

116
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,090
they make these encampments and you just,
you just have to deal with it.

117
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,730
So it's like if you live in that area,
you know,

118
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:37,450
you just have to jump over needles
and try to figure your way through it.

119
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,560
I feel so I feel terrible because,
no, I, it's, it's most of this,

120
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,930
most of this is either drug addiction
or mental illness. Those are the real,

121
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,110
real problems. Do you guys have no
drug addiction or mental illness,

122
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,410
like places that you could go to for
help here? I don't know what it is, man.

123
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:55,910
I don't know enough about it. Um,
um, um, entirely ignorant about how,

124
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:56,681
what's going on.

125
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:59,630
I know that if you talk to people that
work in the field that work with these

126
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:03,230
folks, they say that it all really started
to happen. Look at this guy, he's like,

127
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:07,190
run over my leg. Oh my gosh, I need
disability. Oh my goodness, man,

128
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,240
that's crazy. Crazy. Honestly,

129
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:14,210
if you were to take a screenshot of what
you just showed me, I'd be like, okay,

130
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,560
that's some third world country,
right?

131
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,750
This is la people can't even
afford to live in La. I know.

132
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:20,660
I might as well be a third
world country though.

133
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,990
I mean it might as well be the apocalypse.
It's the apocalypse for those folks.

134
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,900
I mean at least there they're
around all these cars and shit,

135
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:31,280
but I mean there are thousands of homeless
people in that whole skid row area

136
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,530
right next to the mission
there. Yes. That's one of the,

137
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,330
is one of the things
that keeps them there.

138
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:38,120
I guess we'll have like a mission beds,
three beds in the whole thing.

139
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,770
I don't know. That's wild that they, uh,
they uh, allow most of this to go on.

140
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:45,560
I don't know. Like how often they
break it up and make people move.

141
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,460
But this did not, the numbers are so
high. There's not much they can do, man.

142
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,280
That's cray. It's sad. Sad. It's
Super Sad. Like, but what do you do?

143
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:54,920
How do you fix that? Like,
I don't have any solution.

144
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,070
You can't tell people they shouldn't.
What are you doing?

145
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,180
What does that actually documented?
You have a problem. Yeah. Yeah.

146
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:05,310
Product went and spent three days down
there like undercover and filming him

147
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,381
experiencing,

148
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:08,750
and then he'd come back and do like an
interview or like what are you just went

149
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:12,830
through? And it's, it came out 10
years ago. So it's, it's different.

150
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,820
I don't know if I'm, I'm assuming it's
worse now, but it's definitely not good.

151
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:21,380
And this and this. So it's crazy.
So, uh, I was on my one wheel, right?

152
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,130
Just right riding by. I was commuting
back and by the way, the thing is bad ass.

153
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,820
It's pretty crazy, right? Yeah. I've wrote
it. I wrote yours today. He did ride mine.

154
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:31,940
It was good. And after watching you
scoot around effortlessly, I was like,

155
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:34,400
how hard could it be? Do you
need one? You should get one.

156
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,020
I also don't need broken elbows
like, honestly, it's good
for, it's good. It's good.

157
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:41,990
It's a good core workout. I'm sure
it's a great word. You sit ups.

158
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,960
I think it's a better core
workout. Yeah. Sit Up, Michelle,

159
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:49,010
show you this hip and glute machine from
rogue where you put your ankles in this

160
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,590
thing and you lean all the way back and
go all the way up till you have some

161
00:08:51,591 --> 00:08:55,550
next level shit here. By the way. I got
some cool stuff, man. That's awesome, man.

162
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,610
Warehouse. It's really, it's this place is
fucked. Can I live here? Sure. All right,

163
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,700
cool. Plenty of room. Bring it 10.

164
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,660
Can't battle the Jujitsu bad. Um, but,
but yeah, so I was writing my one wheel,

165
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,170
uh, pass this, uh, past like
this is kind of overpass. And uh,

166
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,750
there was a tent there and like a,

167
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:17,100
a lady sticks her hand out and
she offers me a chocolate. Uh,

168
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,550
what was it? I think it was
a chocolate lady bug, right?

169
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,460
It was a lady bug wrapped in like that,
that, that, that 10 mixed chocolate,

170
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,530
whatever. I'm like, oh. I'm like,
no thank you. No thank you. Right.

171
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,050
By getting next day offers to me again.
I was like, no thank you. No thank you.

172
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,670
I was like, you know what, I'm going
to, I'm going to like, you know,

173
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,270
do something nice. Right. So I get
five bucks and I was like, I'll go,

174
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,640
I'll give it to her. You know, it's
a nice gesture. I write up, you know,

175
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,080
I give her a hand, are the five bucks.
As I start slowing down on the one wheel,

176
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,180
other people should are popping their
heads out of the tents and they actually

177
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:53,181
saw me give her the money and immediately
a guy runs out and like snatches it

178
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,770
directly out of her hand,
snatched it right at hand.

179
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,300
Someone else comes around the corner,

180
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,390
takes it from him and they start getting
into the scuffle and I'm just like it.

181
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,860
I've never seen anything like that before.
I know I'm really passionate about it.

182
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,940
I just, it's just, I just can't
stop thinking about it. It's crazy.

183
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,270
It's really crazy out here, man. Dude,
that's crazy. And everyone comes,

184
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,880
everyone comes to to,
to La,

185
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:21,020
California to get there at
their big break. Like all in,

186
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,240
I'm going to be like a famous, whatever,
famous, you know, actor, singer,

187
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,010
exotic dancer, a porn star, whatever.
And it's, the struggle is real out here.

188
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,330
It's real. It's real everywhere. But when,
whenever you get giant groups of people,

189
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,680
you're going to get,
you know,

190
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,160
a higher percentage of people that are
out here that are homeless or struggling.

191
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,020
Right. Um, again, I don't know what the
fuck, what's the solution? Yeah, no,

192
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,883
yeah.

193
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,400
[inaudible].
