00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:02.856
- [Instructor] Let's say
that you have decided to go

00:00:02.856 --> 00:00:06.403
canoeing, and right over
here, this is a top view of

00:00:06.403 --> 00:00:08.525
our river right here.

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:09.418
This is our river.

00:00:09.418 --> 00:00:12.020
And, let's say that the
current, the river, is going

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.030
towards the right.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.113
So, there is two different directions

00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:19.835
that you could be canoeing in.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:23.198
You could imagine someone
who is canoeing in the same

00:00:23.198 --> 00:00:27.331
direction as the current, so
they are canoeing that way.

00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:29.514
And then, you could imagine
another person who's canoeing

00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:30.959
the other way.

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.314
So, someone who's canoeing upstream.

00:00:33.314 --> 00:00:34.799
This person is canoeing downstream,

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.416
this person is canoeing upstream.

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:38.618
So they are going in that direction.

00:00:38.618 --> 00:00:41.219
So, pause this video and
think about which person

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.892
is going to have to expend more energy.

00:00:43.892 --> 00:00:46.278
Or, which person is going
to have to be more active,

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:49.338
and which person is
going to be more passive.

00:00:49.338 --> 00:00:51.999
Well, yes, this wasn't an
incredibly hard question.

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.803
If you are going with the flow of current,

00:00:54.803 --> 00:00:57.587
as the person in yellow is
here, they don't even have to

00:00:57.587 --> 00:00:58.683
take their paddles out.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:01.691
They can just take a nap,
and the boat will naturally

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:03.223
go with the current.

00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:07.632
They would be, they could
be just moving passively.

00:01:07.632 --> 00:01:10.244
While the person in blue, here,
they're gonna have to work

00:01:10.244 --> 00:01:11.858
really, really, really hard.

00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:14.021
They're gonna have to paddle
some, just to not even move

00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:16.380
to the right, and then
even paddle even more,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.676
to actually go against the current.

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:22.179
So, this person would
have to be very active.

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.461
And so, this is really just
a metaphor for what we're

00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:26.832
going to talk about now.

00:01:26.832 --> 00:01:29.209
And, that's the idea in Biology of

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.065
Active versus Passive Transport.

00:01:32.065 --> 00:01:35.253
So, let's start with, maybe,
the more pleasant one.

00:01:35.253 --> 00:01:36.576
In either situation.

00:01:36.576 --> 00:01:39.159
And that is, Passive Transport.

00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:43.829
So, Passive Transport is when something

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.663
goes with the gradient.

00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:47.033
So what do I mean by that?

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.896
So, you could have a
concentration gradient.

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:54.792
So, let's say that on, let's
say I have a tube of some kind.

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.000
And let's say it's filled with water.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.416
And dissolved in that water,
at this end of the tube,

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:03.166
I have a high concentration
of some molecule,

00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:05.744
or something right over here.

00:02:05.744 --> 00:02:08.265
While on the right-hand side
I have a low concentration.

00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:10.836
So what are we think is going to happen?

00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:13.466
Well, these things are just
going to naturally move around,

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.972
and over time, they're gonna
bounce their way, so that after

00:02:16.972 --> 00:02:19.593
a little bit of time has passed,
a lot of these things are

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:23.737
just going to passively move to the right.

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:26.487
And so at some point, you might
have an equal concentration,

00:02:26.487 --> 00:02:30.097
or roughly equal, throughout
this entire container.

00:02:30.097 --> 00:02:33.713
And so, this movement along
your concentration gradient...

00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:35.685
Here you're moving from
high-concentration,

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:40.033
to low-concentration, this
would be passive transport.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:43.516
This is a concentration gradient,
that we are moving along.

00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:45.017
Let me write that down.

00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:47.327
This is our concentration gradient.

00:02:47.327 --> 00:02:49.968
But, you can also have
an electrical gradient.

00:02:49.968 --> 00:02:53.551
So, let's take a similar
type of container.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:57.809
Maybe it's filled with water,
and on the left-hand side,

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:59.923
imagine if you have a bunch of

00:02:59.923 --> 00:03:02.594
positive particles, or molecules.

00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:04.524
And on the right, you have a bunch of

00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:07.725
negative particles, or molecules.

00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:09.806
Well, the positive ones repel each other,

00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:11.118
so do the negative ones.

00:03:11.118 --> 00:03:13.403
But the positives attract the negative,

00:03:13.403 --> 00:03:15.292
and the negative attract the positive.

00:03:15.292 --> 00:03:18.197
And so, you would think that
things would naturally move

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.965
down their electrical gradient.

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:21.887
The positives want to
go away from each other,

00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:24.406
and they're drawn to the negative.

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:26.690
Similarly, the negatives wanna
get away from each other,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.925
and they are drawn to the positive.

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:31.362
So, whether you're talking
about a concentration gradient,

00:03:31.362 --> 00:03:32.634
or an electrical gradient...

00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:34.260
And sometimes you have
a combination of both.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.865
An electro-chemical gradient.

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:38.059
When you're moving along
with your gradient,

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.734
you don't have to use any energy.

00:03:39.734 --> 00:03:42.233
That's known as Passive Transport.

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:43.983
So, no energy needed.

00:03:48.714 --> 00:03:51.448
It's just going to happen naturally.

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:55.622
Now, the opposite is the
notion of Active Transport.

00:03:55.622 --> 00:03:58.803
Active Transport, and this is when you

00:03:58.803 --> 00:04:00.896
go against the gradient.

00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:03.729
So an Active Transport would
be, somehow let's say you're in

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.618
this situation right over here,

00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:08.402
somehow getting one of these particles...

00:04:08.402 --> 00:04:10.364
Let me do it in the same color,
somehow getting one of these

00:04:10.364 --> 00:04:13.522
particles, instead moving
to go in that direction.

00:04:13.522 --> 00:04:15.281
It will actually go against it's gradient,

00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:16.520
in that direction.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.394
Or, another situation is,
imagine if you have a positive

00:04:19.394 --> 00:04:23.266
particle right over here,
instead of it naturally just

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:25.588
going in that direction,
somehow you make it go against

00:04:25.588 --> 00:04:27.776
it's gradient, and you make it go closer

00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:29.828
to the other positive particles.

00:04:29.828 --> 00:04:33.495
Well, this is going to
require energy to do.

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:37.761
And probably the most sited
example, or the most common

00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:40.199
example that we're going
to see, in Biology class,

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.027
of Active Transport,

00:04:42.027 --> 00:04:44.486
is what's known as a
sodium-potassium pump.

00:04:44.486 --> 00:04:47.198
Which we will study in
detail in other videos.

00:04:47.198 --> 00:04:49.403
But, let's say that this
thing that I'm drawing,

00:04:49.403 --> 00:04:52.653
here in white, this is a cell membrane.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:56.403
And, I'm drawing these gaps for a reason.

00:04:56.403 --> 00:05:00.570
And, what you have on the
outside of the cell membrane,

00:05:01.442 --> 00:05:05.609
you have some potassium
ions, on the outside, but,

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:09.346
you have a lot more on the inside.

00:05:09.346 --> 00:05:13.436
So, these are all potassium
ions on the inside of your cell.

00:05:13.436 --> 00:05:17.603
And then, so let me just
write K+, K+, K+, K+, K+,

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.243
and you'll have some
sodium ions on the inside

00:05:23.243 --> 00:05:24.949
of your cell;

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.116
Na+, but you have a lot more
on the outside of your cell.

00:05:30.058 --> 00:05:31.735
And, in general, the outside
of your cell is going to have

00:05:31.735 --> 00:05:35.128
many more positive ions than the inside.

00:05:35.128 --> 00:05:38.887
Maybe you already see where this is going.

00:05:38.887 --> 00:05:43.054
Na+, Na+, Na+, I think we've
got the idea, Na+, Na+.

00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:49.522
Now, if on this membrane,
alright, let's ignore this part

00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:52.346
right over here, if I just had
a channel, right over here,

00:05:52.346 --> 00:05:55.677
that was open only to potassium.

00:05:55.677 --> 00:05:58.502
So, only potassium can go through.

00:05:58.502 --> 00:06:01.669
So, only potassium can go through this

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:04.293
channel right over here.

00:06:04.293 --> 00:06:06.356
What do you think is going to happen?

00:06:06.356 --> 00:06:08.630
Well, you would have Passive Transport.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.688
These positively charged
potassiums right over here,

00:06:11.688 --> 00:06:14.542
they would go down their
concentration gradient.

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:17.653
There's more likely to have
a potassium ion just bump

00:06:17.653 --> 00:06:20.201
in the right way, just right
over here, so that it goes

00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:21.034
through the channel.

00:06:21.034 --> 00:06:23.084
Because, there's just more
potassiums right on the

00:06:23.084 --> 00:06:25.971
inside of the cell, than
there would be on the outside.

00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:27.759
And so, this, this potassium

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.649
is going down their
concentration gradient,

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:31.895
from high-concentration,
to low-concentration

00:06:31.895 --> 00:06:33.101
through this channel.

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.785
This would be Passive Transport.

00:06:35.785 --> 00:06:37.285
Passive Transport.

00:06:39.422 --> 00:06:42.550
But, you could imagine
there's also Active Transport,

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.198
and that Active Transport is
what pumps the sodium ions

00:06:46.198 --> 00:06:49.754
inside the cell outside of
the cell, even thought it's

00:06:49.754 --> 00:06:52.415
not only against it's
concentration gradient,

00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:54.599
it's also against it's
electrical gradient.

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:56.845
The outside's more positive,
so you wouldn't think a

00:06:56.845 --> 00:06:59.412
positive ion would naturally go outside.

00:06:59.412 --> 00:07:02.401
And the outside has more
sodiums that it does inside.

00:07:02.401 --> 00:07:04.382
But, the sodium-potassium pump

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:07.065
still pumps those sodiums outside.

00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:09.846
And, as I hinted at, it
does this using energy.

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.580
So, you'll sometimes see a
sodium-potassium pump drawn

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.594
like this and, once again
I'm not gonna go into depth

00:07:16.594 --> 00:07:20.251
on it, we have a whole video on it.

00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:22.657
But, the general idea
is, is that the sodiums

00:07:22.657 --> 00:07:23.907
bind over here.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.687
And then some ATP, which
is the powerhouse of cells;

00:07:27.687 --> 00:07:30.450
which we will study in more
depth later on in Biology,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.245
it leverages it's energy to
change the shape of the proteins

00:07:35.245 --> 00:07:37.692
that make up this sodium potassium pump,

00:07:37.692 --> 00:07:41.957
to then pump these sodiums
outside of the cell.

00:07:41.957 --> 00:07:43.726
So, it's gonna go from
this shape, and then

00:07:43.726 --> 00:07:46.002
it's just going to, you
could view it as opening

00:07:46.002 --> 00:07:49.883
it up that way, the real
enzymes look quite different,

00:07:49.883 --> 00:07:51.569
but that's the general idea.

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:55.736
You use energy, in the form
of ATP to pump the sodiums out

00:07:57.258 --> 00:08:00.294
against both their concentration gradient,

00:08:00.294 --> 00:08:02.268
and their electrical gradient.

00:08:02.268 --> 00:08:05.502
And that's why it's
called Active Transport.
