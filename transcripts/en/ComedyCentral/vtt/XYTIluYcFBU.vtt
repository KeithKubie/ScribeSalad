00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.035
- It's time for
tonight's #HashtagWars.

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:05.038
(audience cheering)

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.411
Amazon Japan is
selling a cookbook

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.713
of some questionable
culinary delights.

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:17.384
Condom dishes I want
to make for you.

00:00:17.384 --> 00:00:19.719
This book of 11 recipes
includes condom fruit parfaits,

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:21.454
condom escargot and butter,

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.291
and some has swallowed on
the way back from Amsterdam.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:28.061
So, in honor of their
culinary ingenuity,

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.730
tonight's hashtag is #DongFoods.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.935
(audience cheering)

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.442
We are really mature.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.278
But examples of this would be

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.920
scroatmeal, shaft
sackaroni and cheese,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.500
or cup-o-balls.

00:00:56.156 --> 00:00:59.826
I wanna put 60 seconds
on the clock, and go.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.761

Hope so.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.543
Yeah, points.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:17.777
Nikki,

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:19.145

inch sub, toasted.

Oww, god damnit.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.798

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.467
- Stuffed dick in breast.

- A turdicken.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.474
- Yeah, turdicken, points.

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:50.009
Wait a minute, that also

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:00.353
(audience cheering)

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.055
There are breaddicks.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.698
The next time I go to a
restaurant that serves those,

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:15.068
I'm just gonna
push my head down.

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:15.902
