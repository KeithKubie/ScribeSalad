MALE SPEAKER 1: Thank
you for coming today.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.740
I've got the pleasure of
introducing Mario Chamorro

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.611
today, who will teach
us how to make it happy

00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:10.610
Let's hear it for Mario.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.180
MARIO CHAMORRO:
What's up, Google?

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.520
I am Mario, and I am
here to make it happy.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.470
It's not hard to
bring a charango,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.960
to sneak a charango,
into Google campus.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.440
It is not hard to
download a looping app.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.950
What is hard is, is
to stand in front

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.130
of all of you playing an
instrument that I just

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.400
start learning to
play it yesterday,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.590
and to download and use app
that I just downloaded on my way

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.250
to Mountain View.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.690
Over the past four years I've
been working on happiness,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.620
and if I have learned something
it's that happiness is hard.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.060
Sometimes happiness is hard.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.730
And sometimes happiness requires
one little extra effort.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.410
One kind of like thing,
a breakout from you,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.350
to take some action.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.500
So this is how we're
going to start this talk.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.710
When I got the invitation to
come to talk here at Google,

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.030
the first thing that I did
was to visit the bookstore.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.620
And this is what I found.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.200
Are you smart enough
to work at Google?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.970
So my immediate thought
was, I don't know.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.470
But I decided to
build up courage

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.710
to come today to share a
couple of stories with you.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:55.450
So Nathan told me that I just
have 30 minutes today with you.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.830
So the first thing
that I'll do is

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.490
I'm going to set
up an alarm that

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.060
goes on over only 35 minutes.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.760
And my challenge is that
in less those 35 minutes,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.630
I can share with
you one simple idea.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.130
It's an idea that is
not hard to understand,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.940
but sometimes it's really
difficult to embrace.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.360
So how the journey
is going to go today.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.230
It's going to go in
three different steps.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.790
The first part is
I'm going to share

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.567
with you a couple
of stories, then

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:38.400
I'm going to tell you
about some of the work

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.200
that we have been doing
on the happiness field,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.450
and lastly, I'm going to
share something with you that

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.420
happened just last week,
which is really cool.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.210
The first story is about
how happiness brought me

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.220
to the Silicon Valley, and
how happiness brought me

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.270
to this peak here
with you today.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.020
I am from Colombia.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.450
I went to Columbia, and I used
to live on Columbus Avenue,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.480
so it's really Colombian.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.880
This is my volcano.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.050
It's called Il Galletas.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.270
I grew up in a city
called El Basto, which

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.481
is in the southwest of Colombia.

00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:15.980
This is kind of
like the first image

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.420
that you see once
you open your window.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.840
And it's kind of
like a magical place.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840
This is my dad.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.007
That was this Christmas,
and he's 74 years old.

00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:31.590
And that was the
very first time where

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.260
he start interacting
with Internet.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.960
Surprisingly, yes, he was
fascinated about Google.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.120
Not surprisingly, I will say.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.690
So regardless of his skills
in computer and Internet,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.510
I believe that my dad is
an amazing life hacker.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.300
Why?

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.240
Because he always find a
way to convert something bad

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.590
into something good.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.090
In fact, I'm going to share
with you one tip that he give me

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.990
what I was a little kid.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.610
He told me that if I was able
to whistle any song that I loved

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.480
on my way to work or
to school, definitely

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.730
my day was going to be better.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.580
So in El Basto I went
to school, and when

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.380
you go to school in a
little town in Colombia,

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.790
they tell you the biggest, the
largest that you can dream,

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.110
is to move to the
capital and to get

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.930
a job into a
multinational company.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.660
Right?

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.560
But unfortunately,
that wasn't my case

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.780
because I got one of the worst
SAT scores in my high school.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.520
And therefore when
that happened,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.790
your professors, your
family, and friends

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.900
tell you that your future is
to take care of these ladies.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.280
Right?

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.605
And as most as I love these
ladies-- they're cute, right?--

00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:51.480
you have to see this.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.360
These screens are amazing.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.320
For the most that I
love these ladies,

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.020
I wanted to do
something different.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.860
So when I was 16,
I moved to Bogota.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.610
And in Bogota, I
remembered that I was just

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.886
staring upon all
those sky croppers.

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:09.385
Scrapers.

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:09.884
Again.

00:05:09.884 --> 00:05:10.960
Again I did it again.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.560
Skyscrapers.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.870
I did it in college.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.400
I'll tell you the story.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.570
I was staring at
those big buildings,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.800
and I remembered that
I was thinking why?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.140
What's happening there.?

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.200
But back.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.460
The country was in bad shape,
and the last part of the night

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.870
is the violence rate was going
up, the economy was going down.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.715
So everybody was
telling, you know,

00:05:38.715 --> 00:05:44.104
Mario, just go back to El Basto
and just take care of the cows.

00:05:44.104 --> 00:05:46.270
Instead of doing that, I
fell in love with politics,

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.603
and I ended up working with
the president of my country.

00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:51.870
That picture was when
we launched a loan

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.670
to support the
young entrepreneurs.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.610
And life was going great.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.850
And I was able to rent a nice
apartment, to have a car,

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.770
and everything was going well.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.610
Until one day it was
my birthday number 24.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.560
And I do remember
that when I woke up

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.680
and I said, well, how
can it be possible

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.380
that I haven't been able to
live in a different country?

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.070
How can it be possible that I
don't speak any other language?

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.150
I mean, I'm still trying, right?

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.280
So in less than three
months I quit my job,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.510
I sold all my belongings,
and I moved to Boston.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.030
In Boston, I just had money
there to be for three months,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.300
so I was running out of money.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:35.090
No languages skills and
almost not knowing anybody.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.345
So I got myself into
a lot of odd jobs,

00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:44.630
from salsa lessons to teaching
salsa lessons to valet parking.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.070
And one day, I was
doing valet parking

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.210
in this coffee in
Newbury Street, which

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.560
is kind of like this
fancy street in Boston,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.911
and I do remember that a
Ferrari came and parked outside.

00:06:56.911 --> 00:06:59.410
And my reaction was-- I turned
to the guy who was next to me

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.780
and said, you know what?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.410
My dream is not to
have one of those cars,

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.920
but my dream is to go to
a really awesome school

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.870
such as that guy.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.080
And the guy was
wearing an MIT hoodie.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.870
So the guy said,
well, you know what,

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.260
it happens that I'm a
professor at Harvard,

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.170
so if you want to come
and take my class,

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.211
you're more than welcome.

00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:20.150
So I said yes.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.220
So then I start visiting
Harvard, taking lessons,

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.930
and then I ended up
meeting a lot of people,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.120
and then I fell in love
with all the academia

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.010
and with the energy world
and the finance world.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.690
So then I decided I wanted
to apply into-- to study

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.550
at the ivy league school.

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.160
Everybody was telling me
that, Mario that's crazy,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.700
you don't have money, you
barely speaking English.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.030
Don't do it.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.160
And until one day,
in this corner,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.410
in Boston, it was this
December 24, 2004.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.440
It was a cold night in Boston.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.550
And I was parking cars
outside on the street,

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.580
then there was this car.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.900
He came-- they had a
sticker on the back that

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.210
said Columbia University.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.400
So I opened the door, and one
thing that I do very often

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.160
is I always share my
dreams with people.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.960
Strangers.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.420
So then I told
him, you know what?

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.670
My dream is to study
in that school.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.700
And he say, well, you know what?

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.610
My daughter goes to
Columbia College,

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.340
but I don't think
you can make it.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:29.910
So that day, I decided that I
was going to apply to Columbia.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:32.372
And that night, in
that corner-- actually,

00:08:32.372 --> 00:08:34.580
every time that I go to
Boston I stop in that corner,

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.289
and I just ask for three wishes.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.350
I just did it a
month ago, actually

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.250
I wished that I wanted
to study at Columbia.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.780
Right?

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.690
So, yes.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.050
Four or five months later,
I was accepted to Columbia,

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.430
and I always have the
letter in my pocket.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.270
And one night the same
guy came, in the same car,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.479
and I thank him because
if he didn't tell me

00:08:58.479 --> 00:09:00.020
that I wasn't able
to go to Columbia,

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.720
I will never take
the courage to apply.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.680
So I thank him.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.910
And it's how you
see these obstacles

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.550
and how you play
with these obstacles

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:12.950
and how awesome
things can happen.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.810
So one of the main things
that I learned after Columbia

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.110
was that you don't need
to be rich in order

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:23.430
to be super-smart to
go whatever you want,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:28.030
to do whatever you want, you
just need to put some effort.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.465
After school, I ended up in the
finance world between Boston

00:09:32.465 --> 00:09:37.070
and New York, working
from investment banking

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.670
to stock trading.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.110
And then during the
financial crisis,

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.335
I ended up again with
zero money in my pockets

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:49.300
and starting my life again.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.300
One day, I remembered that I
was in this magical place called

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.550
a Fung Wah, which is
a bus that take you

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.024
from New York to Boston.

00:10:00.024 --> 00:10:01.690
I don't know if you're
familiar with it,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.600
but I call it magical because
you have four to five hours

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.210
to think and it was
in that magical place

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.060
where my aha moment
came into reality.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.130
My aha moment was this one.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.560
I have two questions.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.850
The first one,
what is your gift?

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.030
Everyone has a gift.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.910
100% of human beings
are good to do anything.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.240
To do something, right?

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.530
But just few people use
those gifts, and even fewer

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.800
use those gifts as
a way of living.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.960
So then I start thinking
about this question.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.340
The second one was a little
bit tougher because was

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.965
how are you using those gifts to
make the world a better place?

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.530
Somebody told me that I was
good connecting with people

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:47.350
and empowering them
with positive messages,

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.530
so then I decided just
to instigate and to start

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:51.757
taking into some experiments.

00:10:51.757 --> 00:10:53.590
The first one was called
a tourist attitude.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.900
Which is a kind of
travelers' attitude, which

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.510
is the state of mind that we
have when we visit new places,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:10:59.010
right?

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.790
You become more curious,
you do more things.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:04.250
You are here and now.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.590
My hypothesis was that we can
activate that state of mind

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.230
any time in life.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.834
And then I build a
website, and then

00:11:10.834 --> 00:11:12.500
people from different
parts of the world

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.640
was-- we're using that
theory, and then I

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.360
get emails saying,
thanks for your idea.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.040
I got a girlfriend I'm
enjoying more or my city.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.800
And other things, too.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.970
And thanks to that I started
doing more experiments.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.670
Another one was called
a 365 challenges,

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.580
in which people used
to send me challenges.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.360
And the challenges have
two characteristics.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.620
The first one was the challenge
should be something to do good,

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.340
or to make people happy.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.090
And-- it's OK.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.660
And the second one
was that challenge

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.850
should be applied in
less than a month.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.790
So my first challenge
was to became official

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.430
and to marry people, right?

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.920
So I became a priest.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.080
In fact, I'm a certified
minister in case

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.720
that you guys need that service.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.570
I can give you a good discount.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.270
The other challenge
was to spend time

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.280
with the Hare Krishnas
in one winter day.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.400
Another one was to give
out free subway rides.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.640
Some people were really skeptic.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.470
But anyways, It was
very interesting.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.410
Another one was
called Nap4change,

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.030
in which I've been
collecting-- yay.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.030
I've been collecting
pictures of people napping.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.690
I hear here at Google you
have amazing nap rooms.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.820
Hopefully I can get
into one of them.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.290
But I've been collecting just
pictures of people napping.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:35.790
Why?

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.340
Because it's better to take a
nap than to a drink a RedBull.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.530
And the other experiment
was called happy post.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.500
Can happen suppose we
start asking people

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.630
to write to draw
anything that makes

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.040
them happy on a Post-it note.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.820
That little action is
spreading to 30 countries,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.380
and then we have had three
teams 30 countries going

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.150
around stopping people in
the streets asking them,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:00.690
what makes you happy?

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.420
And from that
little experiment we

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.896
start building
art installations,

00:13:03.896 --> 00:13:07.775
and from those art installations
we start connecting people.

00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:10.020
And from the
connecting people we

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.390
started learning
happiness what's

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:16.140
the tools to generate
positive social change so

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.080
when we with that
idea in my mind

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.870
I decided to push a little bit
forward, and go to my next gig.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.440
The next gig.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.300
So thanks to that, we were
invited to talk at Ted.

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.290
We have been very close
to the Tedx community.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.230
We have the fortune
to having spoken

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.090
in different places in Tedx.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:44.430
We have been also recognized
by the president of Columbia,

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.140
and also we have been creating
some art installations

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:51.640
and signing some happiness
agreements with some mayors.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.260
Also, we got a lot
of media coverage

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.610
and when that
happen people start

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.180
getting more interested
in what you do?

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:04.320
Which shouldn't be like
that, but it is what it is.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:10.200
So at that point, I decided
to quit my job again.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.560
So I quit my
corporate job, and I

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:17.860
decided to start spending 100%
of my time doing happiness

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.890
initiatives.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.180
So then I call a couple
of friends in Boston,

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.700
and then we build a
crowd-funding platform

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.440
and we launch it.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.810
We work really hard
on it for six months,

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.460
and we launch it and guess what?

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.480
Nobody use it.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.880
So at that point I ended up in
New York again with no money.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.790
That's kind of like a
pattern in my life, right?

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.630
And then I thought that
probably some company

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.380
could support my ideas.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:50.770
So luckily, by just knocking
doors and just sharing dreams,

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.680
I had this company
who believe in me,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:55.700
and they gave me offices,
pay, salary, and Visa.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.630
So then I was able
to have a place

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:01.290
to work and to focus my
attention on these initiatives.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.640
But I'll get back to that later.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.200
Now I'm going to
talk about this guy.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.140
His name was John Paul.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.430
He was five years old.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.809
He's no longer with us.

00:15:14.809 --> 00:15:15.475
He died already.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.880
When I met him, he
was a cancer patient,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.420
and the most amazing
thing about him

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.250
was that he was always smiling.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.770
Always super-active
and here and there.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:34.430
And his doctor told me that
John Paul used to tell him,

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.094
you know what, doc?

00:15:36.094 --> 00:15:38.010
I'm going to die in five
months, but something

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.660
that really makes me happy
is to make others happy.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:44.130
So he was giving dance
classes to his peers.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:49.160
He was pranking other
patients, and basically he

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.930
was bringing a lot
of joy to people.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.040
So for me, he was
a happiness rebel,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.990
where I learned a lot from him.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.590
So what rebels do?

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:58.860
Revels instigate.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.800
Right?

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.160
And he became an icon for
what I'm doing right now.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.180
So rebels instigate.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.430
So what is instigation?

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.300
It could have a
negative connotation

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.940
but also could have a positive.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.120
So instigating is to bring
about or to initiate an action

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:14.880
or event.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.680
To change something.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.000
So why instigate?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.160
One example.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.990
That's the O'Connor
exhibit in Sydney.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.640
And apparently, in
Japan, something

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.520
is worth has been broken and
then you put it back together.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.480
So they have this
exhibition with plates.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:38.680
And my friend Freddie just built
this up, and he place it here.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.010
And the people who were
working in that gallery

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.260
told him well, you know what?

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.490
That might fall.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.850
And he say, well that's great.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.610
Because if it fall, somebody
will put it back together

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.060
and will make it better.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.410
So why instigate?

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.030
it's because you're able
to instigate also happiness

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.860
and to prank, happiness,
also, and do good actions,

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.570
then you can start
affecting peers

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.048
around you and probably
the world, right?

00:17:03.048 --> 00:17:05.089
And that's the whole
experience of make it happy,

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.660
and this is the last
part of my story.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.050
So this is where I am right now.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:13.390
From the little town,
now I'm in New York,

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.609
in this platform where I
interact with the brand expert,

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:22.589
with product development
expert, with amazing designers,

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:27.500
with talented videographers
where they are supporting me

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.150
about taking these initiatives
into another level.

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.140
We are still in a very,
very, very early stage.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.850
But this is something
that we have been doing.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:37.440
So what are?

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.560
We are a movement of
optimistic rebels.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.730
Optimistic rebels
such as John Paul.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.170
As well as him we
have optimistic rebels

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.440
in thirty countries.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.680
They are the ones who
do community organizing.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.960
The ones who can
instigate more happiness

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.120
around their communities
and around themselves.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.830
From art installations
to real-life gardening

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:01.320
to fixing something to
converting something

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.750
bad into something good.

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.660
They are kind of a
continuous inspiration

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.750
and this is the soul
of Make it Happy.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.650
We believe in
happiness is a choice.

00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.940
Everybody has a choice.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.360
Happiness is a
human inspiration.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.850
Otherwise somebody
can tell me that you

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.410
don't want to be happy,
you can raise your hand.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.280
I hope nobody will
raise their hands.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.290
Happiness is contagious.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.810
We just saw it at the very
beginning of this talk.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:35.980
We created a song together,
and happiness is a movement.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.980
We believe also in collective
happiness Is not only

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.770
about your only
happiness, but it's about

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.790
how you have the gift of
how you can spread happiness

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.110
to those around you, and how
you can give the best that

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.990
is you to affect, in a positive
way, the community that

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:51.730
is surrounding you.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.970
So we want to inspire people
to prioritize happiness.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.304
For instance, you brush your
teeth every single morning,

00:18:58.304 --> 00:18:58.803
right?

00:18:58.803 --> 00:19:00.760
Why you don't also
prioritize your happiness

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.550
and think about things that
make you happy and just do it?

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:06.770
How we prioritize happiness
is by creating. tools

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.890
to instigate happiness, and
we do it in three levels.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.040
The first one is in individuals.

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.210
So what I'm going to present
is little nuggets of things

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.000
that we have been
doing at each level.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.160
Individuals, companies,
and governments.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.340
The first one is individuals.

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.360
So we have been just going
to around building campus

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.760
ambassadors programs, regional
ambassadors, happiness

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.110
advocates, inspiring
individuals.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.240
We have been also creating
tools such as this book where

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.450
we ask people, what is
your idea to make the world

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.140
a happier place?

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.430
Where we're trying to collect
a million of those ideas,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.360
and hopefully it will become
an open source of ideas

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.150
of happiness accessible
to everybody.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.280
Last week we launched
this campaign

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.140
with Mashable, in which we
asked Vine experts to send us

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.810
their video on what
happiness means to them.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:07.370
And actually these were the
winners from this contest.

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:08.980
These were the main videos.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.590
And we present these
videos at the UN.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.540
So is kind of like you
just give a little platform

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.900
to participate and engage,
and something amazing

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.760
can start happening.

00:20:24.797 --> 00:20:25.630
All those are vines.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.870
Besides individuals, we
have been also working

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.994
with companies
creating partnerships.

00:20:45.994 --> 00:20:48.160
We really want to create
partnerships with companies

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.160
to be able to
create these tools.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.650
We have been also doing
workshops, lectures.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:54.510
Columbia.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:55.260
I'm from Colombia.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.340
We have been doing a lot
amazing things in Colombia

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.660
where people and companies
have been signing happiness

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:07.540
agreements where CEOs commit
to really take responsibility

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.410
over the happiness
of their employees.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:13.850
So this video was taken
in a bullet-proof clothing

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:15.840
company in Colombia.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.840
We go there, we
work with people,

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.400
and sometimes you also
have to take some risks.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.420
So I think I took a shot
there for happiness--

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.620
literally a shot.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.890
The whole idea is that
they save lives right?

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:41.510
So they challenge me to also
to use one of their tools

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:42.840
with how they save lives.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.140
I was chill.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.670
It didn't hurt.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:15.660
I swear In governments, this
has been very interesting.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.590
In fact, a week ago, we were
celebrating International Day

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.440
of Happiness, and I'll go
through that in a little bit.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:25.470
But we participate in the very
first that happiness summit

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:29.420
at the UN with ministers
from 65 different countries.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.461
And when you see all got these
ministers discussing about hey,

00:22:32.461 --> 00:22:34.336
we should include
happiness and this or that,

00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:36.130
and how or how can
we include happiness

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.589
and the creation of policies?

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.380
That is when you start
feeling that there's

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:42.260
something happening, and
something in the air that

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.220
is somehow right about the
work that you are doing.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.240
So we have been also been
working with governments

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.910
and we're big
supporters of Bhutan.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:53.870
As you know, Bhutan,
I'll go there,

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.680
but Nima's going
to spend a little--

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.820
MALE SPEAKER 2: Bhutan
Ambassador, Gross National

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:03.510
Happiness, more important
than Gross National Product

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:08.090
because happiness is
about being human first.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.930
We make public policies
that truly serve the public

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:16.920
by involving grassroots people
where every joys counts,

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.050
every voice counts,
every happiness counts.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.960
We welcome you to this great
initiative by our friend Mario

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:30.010
Chamorro and Happy+ Team to
spread happiness for positive

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:30.840
social change.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.520
MARIO CHAMORRO: So
the beauty of Bhutan

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.570
is that is that Bhutan
is this country that only

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.420
has 1 million inhabitants that
is between India and China,

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.512
and they started
taking the risk.

00:23:40.512 --> 00:23:42.720
And it is to get in happiness
in the economy and just

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.570
really finding value
in a different way.

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.897
They measure all their
success based on happiness.

00:23:48.897 --> 00:23:50.480
And thanks to the
experiment that they

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.450
have been doing that
there, some of those

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.640
have been replicated in
countries such as Germany,

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.760
France, and now--
more countries are

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.790
can just joining and joining.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:04.450
In fact, in 2015, there's
going to be the new G8

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.730
meeting in Germany,
and Angela Merkel

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.590
is definitely very interested
on the happiness agenda,

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.110
so she wants to include
happiness as a new measurement

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:18.700
that countries can adopt and
build public policies from.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.330
Also from the government side,
we have instigated happiness.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.730
We have been talking
to different leaders

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.180
here in the US and other
organizations as well.

00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:32.940
Just planting some seeds
about how can we support

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.600
and how can we breach--
I call this initiative

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.000
from governments to
the grassroots level.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.460
This is another
tool that we build.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.510
This is a great
story that I love.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.980
So my good friend Navin
Masson, he's an MIT grad

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.460
and he lives in Cambridge.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.930
And he was teaching this class
called art entrepreneurship.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.380
So he went to the City
Council of Cambridge

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.670
to ask for some help
for his students

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:02.510
but the response was really
bad and really awful.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.770
So somehow he called
me that night and said,

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.400
Mario response was awful.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.500
I'm going to run for city
council and fix that.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.430
And I say, well,
let's do it together.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.530
And so we built this map
in less than four days

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.960
in which we collected
about 200 videos

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.280
and we place it on
the map of Cambridge

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.635
we geotagged everything.

00:25:23.635 --> 00:25:25.260
And base it on the
responses about what

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.890
makes people happy
about Cambridge

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.310
and how they will be
happier to be in Cambridge,

00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:33.700
he built his political program
and now he's a city councilor

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.980
and he's working some of
these initiatives as well.

00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.780
So those are some of the tools
that we have been building.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:43.810
And finally, this is
something that is very recent.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.142
Just happened last week.

00:25:45.142 --> 00:25:47.350
Beautiful thing about
International Day of Happiness.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.020
The UN Created International
Day of Happiness.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.310
This year was the second one.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:56.780
So our vision is to create
an international holiday

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.010
where companies and governments
can celebrate happiness as well

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.230
as individuals.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:05.910
It's a little steps, but it
can lead into bigger things.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:07.390
It's just to show
the recognition

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:11.210
from the government's
side through happiness.

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:16.200
So we helped organize
this event at the UN,

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.240
and also we were able
to mobilize people

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.990
being in 18 different
countries where

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.950
we have different activations
from collections of garbage

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.855
in oceans to events
at universities.

00:26:31.106 --> 00:26:33.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.570
ANWARUL KARIM CHOWDHURY: I'm
happy if my family is happy.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.538
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:51.442 --> 00:26:56.428
MALE SPEAKER 2: Happiness
everyone being human first.

00:26:56.428 --> 00:26:59.872
Every child counts,
every voice counts.

00:26:59.872 --> 00:27:01.348
Every happiness counts.

00:27:01.348 --> 00:27:06.760
Respect happiness for
positive social change.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.204
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:57.507 --> 00:27:59.090
MARIO CHAMORRO: We
wanted to leave you

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:02.060
with three words--
make it happen.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.630
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.720
So what's really
inspiring to see,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.064
18 cities people creating
their own initiatives

00:28:32.064 --> 00:28:33.480
following some of
our initiatives.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.180
We ask people to create a
happy face with their thumbs

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.270
in support of happiness.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.230
We also asked them
to create circles.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:44.442
But also they ended up doing
a bunch of amazing things.

00:28:44.442 --> 00:28:46.400
And thanks to them we
were able to reach about,

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.770
like, 20 million people
just to celebrate happiness

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.940
to hear at least for the
first time about International

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.060
Day of Happiness.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.990
And this is long-term
vision, but definitely we

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:04.060
want to get to a better level.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.900
Mao Tse-Tung used to say
that revolutions are not

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:08.240
dinner parties, right?

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.590
Revolutions also
takes a lot of guts.

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.380
In fact,a good old friend of
mine used to say that it takes

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:24.850
balls to be happy, so
where does it start?

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:26.960
Revolutions start
with individuals.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.960
As well as happiness.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.260
Starts with you.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.720
So everybody has the gift
to make the world happier.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.390
Everybody has not only the gift,
but also the responsibility

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:36.810
to make the world happier.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.530
From your own lives
to people that

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.660
are surrounding you, but
also in the amazing tools

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.250
that you guys build
on a daily basis.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.840
And then this the
invitation to help

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.540
us to continue to
gain in happiness.

00:29:53.540 --> 00:30:01.420
This tower is the largest
building in Colombia,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:06.040
and thanks to my good friend,
Pablo, and to the Make

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.550
it Happy Columbia Team,
we were able to light up

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:12.250
the building-- the building that
I saw when I was 16 years old

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.580
and I was just staring at it.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.756
That building was
radiating happiness,

00:30:17.756 --> 00:30:21.580
was showing to the
city's 9 million people

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.120
messages of happiness.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.210
So for me, that's hope.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:30.420
And that's hope that we, all of
us, we can radiate happiness,

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.270
and things can happen, right?

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.540
So that's my invitation
for you today,

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.420
and that was the simple idea
I wanted to share with you.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:41.780
Instigate happiness
from your own jobs.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:43.060
From your own lives.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.710
And help us to be
part of it like this.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.660
Make a happy revolution.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.590
And that's it.
