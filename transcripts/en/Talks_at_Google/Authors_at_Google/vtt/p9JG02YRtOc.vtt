CHRIS: It's my distinct pleasure
to welcome Professor Paul

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.950
Sabin who is an environmental
and energy historian at Yale.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.059
It's my distinct pleasure to
welcome him to Google so please

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.200
join me in giving him
a round of applause.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.827
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:21.827 --> 00:00:22.910
PAUL SABIN: Thanks, Chris.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.380
And thanks for having
me here at Google.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.234
Americans love history, but
I think in this business

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:30.650
and technology
setting, it's worth

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.741
asking what history is good for.

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.490
And I want to emphasize
a couple of things

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.290
in starting out around that.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.870
One is just the way
that history can

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.200
help us to appreciate complexity
and the uncertainty of the past

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.270
and also the way in which
it can help us to develop

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.390
a way that we can cultivate
empathy for the people whose

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.390
lives we're studying and
whose decisions and choices

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.820
we're trying to understand.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.980
I think these two different
kinds of understanding

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.600
can help us cultivate
our listening,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.590
can foster a critical
sense of humility,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.280
and also they can
raise questions for us

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.721
to ask about the future.

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:09.220
More generally, I
think that history

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.100
can offer a sense of
context and perspective

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.160
that's necessary for the
challenging social choices

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.490
that I believe we have
to make in charting

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.740
our future on the planet.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.310
Now, science and technology
and economics obviously all

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.640
have a critical role
to play in this future.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.906
But I think that they
don't have all the answers.

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:31.530
And they don't
necessarily even prepare

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920
us to know what
questions to ask.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.214
So that's where I think history
can play a critical role.

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:39.880
So I want to circle
back to these themes

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.370
at the close of my talk,
to talk a little bit

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.590
about the interesting
and complex ways in which

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.820
the story that I'm
going to share today

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.280
has been interpreted and the
way people have reacted to--

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.380
and let me just say
I guess as a hint

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.100
that listening and humility
are not the keywords that

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.102
come to mind in thinking
about that interpretation.

00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:02.810
So today I want to
tell you a story based

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.420
on my recent book, "The Bet:
Paul Ehrlich, Julian Simon,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.860
and Our Gamble Over
Earth's Future."

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.430
And my goal is
really to provide you

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.180
with some perspective on the
growing partisanship that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.750
has come to engulf our debate
over environmental issues

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.260
in the United States.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.700
And this is really
to help us also

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.580
think more about risks of
environmental catastrophe

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.530
and resource scarcity
on the one hand

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.820
and also the promise of
technological innovation

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.010
and human ingenuity and
progress, human advancement

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.520
into the future.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.729
So this is a story about
sharply disagreeing viewpoints.

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.770
But as I'll say at the
end, I think the challenge

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.270
for us really is
to try to find ways

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.330
to reconcile these different
viewpoints and learn from them.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.110
Now, we weren't always as
divided as we are today.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.410
Just this week, you had the
Senate Democrats pulling

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.990
an all nighter to talk
about climate issues,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.150
and on the other side,
you have many Republicans

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.160
who are questioning whether
climate change is caused

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.930
by humans or to what extent
it's changing and opposing

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.990
many of the initiatives that
EPA-- a job-killing agency

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.304
it's been called.

00:03:13.304 --> 00:03:14.970
So we weren't always
as divided as this,

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.344
and I think it's
worth going back

00:03:16.344 --> 00:03:19.020
to remember some of the
bipartisanship with which

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.480
the environmental legislation
of the 1970s was passed.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.645
The Clean Air Act,
the Clean Water Act,

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:27.770
the National Environmental
Policy Act, all of these

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.490
were passed with bipartisan
support in Congress.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.270
And Richard Nixon
actually articulated

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.420
this bipartisan attitude in
his 1970 state of the union.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.430
And I wanted to
share, if I can here,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.160
a little video from
him in which he talks

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.362
about how a concern
for the environment

00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:50.070
was something that
should be beyond party

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.090
and beyond faction.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.520
So this is Richard Nixon
talking in the 1970s

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.616
state of the union.

00:03:56.616 --> 00:03:57.520
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.040
-The great question
to the '70s is,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.594
shall we surrender
to our surroundings

00:04:03.594 --> 00:04:07.042
or shall we make our
peace with nature

00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:10.206
and begin to make reparations
for the damage we have done

00:04:10.206 --> 00:04:13.970
to our air, to our
land, and to our water?

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.709
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.649
Restoring nature to
it's natural state

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.940
is a cause beyond party
and beyond factions.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.970
It has become a common cause of
all the people of this country.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.200
It is a cause of particular
concern to young Americans

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.770
because they more than we will
reap the grim consequences

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.245
of our failure to act on
programs which are needed now

00:04:42.245 --> 00:04:45.060
if we are to prevent
disaster later.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.553
Clean air, clean
water, open spaces,

00:04:48.553 --> 00:04:49.867
these should once again--

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:50.700
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.908
PAUL SABIN: So this is Nixon
with a unifying message,

00:04:52.908 --> 00:04:54.930
bringing people together
around the environment.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.260
And he didn't necessarily stay
in this point of view for long.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.745
He became a little
disillusioned with how well

00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:05.220
the environmental cause was
serving him politically.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.616
And he wasn't necessarily a
passionate environmentalist.

00:05:08.616 --> 00:05:10.490
Here's a picture of him
walking on the beach.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.864
He was trying to
be Kennedy-esque

00:05:11.864 --> 00:05:14.010
walking on the beach
in Southern California

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.080
but with his wing tip
shoes and his dress pants.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.830
But still, even Nixon was
bringing people together

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.030
around the environment.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.020
And so that was in the early
1970s, but by the 1980s,

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.750
you had a gradually
growing division,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.060
greater partisanship
around the environment.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.130
And you can see that in these
League of Conservation scores

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.410
by chamber and party.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.430
You can see kind of a gradually
opening gulf between the two

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.610
parties on the votes
that they were cataloging

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.910
in Congress for this index.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.070
So what are the explanations
for this growing partisanship

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.260
around the environment?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.840
There are several
common explanations.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.860
Some have explained it in part
as the sifting out of the two

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.325
parties by region and
according to ideology,

00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:04.950
where the Southern
Democrats moved over

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.730
to the Republican Party and
the northern Republicans

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.680
moved over to the
Democrat and kind of took

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.370
their environmental
affiliations with them.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.820
Others have explained it as
more of a business backlash,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.680
with business interests
fighting regulation and pushing

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.500
their political allies to
contest regulatory initiatives.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.640
And still others have identified
a conservative intellectual

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.930
revolution with think
tanks and funding

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.640
for public intellectuals
who would then

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.530
advance criticism of
environmental regulation.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.300
I think all of these
different explanations

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.820
have some truth to them.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.660
And scholars have
examined them in depth.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.040
But at the same time, I think
that these interpretations

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.120
don't say the whole story.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.315
And what I want to explore
today is the genuine clash

00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:55.180
that occurred between different
viewpoints in the 1970s

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.100
and 1980s because these
interpretations really

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.790
explain the growing
partisanship primarily

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.040
as just a political and economic
development, that people are

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.330
representing their political
and economic interest.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
And they tend not
to look more closely

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.650
at the intellectual
conflicts and what

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.510
I see as some of the
weaknesses and flaws

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.030
of the environmental
movement during this period.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.070
So I think that's a mistake.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.440
And in my book, "The
Bet," I revisit the rise

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.780
of the environmental
movement since the 1960s

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.620
and the backlash and the
debates that it engendered.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.570
And so I approach this story
through a smaller story

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:35.050
that I think allows entry into
the larger debates happening

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.920
in environmental politics.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.870
And this was a story about the
biologist Paul Ehrlich, here

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:45.480
on your left, author of the
1968 book "The Population Bomb,"

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.780
and his antagonist Julian
Simon on the right,

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.990
who wrote the book "The
Ultimate Resource."

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.890
And these two men
made an actual bet,

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.700
which is a rare thing in
intellectual disagreements.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.840
They came together around a
bet over metal prices in 1980.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.100
And it was a simple bet over
five metals, chromium, copper,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.730
tin, nickel, and tungsten.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.690
It was a bundle of those
metals worth a total of $1,000.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:14.420
And, essentially,
if the prices rose,

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.130
Simon would pay the difference
and if the prices fell,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.730
Ehrlich and his
colleagues would pay.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.720
And it was going to
be a 10 year bet.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.180
Now, it was a simple
bet about metal prices,

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.850
but really the bet
stood for much more.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.730
It was really a proxy
for their competing

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.800
visions of the future.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.460
On Ehrlich's side, an
apocalyptic vision that

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.190
was fearful about human
excess and over population.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.789
And on Simon's side,
optimistic and bullish

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.870
about the potential
for human progress.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.770
Ehrlich thought that
rising metal prices

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.990
would signify that population
growth caused resource

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.360
scarcity.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.310
And that would bolster his call
for government-led population

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.400
control and limits
on consumption.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.740
Simon argued that markets
and new technology

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.470
would drive prices down.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.730
And this would prove
that society did not

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.440
face resource constraints and
that human welfare, in fact,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.750
was going to steadily improve.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.520
And so the outcome of the
small bet about metal prices

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.500
would have these tremendous
implications for what direction

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.380
the planet and
humanity was headed in.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.620
It would either
bolster Ehrlich's call

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.640
for limits on population
growth and his warnings

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.310
of an environmental calamity.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.390
Or it would fuel
Simon's attack on what

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.870
he called Ehrlich's
"unfounded threats of doom."

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.460
So in the book I try, in
the spirit of the empathy

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.850
that I talked about and
the complexity, to explore

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.000
these two men and
their different lives

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.530
and how they arrived at the
positions that they took.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.364
And I want to talk a
little bit about that

00:09:51.364 --> 00:09:52.780
because Ehrlich
and Simon actually

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.269
are very interesting characters
who shared much in common.

00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:57.310
Actually, in some ways,
that was what drove them,

00:09:57.310 --> 00:09:59.630
I think, to such
sharp disagreement.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.690
They both were born in 1932
to Jewish families that

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.730
were based originally
in the cities,

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.010
in Philadelphia and in
Newark, but then moved out

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:13.010
into the suburbs
just before they

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.827
each were around 10 years old.

00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:16.410
And they actually
grew up about three,

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.390
five miles apart from
each other in Maplewood,

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.880
and Millburn, New Jersey.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.590
Ehrlich was a child of
the suburbs in the sense

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:29.150
that he loved chasing
butterflies through the fields

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.970
and he was impassioned about
the threat of development

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.520
to the suburban landscape.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.910
He became early on
concerned about the danger

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:41.200
of DDT, the pesticide being
sprayed that was endangering

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.960
the food sources that he wanted
to feed to his butterflies.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.270
He was a lover of nature.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.700
At one point, he had so many
aquariums and other types

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.540
of collections in
his bedroom that he

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.850
had to move out and
move up into the attic

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.690
to make room for them.

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.590
So Ehrlich's study
of butterflies,

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.770
which he's continued as
a professor up the road

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.080
here at Stanford-- this
is the Bay Checkerspot

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.110
butterfly-- really
provided him with a model

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.980
for thinking about
human population growth

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.660
because he studied the rise and
fall of butterfly populations

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.670
in relationship to the abundance
and scarcity of resources.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:24.980
And so, in seeing that
butterfly populations might grow

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.910
and then they might outstrip the
resources that were available

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.490
and then they would crash in
this tremendous collapse--

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.364
and then he said this
was the same thing that

00:11:33.364 --> 00:11:35.280
was going to happen to people.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.670
And so he predicted the greatest
cataclysm in the history of man

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.090
was coming, this
population collapse

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:47.100
that would be caused by food
shortages, disease outbreaks,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.670
maybe thermonuclear war.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.636
And he described
that the population

00:11:53.636 --> 00:11:55.010
had grown to the
extent-- he said

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.610
we've had most of what he called
the outbreak of population

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.130
and now all that
we're waiting for is

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.000
what's going to
come in the crash.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.390
So kind of basically modeling
onto human populations

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.775
the same developments
as with butterflies

00:12:07.775 --> 00:12:08.650
and other creatures.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.710
And he wasn't alone in this.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.835
There were many biologists
in the post World War Ii

00:12:11.835 --> 00:12:17.350
period who were thinking about
animal populations in this way.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:21.650
Ehrlich was so concerned about
the threat of population growth

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.320
that he came to embrace
the idea of triage,

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.050
that some countries
might be so far gone,

00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.209
so headed directly
towards catastrophe

00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:32.500
and unable to feed themselves
that they should actually

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.800
be cut off from food aid.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.380
And he put countries like
India in this category,

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.520
saying the US should
no longer send them

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.430
food aid because quote,
"dispassionate analysis

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.700
indicates that the unbalance
between food and population

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.150
is hopeless."

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:52.040
And he argued that the optimum
human worldwide population

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.880
was somewhere between 600
million and 1.5 billion people,

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.470
so significantly less than what
even the population was then

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.130
around 1968, 1970.

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.140
Now, Ehrlich was a very
popular, charismatic speaker

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.140
with a biting wit,
very entertaining.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.310
Here he is speaking to students
around Earth Day at Iowa State

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.150
University.

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.750
He spoke to audiences
of thousands.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.000
And in 1970, he
really became famous

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.920
after Johnny Carson invited
him onto "The Tonight Show,"

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.086
became a big fan of his,
loved having him on the show

00:13:25.086 --> 00:13:26.710
and had him actually
more than 20 times

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.080
onto "The Tonight
Show" and really shared

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.226
a lot of his views on population
and environmental issues

00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:33.350
and gave him that platform.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.720
That really brought Ehrlich
to much greater fame.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.280
Now, Julian Simon,
as I said, also

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.900
grew up in suburban New
Jersey in his teenage years.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.370
But his formative years
were really in Newark.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.770
And he was impressed in
the early age the hustle

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:50.990
and bustle of immigrant life.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.490
And he loved the
diversity of people

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.156
and the excitement
of being in the city,

00:13:54.156 --> 00:13:55.790
and he always,
after he moved out

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.830
into the suburbs-- he regretted
the loss of that community

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.540
that he had felt when
he had been in Newark.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.600
And I think that carried through
in his appreciation of cities

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.010
and people and more people
bringing more excitement

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.000
and diversity to the world.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.870
He took a slightly more
circuitous path into academia.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.640
Here he is as a Boy
Scout as a young boy.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.844
He served in the Navy
for a few years also,

00:14:21.844 --> 00:14:24.010
giving him an impression
of what the world was like.

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.280
And what he saw
later would describe

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.020
some of the more rundown
areas of the world

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:32.122
where his Navy ship
would stop and thinking

00:14:32.122 --> 00:14:34.580
about how they had improved
over time, that you didn't just

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:35.850
see the beautiful
parts of the world

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:36.890
but there were
these other places

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.570
that he had seen and saw the
improvements that took place

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:40.410
there.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.190
Now, Simon early on actually
shared Ehrlich's view

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.190
about the threat of
population growth.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.310
And he got into studying
marketing and business.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.830
And he was hired by I
think it was the Population

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.810
Council to develop
marketing plans for family

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.855
planning in India
and in other places.

00:14:57.855 --> 00:14:59.730
And so he was originally
trying to figure out

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.530
how to address the problem
of population growth.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.340
But then he came to believe
that actually population growth

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.240
wasn't a problem.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.360
And in this, he sort of linked
up with some other economists

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.710
at the time, people like Simon
Kuznets and Richard Easterlin.

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.930
And they had examined historical
patterns of economic growth

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.137
and correlated them
with population growth

00:15:20.137 --> 00:15:21.720
and decided that
there wasn't actually

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.260
evidence that population
growth was diminishing

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:25.990
national economic growth.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.020
And you also people like the
Danish agricultural economist

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:34.900
Ester Boserup, who found that
population growth actually

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.650
increased innovation in
agriculture and spurred saving.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:42.471
And so rather than
agriculture setting limits

00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:44.720
for population, which was
the idea that there was only

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.275
so much that
agriculture produced.

00:15:46.275 --> 00:15:48.400
She actually found that it
was sort of the reverse.

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.130
It was the density and
the demand of population

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.700
that set limits on
agriculture and that the forms

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.125
of agriculture were determined,
in part, by population size

00:15:57.125 --> 00:15:58.750
and density and that
it would stimulate

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.350
new kinds of
agricultural practices.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.270
Now in 1980, Simon broke
out into the public arena

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.740
with a article in "Science"
in which he attacked

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.670
Ehrlich and other
doom-sayers for what he said

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:17.350
were unfounded-- the
oversupply of false bad news.

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.820
And he soon found common
cause with libertarians

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.720
and conservatives and
enjoyed a lot of attention

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.800
as a regular contributor
to op-ed pages

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.710
with these kinds of
arguments-- that life on Earth

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.350
is improving, that these
myths of overpopulation.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.040
"Why Do We Think
Babies Create Poverty?"

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.530
So these are all
part of a campaign

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.200
to change the way that people
thought about population

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.230
growth, and he
then extended this

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:42.640
as well to the problem
of immigration.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.410
And this is where actually--
these characters, these

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.340
are individual
intellectuals navigating

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.700
the currents of
American politics--

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.420
in which he sort of fell
out with many American

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.920
conservatives because
Simon actually

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.750
was quite pro-immigration,
believing that immigrants were

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.310
an asset to the American
economy and would

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.520
stimulate economic growth.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.270
They took much less
than they contributed.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.085
And so he was an early
advocate for immigration.

00:17:06.085 --> 00:17:07.960
So actually there was
recently the suggestion

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.310
that Detroit should create
a special economic zone

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.829
and invite immigrants
to come in who

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:15.579
would invest to create
jobs in the city.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:20.300
This was the kind of thing
that Simon was in favor of.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.700
And actually just as
an aside, you may never

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.170
have heard of Julian
Simon before today,

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.500
but one of the things
that he's more known for--

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.560
or you would know
him for-- is that he

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.530
was one of the main advocates
for the idea of an auction

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.506
for overbooking on airlines,
that you should have a market.

00:17:39.506 --> 00:17:41.380
So if you have ever been
bumped from a flight

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.950
and gotten a free flight or
some other benefit as a result,

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.840
that was one of the ideas that
Julian Simon was an advocate

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.560
for.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.960
So if Simon sort of fell
out with conservatives

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.930
over his position
on immigration,

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.680
Ehrlich also had sort of
a complicated relationship

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.250
to liberals.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:02.480
And he came under attack
for being racist, being

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.720
anti-immigrant, those
types of questions

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.710
about what was his position.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.720
And actually during
the 1970s, he

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.680
spent a fair amount of his
time trying to defend himself

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:14.140
and to make the
case that there was

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:17.290
a rational basis for his
ideas about population control

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.370
and also control of immigration.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.880
So these are two books that
he published during the '70s.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.230
One, "The Race Bomb," which
basically said that race is,

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.600
from a biological perspective,
not a meaningful category.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.880
And so we shouldn't think
about racial differences.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.660
And "The Golden
Door," which analyzed

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.940
Mexican-American relations
and made the case

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.690
that we shouldn't blame Mexican
immigrants but at the same time

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.990
there was still a rational
basis or rational reason

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:43.590
for wanting to
limit immigration.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.090
So this was a lot
of his efforts was

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.972
trying to navigate those
complicated politics.

00:18:47.972 --> 00:18:50.180
Now, I wanted to give you
a bit of a taste of Ehrlich

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.590
and Simon.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:55.100
If it will work, I have
a little video here

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.870
to share just to give
you a bit of a sense

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:00.590
of their rhetorical styles
and some of their arguments.

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.685
So this is Ehrlich
in 1971, I believe,

00:19:03.685 --> 00:19:07.520
on an Australian television
show called "Monday Conference."

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.186
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:08.186 --> 00:19:11.620
-I wonder if we could
begin at the end in a way.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.550
One of the things that
Dr. Ehrlich is saying

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:19.350
is that things are so bad
that people should not

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:24.229
be allowed to have as many
children as they may now want.

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:25.270
What do we think of this?

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.730
Does anyone have a
comment on that or--

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.450
-While I'm very intrigued
by Dr. Ehrlich's concern

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.800
for the environment,
for our future,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.180
I'm quite appalled at the
"1984" style of society

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.260
that he postulates in his books.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:45.180
He would seem to cut right
across inalienable human rights

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:51.570
and demand that people be
legalized to produce children.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.360
He would tend to demand
that we limit our families

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.120
and, if people are
not willing to do this

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.550
by propaganda-- propaganda
principally aimed

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.700
at the impoverished people
and at the dark races--

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.750
he would introduce
legal sanctions.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.290
Having introduced
legal sanctions,

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.650
what legal penalties
for those who

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.840
disobey the law of the
scientists, compulsory abortion

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.985
or imprisonment?

00:20:12.985 --> 00:20:15.360
Well, let me first point out
that you have misrepresented

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.860
my views somewhat, although you
have come close in other areas.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.360
Like, one of the
things that we have

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.712
to face very clearly is
the question, if we do not

00:20:21.712 --> 00:20:23.920
solve this problem by finding
ways to change people's

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.780
attitudes, what
kinds of sanctions

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:29.215
might you impose that do
not bear differentially

00:20:29.215 --> 00:20:31.590
on the poor or the black or
the nations in the world that

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.040
are underdeveloped and so on?

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.120
And this is an area where the
questions are very difficult.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.062
And, actually, in many
ways, the best answer

00:20:41.062 --> 00:20:42.520
from the point of
view of democracy

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.970
seems to be an
across-the-board limitation

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.350
of family size to two children
unless the second birth is

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:50.890
a multiple birth.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.890
Now, you say these are
inalienable rights.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.605
A favorite sport of people is
to make up inalienable rights

00:20:56.605 --> 00:20:58.384
to fit their own preconceptions.

00:20:58.384 --> 00:20:59.800
I say there's an
inalienable right

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.990
to have grandchildren
that you'll

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:02.614
abrogate if you have
too many children.

00:21:02.614 --> 00:21:05.080
There's an inalienable
right to have clean air,

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.090
not to breathe poisons.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.020
There's an inalienable right
to have natural beauty,

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.740
to have enough food,
and so on, and so forth.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.525
now there was a time
when people thought

00:21:11.525 --> 00:21:13.900
it was an inalienable right
to have the number of spouses

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.114
that they chose to have.

00:21:15.114 --> 00:21:17.280
And certainly no government
could intervene on that,

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:19.696
but I believe the Australian
government intervenes on that

00:21:19.696 --> 00:21:22.170
inalienable right and restricts
you to one spouse at a time

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.690
and throws you probably
right into jail if you don't.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.760
So I suspect that
could easily happen

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.560
with the number of
children you have too.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.450
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:30.760
PAUL SABIN: So in addition
to the marvelous sideburns

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.990
that he is displaying
here, I think

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.590
there are another couple of
interesting elements of this.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.500
You can see here the rhetoric.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.770
We have to take action now
or disaster will come later.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.920
And sort of a grandiose
vision of that--

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:47.484
you're going to abrogate your
right to have grandchildren

00:21:47.484 --> 00:21:48.650
if we don't take action now.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.370
So it's a very stark portrayal.

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:54.020
You can see, again,
this issue of him

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.340
trying to develop a rational
basis for population control,

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.350
defending against the
criticism that this might

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:02.060
be racist or
inequitable and trying

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:05.445
to create a fair way to
have population control.

00:22:05.445 --> 00:22:06.820
And I think another
element there

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.420
that you can see here is just
the sharp rhetorical style,

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.600
the humor, the ability to
take convey the argument that

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.930
is quite compelling as
a presentation style.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.340
Now, here Ehrlich is
sporting sideburns.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.520
Here is Julian Simon
sporting his own flourish.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:28.039
He liked to wear these
plastic devil horns sometimes

00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:28.830
when he gave talks.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.700
It was kind of a
provocation of his audience.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.150
You portray me as the devil
with these terrible ideas

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:37.572
that I have and so I'm going
to stick it in your face

00:22:37.572 --> 00:22:38.780
by wearing these devil horns.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.150
I think it was also maybe a
bit of a defensive mechanism

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:42.860
that he used to protect himself.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.840
But here he is laying
out his arguments

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.100
for why he thinks we don't face
a threat of resource scarcity

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.780
and why he thinks
things are just

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.274
going to keep on getting better.

00:22:53.274 --> 00:22:54.190
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:56.710
-Every trend in
material human welfare

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.075
has been getting better
rather than worse.

00:22:59.075 --> 00:23:01.280
And as to the future, you
ask, would I bet on it?

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.350
The answer is, yes.

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.685
I will bet on it.

00:23:04.685 --> 00:23:08.140
I make this offer to any
prominent doom-sayer.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.560
You pick any measure of
material human welfare,

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.190
you pick any place in
the world, any country,

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.440
you pick any year in the
future, starting, say,

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.110
10 years from now so there's
time for things to happen,

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:26.240
and I'm prepared to bet that
that dimension that you pick,

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.460
that aspect of human
welfare you pick,

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:32.750
will show improvement relative
to now and not deterioration.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.300
Now, before we go
on, let me give you

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.210
the theory of how this could
possibly happen in a nutshell.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:45.177
And I'll repeat this
theory later on.

00:23:45.177 --> 00:23:46.260
The theory goes like this.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:50.060
You have more people,
you have higher income,

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.800
and that increases the
demand for resources.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.420
Increased demand for resources
means higher prices, either

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.150
actual or expected.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.840
Now that's as far as the
Malthusian theory goes,

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.030
but the economy
doesn't stop there.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.930
What happens is
that these expected

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:12.900
higher prices
represent opportunity.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.560
They represent
opportunity to businesses.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.710
Businesses say,
aha, higher prices.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.250
Greater opportunities
for profit.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.000
I'll get to work and see
if I can find some way

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.910
to increase my supply or
find substitutes or whatever.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.980
It also represents
opportunity for scientists,

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:32.830
who say, here's a chance for
me to make a discovery that

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.410
will help humanity, maybe
even get a Nobel Prize for it.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:37.510
So that's the theory.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:40.540
But one more bit.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:46.590
So people go to work looking for
ways to fill this opportunity.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.550
Most of them fail.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.840
They don't find
solutions to the problem,

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.000
but they pay the
price themselves.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.080
Eventually, some
people do succeed

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:01.100
in finding solutions
to these problems.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.540
And the extraordinary part is
that the solutions that they

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:09.310
find leave us better off
than if the problem had not

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.584
arisen in the first place.

00:25:11.584 --> 00:25:12.940
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:16.880
PAUL SABIN: So this is
Simon's response to Ehrlich.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.220
And some of this is some
basic economic theory,

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.080
ideas about technological
substitution, innovation,

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.840
the spur to investment, the
search for new resources.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.590
You also can see,
in Simon, he has

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.070
some of the same
rhetorical style

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.360
as Ehrlich in the sense of
a kind of combativeness.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:33.940
I'll bet you.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.250
I'll challenge you.

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:37.830
A similar aggressiveness.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:41.950
And also a tendency towards, not
just that things are generally

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.190
getting better, but an
extreme version of that

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.010
in which every
single thing is going

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.520
to be getting better
all across society.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:53.050
So that's a portrayal of Simon.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.655
And now I want to
turn now to what

00:25:54.655 --> 00:25:56.810
I think is an interesting
element of the story.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.510
So they make the bet in 1980.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:01.092
And that's actually only one
of the bets that's in my book.

00:26:01.092 --> 00:26:03.050
The second bet is the
other bet that the nation

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:06.450
was making in 1980 which was
the choice between Jimmy Carter

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.330
and Ronald Reagan in
the 1980 election.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.980
I think in interesting
ways, the arguments

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:14.580
between Ehrlich and
Simon actually line up

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:20.280
in striking ways with the
division between Carter

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.345
and Reagan.

00:26:21.345 --> 00:26:25.630
Now, Carter really brought
the Ehrlich perspective

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.450
into the White House
in a lot of ways.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.610
He embraced the idea of
conservation and limits.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.830
Here he is walking,
after his inauguration,

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:36.410
walking the distance
to the White House.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:41.350
And here installing the
solar panels on a roof

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:42.770
in the White House.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.180
And he talked about how,
even our great nation

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.620
has its recognized limits.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.970
More is not necessarily better.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:54.400
And he closely shared a lot of
the key philosophical elements,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.010
I think, of the 1970s
environmental sensibility.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.360
He had a passion for nature
as a child in Georgia.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.280
He had fished and
hunted in the streams.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:06.290
And, as governor, he had
protected a lot of open space

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:08.040
and tired to coordinate
regional planning

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.000
to be more rational
and more conserving.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.930
He had a moral righteousness
that Ehrlich also has,

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.790
a moral righteousness
about the need

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.110
to address human excess
and human wastefulness.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.530
And he had a conviction
that government planning

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.480
was the proper way to
respond and to address

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.080
social and
environmental planners.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.050
And Carter actually got his
start with regional planning

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.710
initiatives in
Georgia, and he brought

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.940
this idea of planning
to the White House.

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:40.770
He approached these
problems as a planner.

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.460
So in this particular,
he was focused

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:47.770
on the problem of energy
in the late 1970s.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.480
And he worried about how
the Americans were grossly

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.500
wasting our energy resources
and other materials

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.650
as though their
supply was infinite.

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.390
But we must face the
prospect of changing

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.640
our basic ways of living.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.250
And he expressed
this in similar terms

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.790
to Ehrlich, saying,
"this change will either

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.840
be made in our own initiative
in a planned or rational way.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.322
So that's Ehrlich's idea that
if you can take action now,

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:13.030
then we can avoid
problems in the future.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.180
"Or changes will
inevitably," he said,

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.890
"be forced on us with
chaos and suffering

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.700
by the inexorable
laws of nature,"

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:22.520
And so I think this
aligns in a lot

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.510
of ways with Ehrlich's ideas.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:27.060
And here, just to give you
a taste of Carter's take,

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.990
this is him talking about
energy in April '77, April 1977

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.394
speech addressed to the nation
on a proposed energy policy.

00:28:35.394 --> 00:28:36.060
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:39.110
-The energy crisis has
not yet overwhelmed us,

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:42.854
but it will if we
do not act quickly.

00:28:42.854 --> 00:28:44.270
It's a problem
that we will not be

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.860
able to solve in
the next few years.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:48.610
And it's likely to get
progressively worse

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.460
through the rest
of this century.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.150
We must not be
selfish or timid if we

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.450
hope to have a decent
world for our children

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:59.190
and our grandchildren.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.890
We simply must balance
our demand for energy

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.030
with our rapidly
shrinking resources.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.680
By acting now, we can
control our future

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.530
instead of letting
the future control us.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.420
Two days from now, I will
present to the Congress

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.480
my energy proposals.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.780
Its members will be my
partners and they have already

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.270
given me a great deal
of valuable advice.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.780
Many of these proposals
will be unpopular.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.200
Some will cause you to
put up with inconveniences

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.014
and to make sacrifices.

00:29:30.014 --> 00:29:31.930
The most important thing
about these proposals

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:37.630
is that the alternative may
be a national catastrophe.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.270
Further delay can affect
our strength and our power

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:42.040
as a nation.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.130
Our decision about
energy will test

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:46.389
the character of
the American people

00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:48.430
and the ability of the
president and the Congress

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.440
to govern this nation.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:53.790
This difficult effort will
be the moral equivalent.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.570
of war.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:55.403
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:55.403 --> 00:29:56.980
PAUL SABIN: So this
is Carter warning

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.540
about national catastrophe.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.360
He worried that the US
was going to run out

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.960
of oil reserves in the
1980s and that disaster

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.690
was right around the corner.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:10.530
And this was sort of-- the
image that Carter presented

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:12.030
to the country
was one of limits,

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:14.990
of the need for
sacrifice, and the need

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.880
to address this with planning.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.350
And that was something
that Ronald Reagan strongly

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:23.520
objected to and came in
resisting that, running

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.600
for office on the promise
of American greatness.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.870
And he to a significant
extent, I think,

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:32.920
sang to the tune
of Julian Simon.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.320
The idea that resource
limits weren't real,

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.790
that they wouldn't
constrain America's future.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.880
And this announcement for his
candidacy for the White House--

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.310
I think it's striking
how much he focused

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:48.830
in terms of the rationale
for his candidacy

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:52.660
on the predictions that
the United States faced

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.670
limits and doom and constraints.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:31:02.960
And I wanted to share with you
this clip from his announcement

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.236
of the candidacy in 1979.

00:31:05.236 --> 00:31:06.056
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:06.056 --> 00:31:07.680
-Now there are those
in our land today,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.670
however, who would have
us believe that the United

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.970
States, like other great
civilizations of the past,

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:16.120
has reached the
zenith of its power,

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.840
that we're weak and fearful,
reduced to bickering

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.010
with each other and no
longer possessed of the will

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:24.400
to cope with our problems.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.455
Much of this talk
has come from leaders

00:31:27.455 --> 00:31:30.780
who claim that our problems
are too difficult to handle.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.820
We're supposed to meekly
accept their failures

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.580
as the most which
can humanly be done.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.470
They tell us we must
learn to live with less

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.140
and teach our children that
their lives will be less

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.500
full and prosperous
than ours have been,

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.880
that the America
of the coming years

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.550
will be a place where,
because of our past excesses,

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.920
it will be impossible
to dream and make

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.560
those dreams come true.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.760
I don't believe that, and I
don't believe you do either.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.450
That's why I'm seeking
the presidency.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:06.400
I cannot and will not stand
by and see this great country

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.470
destroy itself.

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:11.390
Our leaders attempt to blame
their failures on circumstances

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.500
beyond their control,
on false estimates

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.510
by unknown unidentifiable
experts who

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.040
rewrite modern
history in an attempt

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.810
to convince us our high
standard of living--

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:25.030
the result of thrift
and hard work--

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.940
is somehow selfish
extravagance which

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.520
we must renounce as we
join in sharing scarcity.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.460
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.918
PAUL SABIN: Now, Reagan doesn't
specify who these anonymous

00:32:35.918 --> 00:32:39.410
experts are, but I would argue
that he's referring to people

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.590
like Paul Ehrlich and also the
authors of the 1972 book "The

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:46.120
Limits to Growth" who had
run these computer models

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.720
of resources and the economy
and population and said that--

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.880
in a similar story to
Ehrlich's-- that we were going

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:58.240
to have a population overshoot
and then a collapse more

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.480
or less right around
now or in another decade

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.810
or so in the 21st century.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.670
So Reagan came in
and he used this

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:12.740
is new idea about how we
didn't face fundamental limits

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.490
or scarcity as a
rationale, a justification,

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.200
for regulatory relief.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.380
He set up a vice presidential
commission on regulatory relief

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.710
and instructed the Office
of Management and Budget

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.780
to apply new tests
to try to do what

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.150
David Stockman, the head
of the budget office,

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:34.000
said was a regulatory
ventilation, was the language.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.794
But the idea was really
to try to reversal

00:33:35.794 --> 00:33:38.210
a lot of the regulations that
had been passed in the '70s.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:44.110
And so the bipartisanship
era of environmental policy

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.126
was truly over at this point.

00:33:46.126 --> 00:33:47.500
The environmental
groups attacked

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.200
Reagan and I think
the partisanship

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.200
that we have come to see
really settled in quite fully.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:58.060
And it centered in some ways
I think on the questions that

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.190
were at the heart of the
Ehrlich and Simon bet

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:04.450
which is, does the
US, does the planet,

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:06.240
face an environmental crisis?

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.840
Were we running out of resources
and compelled to conserve?

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:16.159
And what were the natural
limits of American growth?

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.969
So in October
1990, Julian Simon,

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:22.780
having moved to Maryland,
picked up his mail and opened up

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.750
and there was a sheet
of metal prices in there

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:28.429
with a check for $576.07.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:30.179
And there was no
note, but it was

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.699
clear the check was
from Paul Ehrlich

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:35.790
to settle the bet on the metals.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.409
The metals fallen, on
average, by around 50%,

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.579
so Simon prevailing
across the board.

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:44.870
And it's interesting to think
about why that turned out

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:46.409
to be the case.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:52.030
In part, it was the collapse
of oil prices after 1979,

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.780
but you also had all
these different kinds

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.880
of everyday market forces which
were the very kinds of things

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.470
that Simon and other
economists had talked about,

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:03.080
the substitution of new
technologies like fiber

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.320
optic cables and satellites
for copper wires,

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.090
the breakup of the
tin cartel, which

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:11.800
had propped up tin prices.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.960
And when it collapsed, the
prices fell through the floor.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.470
You had new sources
of supply that

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.950
were brought on because higher
prices stimulated people

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.040
to go out to search
for new mines.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.350
You had the break up
of labor conflicts

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.980
that had sent prices
higher in the late '70s,

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.810
and then when those
conflicts were resolved,

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:30.210
prices went down.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:32.060
So in all these
different ways, you

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.940
had these everyday market
forces, the kinds of things

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.970
that Simon had talked about.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:45.110
But even more generally than
the prices of metal-- the thing

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.230
to note is the
worldwide population

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.500
had grown by 800 million
during this period,

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:55.650
from a from 4.5 to
5.3 billion people,

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.950
to date the largest
increase over a decade.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:06.250
And yet the metal
prices had still fallen.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:08.000
More broadly, in
thinking about the bet--

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.260
so the bet was a proxy for
a larger bet, which is,

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.380
what was going to be
the fate of humanity?

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.460
Measures of human
health and human wealth

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:18.960
also have increased over
time during that time period

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.920
and on up until the
present time as well.

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.160
I don't if any of you have
ever seen Hans Roslings

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.240
interesting videos about
human history in four minutes.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.780
He has this great video in which
he explains the improvements

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:36.650
in health and wealth over the
last couple hundred years.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:39.930
So at first glance, the results
of the Ehrlich Simon bet

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.740
seem to suggest a
simple story line.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:44.180
There's a clear winner
and a clear loser.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:47.630
And the bet itself quickly
became a symbolic weapon

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.820
in battles between
conservatives and liberals

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.710
over environmental
policy, saying, look,

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.440
Simon won this bet
so environmentalists

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.075
are wrong about this
and everything else.

00:36:57.075 --> 00:36:59.500
And so this is the
reason for opposing

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.090
all different kinds
of regulation.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.595
And so is it a symbol
of its symbolic value.

00:37:04.595 --> 00:37:06.720
The Competitive Enterprise
Institute, for instance,

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.130
today awards a Julian
Simon award for someone

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:14.990
who is contributing to our
appreciation of the powers

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.850
of human ingenuity
and innovation.

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:22.670
And the award is
a leaf-- I'm not

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:24.837
sure what the main
part of the leaf

00:37:24.837 --> 00:37:26.420
is made of-- but the
veins of the leaf

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:30.170
are the five metals from
the Ehrlich Simon bet

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:36.160
so it's sort of just the
symbolic power of the bet

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:36.840
itself.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.430
But I think that
story of Simon wins,

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.120
Ehrlich loses is too simple
an interpretation of this bet

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.986
and of the larger clash
between Ehrlich and Simon.

00:37:46.986 --> 00:37:48.610
Because while measures
of human welfare

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:52.850
have improved in recent
decades, the planet's ecosystems

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.620
are also under more
stress than ever before.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:57.120
You have global
temperatures rising,

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.490
fish stocks being depleted.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.790
And the quest to meet the
resource demands to avoid

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.350
facing scarcity have pushed
us into more and more risky

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:08.150
practices, from blowing up
the mountains of Appalachia

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.220
in mountaintop removal mining
or going out into deep water oil

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.536
drilling leading to the
disastrous spill that

00:38:14.536 --> 00:38:16.160
took place in the
Gulf, a whole variety

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:20.560
of different challenges-- risks
that we're taking in order

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:25.991
to avoid the scarcity that
Ehrlich like was warning of.

00:38:25.991 --> 00:38:27.490
Ehrlich and his
allies have insisted

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:29.600
that the bet doesn't
prove anything.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.772
He says Julian Simon is like
the guy who jumps off the Empire

00:38:32.772 --> 00:38:34.730
State Building and says
how great everything is

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:39.180
as he passes the 10th floor
of the building going down.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.780
So Simon's actual
victory of the bet

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.440
also has come under
attack because economists

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.940
have gone back and
they have charted

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.630
the prices of metals
going back to 1900.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.240
And they found that
actually if you

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:54.140
were to run this bet in
1900 to 1910, 1901 to 1911,

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.120
Ehrlich actually would
have won more times

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.220
than he would have lost.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:01.310
So the idea that Simon's
victory between 1980 1990

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:03.530
symbolizes that
prices of resources

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:05.050
are always going
to go down, that's

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.320
actually not borne out over
the course of this history.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.570
But this data,
though, also, I think,

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:17.420
is complicated because it
doesn't show either a clear

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.616
rise or a clear drop
over the period of time.

00:39:20.616 --> 00:39:21.990
And, in fact, most
of the reasons

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.370
why Ehrlich would have
won over this time period

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.720
is the recovery from
the tremendous collapse

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.230
in commodity prices after World
War I and then, eventually,

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:36.070
the recovery of those prices.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.420
I think what it
suggests most of all

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.480
is how unreliable
commodity prices are

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.740
as a proxy for trying to
assess either the well

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.475
being of humanity or the state
of the planet's ecosystems.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:55.000
So instead of being a
simple morality tale,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.540
I think that the story of
Ehrlich and Simon's bet

00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.250
reveals limitations
on both sides

00:39:59.250 --> 00:40:00.895
of the environmental debate.

00:40:00.895 --> 00:40:03.420
And I think the stark
framing that both men

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.260
chose has made a
productive conversation

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.390
about environmental problems
even more difficult.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:13.150
And rather than choose between
these competing perspectives,

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:14.827
what I think that
we need to do is

00:40:14.827 --> 00:40:16.910
to wrestle with the tensions
and the uncertainties

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:20.130
that they raise and to try to
gain from the insights that

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:22.880
come from both the
economic side and also

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.910
the insights of the biologists.

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:29.490
So I wanted to close
with a few lessons

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:34.052
that I think each side of this
conversation might take away.

00:40:34.052 --> 00:40:36.510
One of the main lessons for
environmentalists from the bet,

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:40.431
I think, is the power of human
adaptability and creativity.

00:40:40.431 --> 00:40:41.930
So environmentalists
have often been

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:45.480
prone to these kinds of
pessimistic predictions

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.420
about the terrible catastrophe
there's right around the corner

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.420
if we don't take action.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:54.924
That has been the rhetoric of
many like Ehrlich since 1960s

00:40:54.924 --> 00:40:57.090
or you could say it even
goes back further to people

00:40:57.090 --> 00:41:02.340
like Malthus much earlier.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:06.840
But I think that
this clearly has not

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.660
been the case in recent times.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:11.850
And I think that the
environmental community

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:14.190
has to figure out how to
wrestle with that contradiction

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.174
of the disaster not
having come yet.

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:18.590
And what does that
mean for how we

00:41:18.590 --> 00:41:20.930
think about
environmental problems?

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:25.110
And these sweeping apocalyptic
pronouncements themselves

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.010
also carry risks
because they make

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:31.720
it more difficult to achieve
pragmatic policy making.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.350
If you're warning of
the end of civilization,

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.510
it makes it very hard to come
up with a pragmatic solution

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:42.890
around emissions trading,
around pollution credits,

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.330
for instance, things like that.

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.510
And I think that the
dire rhetoric also

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.630
makes it very difficult
for the followers of people

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:52.930
like Ehrlich to be willing
to accept compromise

00:41:52.930 --> 00:42:00.060
and to be willing
to-- it creates

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.490
unrealistic expectations
of what policies are going

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.890
to accomplish in a
short period of time.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:07.480
The second inside I think
for the environmental side

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.910
of this debate is
the way in which

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:12.880
the debate itself--
overpopulation growth

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.030
and resource scarcity-- has
a legacy and it matters.

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:20.440
Because a lot of the
skepticism towards climate

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.450
change that you
see today I think

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:25.830
is fueled in part by the
legacy of these past debates

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.830
over resource scarcity
and population growth.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.710
And people say,
look, Ehrlich was

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.354
wrong about the predictions.
"The Limits of Growth,"

00:42:32.354 --> 00:42:33.020
they were wrong.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:33.970
They said we were
going to run out

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.320
of all these things by
all these previous dates.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:39.490
We didn't run out
of oil in the 1980s.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:42.140
Pollution's gotten
better rather than worse.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.620
All these different
ways-- predictions

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:51.010
have not come true as were
expected or were predicted.

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:54.360
And so therefore we're now going
to doubt these new predictions.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.955
So there's a lack
of credibility.

00:42:56.955 --> 00:43:00.770
And I think that,
for environmentalists

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.360
to understand the people who
they call climate deniers,

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.600
I think it's useful to
wrestle with this history,

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:12.040
these debates over and kind of
to think a little bit more--

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.540
again the empathy
that I was talking

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.206
about the beginning of the talk,
of trying to understand why you

00:43:16.206 --> 00:43:20.046
would see such skepticism
around the science.

00:43:20.046 --> 00:43:22.420
And I'm not saying that's the
only reason for skepticism.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.400
There are many factors
going on but I believe

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.790
that wrestling with this
history of this debate

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:32.780
is really-- has an impact
on our debate today.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.150
So now for conservative
followers of Julian Simon,

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.990
I think there are also
important lessons, one of which

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:43.700
is just that past success is not
a guarantee of future success.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:47.680
And I think this often is
not adequately appreciated,

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.240
that our ability to adapt to
greater numbers of people,

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.040
our ability to find
new energy resources,

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:56.537
those don't necessarily
mean that we

00:43:56.537 --> 00:43:58.120
are going to be able
to find solutions

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.810
to the threat of climate change.

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:05.490
And so just to assume that just
because we solved something

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.227
in the past doesn't
mean we're going

00:44:07.227 --> 00:44:08.310
to solve it in the future.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:11.920
And I think that extends
to the second insight which

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.270
is that climate change is
different from population

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.480
growth.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.771
These aren't the same problems.

00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:19.620
And so to say that we addressed
the growth of population,

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.840
we were able to meet the
needs of growing population

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.830
doesn't necessarily have
similar implications for climate

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:25.350
change.

00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:27.700
Climate change is a
very specific problem.

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.810
We're putting too much
of too many chemicals

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.120
in the atmosphere.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.540
In my view, it's a
pollution problem.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.310
Whereas population growth
is a very diffuse issue.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:39.570
There's many different
ways to feed people,

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:44.010
to meet their energy needs, to
adapt to the diffuse pressures

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:48.800
that more people put
on land and resources.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.540
And those are in the marketplace
because people are out there

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.890
trying to consume things
and they're making demands

00:44:55.890 --> 00:44:58.060
and the marketplace
responds to those demands.

00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.060
And so the forces that
Julian Simon talked about,

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.790
these market forces, can
respond to population growth.

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:06.570
Whereas climate change
is, by very definition,

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.270
it's outside of the marketplace
or it has been today.

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:12.000
And until it is brought
within the marketplace,

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.646
those kinds of forces that
Simon's followers love to tout

00:45:16.646 --> 00:45:18.770
aren't really being brought
to bear on the problem.

00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:20.820
And that brings me
to the third insight

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:24.240
I think that should be
shared with Simon's followers

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.100
which is that you
can't solve problems

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.430
unless you acknowledge them.

00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.990
So Julian Simon in
that video I shared

00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:33.897
made the case that
problems rise up,

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:35.480
we create solutions
to those problems,

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.063
and then we're better
off than before.

00:45:37.063 --> 00:45:39.494
But that's only if you
recognize that a problem exists.

00:45:39.494 --> 00:45:41.910
Because if you don't recognize
that a problem like climate

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.820
change exists, then you're not
bringing any of these forces

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.620
to bear on solving the problem.

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:50.120
And all of the science and
technology and innovation

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.330
that may very well be able to
address the problem of climate

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:56.430
change are not being
brought into play.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:01.190
And so I think that this is one
of the fundamental limitations,

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:02.760
I think, of the
Simon perspective,

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.910
which is that the very optimism
about the future itself

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:12.660
becomes an inhibiting the
bringing about of that future

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.130
because an obstacle
to innovation.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:20.140
So now I want to return to my
first themes about listening

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.710
and empathy and
complexity and questions,

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:27.300
the kinds of learning I think
that history has to offer.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:32.364
Because I think too often,
on both sides of this debate,

00:46:32.364 --> 00:46:33.780
both sides of this
debate have not

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.450
been willing to
listen to each other.

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:39.310
Ehrlich has bluntly
stated, including recently

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:43.410
in discussion of the
bet in an interview,

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.580
that there's nothing to
learn from this story other

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:50.330
than that it's a bad
idea to make bets.

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:53.860
It was ill advised but he says
that it doesn't necessarily

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:57.564
signify anything about what's
happening in the future.

00:46:57.564 --> 00:46:59.230
And on the other hand,
Simon's followers

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:01.390
act as if winning
this 10 year bet

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:03.820
signifies you're always
going to win the bet.

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.490
There will never
be any problems.

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:07.360
We're going to solve
all the problems.

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.360
And just because we
solved things in the past,

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.710
no problems are going to come
up that we can't address.

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:16.290
So I think both
of these positions

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.630
are simplistic and wrong.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.970
And that rather than
embrace either Ehrlich

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:23.640
or Simon, what we
need to do is try

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.390
to learn from their
insights, learn

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:29.050
from both the tremendous
capacity for human adaptability

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.800
and innovation, which Simon
I think give us insights

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.210
into, and also the fragility
of the planet and the ways

00:47:36.210 --> 00:47:39.780
in which humans are transforming
the planet in more and more

00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.710
intense ways and
try to figure out

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.960
how do we reconcile
and incorporate

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.310
these different things into a
coherent vision of the future.

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:48.810
That's really I
believe what history

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:52.290
has to offer in part is
this capacity for synthesis.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:55.500
And I think that, ultimately,
neither biology nor economics

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.070
have the definitive answers
because, if you take

00:47:59.070 --> 00:48:03.270
the logic of these two men,
humans might survive along

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:06.670
the lines of Simon and we
might even prosper economically

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:10.210
and in our health
while we also transform

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:14.560
the planet in many of the ways
that Ehrlich has predicted.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.780
So one of the
questions may be, then,

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.970
do we want to live in
a more biologically

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:25.670
impoverished planet but more
economically productive planet?

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:29.990
So both these things could be
happening at the same time.

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.710
So one lesson I think
from my story here

00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:33.420
is that humanities
course ultimately

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.490
is going to be determined
less by the iron

00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:37.910
laws of nature that
Ehrlich liked to celebrate

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:43.230
or the unbounded market powers
that Simon embraced and more

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:46.280
by the social and political
choices that we have to make.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.860
And what we're faced
with is not a question

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:53.810
of biology or economics in
looking into the future,

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:55.370
but it's really
a social question

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.580
about what kind of planet
do we want to live in.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.580
And that, I think, is a
fundamentally an ethical

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.300
question, and
that's really what I

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:03.740
hope that we need to
take away from this story

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.610
is how to wrestle
with that question

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:09.620
and bring it back and take any
insights from Ehrlich and Simon

00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.619
to address those issues.

00:49:11.619 --> 00:49:13.160
So thank you very
much for listening,

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.750
and happy to take any
questions that you might

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:19.400
have about this
about this subject.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:25.224 --> 00:49:26.890
AUDIENCE: It seems a
little ironic to me

00:49:26.890 --> 00:49:31.510
that one of the things
that made the solution

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:34.030
to this particular
question about population

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:37.490
actually is the source of
the next problem we have.

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:41.780
The incredible increase in
use of energy in the planet

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.740
helped with a lot
of things that made

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:47.770
it possible to feed, clothe,
and otherwise equip a larger

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:51.290
population because energy
has played a role everywhere.

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:54.660
I mean, we turn energy
into food in this country.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.620
And so it's very interesting
that the solution

00:49:58.620 --> 00:50:00.470
to an argument between
two people about two

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.910
different points of view creates
a new type of problem for which

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.420
neither of their arguments
actually applies all that well

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:07.890
and yet it looks
kind of similar.

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:09.014
PAUL SABIN: Right.

00:50:09.014 --> 00:50:10.180
I think that's a good point.

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.080
And you're right to
point energy as being

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:19.140
the key element in a lot of ways
in thinking about the future.

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.500
Because energy is-- even
we think about water

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:25.700
as being a key issue, but energy
is the key behind desalination

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:30.160
issues, for instance, to
what extent that is viable.

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:33.770
So I think you're right.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.870
So there are actually
three bets in my book.

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.240
So one is the little
bet about metal prices,

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.740
the second is the bet on
the Carter Reagan election,

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:43.140
but the third bet is the
bet about the future.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:48.340
And so it's really a
grand historical question.

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:52.170
So are we coming to the
end of an age, fueled

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:54.070
in part by abundant
sources of energy

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:55.802
and our dependence
on fossil fuels,

00:50:55.802 --> 00:50:57.260
which is what
Ehrlich would argue--

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.867
we're coming to
the end of the boom

00:50:58.867 --> 00:51:01.450
and we're going to hit the crash
and this can't be sustained--

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:05.270
or is this a path that we
can continue into the future?

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:09.710
And I think that there
are interesting arguments

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:11.540
on both sides of that
question in terms

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.900
of how-- and the technology,
it's uncertain about how

00:51:14.900 --> 00:51:17.146
the technology is going to
unfold in terms pf to what

00:51:17.146 --> 00:51:19.520
extent we're going be able to
move away from fossil fuels

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:25.990
to find sufficient other energy
sources to meet our needs.

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:28.770
AUDIENCE: I see the radically
different views of these men

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:33.090
and how they've affected our
political discourse and vice

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:34.510
versa.

00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:37.040
I read the Club of Rome
Report, "Limits to Growth,"

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.990
and all of that and scared the
hell out of me a long time ago.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:46.040
Do you see a way that we can
bring our political discourse

00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:53.750
in this country and worldwide
to a more cooperative way

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.770
of addressing problems rather
than being diametrically

00:51:56.770 --> 00:51:58.390
opposed?

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:02.580
Dianne Feinstein versus
the senator from Oklahoma.

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:07.620
They're never going to
get together, but how can

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:10.960
we move in that
direction of cooperation,

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.890
focusing on solutions?

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:17.090
Well that's a difficult
question and is really

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:18.970
a fundamental
question of the day.

00:52:18.970 --> 00:52:22.400
I mean, as a historian,
one of my hopes

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.420
is to contribute
to that by sharing

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:28.080
this history of the
past debate in the hopes

00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.290
that people can find
their way towards a more

00:52:31.290 --> 00:52:33.870
productive conversation and be
able to listen to each other

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:34.570
better.

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:37.020
But I think that
that's very optimistic

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.470
to think that a book
is going to do that.

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:42.760
My own feeling about the
current state of affairs

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:50.170
is that we're in a
specific moment in time.

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:54.480
And I really am actually
optimistic that we will not

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.300
be stuck in this
deadlock forever.

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.560
My own feeling is that political
sentiment and popular sentiment

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:07.350
around the question of climate
at some point will break.

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:12.830
And at that point, it will move
into a pragmatic conversation

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:17.180
around adaptation,
around different kinds

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.470
of policies, pros and cons
of different strategies

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:22.330
and approaches that
will be more productive.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.620
Not to say that it's
ever going to become easy

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:28.070
but that it will be a more
pragmatic conversation, that we

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:29.900
won't be stuck in this
particular moment.

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:37.400
I don't feel that the current
political constellation

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:42.090
is tenable as a
permanent status quo.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:45.700
Both the resistance to
the science of climate

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:48.986
and resistance to
the ways in which

00:53:48.986 --> 00:53:50.610
it appears that the
climate is changing

00:53:50.610 --> 00:53:55.062
around us and the change
over generations of people

00:53:55.062 --> 00:53:56.770
and the different
ideas-- so I'm actually

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.686
cautiously optimistic
that things will change.

00:53:58.686 --> 00:54:00.520
Whether it will
change in time for us

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:05.070
to make a significant impact
on carbon emissions is unclear.

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:09.160
But I have optimism actually
about the political debate

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:12.480
to some extent, modest optimism.

00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.910
Thanks so much for coming.

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:18.316
[APPLAUSE]
