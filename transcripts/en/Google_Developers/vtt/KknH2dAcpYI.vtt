KELLY SANTIAGO: Thanks so
much for joining us today

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:03.900
to talk about
Tango and what it's

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.430
like to work on the
platform and why

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.600
our developers find it important
to build on the platform.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.330
So just as a little background--
so I'm Kelley Santiago.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.650
I co-founded an independent game
development studio years ago

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.870
called That Game Company.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.610
Then I worked at the Android--
thank you-- Android-based

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.815
console Ouya.

00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.550
Little woo?

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.820
Mini woo?

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.900
Working with developers.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.580
And now I'm super
excited to be working

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:37.910
with even more pioneering
developers on our new projects

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.740
under the Google VR banner.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.820
So Project Tango is a
platform that gives developers

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.325
the abilities to build apps that
understand space and motions.

00:00:48.325 --> 00:00:50.320
Over the past 2 and
1/2 years, we've

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.170
had over 6,000 developers
building applications ranging

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.029
from interactive games that
you may have checked out

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:58.695
in the Sandbox-- and
if you haven't, you

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:03.560
should totally check them out--
to tools to help architects.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.850
We are really fortunate
to have with us

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.060
today a group of
Project Tango developers

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.010
building very different apps.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.720
So with that, I'm actually going
to let them-- because it is I/O

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.931
and I feel like you're here to
hear from developers and people

00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:18.930
working on the platform.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.530
So I'm going to let the
panelists introduce themselves

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.616
and talk a little bit about
what brought them to Tango

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:25.782
and what they're working on.

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:30.720
JOEL PENNINGTON:
I'm Joel Pennington,

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.030
and I work at Autodesk.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.610
And my job is to take
technology from the film, game,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.840
and TV industry and bring
it to the hands of folks

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.410
in the other industries that
Autodesk creates software for.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.740
And that manifests itself
in visualization tools today

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.160
for architects, engineers,
construction professionals--

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.690
folks that build anything.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.250
It's part of our future
of making things movement.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.980
And what we're doing today
with the Tango tablet

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.360
is we're giving the amazing
film production tools that you

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.430
get if you're creating Avatar
in the form factor of a tablet

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.440
that everyone gets
and understands

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.070
and deliver it to an architect
to let him or her explain

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.640
their design to their clients
in a way that was never

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.559
possible before.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:24.350
ROBIN HUNICKE: All
right, I'm Robin Hunicke

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.900
I am the co-founder of
Funomena here in San Francisco.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.550
I actually worked
at That Game Company

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.470
with Kelly on a
game called Journey,

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.430
and then afterwards, I came
back up to the Bay Area

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.630
because I love it here
and founded this company.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.110
And my background is in
artificial intelligence

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.960
and robotics.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.210
I worked on the Sims and some
other simulation-based games

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.750
before moving into
what we call deep games

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.130
or emotionally-based games, of
which Journey is an example.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.640
And I'm really interested
in the intersection

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.340
between new technologies
and game development.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.300
And so Tango is one
of the many projects

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.160
that we work on at Funomena that
push our boundaries in terms

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.960
of understanding leading
edge technologies, things

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.090
that are new, new ways of
approaching the space of play.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.700
And specifically what I liked
about Tango is the ability

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.880
to build a world-- the thing
that we work on is called

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.830
woorld, w-o-o-r-l-d and it
is in the Sandbox area--

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.220
with other people by passing
this view port around

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.670
and seeing the world from
a different perspective.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.580
And so the best
thing about it is

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.380
that it lets me work with
my designer Keita Takahashi.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.990
He's most famous for
developing Katamari Damacy

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.940
and letting his irreverent
understanding of the world

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.670
become real through this lens.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.300
So it's been a really
fantastic experience.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.950
KYLE NEL: Cool.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.370
I'm Kyle and I don't
have a cool intro song,

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.700
but I'll work on that.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.161
I'm Kyle Nel, and I'm
the executive director

00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:53.410
of the Lowe's Innovation Labs.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.210
And Lowe's Home Improvement--
it's a big Fortune 50 North

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.460
American home
improvement company.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.580
So our group, we build
stuff you wouldn't

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.149
expect a Lowe's to build with
people you wouldn't expect

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:06.690
us to build it with,
and I think this

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.440
is a great example of that.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.140
We've done a lot of
other things too,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.920
but this one, in particular,
is a persistent problem--

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.910
a customer problem.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.620
Has anyone done a home remodel?

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.800
A lot of sad nods.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.630
It's really hard, and one
of the biggest problems

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.990
is not having the inability
to buy the thing you want.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.690
It's really the
visualization and trying

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.030
to understand how a
lot of different things

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.480
could happen in your
space and then communicate

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.870
that with the
other person that's

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.120
making that decision with
you-- your significant other

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.850
or whoever.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.806
And that inability to
get that out of your head

00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:42.180
or to understand what it will
look like just stops people

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.390
from doing projects,
and that really, really

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.281
hampers what we're
trying to help people

00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:49.280
do, which is improve their
homes and help people

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.071
wherever they live.

00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:52.630
So Tango is uniquely
situated and suited

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.250
to be able to meet that need,
and we're really, really

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.230
excited to be part
of this group.

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.890
JESSE SHELL: Hi,
I'm Jesse Shell.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.580
Formally, I was the creative
director of the Disney Virtual

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.250
Reality Studio back in the 90s.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.530
For the past dozen
years or so, I've

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.750
been teaching at Carnegie Mellon
and running a place called

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.280
Shell Games out of
Pittsburgh, which

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.940
is a team of about 100
game developers doing

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.840
all kinds of things.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.960
We were first drawn to Tango
because part of what we do

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.460
are interactive theme
park installations,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.770
interactive museum exhibits.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.940
We love this idea of being
able to mix digital with space.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.500
And while that was initially
what we were completely focused

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.180
on, we quickly found
that, wow, there

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.384
are a lot of just super fun
game things you can do with it.

00:05:40.384 --> 00:05:42.300
Because we're always on
the lookout for things

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.415
that are magical, and we were
really pleased at how magical

00:05:45.415 --> 00:05:49.325
the Tango technology can be.

00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:50.200
KELLY SANTIAGO: Cool.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.820
So Robin, I was hoping
you could kick it off

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.541
with talking about what's been
a surprising challenge for you?

00:06:01.541 --> 00:06:04.040
And then maybe that will inspire
some of the other panelists

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.247
to weigh in as well.

00:06:05.247 --> 00:06:06.080
ROBIN HUNICKE: Sure.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.650
So the thing that I'm really
interested in right now

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.180
is that VR and AR technologies
really involve two things.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.434
They involve the body and
our perception of reality.

00:06:17.434 --> 00:06:19.600
And you can think of those
things as the same thing,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.350
but there's the
physical embodiment

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.650
of motion and the
activity that you do when

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.637
you're in a VR or an AR space.

00:06:25.637 --> 00:06:27.470
And then there's also
the way that your body

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.330
interprets signals that are
coming into it to turn it

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.220
into reality.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.480
And so one of the
biggest challenges for me

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.230
personally with
augmented reality

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.052
is that unlike an experience
where you're cutting out

00:06:39.052 --> 00:06:40.760
all of the world, you
have to really work

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.230
alongside the world.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.700
And if you're a designer
type of person like me,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.010
you are particular about
how things look and feel.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.450
And so building
something that has

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.350
a real aesthetic,
like a feeling,

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.680
but also having it be able to
work in any kind of environment

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.410
with any number of ugly
pieces of furniture

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.930
or random detritus
on the table--

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.920
that sort of stuff--
for me, it just

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.950
gnaws at my designer
sensibilities.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.240
And so one of the
things that we found

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.640
challenging when we first
started working with Tango was

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.140
how do we build a consistent
aesthetic experience that

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.860
looks cool and feels like it
came from Keita's imagination,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.490
for example?

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.530
Because he has a very classic
and interesting style.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.990
His work is in the Museum of
Modern Art in New York City.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.880
He's a well-known designer.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.440
How do we take that
design aesthetic

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.280
and put it out into spaces
that could maybe be completely

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.640
cluttered or totally empty?

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.860
And what was really
interesting was that getting

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.290
past that challenge, we were
able to think about the fact

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.970
that we don't need
to design everything.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.010
What we really need to
do is design the space

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.560
just in front of you--
the attentional activity

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.050
that you're interested in.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.660
Give you a sound cue, draw
your attention somewhere else.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.490
And so it started to give us a
different surface to design on.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.807
We started thinking a
lot more about the body

00:07:57.807 --> 00:08:00.390
and the attention of the body
as we interacted with the space.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.980
So it was a challenge, but
it was also eye opening.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.270
And I think, honestly,
it has made us all better

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.420
developers at Funomena.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.610
KELLY SANTIAGO: How about Joel?

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:16.330
JOEL PENNINGTON: Well, when
we take a look at the way

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.560
that directors today create
films in the virtual production

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.080
world, we've solved
many of the problems

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.330
around interacting with a world
that doesn't physically exist.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:33.020
And the challenge
for us was taking

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.220
that, which is million dollar
equipment, hundreds of people

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.320
working in the background, and
putting that onto the Tango

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.809
tablet and making it work for an
architect who doesn't know how

00:08:43.809 --> 00:08:45.950
to make a film, doesn't
know about film production

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.190
technologies, but is able to
communicate the design idea.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.160
And when we worked with
the folks at Tango,

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.160
we were able to enlist a
number of charter architects

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.300
that let us develop
this in concert

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.160
and create a research platform
at Autodesk that allows us

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.910
to fully visualize
and experiment

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:11.272
with this new way of
interacting with your designs.

00:09:11.272 --> 00:09:13.730
KELLY SANTIAGO: So what I think
would be really interesting

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.860
is to talk about-- you've
all been working with this

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.720
in the field now for
a bit and probably

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.670
have some learnings from
focus testing and user

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.000
testing that you've been doing.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.620
What are some surprising things?

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.450
Maybe Kyle, you
can start us off?

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.020
KYLE NEL: My background is
in applied neuroscience.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.561
So there's two sides
of neuroscience.

00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:34.140
There's the physician
side, and then there's

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.850
the hardware / software nerds.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:40.200
You probably can fit
which one I was in.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.510
So anyway, one of the
things we built early on

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.310
at Lowe's surprisingly was an
applied neuroscience company.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.560
So we actually put
high rez EEG headsets

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.390
on people and eye-tracking
goggles and we tested.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.000
And Tango-- our
application of Tango--

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.500
is not our first venture into
virtual and augmented reality.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.990
We've done a number of things.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:58.945
Net platform we call
the hollow room.

00:09:58.945 --> 00:10:01.570
So we've been testing different
iterations, including Cardboard

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.600
and others, using applied
neuroscience, which

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.996
is far better-- as
a social scientist,

00:10:07.996 --> 00:10:09.620
a far better thing
than asking somebody

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.260
what they thought of it only.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.960
Or did you see the
button on the left?

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.820
Because then you're
biasing the response.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.220
And so we could see
very quickly what

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.610
was working and not working.

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.186
But most interestingly,
the biggest measure-- one

00:10:22.186 --> 00:10:24.060
of the big measures we
test for is this thing

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.630
called cognitive load, which
is how much your brain is

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.550
having to work.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.820
Now, there's a sweet spot.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.361
You don't want it
to be underwhelming

00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:32.720
where you're not engaged.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.090
Have you ever drove to work
and you get out of your car

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.440
and you're like, I don't
even remember driving.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.640
That's really low cognitive
load and it concerns me.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.190
But we've all done it, right?

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.970
And then there's too
much, and that is bad too.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:48.704
You want to hit that sweet
spot, which is very, very hard.

00:10:48.704 --> 00:10:50.120
And as we did all
this testing, we

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.390
saw that Tango more
intuitively hit that sweet spot

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.650
on a number of measures.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.200
Back to what she
was saying, too,

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.750
about how you have to have
this intuitive form factor.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.340
And this is a far more intuitive
form factor for right now.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.870
So we're really
excited about that.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.480
But there's still so many
different ways to iterate

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.860
and serve up content
and the experience

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.780
with the functionality,
and that's

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.430
back to the question
about challenge.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.750
It's been interesting for
us to take-- OK, well, we

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.160
think this is the answer based
on what we just saw and we

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.000
put that in and then it
creates a whole bunch

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.070
of other potential challenges.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.700
But it's just been really great
to work with a Google team

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.810
and use the neuroscience
and then put it in the field

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.190
very quickly in front
of real, actual people

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.820
to see how they respond to it.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.049
It's been great.

00:11:32.049 --> 00:11:34.090
KELLY SANTIAGO: Jesse,
what about with your work?

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.390
You've done a
variety of projects.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:41.345
So what have you been learning
through watching people play?

00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:42.970
JESSE SHELL: I guess
what we're finding

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:48.020
is that the shift to
making Tango experiences

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.130
is almost as big a
shift as when we went

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.550
from mouse-based and
gamepad-based gameplay

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.480
to touch-based gameplay.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.920
Because when we went to
touch, we had to reinvent UI.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.450
We had to invent this whole
new language of the way you

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:04.520
interact with things.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.550
And what was intuitive
was really different.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.050
And what we're
finding, the same key

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.070
that we found back
with touch games

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:17.370
is the same key now, which
is watch what children do.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.575
Because children are way
smarter than the rest of us

00:12:20.575 --> 00:12:21.950
because we've all
been trained up

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.100
on all kinds of broken
nonsense in our brains.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.604
When you give adults
Tango, what we

00:12:29.604 --> 00:12:32.270
find is we'll be doing games and
trying to show them how to play

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:35.790
and adults sometimes are
like, well, how do I move?

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.340
I'm like, well, you move.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.470
You just move.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:40.510
Well, how do I zoom in?

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.730
Where's the zoom button?

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.495
I'm like, you zoom in.

00:12:43.495 --> 00:12:44.870
It's right there
in front of you.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.620
Get closer to it.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:48.980
But you never have to
tell this to children.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.660
And we have to use this
logic on ourselves.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.400
We had a thing where we're
making this one game where

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.739
you can set up big rows of
dominoes all over the place

00:12:59.739 --> 00:13:01.280
and then you can
knock them all down,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.470
which is super fun because
you can do it very fast

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.650
and you don't have
to clean them up.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.170
It's really nice.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.086
You just hit a button
and they stand up again.

00:13:07.086 --> 00:13:08.830
You can change it around.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.220
And we wanted to be able to move
the whole set that we've made.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.110
And I was like, yeah, let's
put in little buttons that

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.360
move it to the left and right.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.220
And the developers
were like, no, stupid,

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.590
you just move them all
to the left and right.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:21.530
Just pick them up.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:23.360
Oh yeah, I can do that.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.170
So it's learning these
new, more intuitive powers.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.490
It's almost more like
un-learning is what you

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.320
have to do in order to use it.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.320
KELLY SANTIAGO: Yeah,
that's really interesting.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.580
Would you recommend a
certain breadth of audience

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.281
when you're conducting a
focus test or user test?

00:13:41.281 --> 00:13:41.780
Oh

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.530
JESSE SHELL: Yeah.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.570
KELLY SANTIAGO: Have all ages?

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.460
JESSE SHELL: If you want to
sell to a lot of people, sure.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:55.790
KELLY SANTIAGO: But you find
kids give meaningful feedback?

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.590
JESSE SHELL: I find
they're best at showing you

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:03.782
intuition-- natural
human intuition, that is.

00:14:03.782 --> 00:14:05.240
You still need the
test with adults

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.712
because you've got to learn
all of the unintuitive behavior

00:14:07.712 --> 00:14:09.170
that they've learned
and figure out

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.650
how you're going to unravel
that and get them back

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:12.639
to something natural.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:15.180
But it can be very helpful to
test with kids for that reason.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.040
ROBIN HUNICKE: It's
also really great

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.320
to test with people
that are not necessarily

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.120
in the realm of
gamer or experienced

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.710
super user like myself.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:26.930
Because we tend to develop
things for ourselves.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.138
We make them tweakier so
that we can be very precise.

00:14:29.138 --> 00:14:30.680
We want to add all this detail.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.690
And if you just put someone
who has never even tried

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.740
a virtual reality or an
augmented reality technology

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.400
into the experience,
you almost always

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.600
get questions that reflect
back to your own ignorance,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.580
your own written in rules
about how people will behave.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.090
I think it's very
important to test

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.700
with everyone and their
partner and their parents.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.680
Try to get really
outside the envelope.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.230
JOEL PENNINGTON: And for many
of my clients and customers,

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:55.060
they're architects.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.840
These are people who have
been architects or engineers

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.120
for decades.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.360
So they are not gamers.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.720
They take the Tango
tablet that we give them,

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.810
and the first challenge is
actually getting their design

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:09.740
onto the tablet.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.560
So we had to build a pipeline
to go from our design software

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.930
to our game engine very
quickly and efficiently using

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.470
a whole bunch of cool
stuff on the cloud.

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.510
Once we get to their
design on the tablet,

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:27.340
the first thing they do
is, oh, this is neat.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.180
You can move.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.240
Oh, oh.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.040
And then once they
start exploring,

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.490
they start to show their
coworkers how it functions.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.210
And then you'll never
get the tablet back.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.770
KYLE NEL: Yeah, I
think for us too

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:42.270
is we've done a lot
of this testing.

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:46.420
We're testing regular, normal
folks that had never even heard

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.890
of Tango or don't
follow any of this stuff

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.270
or even know what virtual
reality is really.

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.840
And giving it to somebody, there
is one woman in particular,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.874
we explained what
virtual reality was

00:15:56.874 --> 00:15:57.790
and what do you think?

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.470
She was like, virtual what?

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.740
And then at the end, we
didn't explain anything

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.910
else other than we
just gave it to her

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.243
and told her to explore with it.

00:16:04.243 --> 00:16:05.820
And then she repeated
back everything

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.900
that we were trying to
convey had we just written

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.020
up a concept test and
explained all the key words.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.440
And so that intuitive piece
is really, really important.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.620
I think that's
what sets us apart.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.579
And the other thing, too,
is the intuitive bit,

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:20.495
even though the form
factor is very intuitive,

00:16:20.495 --> 00:16:22.000
there's still a
lot of challenges.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.780
So for us, how do you
serve up 300 toilets

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:28.390
that look pretty much the
same in a virtual environment

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.670
without overwhelming people?

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.970
I mean, these are the
kind of challenges

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.011
that we hit all the time.

00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:36.350
And to overcome some
of the learned behavior

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.760
and make it more intuitive.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.340
KELLY SANTIAGO: Building
on that of bringing

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.000
in different
audiences and you guys

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.960
all come from
different backgrounds,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.480
I'm wondering for this audience
of current and hopefully future

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.430
Tango developers, what are
some resources that you found

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.420
helpful to bring into your
work in augmented reality

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.010
and on Tango?

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:04.244
Either a specific tool or
philosophy or teaching?

00:17:04.244 --> 00:17:06.119
ROBIN HUNICKE: I actually
spend a lot of time

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:08.849
looking at the works
of Disney and thinking

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:12.250
about the ways in which
park design and experience

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.060
design for physical
space really influences

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.920
the development of games and
playable spaces and activities.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.650
Specifically attentional design.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.230
So just really basic concepts
like having a weenie-- so

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.000
putting something
in the space that

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.792
will draw a person forward.

00:17:28.792 --> 00:17:31.000
Like that the number one
challenge with Tango devices

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.725
is to get people to actually
move while holding it.

00:17:33.725 --> 00:17:35.850
So you got to put something
in front of them that's

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.704
a little bit cute and a
little bit interesting

00:17:38.704 --> 00:17:40.620
and a little bit sparkly
with a little glitter

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.290
and then they'll walk to it.

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:43.820
You need to bring them forward.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.260
And if you make it sound
a little bit louder,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.780
it feels nice.

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.010
And so if you want to
think about physical space

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.320
and physical design, you
need to really think about

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.610
what draws a person's attention
and how much motion should

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.250
things have?

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.960
And then, of
course, the opposite

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.300
of that, which is how do you
avoid cluttering the space?

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.580
How do you keep it simple?

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.580
These are things that you
can use whether you're

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:09.170
working on something like an
immersive 3D game like Journey

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.090
or Wattam or Luna
that we're building--

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.130
Luna is a VR title that
we're developing now.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.580
Or something like
World, where it's

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.070
a very sparse set
of interactions

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.190
but they just immediately
spice up the space

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:21.712
because they bring that
magical feeling into it.

00:18:21.712 --> 00:18:23.920
So that's something that I
think is really important.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.660
JOEL PENNINGTON: On
the technical side

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:27.970
of things, the
developers and I, we're

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.240
very impressed
with how quickly we

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.950
were able to get ramped
up simply through access

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.610
to the API and the dogs.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.350
So good job.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.490
KYLE NEL: For us, we do
all of the things the same.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.460
We don't do virtual
reality or augmented

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.200
reality for VR AR's sake.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.080
We just think it's
the best way to solve

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.270
human problems and
human needs that people

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.990
have been asking for forever.

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.542
We call them common
cold problems.

00:18:56.542 --> 00:18:58.250
It's like, you can
put a man on the moon,

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:02.820
but you can't-- so we think that
VR and AR solves that purpose,

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.410
and we use this thing where
we actually hire professional

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:08.760
science fiction writers
to envision the probable

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.594
convergence of tech and trends.

00:19:10.594 --> 00:19:12.510
So we started doing this
about four years ago,

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:15.100
and if you look at
the original stories,

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.540
it looks a lot like Tango.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:23.170
This is before the VR
emergence really showed up.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.560
And so for us, it's
helping to focus

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.610
on what the solution is rather
than the technical capabilities

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:29.730
that we have right now.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.550
And that changes-- I've
seen it-- the direction

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.660
in which the development takes.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.310
Because you don't
take-- easiest is not

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.780
the best word-- but the one
with the least resistance path.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.180
You take the solution
focused path.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.060
And they sometimes
converge, but not always.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.980
And that's really
been helpful for us.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.210
JESSE SHELL: One thing
we've done a lot is not just

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.180
look-- it's so easy
when you're used

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.350
to developing apps and
software to just be thinking

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:59.970
about the digital
world, but when

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:04.680
you get into this realm
of spatial design,

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.310
you need to look at
real world things.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:12.060
How is a model train
set designed and why?

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.290
How are LEGOs designed and why?

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.760
How big should things be?

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.670
How small should things be?

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.207
And you need to think about
things like am I designing

00:20:20.207 --> 00:20:22.290
an experience that's about
interacting with things

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.940
on the floor, on a table,
while I'm standing, while I'm

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.340
moving around the house?

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.880
What exactly--
you're just having

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.230
to think about that
spatial context

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.880
and then taking
design inspiration,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.800
we were taking a lot of design
inspiration from toys and play

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.750
sets and their
designs as opposed

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:42.852
to from video game space.

00:20:42.852 --> 00:20:44.310
ROBIN HUNICKE:
Yeah, I was actually

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:47.040
going to say to follow up on
that that our office is filled

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.580
with clay, sculpting sand.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:55.260
We have a lot of playmobil toys
and also a lot of plan toys.

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:58.330
Plan toys are really great
just in terms of form factor.

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.060
One of my favorite
ones, it's just

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.580
a simple base with
long planks coming out

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.677
of it that looks like a tree and
then it has a set of ladybugs.

00:21:07.677 --> 00:21:10.010
And the tree has little spots
on it of different colors,

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:12.650
and you can put the ladybugs on
the colors using a colored dye.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:16.169
So it's a way of teaching
kids how to match the colors,

00:21:16.169 --> 00:21:17.460
but it's also a balancing game.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.910
Because the more ladybugs you
place on the tree branches,

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.010
the more wobbly they get.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.520
So we're really
interested specifically

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.010
in toys that are physical that
have some sort of a learning

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:27.570
component.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.050
So early age
development toys are

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:32.580
really good for where
everyone's audience is going

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.800
to be in these technologies.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.520
That's something
that Genova used

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.494
to say that when you put
someone into a new environment,

00:21:39.494 --> 00:21:40.910
their response to
that environment

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.320
is going to be just like a baby.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.070
They're going to poke
at stuff and they're

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:45.820
going to try to see
what it does and learn

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.720
what its physics and
its behaviors are.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.320
So being in the mindset that
you're creating these learning

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.590
toys as opposed to
experiences, necessarily,

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.020
or applications
is really helpful,

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.730
and being able to engage the
playful qualities of people

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.780
of all ages is essential
for that design.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.910
KELLY SANTIAGO: As far
as understanding space,

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.630
Joel, it seems like your
clients, architects, have

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.450
a really rich history in that.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:14.260
How are they responding
to this new technology?

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.940
JOEL PENNINGTON: Well,
it's transformative.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.120
If we go back a little bit,
blueprints were the best

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.890
that an architect
could do to visualize

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.270
what this new space,
this new city if you're

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.180
a civil engineer, would
look like and feel

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:33.290
like to the potential clients.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.670
And that's a really terrible
way to communicate your design

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.470
intent-- full stop.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:45.310
So then we moved to building
3D models of little cities

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.710
and buildings and
it looked cool.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.920
It looked like LEGO.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.360
But it didn't allow
the stakeholders--

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.450
the folks that are at
the town hall meetings--

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.920
to fully understand how is this
really going to impact my life?

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.680
It's not until
today where we have

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.900
access to immersive
technologies like game engines

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.360
and so forth that allow
you to really stick

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.390
your client into that
world and let them

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.500
understand what it's like
at a one-to-one scale.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.900
Or should I want
to, let me fly over

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.460
to the other end of
the city and experience

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.200
what this construction project
will do to my daily commute?

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.230
We can simulate all of that and
we can visualize all of that

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:30.790
and give that person the
exact, true-to-life scenario

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.130
that they will see when
it's physically constructed.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.660
And the architects
today are using

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:43.340
this not just for those really
important pitch projects where

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:46.050
they've really got
to win that new job,

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.530
they're actually using it
in daily design reviews

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:50.170
internally.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.330
So they're not just showing
it to their clients,

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.070
they're using it for
their own design purposes.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.900
Because design
software is amazing,

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.020
but it is required
to be so precise

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.100
and have so much
information in it,

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.370
that is like an anchor
pulling it down.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.770
It doesn't allow it to be
live and rich in real time.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:12.230
And we get that with
the Tango tablet.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.599
KELLY SANTIAGO: That
is blowing my mind.

00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:15.098
Sorry.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.240
So whenever there is a
brand new space like this,

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.060
I think it's a
unique opportunity

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:31.780
to hit the reset button on how
we've been approaching media.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.920
In television and film,
I feel like whether it's

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.560
for entertainment or for
education-- news programs,

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.200
you can see, take
a lot of their cues

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.310
from dramatic and
fictional programming.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.880
And similarly, in
the digital space,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.745
we still approach everything
with the divide of here

00:24:48.745 --> 00:24:50.660
are apps and here are games.

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.540
And I'm wondering
if you see ways

00:24:53.540 --> 00:25:00.000
in which we could be
developing or harvesting

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.970
this new developer ecosystem
of cross pollinating.

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:06.180
What are the
opportunities there?

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.190
JOEL PENNINGTON: If I may,
just very briefly, absolutely

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.990
the design requirements to
build a city, build a building,

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.720
make a thing that
you then want to get

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:21.720
funded by a Kickstarter require
expertise and design knowledge.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.820
But if you want to
communicate your idea,

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.240
you have to do that
using new technology.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.490
And game engines are
the way to do that.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.250
And I will pass on.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.760
I didn't want to take two
answers, but I had to.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.710
ROBIN HUNICKE: I totally
agree that it's very important

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:43.860
to think about experience design
and applications and creativity

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.380
sharing-- the ways in which
we are all very social--

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.770
as well as the
designed experience.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:54.180
And so I think for us, one
of the initial reactions

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.360
to the idea of using
a Tango device was,

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.580
well, it's going to be hard.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.700
It won't look that good.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.720
The world will be messy.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.600
But when we started developing
with it, almost instantaneously

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.160
we were passing
the device around,

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.400
talking about the experience
that we were engaged in,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.540
and then thinking
about I would totally

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.780
love to place this little
interactive snowman

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:13.400
on your head and
take a photo of it

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.730
and then share it with my mom.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.320
That would be a funny photo.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.380
And the idea of instantly
becoming aware of how social

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.870
the experience was.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.960
And then also, because it's a
small form factor unlike a game

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.110
engine-- we normally
develop game engines

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.170
like Unity for PlayStation
3 and for high-end PCVRs,

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.060
so our experience has been
tethered by that technology.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.780
With Tango, we were able to
experiment on a daily basis

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.670
and immediately
give the application

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.150
to other people in the office.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.511
It was not uncommon
even during a meeting

00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:48.010
for people to just get up and
start trying stuff and walking

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:48.510
around.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.270
It was such a rapid
iteration cycle.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:52.500
So for us, moving
toward applications

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.600
freed up our minds as developers
and really gave us permission

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.260
to try an experiment
in ways that we maybe

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.840
wouldn't have done if we were
working, like, in a big 3D

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.990
space in an engine with
a high-end visualization

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.580
technology.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.720
So I think it goes both ways.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:10.830
The lower resolution
allowed us to free ourselves

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.570
from expectations, which
limited our designs.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:15.510
It's really honestly--
I said this before,

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.570
but I'll say it again-- it was
the most pleasant development

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.520
like pipeline experience
that I've had so far.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.145
It was so fast and
so easy compared

00:27:22.145 --> 00:27:24.520
to some of the clunkier stuff
that we've been working on.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.500
KELLY SANTIAGO:
Jesse, I know you've

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.640
been thinking a lot as
we all have, but you

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.540
in particular have
been vocal as well

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.160
in sort of the future
of all this technology.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:43.040
What are you excited to
see in the future of Tango

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.420
and augmented reality?

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.300
JESSE SHELL: So there's a lot
of talk about augmented reality

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.769
right now, and there's not
a lot of augmented reality

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:51.310
in the world.

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.120
It's mostly just
talk about something

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.520
that no one knows what it is.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.070
And we could all hang out
and wait for a glasses size

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.910
perfect matrix augmented
reality to show up,

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:05.810
and maybe one day it will.

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:10.570
But in the meantime, what's
excited me is working

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.200
with Tango, we're already
learning the alphabet

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.740
of augmented reality.

00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.640
We're learning
the best practices

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.180
because it's a system that's
here and it works today.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.930
And this year,
you're going to be

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.110
able to make apps
for customers with.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.940
And so that's one of
the things I love.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:35.390
And back to your question
about this app-game divide,

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.300
the way I think
about that is apps

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.282
are generally about
creating something useful.

00:28:40.282 --> 00:28:41.740
That's generally
what apps are for.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.870
So here, go create
something useful.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:47.060
And games are usually
about doing something fun.

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:52.340
And that middle space is about
creating something fun I think.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.630
And that's why Minecraft
is so successful.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.700
It's not a game,
it's an app that's

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.430
about creating something fun.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.080
And Tango is one of
these things that

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.810
really allows you to
create a lot of things

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.605
in that middle place.

00:29:07.605 --> 00:29:10.280
KELLY SANTIAGO: Cool.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.550
Kyle, do you have any
thoughts about the future?

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.210
KYLE NEL: Yeah, I think that
there's a couple of pieces

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:20.939
there-- the business
side of things.

00:29:20.939 --> 00:29:22.730
Obviously, there's a
tremendous opportunity

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:26.110
to be able to figure out how
you can take these gaming

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.470
learnings of what
works in games and then

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.350
be able apply it in this new
space that's not quite an app

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.820
but is something
wholly different.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.910
And I like what you were
saying earlier about how

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.474
this is a platform change
much in the same way

00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:42.640
that some of the other
platforms change in the past.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.470
And coming at it
from that direction,

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.660
you start to think about
it differently hopefully.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.332
But it's also beyond just
the development piece.

00:29:49.332 --> 00:29:51.790
And thinking about it, there's
also an infrastructure thing

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.230
that has to change as well.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.980
On our side, there's all
kinds of things we have to do.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.260
Like the asset
creation process--

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.176
you have beautiful
3D assets that

00:30:02.176 --> 00:30:03.800
work in different
environments and work

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.140
very well over different
kinds of networks.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.370
And then how do you serve
that up in a meaningful way

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:10.560
without overwhelming people?

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.180
All these things we're beginning
to have to figure out now,

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.530
to your point, because it's
actually starting to arrive.

00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:20.780
And from what I've seen
in the actual science

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:22.227
of the neuroscience
stuff, if you

00:30:22.227 --> 00:30:24.310
don't think about it
intentionally and think about

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.940
it structurally in those
different ways beyond what

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.500
the person playing the
thing actually uses,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.580
it will just be a mess.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.300
And my worry is that
if we don't think

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.950
about those things
as a group and solve

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.290
some of those big challenges,
then the architecture

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:40.998
in which we continue
to develop will just

00:30:40.998 --> 00:30:42.634
be messier and messier.

00:30:42.634 --> 00:30:45.050
ROBIN HUNICKE: Yeah, there's
a real risk for lock-in right

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:47.110
now, and as developers,
it's all of our jobs

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.730
to think about what we
can do to really reverse

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.720
or un-learn, as
Jesse was saying,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.830
bad lessons or just locked-in
assumptions about how people

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.700
operate and what they want.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.800
People respond to
what you give them,

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.080
and you get what you give.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.500
As a designer or
as a developer, you

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.090
have to be always giving more
and thinking about things

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.830
at a much broader
level than what's easy.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.780
And I think one
of the best things

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.970
about being able to rapidly
iterate on technologies

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.290
like this is that you can
try a lot of things quickly,

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:19.610
you can put them
out there, you can

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.276
see how people respond
to them, and it's

00:31:21.276 --> 00:31:24.502
a really rich environment for
questioning our own intuitions.

00:31:24.502 --> 00:31:25.960
But it really is
our responsibility

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.550
to make sure that the next 100
years or 300 years of advances

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.120
in terms of us being able to
put ourselves into reality

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.890
in different ways
and to absorb reality

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.400
through different
lenses and filters

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.680
that we're really
thinking about this

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.650
from the perspective of
what is human in terms

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:44.380
of what doesn't stress the
body on a regular basis?

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.580
What doesn't stress the
cognitive on a regular basis?

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.970
How do we engage with
one another in safe ways?

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.220
And how do we allow
our imaginations

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.350
to be as broad and as open as
they can be and not just think

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.954
of everything as a tight little
package-- a single absorption?

00:31:58.954 --> 00:32:01.370
Therefore, we want to streamline
it right into your brain.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.300
But really give
people the opportunity

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.330
to be more expansive as humans.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.920
This is something that we
will be designing right now,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.320
and so stop thinking about
the mouse and the keyboard.

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.985
Stop thinking about
standard ways of input lists

00:32:12.985 --> 00:32:16.910
and all this other stuff--
the clickable, scrollable UI.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.650
There are so many other ways
to do things in these spaces,

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.860
and it's really in
all of your hands.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.720
It's a very important
mission, I think.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.230
JOEL PENNINGTON: When we look
at all of this cool new hardware

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.350
that's coming out that
enables augmented reality

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:35.030
and virtual reality
experiences, I firmly believe

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:38.410
that we'll all fall flat unless
there is content to support it.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.800
And we're content creators.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:46.490
But it is really tough to
make compelling content today.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.650
At Autodesk, it is
no secret that we

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:54.170
have most of the software folks
used to make CG content today.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:57.510
We also have our
game engine Stingray,

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.950
and right now, we've got
a very strong coupling

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:02.510
between that software
and the engine.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:06.110
That lets us test and iterate
very quickly with architects

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.650
and game designers
and so forth that

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:11.320
want to be able to take their
assets that they've created

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.210
and their traditional
packages and get them

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.900
into that interactive
experience quickly

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:18.540
to elicit feedback
from charter users,

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.740
customers, gamers, and so forth.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.830
KELLY SANTIAGO: Kyle, working
with a brand like Lowe's, I

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:29.040
would imagine it would have
additional complexities as far

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.550
as how much you're able to
iterate or rapidly iterate?

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.640
Is that true?

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.060
What's that process like
for you and your team?

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.143
KYLE NEL: Not many people
know that Lowe's started

00:33:41.143 --> 00:33:43.571
as an augmented reality
company in the '40s.

00:33:43.571 --> 00:33:45.070
We've just been
waiting a long time.

00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:49.660
We decided selling home
improvement supplies was

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.642
a good way to build capital.

00:33:51.642 --> 00:33:53.600
KELLY SANTIAGO: There's
a lot of responsibility

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.490
to physical spaces and
people of all kinds.

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.450
KYLE NEL: So without
waxing too philosophical,

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.800
Lowe's mission is to help
people love where they live,

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.010
and so the way that we
manifest that right now

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.710
is through building these
stores all over North America.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.870
But clearly, that ambition
expands into the digital realm

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:11.699
as well.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:15.949
And so when that's your goal,
the organization, hopefully,

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:20.690
will modify itself in order
to help achieve whatever

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.760
opportunities arise when you're
on this exponential path,

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.350
especially on AR and VR.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.659
And so for us, when we started
down this a few years ago doing

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:31.139
different platforms
and we did that

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:34.600
with the intention of making
sure that the organization was

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.850
malleable-- we didn't know it
was going to be called Tango

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:38.940
or who was going to do it.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.639
But when it arrived, we
would be ready-ish for it.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:46.270
And ish is the key thing.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.800
And if you talk to any large
organization on the planet,

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:53.110
not just a retailer, not just
a traditional business thing,

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.060
they're all trying to
understand how to engage people

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.740
in a more meaningful way.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.530
And what more meaningful way
than the most intuitive way,

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:03.410
which right now I
think is clearly Tango?

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:06.060
So once again, for
us, it's about showing

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.810
what the promise could be
and the possibility could be

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.874
and then trying to-- I
don't know if beat up

00:35:11.874 --> 00:35:13.540
is the right word,
but it's kind of what

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.400
I do is beat up the
organization so that they will

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.010
understand it and then jump on.

00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:23.760
But I will say that Lowe's has
gotten behind this in a big way

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.967
because they see
the potential of it.

00:35:26.967 --> 00:35:28.800
JESSE SHELL: Kyle, tell
them your job title.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.174
KYLE NEL: I'm the executive
director of Lowe's Innovation

00:35:31.174 --> 00:35:34.390
Labs and the vice president
of disruptive innovation.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.601
So we were joking around
at breakfast this morning

00:35:36.601 --> 00:35:38.350
that when people come
in and they're like,

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:41.030
Kyle is such a jerk, he made
me do this, I'm like, see,

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.530
I'm winning.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.704
Success.

00:35:45.704 --> 00:35:47.370
KELLY SANTIAGO: I
feel like that touches

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:49.960
on what Jesse was mentioning
as far as maybe having

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:54.490
this broad view that exists
outside of technology

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.400
so then you're ready
for the technology

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.260
as it manifests, which we
always know is not the utopia.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.170
It's somewhere in the middle.

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:06.090
And then just be ready for
that and see what you can do.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.930
It's cool.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:12.360
What tips do you have for a
first time Tango developer?

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.440
JESSE SHELL: Oh, I've got a lot.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.640
The big thing is
to keep it simple.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.400
You're going to have to
find your way in terms

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.770
of what works.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:31.110
You're going to have a lot
of big dreamy ideas about all

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.040
the wonderful things
that are going to work.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.720
And not everything
is going to work yet.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.820
It's a platform that
has its strengths

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.580
and has its weaknesses.

00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.170
If you go in-- and I think
we did this initially.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.580
We started playing
around with it 18 months

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.420
or two years ago--
something like that.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.920
And we had this big
dream of exactly how

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.800
it was going to work.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.508
And when it didn't
work exactly that way,

00:36:55.508 --> 00:36:57.327
we we're like we hate this.

00:36:57.327 --> 00:36:59.160
And then a little later,
we were like, well,

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.540
maybe we should just
do what it's good at.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:04.590
And then we started
focusing on that,

00:37:04.590 --> 00:37:09.870
and then we started making
all of this path forward.

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.860
So I think going in
with an open mind

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:15.600
and looking for what it's good
at, and you'll find things.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.004
Like we ended up
finding oh my god,

00:37:18.004 --> 00:37:19.420
it's really good
at playing Jenga.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.830
And this just hadn't
occurred to anybody,

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:27.580
but it was because we started
thinking where is this strong

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.970
and what can it do?

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:30.490
ROBIN HUNICKE: I
would say also just

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:34.790
really being open to trying
the weirdest and most bizarre

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.820
idea that you have.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.727
Keita is incredibly irreverent
when it comes to reality.

00:37:39.727 --> 00:37:41.810
He just doesn't like the
fact that there's gravity

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:43.779
and that we have limitations
of physical bodies

00:37:43.779 --> 00:37:45.570
and that we can't just
appear to each other

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.290
as giant Teddy Bears or
animating carrots or whatever.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.790
He wants the world to be a
really magical place in ways

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.581
that are sometimes very
frustrating to him.

00:37:53.581 --> 00:37:55.740
So his first
experience with Tango

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.850
was to immediately ask can we
hang things on the ceiling?

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.670
Can I make a cloud
that will rain

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.960
and then little
flowers will sprout?

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:06.490
How can I engage in this reality
in a way that totally questions

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:07.520
what we expect?

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.790
And so to give
yourself permission

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:13.260
to just have the strange idea
and put it in, because it

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.130
is so easy, it is so fast.

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:19.780
It was so possible for us
to add features and get them

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.860
into the pipeline and testable
within the same day of having

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:24.360
a meeting.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.060
It would be in the device.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.570
And so don't lock
yourself into this pattern

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:31.760
of thinking you have
to flow everything out.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.850
Really go with what the
device is good with,

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.530
but specifically, ask
yourself, why not as opposed

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.800
to sort of always trying
to detail exactly why.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.050
JOEL PENNINGTON: And
then give it to people

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.910
and watch them play with it.

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:48.400
That's the most amazing reaction
because they start small,

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.106
and then once they
realize what they can do,

00:38:51.106 --> 00:38:52.480
you'll never get
the tablet back.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.830
You're just going to have
to go buy another one.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:54.790
ROBIN HUNICKE: It's true.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:55.290
It's true.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.340
We're always having people
jealous of people interacting

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.380
with the Tango device at work.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.800
People cluster around
and try to touch it.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.310
KYLE NEL: And to add onto that,
it's been really helpful for us

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.710
after you hand somebody--
a normal person who

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.680
doesn't do this all the time
and have them experience it,

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.160
have them explain it to somebody
else sitting right next to them

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.702
about how they
would talk about it.

00:39:16.702 --> 00:39:18.910
There's so many different
things that came out of it.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:20.859
Like, oh my gosh, I never
even-- that's really

00:39:20.859 --> 00:39:21.900
what you got out of that?

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.316
And that's really
what you wanted?

00:39:23.316 --> 00:39:26.797
And it just takes you
in different directions.

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:28.380
KELLY SANTIAGO: Yeah,
you were talking

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.980
earlier, Robin, before
the panel about designing

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.131
around the constraints.

00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:35.380
And Jesse was kind of touching
on this too-- there are

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.790
strengths and there
are weaknesses.

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:40.210
And so when you find out maybe
that original idea doesn't

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.847
quite work, OK,
well, how can I lean

00:39:42.847 --> 00:39:44.680
into what the strengths
of the platform are?

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:47.070
ROBIN HUNICKE: Yeah, I
think that we actually

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:51.100
felt comfortable
rolling our own when

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.240
it came to certain
aspects of the system.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.171
We especially wanted people to
be able to set up a little play

00:39:56.171 --> 00:39:58.420
area and then walk away from
it and come back and have

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.400
it persist.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.817
So we were able to use
features of the device

00:40:01.817 --> 00:40:02.650
to make that happen.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.520
And then in places where we
were struggling a little bit,

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.762
we just wrote software that
took care of that problem

00:40:07.762 --> 00:40:08.970
from a different perspective.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.240
So we would ask ourselves
what is this really about?

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.304
So for example, being
able to leave a place

00:40:13.304 --> 00:40:14.720
and then come back
to it is really

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.899
about matching the picture in
your mind to what you built.

00:40:17.899 --> 00:40:20.190
So we built something where
you take a picture with it,

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.880
and then later, you just
line up the picture,

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.890
and it's there again.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.370
And people will do a lot.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.620
They will give
you a lot in order

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.104
to have that fun experience.

00:40:29.104 --> 00:40:31.270
They haven't learned that
the technology is supposed

00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:33.000
to solve all of our problems.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.570
When we first started working
with Tango developers,

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:36.600
Nick [INAUDIBLE] and
some of the other people

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.790
that we were working
with in the organization

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.090
gave us this big, long
list of all these things

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:43.930
that we would have to
educate users to do.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.780
And I said, do you want me to
write you a use case tutorial

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.405
or do you want to game design?

00:40:49.405 --> 00:40:52.677
Because I can design around
like 30% to 70% of these things

00:40:52.677 --> 00:40:55.010
depending on how creative the
people are on the project.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:57.630
Let's not think about all the
limitations of the technology,

00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:59.755
let's think about the couple
of things it does well

00:40:59.755 --> 00:41:02.020
and what we can get people
to give us for free.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.061
And so that's the other
thing that you can really

00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:07.250
do with something this simple
is you can get a lot for free.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:08.850
People are not
expecting the world

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:11.100
to be given to
them on a platter,

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.970
and honestly, our user
testing on Google Campus,

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.470
when people experience
it, they're blown away.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.980
They're literally
like, this is so cool.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:21.550
It does so much cool stuff.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:22.860
I had no idea.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.720
And in your mind as a developer,
you're imagining the holodeck.

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.110
So you're like, it's
not the holodeck.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.760
This is not Data doing
a Sherlock Holmes

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.460
thing in real time.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.350
Your limitations are so
much greater than the user.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.970
The everyday person
who picks up a Tango

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:43.430
will literally be blown
away, so don't limit yourself

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:44.696
in that way.

00:41:44.696 --> 00:41:46.820
KELLY SANTIAGO: So we just
have a few minutes left.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.840
I'm wondering if real
quickly we can put back

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.490
the slide with the
speaker's information on it

00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:53.970
and you can see their
Twitter accounts.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.290
Let's give a hand for
all our awesome panelists

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:57.570
and developers.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:59.580
Thank you for sharing
your lessons learned

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.580
and for coming out here.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:03.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:08.730
