00:00:00.308 --> 00:00:03.653
(music playing)

00:00:03.653 --> 00:00:06.817
Christophe: 1913 is a
year of great upheaval.

00:00:06.817 --> 00:00:10.451
Artists are trying to find
new ways to develop an art

00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:13.734
which would be free from the society,

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:17.234
at least from the bourgeois
order of the past decade.

00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:21.407
Books played a major role in that project,

00:00:21.407 --> 00:00:24.286
but not books as we know them.

00:00:24.286 --> 00:00:28.658
Some of those books were
hand-colorized by the artist,

00:00:28.658 --> 00:00:31.163
so each is unique,

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:36.371
propose just a different
relationship between text and images.

00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:39.119
Olga Rozanova is one of the artists

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:41.444
who pioneered this new use of books

00:00:41.444 --> 00:00:44.193
in the 2nd decade of the 20th century.

00:00:44.193 --> 00:00:46.663
Often, she worked with her companion,

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:48.779
Aleksei Kruchenykh, a poet.

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:51.777
"A Little Duck's Nest ... of Bad Words" is

00:00:51.777 --> 00:00:55.026
with the [tale inlay] their
most famous accomplishment.

00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:59.655
Aleksei Kruchenyk invented
a new language called Zaum.

00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:04.608
Zaum can be translated into transrational,

00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:06.439
or beyond reasons.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.835
The idea was to free
language from meaning,

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.386
to free the words,

00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:14.819
to create words for the
shape or the sounds,

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:18.396
not to be bound to a specific meaning.

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:20.795
Books played a major role.

00:01:20.795 --> 00:01:26.488
Cheap books, small books
distributed in large edition.

00:01:26.488 --> 00:01:28.878
Books without a real binding,

00:01:28.878 --> 00:01:31.830
usually the sheets are
just stapled together.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.137
Most of those booklets were produced

00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:37.878
in rather large edition,
a few hundred copies.

00:01:37.878 --> 00:01:40.099
However, because of their
mode of distribution,

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:43.156
they were given freely to other artists

00:01:43.156 --> 00:01:46.105
or exchanged against other works.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.967
Few of them survived,

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:51.223
so very few copies of "The
Duck's Nest", for instance,

00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:52.738
are known today.

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:54.794
We are very lucky that in the collection

00:01:54.794 --> 00:01:56.407
of the Museum of Modern Art,

00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:57.810
we have two copies,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.967
allowing to understand how the artist

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:06.297
basically reinvented the text
through the illustration,

00:02:06.297 --> 00:02:09.296
each time in that process.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.444
There is something extremely radical,

00:02:11.444 --> 00:02:15.910
to be almost a place of
a performative action,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.572
which those books convey so well today.
