I have the number 210 let's try to

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250
I have the number 210 let's try to
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.050
I have the number 210 let's try to
factor this into prime numbers so 210 is

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060
factor this into prime numbers so 210 is
 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.850
factor this into prime numbers so 210 is
2 times 3 times 5 times 7 it's the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860
2 times 3 times 5 times 7 it's the
 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.430
2 times 3 times 5 times 7 it's the
product of the first 4 prime numbers

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440
product of the first 4 prime numbers
 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.620
product of the first 4 prime numbers
this is its unique prime factorization

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630
this is its unique prime factorization
 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.300
this is its unique prime factorization
and one of these prime numbers these are

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
and one of these prime numbers these are
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.250
and one of these prime numbers these are
numbers that can't be factored into

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
numbers that can't be factored into
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.950
numbers that can't be factored into
smaller numbers and we leave one out of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
smaller numbers and we leave one out of
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.410
smaller numbers and we leave one out of
the game because it's special and so the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
the game because it's special and so the
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.550
the game because it's special and so the
prime numbers are 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560
prime numbers are 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.680
prime numbers are 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
can they go on forever as was proved

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
can they go on forever as was proved
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.180
can they go on forever as was proved
maybe 2300 years ago by Euclid now one

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
maybe 2300 years ago by Euclid now one
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.190
maybe 2300 years ago by Euclid now one
thing that you can obviously see about

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
thing that you can obviously see about
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.940
thing that you can obviously see about
these Prime's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950
these Prime's
 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.700
these Prime's
is that after 2 they're all odd numbers

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710
is that after 2 they're all odd numbers
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.430
is that after 2 they're all odd numbers
that means that except for 2 if you add

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
that means that except for 2 if you add
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.229
that means that except for 2 if you add
two points together you get an even

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239
two points together you get an even
 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240
two points together you get an even
number so the two plants could even be

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
number so the two plants could even be
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.180
number so the two plants could even be
the same prime so for example I got 3

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
the same prime so for example I got 3
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.700
the same prime so for example I got 3
plus 3 equals 6 I get 3 plus 5 equals 8

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
plus 3 equals 6 I get 3 plus 5 equals 8
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.349
plus 3 equals 6 I get 3 plus 5 equals 8
I get let's see 3 plus 7 equals 10 and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
I get let's see 3 plus 7 equals 10 and
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.770
I get let's see 3 plus 7 equals 10 and
also have that the same as 5 plus 5 so

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780
also have that the same as 5 plus 5 so
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.289
also have that the same as 5 plus 5 so
10 has two representations as a sum of

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
10 has two representations as a sum of
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.160
10 has two representations as a sum of
two primes there's a conjecture of

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170
two primes there's a conjecture of
 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.920
two primes there's a conjecture of
Goldbach from the 18th century and every

Goldbach from the 18th century and every
even numbers starting with 6 is the sum

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
even numbers starting with 6 is the sum
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.399
even numbers starting with 6 is the sum
of two odd primes and I should state

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
of two odd primes and I should state
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.190
of two odd primes and I should state

we've been novels written about the
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660
we've been novels written about the
quest for proving this conjecture or

we died to prove Goldbach's conjecture

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439
we died to prove Goldbach's conjecture
 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.109
we died to prove Goldbach's conjecture
meaning is would be a great prize agree

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119
meaning is would be a great prize agree
 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.350
meaning is would be a great prize agree
cout we strongly suspect that the answer

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
cout we strongly suspect that the answer
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.170
cout we strongly suspect that the answer
is yes and why do we suspect so well

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
is yes and why do we suspect so well
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.330
is yes and why do we suspect so well
because the primes are very numerous

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
because the primes are very numerous
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.249
because the primes are very numerous
even though they thin out

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
even though they thin out
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350
even though they thin out
they are very numerous and so a given

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360
they are very numerous and so a given
 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.620
they are very numerous and so a given
even number has a lot of chances to be

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
even number has a lot of chances to be
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.840
even number has a lot of chances to be
the sum of two primes

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850
 
 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.490
 
210 as you can quickly see is an even

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500
210 as you can quickly see is an even
 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.260
210 as you can quickly see is an even
number and Goldbach would predict that

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
number and Goldbach would predict that
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.930
number and Goldbach would predict that
it's the summer to bronze in fact it's

it's the summer to bronze in fact it's
 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.580
it's the summer to bronze in fact it's
not only the sum of two primes

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590
not only the sum of two primes
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.800
not only the sum of two primes
it's the sum of two points in a lot of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
it's the sum of two points in a lot of
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.650
it's the sum of two points in a lot of
ways in a champion number of ways so

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660
ways in a champion number of ways so
 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.720
ways in a champion number of ways so
what I mean by that if if you're going

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
what I mean by that if if you're going
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.060
what I mean by that if if you're going
to write 200 in technique as P plus Q

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070
to write 200 in technique as P plus Q
 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.880
to write 200 in technique as P plus Q
where P is less than or equal to Q and P

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
where P is less than or equal to Q and P
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.390
where P is less than or equal to Q and P
and Q are prime numbers and Q is greater

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
and Q are prime numbers and Q is greater
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:31.850
and Q are prime numbers and Q is greater
than or equal to 105 so let's take what

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
than or equal to 105 so let's take what
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.890
than or equal to 105 so let's take what
QB any prime with 105 less than or equal

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
QB any prime with 105 less than or equal
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.790
QB any prime with 105 less than or equal
to Q less than or equal to 210 okay any

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800
to Q less than or equal to 210 okay any
 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.250
to Q less than or equal to 210 okay any
prime whatsoever and now let's look at

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
prime whatsoever and now let's look at
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.550
prime whatsoever and now let's look at
210 minus Q what can you tell me about

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560
210 minus Q what can you tell me about
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.690
210 minus Q what can you tell me about
that number that number is less than or

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700
that number that number is less than or
 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.870
that number that number is less than or
equal to 105 105 being kapha q10 and Q

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880
equal to 105 105 being kapha q10 and Q
 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.720
equal to 105 105 being kapha q10 and Q
is above the halfway 210 minus Q is not

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
is above the halfway 210 minus Q is not
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.199
is above the halfway 210 minus Q is not
divisible by 2 how do I know that

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209
divisible by 2 how do I know that
 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.880
divisible by 2 how do I know that
because 210 is divisible by 2 and Q is a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
because 210 is divisible by 2 and Q is a
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.520
because 210 is divisible by 2 and Q is a
prime and it's bigger than or equal to

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
prime and it's bigger than or equal to
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.449
prime and it's bigger than or equal to
105 so we thought okay it's not

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459
105 so we thought okay it's not
 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.610
105 so we thought okay it's not
divisible by 3 how do I know that

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620
divisible by 3 how do I know that
 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.509
divisible by 3 how do I know that
because 3 is a divisor of 210 and Q

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519
because 3 is a divisor of 210 and Q
 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.750
because 3 is a divisor of 210 and Q
being a prime and bigger than or equal

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760
being a prime and bigger than or equal
 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.850
being a prime and bigger than or equal
to 105 is not divisible by tween and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860
to 105 is not divisible by tween and
 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.280
to 105 is not divisible by tween and
also this number is not divisible by 5

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290
also this number is not divisible by 5
 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.680
also this number is not divisible by 5
or 7 for the same reasons

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690
or 7 for the same reasons
 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.400
or 7 for the same reasons
since 210 is 2 times 3 times 5 times 7

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410
since 210 is 2 times 3 times 5 times 7
 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.610
since 210 is 2 times 3 times 5 times 7
so this number does not have as point

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620
so this number does not have as point
 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.930
so this number does not have as point
factors 2 3 5 &amp; 7 so what is its least

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940
factors 2 3 5 &amp; 7 so what is its least
 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.780
factors 2 3 5 &amp; 7 so what is its least
possible prime factor well it would be

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790
possible prime factor well it would be
 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.759
possible prime factor well it would be
the next prime after 7 which is a little

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769
the next prime after 7 which is a little
 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.870
the next prime after 7 which is a little
loving so if this is a composite number

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880
loving so if this is a composite number
 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.000
loving so if this is a composite number
you will have to be some prime greater

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010
you will have to be some prime greater
 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.850
you will have to be some prime greater
than or equal to 11 times something else

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860
than or equal to 11 times something else
 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.790
than or equal to 11 times something else
bigger than 1 but the least candidate at

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800
bigger than 1 but the least candidate at
 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.020
bigger than 1 but the least candidate at
11 times 11 which is 121 which is bigger

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030
11 times 11 which is 121 which is bigger
 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.559
11 times 11 which is 121 which is bigger
than 105 so we conclude

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569
than 105 so we conclude
 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.750
than 105 so we conclude
at 210 minus Q is 1 or chronic and it's

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760
at 210 minus Q is 1 or chronic and it's
 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.860
at 210 minus Q is 1 or chronic and it's
not 1 and how do I know it's not 1

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870
not 1 and how do I know it's not 1
 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.020
not 1 and how do I know it's not 1
well if it were one that would mean that

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030
well if it were one that would mean that
 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.719
well if it were one that would mean that
Q is 209 and Q is not equal to 209 this

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729
Q is 209 and Q is not equal to 209 this
 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.080
Q is 209 and Q is not equal to 209 this
209 is not a prime is 11 times 19 so

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090
209 is not a prime is 11 times 19 so
 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.659
209 is not a prime is 11 times 19 so
every prime Q between 105 and 210 gives

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669
every prime Q between 105 and 210 gives
 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:42.360
every prime Q between 105 and 210 gives
us a P such that P plus Q equals 210 so

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370
us a P such that P plus Q equals 210 so
 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.800
us a P such that P plus Q equals 210 so
Goldbach is not only right about the

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810
Goldbach is not only right about the
 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.140
Goldbach is not only right about the
number of 210 he's really right about

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150
number of 210 he's really right about
 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.790
number of 210 he's really right about
the number 210 and in fact you can ask

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800
the number 210 and in fact you can ask
 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.219
the number 210 and in fact you can ask
how special is this property the 210 has

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229
how special is this property the 210 has
 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:05:01.750
how special is this property the 210 has
its the last number with this problem so

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:01.760
its the last number with this problem so
 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.490
its the last number with this problem so
let's look at all these Prime's between

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500
let's look at all these Prime's between
 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.640
let's look at all these Prime's between
105 and 210 here they are look at them

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650
105 and 210 here they are look at them
 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.800
105 and 210 here they are look at them
every one of them is a candidate for

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810
every one of them is a candidate for
 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.990
every one of them is a candidate for
writing to channes the sum of two primes

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000
writing to channes the sum of two primes
 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.710
writing to channes the sum of two primes
and if it works then 210 minus one of

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720
and if it works then 210 minus one of
 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.279
and if it works then 210 minus one of
these Prime's

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289
these Prime's
 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.620
these Prime's
will itself be a prime is there a

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630
will itself be a prime is there a
 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.930
will itself be a prime is there a
pairing for each one of these Prime's

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940
pairing for each one of these Prime's
 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.870
pairing for each one of these Prime's
with a prime smaller than or equal to

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880
with a prime smaller than or equal to
 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.740
with a prime smaller than or equal to
105 and we find 210 is the very last

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750
105 and we find 210 is the very last
 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.870
105 and we find 210 is the very last
case where this ever happens if this

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880
case where this ever happens if this
 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.240
case where this ever happens if this
happen for a few smaller cases so for

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250
happen for a few smaller cases so for
 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.140
happen for a few smaller cases so for
example for the number 36
