00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Consider the case where a number can be either 0 or 1 with 0.5 probability for each.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What is its variance?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Note that this is the same as figuring out the variance of 2 data points,

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
1 that's 0 and 1 that's 1.
