[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:07.094
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:08.177
JEREMY SHERMAN: Thank you.

00:00:08.177 --> 00:00:09.620
Thank you.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.600
Thank you.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.770
It is a delight to be
here at tech Mecca,

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.260
talking with you all about
this very important question,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.330
a question that is simple, huge,
soulful, strictly scientific,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.460
techie, meaning-of-life-size.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.659
And it's a question that we
ignore, shirk, skirt, ridicule,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:36.496
and pretend we've
answered when we haven't.

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:39.870
An old family friend and I were
catching up with each other.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.850
And he asked me what
I've been up to.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.790
And I described the
question to him.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.100
And he balked in a telling way.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.410
He said, it sounds
like you've got way

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350
too much time on your hands.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.290
It's way over my pay scale.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.870
It's a question that
can never be answered.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.430
And it was answered last
week in a Facebook post

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.410
about quantum consciousness.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.080
So I got all four of
them from him at once.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.140
It is a simple question, much
simpler than any of the things

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.220
that you deal with.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.950
And yet, it is a fairly
unfamiliar question.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.404
People do tend to
balk at this question.

00:01:16.404 --> 00:01:17.820
So the way I'm
going to do this is

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.630
I'm going to frame the question
and then pause for challenges,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.700
kick the tires on
this thing, really

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.280
try to get clear on the
question, challenges,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.890
questions, all of that, and
then give you a new proposed

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.030
answer, which is unlike anything
I've seen from other sources.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.010
The question is, what
are striving selves?

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.450
I strive, therefore I am.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.130
You know, Descartes said,
I think, therefore I am.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.713
I'm going to go much
deeper than that.

00:01:41.713 --> 00:01:42.260
I strive.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.010
I try.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.360
I make effort.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.560
This doesn't make effort.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.180
Computers don't
actually make effort.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.260
They do work.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.540
They do very useful work,
but they don't make effort.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.100
They are not striving.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.370
And I'll be more specific
about that in a minute.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.240
You can call us any number of
things, and agent organism,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.925
living being.

00:01:59.925 --> 00:02:01.790
And I'm just going
to call us selves.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.030
And I'm going to call us
all selves, that every one

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.940
of these organisms is striving.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.180
It is doing work
for its own benefit.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.525
"Striving" means not
going with the flow.

00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:20.030
And you can see that here in
this self, going upstream.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.580
And it's more than this.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.840
It's more than just going
upstream because, really,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.060
what's going on is we are
going against the flow

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.340
towards the
degeneration, everything

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.460
falling towards entropy,
randomness, disorder,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.890
falling apart and petering out.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.650
So a very simple,
straightforward question.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.470
We don't.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.990
We run to stay in place
like the Red Queen

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.790
in "Alice Through
the Looking Glass."

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.820
And it's happening right now,
unconsciously and unfelt,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.030
striving, like what our
bodies are doing right now.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.030
Right now, my body is
regenerating itself faster

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.930
than it degenerates.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.150
And it's doing it
without me understanding

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.520
what it's doing, without
any awareness of it,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.740
just like it does in bacteria.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.540
That is, they don't
have consciousness.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.280
They don't have feelings.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.620
And yet, they are striving
against the tendency

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.332
to degenerate.

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:13.790
So really, we can distinguish
between two kinds of things--

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.610
the things that exist, lasting
as they degenerate, depending

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.640
on their durability, and
selves, which persist,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.620
striving to regenerate.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.820
Very big difference, as yet
unexplained by the sciences.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.560
That's the question.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.640
And as I said, machines
are not striving selves.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.220
We engineer them for durability.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.560
Computers aren't striving
selves, and striving selves

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.880
are not computers.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.680
I adore computers.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.060
I live on them.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.680
I spend most of my time on them.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.300
This is not a Luddite talking.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.360
I'm not protesting against
the use of computers

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.890
as though they are heartless.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.780
No, I think they're full of
heart, the way I use them.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.770
But they are not striving.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.840
So the question
comes down to this.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.250
There's no magic added.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.620
And yet, selves are
means-to-ends striving,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.810
not just cause-and-effect
mechanism.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.580
There's something
different about us

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.010
from nothing but chemistry.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.260
So I rule out from
the start the idea

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.890
that there's some magic
non-thing thingie that gets

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.390
deposited into matter
that makes us come alive--

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.060
a soul, a spirit, a vital
force, or any of that.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.579
None of that will work,
nor will the argument

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.632
that there's something about
all interactions, all material

00:04:21.632 --> 00:04:23.090
interactions, all
cause and effect,

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.215
that's actually a little
bit means-to-ends, and you

00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:28.050
collect enough of that together,
and suddenly, poof, it's

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.740
a suddenly striving self.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.080
No, I'm ruling all of that out.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.360
And also, I'm ruling out
the argument that all we are

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.465
is cause-and-effect mechanism,
which really does corner us

00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:39.100
with a challenge.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.070
What are striving selves?

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.150
There's a fundamental gap in our
research, scientific research.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.300
Striving selves are inadmissible
in the physical sciences.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.310
If you had a physics
professor who told you

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.550
that the moon strives to pull
on the tides for someone's

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.640
benefit, you'd think
there's something wrong.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.070
But down the hall,
you've got a biologist,

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.250
or a social scientist,
who can talk all they

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.990
want about striving selves.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.920
So there's this
fundamental rift.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.110
Take these three terms,
absolutely essential

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.710
in biology.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.060
You cannot do biology without
functional, basically function,

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.400
fittedness, and striving.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.900
That's about selves.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.520
That's about selves
engaging in what

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.280
I'll call self-directed
work, effort by selves,

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.450
for themselves, responsive
to their circumstances.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.680
And the way it works for
continuity in the sciences

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.750
is that the lower
level scientists

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.250
have to explain what the
higher sciences assume.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.190
And we've got a huge gap here.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.970
Because chemistry does
not explain functional

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.380
fitted striving.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.390
And yet, we totally
rely on it in the life

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.210
and social sciences.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.230
So the approach I'm
going to promote

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.170
is that you start with
striving's patient zero,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.107
the very first striving self.

00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:56.940
You have to explain how
mattering could ever

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.260
emerge from matter, how you
ever get from chemistry to even

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.030
the most basic striving self.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.630
And if you do that, you get
to reveal the bare essentials

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.820
without all of the
bells and whistles

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.250
that accumulate through
evolutionary history.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.510
You start simple.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.890
That is not how
we tend to do it.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:15.931
We tend to do it through
cognitive science, which

00:06:15.931 --> 00:06:18.210
starts way too high up.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.520
It's like trying to explain
hair or from quills,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.360
porcupine quills.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.240
They are hair.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:30.260
Consciousness is very much
a striving self's property,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.960
just like quills are like hair.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.320
But it's very specialized,
and it's highly evolved.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.660
And it's also a little
bit, cognitive science,

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.490
like trying to explain striving
starting with wigs, which

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.550
is an artifact, a
computer as an artifact,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.340
by which we can try
to determine what it

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.304
is about us that is striving.

00:06:53.304 --> 00:06:55.720
You've probably heard of the
hard problem in consciousness

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.340
studies, which is
how do you ever

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.980
get qualia, the
experience, the feeling,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.320
the sensation of things?

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.560
But cognitive science works
from a computational model

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.030
for what living is.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.862
So I consider it the
made harder problem.

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:11.320
If you're going to try to go
from computation, which is not

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.921
striving to do anything,
and go straight to qualia,

00:07:13.921 --> 00:07:15.170
you're going to have problems.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.490
That's why I suggest we start
with patient zero, that is,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.930
with the very first
possible striving self.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.870
And I'll say this is a question
behind our biggest questions.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.320
To reckon with consciousness,
mind, qualia, free will,

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.460
morality, mortality,
spirituality, astrobiology,

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.550
et cetera, start by explaining
how the first striving self

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.660
could emerge from chemistry.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.060
So here is the mystery laid out.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.230
We've got names.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.580
We've got names for what selves
are, for their properties,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.450
for their behaviors.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.060
We've got nouns and
adjectives and verbs.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:55.060
And they all remain as yet
unexplained by these terms

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.970
from the physical sciences.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.750
So you can call us organisms,
subjects, agents, individuals,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.550
living beings, creatures.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.440
You can even call
us spirits or souls.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.470
It doesn't actually
matter what we call them.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.400
These are names that flag
what has yet to be explained.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.640
They just are markers
that we use to say,

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.524
this is something we
have yet to explain.

00:08:17.524 --> 00:08:19.440
And you've got all of
these properties and all

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.050
these behaviors
as yet unexplained

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.454
in the physical sciences.

00:08:23.454 --> 00:08:24.870
Saying that you're
a striving self

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.660
is no more scientific
explanation

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.580
than saying you have a soul.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.350
Both of them are just markers.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.419
So naming is not explaining.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.309
Here are some
solutions that we often

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:40.299
move towards since we have this
gap, and it goes unexplained.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.400
And I'm going to suggest
that they don't work.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.470
Natural selection--
there's an idea out there

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.250
that the universe was rolling
along with its natural laws,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.080
and then, suddenly,
a new one enters

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.060
called natural selection,
and suddenly, it

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.979
gives rise to organisms.

00:08:55.979 --> 00:08:56.520
Doesn't work.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.300
Natural selection is actually
natural degeneration.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:02.050
It's selves failing
to self-regenerate.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.050
It explains the honing,
not what's honed.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.370
To say that natural
selection explains life

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.080
is like saying that
erosion explains mountains.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.330
Yeah, it explains
how they're sculpted,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.390
but not what they are.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.720
So I want to say natural
selection doesn't start life.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.030
Life starts natural selection.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.880
You actually have to have
striving selves before you have

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.270
evolution as we think of it.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.160
Another idea is
molecular replication,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.650
in particular, RNA molecules,
because they are so

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.510
important to us organisms now.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.360
But the idea is that you would
get molecular replication.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.160
What you've got
here are examples

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.070
of molecules not being created
from scratch as conservation

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:41.570
of matter.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.720
It's transforming of molecules.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.130
So you get these molecules
going through their chemical

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.240
reactions.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.280
But the chemical
reactions can appear

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.630
to strive, but then
so can anything.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.720
A river can look like it's
striving to get to the sea.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.730
And actually, chemical
reactions like that

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.170
are just going with the flow.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.390
So this idea that molecular
replication somehow

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.150
solves the problem will not do.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:07.820
And energy gradients
degenerate first.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:08.720
They peter out.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.480
You saw that in these two
examples I just gave you.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.280
But the material
order can remain,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.480
degenerating more slowly.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.130
It's still not striving selves.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.580
How about genes?

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.830
Genes sometimes is used for
the molecules themselves,

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.456
as if a DNA molecule is a gene.

00:10:27.456 --> 00:10:28.830
But mostly, what
we mean by it is

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.930
the sequences within the genes.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.210
Sequences are not
striving selves,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.490
but interpreted by them.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.350
DNA, if you lay it on
a table, is lifeless,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.620
so to argue that it's
the secret of life

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.210
seems to be missing something.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.520
It's not this magical
molecule that's sometimes

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.479
depicted as the secret to life.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.020
It's a little like saying the
text, which is also a sequence,

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.075
is striving to
tell you something.

00:10:51.075 --> 00:10:53.700
Another striving self is telling
you something with their text,

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.530
but the text itself
is not actually

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.865
striving to tell you anything.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.500
Or the alternative, which is
that it's just cause-and-effect

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.710
relationships, as if the
sequence, the genetic code,

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.570
which yields a one-to-one
correspondence--

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.530
a code is a material
cause-and-effect process--

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:14.310
is somehow all there is, which
is another popular notion

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.980
about it.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.370
I want to be clear on this.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.080
One of the places
where we get messed up

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.690
on this, and in the sciences,
and also in philosophy,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.480
is to treat it all as causality.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.910
Interpretation is not causality.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.360
A stop sign doesn't cause you to
stop unless you crash into it.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.500
We stop because we interpret
it, given our strivings, as

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.170
about traffic, for our benefit.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.290
So interpretation is
radically different from cause

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.170
and effect.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.290
Complexity, the reason I have
a frog on the cover of my book

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.720
is that in the book, I
pose the question, which

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.292
is more complex, a frog
or a frog smoothie.

00:11:51.292 --> 00:11:54.820
Now, technically, a frog
smoothie is more complex.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.610
There's poor correlation, and
there's almost no correlation

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.190
between the molecules,
once they're all shaken up,

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.500
once they've degenerated
with a blender.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:06.190
But also, they would
degenerate anyway.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.290
That's actually more
complex than the frog.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.180
The frog has more regularities.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.860
It would be easier
to describe, which

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.320
is the metric for complexity.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.410
So we often get
ambiguous with this.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.450
Is it more complex or
just harder to explain?

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.180
The frog is harder to explain,
and yet, less complex.

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.980
It's regularizations.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.860
It's the orderliness
within a frog

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.600
that is so impressive
and so hard to explain.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.080
How about AI?

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.850
Not striving, but
engineer-trained

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.410
to aid our striving.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.380
If you connected a
jillion AI supercomputers

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.220
on a sterile planet,
what do you get?

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.570
You get a sterile planet.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.830
That is, no quantity
of AI by itself

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:49.330
is going to yield
you striving selves.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.600
Quantum mechanics, quantum
phenomena doesn't strive.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.490
Striving selves persist at the
classical, non-quantum level.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.470
Like jilted lovers,
many researchers

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:02.310
would rather not discuss it.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:04.190
They dance around the
gap by equivocation,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.980
basically talking out both
sides of their mouths.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.220
I read these glorious
books by your neighbor,

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.690
for example, Robert
Sapolsky, who

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.398
wrote this wonderful
book called "Behave"

00:13:13.398 --> 00:13:17.500
all about the biochemistry
of motivation.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.070
I love these books.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.320
And yet, they are still
dodging the question.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.290
He'll talk about how a
molecule causes a motivation.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.060
It's not clear how that happens.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.970
And he doesn't seem
to be addressing it.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:33.770
You get a book like
"Information," a theory--

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.090
what is it, "A History,
a Theory, a Flood,"

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.530
by James Gleick.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.570
Wonderful book, which,
by the end of it,

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.180
claims that there's
information everywhere

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.337
and has always been, by the
end of the middle section.

00:13:45.337 --> 00:13:46.920
And then he goes
into the last section

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.850
about how we're now experiencing
a flood of information.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:51.630
Which is it?

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.640
Is it always everywhere?

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:55.921
Or is it something we can
experience a flood of?

00:13:55.921 --> 00:13:57.420
If we experience a
flood of it, then

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.050
apparently we are interpreting
it in a different way

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.306
than we used to.

00:14:02.306 --> 00:14:03.930
But the claim that
it's all information

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.910
is a kind of equivocation.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.200
So information can be
talked about so it's just

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.940
Shannon reductions
and possibilities,

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.540
or as a difference that makes
a difference for a self that

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.760
is striving to stay
alive, to regenerate.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.342
So that's the question.

00:14:23.342 --> 00:14:25.050
And I want to hear
your challenges to it.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.900
I want to hear you really
kick the tires on this,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.660
really push back if you have
trouble with the question,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.880
or if I haven't been
clear about the question.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.480
And then I'll go on to
a new proposed answer.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.270
No, intentionality would
be a subset of striving.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:43.200
The words get really
squirrelly in here.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.410
That is, they carry
a lot of baggage.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:48.450
In my last presentation at
biosemiotics conference,

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.180
I called it trying,
which tends to imply

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.130
a kind of a
psychological intention,

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.650
a will, a conscious effort.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.160
So I've ended up gravitating
to striving for two reasons.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.330
One, it's fairly clean on this
question of ghost and machine.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.100
There's a tendency
in this research to--

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.860
I think of it like
walking a tightrope line,

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:12.660
this question here, because
you can fall off into ghost,

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.140
basically homuncular-- that is,
you're anthropomorphizing what

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:16.970
goes on--

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.890
or into machine, mechanics,
cause and effect.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:22.380
So how you ride that is
difficult with the words

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.130
we've got.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.380
There are definitions
of intentionality

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.860
that would be broad enough,
that would cover what all living

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.690
beings do, but that's not
the vernacular use of it.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:34.710
And we usually think of
it as something willed

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.110
by a conscious, feeling being.

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.400
But yes, it is included in here.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.110
And by the way, I am not
just striving to regenerate.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:45.870
I'm striving, for example,
to communicate an idea.

00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.960
That is, by now, humans
have all sorts of headroom

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.200
and all sorts of distractions,
other kinds of intentions.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.540
But if you want to
get at patient zero,

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.040
you start with the
most basic, which

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.530
is pushing against this
tendency to fall apart.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.710
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
artificial intelligence

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.620
and the limitations thereof,
that you could hook up

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.980
a large number of artificial
intelligence machines,

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.680
and that you would still not
get a striving self out of it.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.060
JEREMY SHERMAN: Yes, nicely put.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.850
AUDIENCE: One of the
ways that we understand

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.410
artificial intelligence
today is just

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.990
a whole bunch of linear
algebra and neural networks.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.730
And that is very
much a calculator.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.140
Are you saying by that that
artificial intelligence

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.210
of today could not be
a construct of that?

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.480
Or could it be never that?

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.330
JEREMY SHERMAN: No, I'm
actually saying of today.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.621
And this is an important point.

00:16:31.621 --> 00:16:32.850
It's actually my takeaway.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.190
That is, once you
understand patient zero,

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:38.130
you have a new
angle on AI, which

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.380
I wouldn't know about because
I'm not an expert on it.

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.522
But I do think there's
potential for it.

00:16:42.522 --> 00:16:43.980
And there's someone
in the audience

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.520
who's paying close
attention to that potential.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.080
Anton right here.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.421
There we go.

00:16:50.421 --> 00:16:50.920
Yes.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:52.383
JEREMY SHERMAN: Yes.

00:16:52.383 --> 00:16:53.580
It's just not yet.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.280
AUDIENCE: So are you counting
viruses as striving or not?

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.863
JEREMY SHERMAN: It's
a great question.

00:16:57.863 --> 00:16:58.770
And I would say yes.

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:02.310
But to do that, I can't
just work from impressions.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:04.009
I have to give an
argument for that.

00:17:04.009 --> 00:17:05.800
So it's a difficult
argument and debatable.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.950
It's not altogether clear.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.530
The model I will give
you for patient zero

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:15.000
is like a non-parasitic
virus, without DNA.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.040
It's really got to
be simple, and yet,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.220
not impressionistic to do it.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:24.000
But yes, there is something
about them that does seem--

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.180
we talked this back and
forth, me and this guy,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:29.820
and colleagues,
including John and Anton.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.160
We explore this and wonder about
whether viruses count or not.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.340
But we think they probably do.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.330
Yes.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.887
AUDIENCE: So regarding
your slide on genes--

00:17:38.887 --> 00:17:39.720
JEREMY SHERMAN: Yes.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.594
AUDIENCE: --how would
you respond to the idea

00:17:41.594 --> 00:17:46.290
that a chicken is an egg's
way of making another egg,

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.350
and that it's not the DNA
that is the striving self,

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:54.156
but rather, the coupled system
between a ribosome and the RNA.

00:17:54.156 --> 00:17:55.530
JEREMY SHERMAN:
Well, even still,

00:17:55.530 --> 00:18:00.730
if you put ribosome and
RNA naked on a table,

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.980
they're not going to
be a striving self.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.070
But you're onto something.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:09.510
One of the things that life has
to do is it has to replicate.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.290
It has to reproduce.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.860
O use reproduce rather than
replicate because replicate

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.160
is a kind of thing you can
do without paying attention

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.600
to the work involved.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.400
You know, those chemicals
were replicating,

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.050
in effect, over there.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:23.400
No, reproducing takes work.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.310
So we have to explain
the work that selves do.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.840
You know, we go back and
forth between saying,

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.650
I have this body,
and I am this body.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.080
I'm going to argue that
what I am isn't my body.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.200
The body remains
there after I'm dead.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.390
It's still all right
there, the energy,

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.040
the material, the organization.

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:42.690
And yet, I'm gone.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.720
So I have to be able
to explain that and not

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.224
resort to phantoms,
not resort to ghosts.

00:18:48.224 --> 00:18:49.140
This is the challenge.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.290
This is what I'm going to try
to do in this next little bit.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.460
But yes, you take a sequence,
or you take a coding process,

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.050
extract it from biology, it's
not the striving self either.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:01.860
You just got to keep on--

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.045
it's a process of
elimination, saying, well--

00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:05.730
and that's basically what I
was going through with those

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:06.660
solutions that don't.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.610
Each of those have
been tempting,

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.294
and I'm arguing each
of those don't cut it.

00:19:11.294 --> 00:19:13.710
AUDIENCE: OK, so let's say you
have a very simple organism

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:16.240
like a non-parasitic
virus that you mentioned,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.290
which is striving.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:23.970
Now, if we could simulate
that with sufficient fidelity,

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.681
would the simulation
then be striving?

00:19:26.681 --> 00:19:28.680
JEREMY SHERMAN: I'm
delighted you bring that up.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.580
I want to propose a
contrast between simulation

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.200
and emulation.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.450
Simulation is done with
cause and effect, formalisms,

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.400
schematics, that sort
of thing, basically,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.710
arrows and pointers
moving from node

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.600
to node by my version of it.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.220
That is, you are modeling the
consequences of some behavior.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.500
Emulating would be actually
showing how the behavior works.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.660
And it's different
from modeling it.

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.390
And I'm going to
give you an example.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.930
Two slides after this is
going to be Anton's emulation

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.370
of the process I'm describing.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.710
If you can emulate
it, yes, you're

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.630
well along to being
able to understand it.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.610
But you have to work
with the world as it is.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:17.440
And it's not a bunch of
cause-and-effect arrows

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:20.290
and nodes, where you
get to label the node

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.537
and just talk about them
as pointing this way.

00:20:22.537 --> 00:20:24.370
I'll be saying a little
bit more about this.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:26.950
Emulation, I'm going to
argue, is something different,

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.770
and totally
achievable at Google.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.270
So that's one of
the reasons why I'm

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.970
interested in presenting here.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.130
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:35.240
I mean, well, we'll see.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.870
But I don't completely buy the
difference between simulation

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:38.490
and emulation.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.400
It seems like a--

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:39.850
JEREMY SHERMAN: Good.

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:41.558
And I haven't really
delivered on it yet.

00:20:41.558 --> 00:20:42.820
So let me see--

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.289
I look forward to your
questions and challenges after.

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:45.830
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:46.621
JEREMY SHERMAN: OK?

00:20:46.621 --> 00:20:48.990
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.180
JEREMY SHERMAN: OK, so
this is Terrence Deacon.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:55.492
I had met him shortly after
this book had come out,

00:20:55.492 --> 00:20:56.450
"The Symbolic Species."

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.040
He's spent 20 years as a
neuroscientist at Harvard

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.610
trying to understand
the emergence

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.730
and consequences of us having
language, "The Symbolic

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.700
Species."

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.780
And he had just moved on
to another question, which

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.350
culminated in this book in 2011
called "Incomplete Nature, How

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:18.720
Mind Emerged from Matter,"
famously a challenging book

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.040
to read, difficult to read.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:26.190
So my effort is to distill it
and some of this into my book.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.120
I think of him as a
natural philosopher,

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.660
which is what scientists
were originally called.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:32.280
He's a scientist.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.710
And yet, he's dealing with
philosophical questions,

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.130
questions that scientists
often don't get around to like,

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:43.290
what is a striving self, or how
does language actually emerge.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.980
He's also a very easy
person to talk to.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:50.130
We have a meeting at his
house every couple of weeks,

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.110
open to whoever is interested.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:53.820
That's how Anton got involved.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:57.270
No, Anton actually read
"Incomplete Nature"

00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.470
and decided he wanted to model
or emulate the process that he

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.060
proposes in here.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:06.460
John also joined up
through that meeting.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.180
We just get together
and explore this stuff.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:09.900
It's delightful.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.620
It's easy.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.800
It's apolitical.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.250
The guys never pulled
rank on me in 21 years.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.430
We just talk we work
on the problems.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.057
It's a delight.

00:22:19.057 --> 00:22:20.890
So here's the question
as I posed it before.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.250
"Striving selves are something
different from nothing

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.270
but chemistry.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.970
What, starting
with patient zero?"

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.970
And here, I'm going to give
you a grotesquely simplified

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:30.520
solution.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.300
It's a chain reaction that
generates chain reaction seeds.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.110
I'm not sure that Terry would
like that, but it gets at it.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:41.590
And here is Anton's beginnings
of the emulation of it.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:45.790
That is, he's imagining
a chain reaction.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:47.440
He's modeling a chain
reaction with all

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.910
of the stochastics involved.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:51.880
And these seeds
forming along the way,

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.250
they are color coded
to represent their,

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.840
in effect, viability.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.510
And this is very early
days for this research,

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.680
but he sees this as
a possibility for how

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.640
we can get at the narrowing
in on the kinds of molecules

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.850
that might have made
this process possible.

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.250
You'll notice that I said
that these were something

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.130
like non-parasitic viruses.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.130
But there's no DNA
in these things.

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.430
The reading of sequences in
the service of your striving

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.590
is not the kind of thing
you can imagine easily

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.350
coming about spontaneously
out of chemistry.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.360
It's a very complicated process.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:31.030
Terry has a model for
how we could get there.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.260
But we're starting
simpler than that.

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.450
And as I said, simple,
but not impressionistic.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.930
OK, now let me back up and
tell you how I got there,

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.430
how we get there, to your
to-don'ts, basically,

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.020
your experience of life.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.910
You focus rather than dithering.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.830
You could have done
dozens of other things

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.610
right now during your hour here.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.520
But you chose to be here.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.950
And you're not just everywhere.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.240
You're doing focused work.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.670
Your focus is a product of
self-control, everything

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:02.480
you prevent yourself from doing
consciously and unconsciously.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.270
And above all, you focus on
preventing the degeneration

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.600
of your ability to focus.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.470
So I'm going to be arguing
that you are a prevention that

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.820
prevents itself from ending.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.930
It's a process of
elimination logic,

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.030
very different from
the arrow kind of logic

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.090
we use in schematics
and formalizations.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:25.062
And it's the insight behind a
lot of very big breakthroughs.

00:24:25.062 --> 00:24:26.520
Pay attention to
what's eliminated.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.530
Darwin, natural selection--
to explain fitness,

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.450
attend to the
non-survival of the unfit.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.150
Shannon, signal theory--
to explain signals sent,

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.950
attend to signals not sent.

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.880
Ashby, H. Ross Ashby, who coined
the term "self-organization"--

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.920
to explain increased order,
attend to emergent constraint

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.507
on disorder.

00:24:45.507 --> 00:24:47.840
I'm going to have to say more
about emergent constraint.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.798
Here are two quotes from
him that I like a lot.

00:24:49.798 --> 00:24:52.920
"A self-organizing system
spontaneously reduces

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.460
the number of its
potential states."

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:59.830
"Observe what might have
happened, but did not."

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.860
Here's an example, an
intuitive example of it,

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:06.130
threading through a crowd and
others threading around you.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.000
You'll get these
streams of people

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.880
who are taking the path
of least resistance

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.654
that emerge by a process
of path elimination.

00:25:15.654 --> 00:25:17.820
Now, these are striving
selves, so it doesn't really

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.790
count if we want to
look for patient zero.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.000
But there are, of course, plenty
of non-living self-organization

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.446
processes.

00:25:25.446 --> 00:25:26.820
Now, the term
"self-organization"

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:27.564
is problematic.

00:25:27.564 --> 00:25:29.730
We were talking a minute
ago about problematic terms

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.230
like "intention."

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:33.354
It suggests a self
trying to organize it.

00:25:33.354 --> 00:25:34.770
And there are
plenty of people who

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.160
have moved in that direction,
talking as though if you just

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.430
get self-organization going,
and it gets complicated enough,

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.860
then you've got a striving self.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.410
I actually call it
emergent regularization.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.450
It's a constraint process.

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:50.440
And whirlpools are an example.

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.980
Auto-assembly, like
crystal formation,

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.140
and autocatalysis about
which I'll say more now,

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.350
because they're
essential to our model.

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.150
Auto-assembly is basically
crystal formation,

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:04.180
but all sorts of other processes
as well-- lipid membranes,

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.780
for example, which are
bubbles, or capsids,

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:08.960
which will be crucial here.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.360
They're like viral shells.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.582
They're not actually
constructed deliberately.

00:26:12.582 --> 00:26:14.290
They're not part of
the striving process.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.900
They actually fall together
just like crystals do.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:18.550
They fall to resting states.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.700
And their resting states, given
their complementary molecular

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.950
geometry, will yield you
regularized sheets, shells,

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:27.596
and tubes.

00:26:27.596 --> 00:26:28.720
So these are very exciting.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.360
Remember, we are
trying to figure out

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.460
how to explain the frog.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.060
Well, the frog is
full of regularity.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.480
So we might look
to this process,

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:43.340
auto-assembly, as a step towards
life, towards striving selves.

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:46.870
Autocatalysis is
basically a chain reaction

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:51.130
that grows a population
of multiple catalysts

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:54.580
that are all, in effect,
producing each other.

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.670
It's a population
explosion that grows,

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.890
depletes the resources
that it depends upon,

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.660
and then dissipates.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.960
So if you imagine you've got
these two molecules, x and y.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.930
And in this super
simplification of it,

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.360
they are both
transforming reactants--

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.220
I didn't get specific
about the reactants--

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.320
into more of each other.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:18.460
An X transforms an R into a
Y. And a Y transforms an R

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.280
into an X. And you get
this population explosion

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.390
of X's and Y's.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:24.970
But in the meantime, you're
depleting all the R's.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:29.107
And you end up with a
dissipation of the molecules.

00:27:29.107 --> 00:27:30.690
And the thing about
this autocatalysis

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:35.057
is, it's more likely to start if
you've got a cluster of the X's

00:27:35.057 --> 00:27:35.890
and Y's to start it.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:37.810
Yes, it could start
with one X producing

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.720
one Y that then
produces another X.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.130
But it's way more
likely to start

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:46.990
if you've got a cluster
of them in close range.

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:48.820
And often with
byproducts-- for example,

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.600
an X might split an R into
a Y in some other molecule,

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.920
which would also be crucial
to this explanation.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.420
Self-organization--
so like I said,

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.660
some people think that
self-organization is enough.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:03.890
It's a variation on the
complexity argument.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.290
If you get enough of this kind
of emergent regularization,

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.450
self-organization, suddenly,
it becomes a striving self.

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:11.650
We don't think so.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.350
It goes with the flow
towards overall degeneration,

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.160
and selves don't.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.320
They strive to regenerate.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:19.540
But still, this concept
of emergent constraint,

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.070
that is, reduced
possibilities emerging

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.260
throughout a dynamic process,
is of interest to us.

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.000
And we think
there's a way to get

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.710
at the origin, the patient zero
of striving selves, through it.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:35.140
So just to be clear on
the general principle,

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.650
the whole is less than the sum
of its parts possibilities.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:41.410
Any of those people threading
their way through the crowd

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.870
could have moved in a
whole lot more directions,

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.930
but those directions are
reduced through the congestion.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.820
And they end up taking
paths of least resistance.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.640
As some probabilities
become less likely,

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.470
others become more likely.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.040
What's presented is a
product of what's prevented.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.740
And so we got that
throughout the--

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.614
Darwin, Shannon, Ashby are all
playing with this key insight.

00:29:02.614 --> 00:29:04.530
And basically, what we're
doing is applying it

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.400
to this question, what
is a striving self?

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.240
If it's not your body, if it's
not your DNA and ribosomes,

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:13.060
what is it?

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.910
So we think of
self-regeneration as possibly

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.890
a higher-level
emergent constraint.

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:21.310
So we've come up with a testable
hypothesis for how coupled

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:25.420
self-organizing processes could
prevent each other from ending.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.660
And like I've said, it has
to be simple and yet not

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.010
impressionistic.

00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.500
I don't get to say, well,
it looks like it's striving.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:36.130
It actually has to be doing
work on its own behalf, fit

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.330
to its own environment.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.640
Requirements for
self-generation, very basic.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.960
If you think about,
OK, everything's

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.860
degenerating, how would you
keep yourself from degenerating,

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.480
you'd need self-repair,
regenerating

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.950
whatever degenerates.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.100
You'd need self-protection, that
is, preventing degeneration.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.540
And you'd need
self-reproduction,

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.248
because, eventually,
you will degenerate,

00:29:56.248 --> 00:30:02.310
and you need lineages of
self-generating striving selves

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:05.544
that have the capacity to
self-repair and self-protect.

00:30:05.544 --> 00:30:06.960
And out of these
three, you end up

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.360
with this interesting
challenge, what

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.610
I call selective interaction.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.060
We all deal with it.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.300
But it had to be there
at the beginning of life.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.630
That is, in order to do any
of this generative work,

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.106
you need to take in
energy and resources

00:30:21.106 --> 00:30:22.230
and put out waste products.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.691
And at the same time,
to prevent degeneration,

00:30:24.691 --> 00:30:25.690
you have to not do that.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.650
So you've got this going on
from the origins of life.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.230
And that's a challenge for
origins of life research

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:35.670
because the kinds of selective
membranes that we all rely

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.250
on, that let in some stuff
and not others-- pores,

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.660
and orifices, and all that--

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:42.360
you're not going to get that
by chance, just a lucky chance

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.000
that lets in all
the right stuff,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.080
lets out all the
right stuff, doesn't

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.850
let in all the
wrong stuff, doesn't

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:49.620
let in all the wrong stuff.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.560
That is a
origins-of-life theory.

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.480
And origins of
striving selves has

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.960
to be striving successfully,
outpacing the tendency

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.010
to degenerate from day one, that
it has to be able to do that.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.609
And this is a challenge,
the selective interaction.

00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:06.400
By the way, you're
still doing all of this.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.070
Obviously, self-repair,
you're striving

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.500
to keep fit and healthy,
sometimes consciously,

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.040
sometimes not consciously.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.079
Self-protection, you're
regenerating skin,

00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:17.870
staying clothed with
a roof over your head.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:19.514
Self-reproduction, kids maybe.

00:31:19.514 --> 00:31:21.930
And selective interaction,
which has gotten very elaborate

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.050
for human beings.

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.216
There's a little taste of
it in this room right now.

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:28.980
I'm suggesting something that
you can either absorb or avoid.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.100
People do all the time.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.016
We're always trying to
figure out what to take

00:31:32.016 --> 00:31:35.850
and what not to take in at
many levels, from, you can say,

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.820
the immune system to
our mouths all of this.

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:41.420
All of it's still going on.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:45.660
So here, finally, is that model
that I mentioned early on.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.500
And we got the emulation
of it from Anton.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.190
Here it is, the autogen,
meaning the self-regenerator.

00:31:53.944 --> 00:31:55.860
Imagine you've got one
of those chain reaction

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:58.380
processes, the autocatalysis,
but its byproduct

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.750
happens to be one of
those capsid molecules.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.630
So while it's chain reacting,
in the midst of that chain

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.940
reaction, it's
putting out molecules

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.760
that will form the
equivalent of virus shells.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.740
Not trying form
them, they just form.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:11.730
They fall together.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:13.770
That's the auto-assembly.

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.470
So you've got to
complementarity between the two,

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.417
where you get a chain
reaction, and then you've

00:32:19.417 --> 00:32:21.000
got these shells
that encapsulate what

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.210
I call starter kits or
seeds, that if they break

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:26.850
open in the presence
of more reactants

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:30.540
can resume the autocatalysis,
the chain reaction,

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.030
and resume producing seeds.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:34.680
OK, so let's take
a look at this.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.730
You got the reactant.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.510
You've got a cluster of
these catalysts in here.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.250
The purple molecules
are the capsids.

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:42.750
It breaks open.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.320
Let's say a big
molecule hits it.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.750
And it's got spill out
into the reactants,

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.830
which generates a
whole lot more seeds,

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.780
X's and Y's, that end up,
by happenstance, captured

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.060
within more of these shells.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:58.580
That's the seeds
or starter kits.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:01.980
Very simple model.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.050
Is there self-regeneration?

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.520
Well, it's repairing the
seeds as they degenerate.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.590
And the capsids protect
against degeneration.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:16.180
It generates varied and
evolvable autogen lineages,

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.940
and there's selective
interaction, though not quite.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.550
It's not actually choosing
when to be open and closed.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:23.609
I'll explain how we
get there in a minute.

00:33:23.609 --> 00:33:25.150
But at least you
have an alternation.

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.827
And the alternation
is crucial, given

00:33:27.827 --> 00:33:29.410
that one of the
things that has to fit

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.380
is environments where reactants
are only sometimes present.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.860
We think of this thing like a
ratchet it grows for a while,

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:37.510
and then it locks down.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.360
And while it's locked down,
it can survive in environments

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.680
where there are no reactants.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.170
That's why it's useful to have
seeds or starter kits that

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:47.310
are enclosed and basically
static at that point.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.470
So it's functional in
that it self-repairs

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.230
when broken for its own sake.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.240
Remember, here's a good
place to not be thinking

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.600
about intentionality.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.850
It's not trying to.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.657
It doesn't care.

00:33:58.657 --> 00:33:59.490
It's that conscious.

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:00.880
It's not willing all of that.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.562
And yet, we have to
start at that level

00:34:02.562 --> 00:34:04.020
if we're really
going to understand

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:09.420
that the self-repair benefits
the lineage of autogens.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.980
It's fitted, as I've mentioned.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:11.639
It's striving.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:15.210
When seeds are broken, autogens
respond with autocatalytic work

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:18.440
that regenerate seeds.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.246
Here's an example of
how it might evolve.

00:34:20.246 --> 00:34:21.620
We argue that, at
this point, you

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:28.296
have found a way to outpace the
tendency towards degeneration.

00:34:28.296 --> 00:34:30.530
It breaks open.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.630
Other molecules get into it.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.449
We have discovered a way
in which it can self-purge.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.790
That is, it will tend
to get rid of molecules

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.170
that don't facilitate it.

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.840
It breaks open, and
the molecules of copy

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.989
are the X's and Y's, not the
other molecules that are kind

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:46.440
of strays that enter into it.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.560
So there's a little bit of
self-purging at this point.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.760
But imagine that you end
up not with a Y but a Z,

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.330
and the Z happens to have
a different byproduct,

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.010
a different capsid molecule
that's a little rougher

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.910
on the outside.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:00.890
And the R's actually
stick to it,

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:05.710
making the overall seed rougher,
more likely to break open.

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.410
Now, this is the kind
of thing we can emulate.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.120
I'm not saying
this is the answer.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.940
But it does show the kinds
of things that could evolve.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.760
And it is an
attempt to show how,

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.410
from nothing but
physics and chemistry,

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:19.780
you could actually get a
striving self that would then

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.200
have the capacity to evolve.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.410
So you can see that
this one actually begins

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.670
to have selective interaction.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:30.780
It is more likely to open
in the presence of reactants

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.560
than in the absence
of reactants.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.020
And then as I
mentioned earlier, we

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:37.395
have a model for
how you'd end up

00:35:37.395 --> 00:35:40.830
with a template molecule,
a molecule like DNA or RNA

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.450
that has a sequence
that is actually

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:46.110
functional for
the striving self.

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:50.220
But we would argue, given
the complexity of making

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.126
use of a sequence,
you really have

00:35:53.126 --> 00:35:54.750
to start with striving
selves if you're

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.110
going to get to the level where
you can actually use DNA and/or

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.680
RNA.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.440
OK, so what's a striving self?

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.340
It's not a ghost.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.923
It's not something
added to chemistry.

00:36:03.923 --> 00:36:04.810
It's not mechanism.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.050
It's not the material energy,
cause-and-effect work,

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.490
or organization.

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.470
It's a self-regenerative
emergent constraint,

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:15.750
a synergistic coupling between
two self-organization processes

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:20.220
that prevent each
other's degeneration.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.240
What is the self then?

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.698
What is a striving self, if
you were to work all the way up

00:36:23.698 --> 00:36:25.140
to all of us?

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:28.680
I would argue that we are a
constraint that channels energy

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.510
into work that prevents the
constraint's degeneration

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:38.100
and that it came about
through a synergy between two

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.870
self-organizing processes that
prevent each other from ending.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:44.280
Your whole is less than
the sum of your parts'

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.447
independent possibilities.

00:36:46.447 --> 00:36:48.030
So I come back to
emergent constraints

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.060
because I think it may have the
most application in thinking

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:54.240
here about how to move
AI and other technologies

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.600
beyond where we already
are, to really push it.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.180
Observe what might have
happened, but did not--

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:01.740
emergent regularization,
as I said,

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.260
self-organization is
go-with-the-flow, local,

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:06.840
temporary generation of
energetic and material

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.860
regularities.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.900
Emergent
self-regeneration, though,

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.240
is selves striving
against the flow

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.829
to prevent their
own degeneration.

00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:15.870
And it happens through
this synergistic coupling,

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.750
where both of them stop
the other from failing.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:22.770
Autocatalysis, remember, it
grows and then dissipates,

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:26.940
while the capsids keep it from
losing all of its potential

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.650
before it dissipates.

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.920
And capsids will break
open and dissipate as well,

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.710
but the autogen
replenishes the supply

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.410
of capsid molecules, these
molecules that form the shells.

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.290
In general, though, there's
a methodological question

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.090
or proposition I want to make.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.570
Life isn't schematic or formal
like our engineering and math

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:50.680
simulations.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.800
It's running gauntlets, selves
constraining possibilities

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.780
to prevent dying.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.860
It's somehow figuring out how
any organism does anything

00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:01.260
like this, running
through the constraints

00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.690
because it is fitted
to the constraints.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:09.210
It has, internal to
itself, an agency

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:14.050
that enables it to avoid all
of the risks of degeneration.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:16.890
And in general, I find
that, across the fields--

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:19.607
in philosophy, in
programming, just

00:38:19.607 --> 00:38:21.690
across the fields-- we're
still using models that,

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:26.430
in one way or another, apply
point A to point B, kind

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.560
of a Euclidean approach,
that I'm going to say

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.760
is not quite how it works.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.390
Everything is
random at the start.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.100
And somehow, life
figures out how

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.700
to narrow in on possibilities.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.760
It's processes of elimination.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.770
OK, so just these two takeaways.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.260
To push the tech envelope,
pay attention to how tech

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.740
simulates but doesn't yet
emulate striving selves.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.230
And that's the thing
we can talk about.

00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:51.630
And the other is to
emulate, pay attention

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.390
to emergent constraints,
not schematic arrowing,

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:57.000
but dynamic narrowing
of possibilities.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.920
Thank you.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.060
Anybody have any
questions and challenges?

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:09.060
AUDIENCE: So one of the
interesting consequences

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:11.990
of the way that you've
presented this is that is it--

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:13.740
you mentioned it works
on multiple levels,

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.900
at the immune system
level or the organization.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:20.220
Is there any bias in
this for observing this

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:21.990
at any particular level?

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.780
Because you could look
at it from an ant cell

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:28.680
to an ant organism,
as we understand it,

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.200
to an ant colony, to
the super colony that

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.250
covers California
versus humanity's cell,

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:40.240
or a person standing here, or
their neighborhood, community,

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:40.740
society.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:43.410
JEREMY SHERMAN: Yes, wonderful.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.730
Great question.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.860
The people who are
doing this research

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.840
come at it from a variety
of different angles.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.464
My background's in
the social sciences,

00:39:50.464 --> 00:39:53.130
and most of what I write
is in the social sciences.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.589
And yet, it's all under the
influence of this model by now.

00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:57.380
I mean, the thousand
articles I've written,

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.470
they're all based on this.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.120
The political work,
the moral work

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.240
I do as a psychoproctologist,
it's all based on this.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:10.050
In our own research, though, we
keep focusing on patient zero.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:12.630
We are kind of
obsessed at that level.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.180
And we also have people
who come into the group

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:20.619
with some intuition,
some gut assumption

00:40:20.619 --> 00:40:21.660
that they want to uphold.

00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:22.951
They're kind of tethered to it.

00:40:22.951 --> 00:40:25.570
And they come to this work
like it's a Rorschach blot.

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:27.660
And they start to say,
wow, this proves that I

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.700
was right about this thing.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.970
I am delighted with how
we managed to keep that

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:34.210
from influencing the work.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.850
And a lot of this is
because Terry is a nerd.

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.960
He's dogged about this question.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.150
He wants to get it right.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:43.710
I've seen him change
his mind lots.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.300
I've changed his
minds about things,

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:48.567
and he's way more advanced
academically than me.

00:40:48.567 --> 00:40:50.400
He's not interested in
the status questions.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.720
He's not interested in--

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.630
I don't see in him
any ax to grind.

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:58.560
Yes, he would like life
to continue striving.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.940
But no, I haven't
seen that influence.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:03.330
We've got some biologists in
the group that are primarily

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.460
interested in multicellularity.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:06.864
We've got all
sorts of people who

00:41:06.864 --> 00:41:08.280
are interested in
the implications

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.280
of this narrowing-not-arrowing
approach

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.680
to all levels of living systems.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.960
We've got a few guys who
are really interested in

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.490
whether organizations
are organisms.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:23.160
And yeah, they can look like
it, but are they really?

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.380
So we have fussed
about that a lot.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.930
I, one point, was writing as
though they were, that there

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:29.940
were these super-organisms.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.000
And Terry laid out the
challenges to that.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.640
Just because it gives that
impression, it probably isn't.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.130
Let's look at what is the
criteria by which you could

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:41.370
say that something is actually
a striving self as compared

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.917
to an agglomeration
of striving selves

00:41:43.917 --> 00:41:45.000
that are achieving things?

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.600
So I love the way we employ
the power of neutral thinking

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.110
to the best of our abilities.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.154
And by the way, you cannot work
in science without the possibly

00:41:53.154 --> 00:41:55.320
that you will have spent
your entire life barking up

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.220
the wrong tree.

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.270
So I have no idea
whether this is right.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:00.750
But I am enthusiastic
about the way

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.280
that it addresses a
question freshly framed.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.400
AUDIENCE: I feel a
little bit like you've

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:14.770
reduced the original
question to something which

00:42:14.770 --> 00:42:18.190
is a lot more
tractable and, I think,

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:21.490
is a less satisfying question.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:25.240
But for a bigger question,
where does consciousness

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.852
fit into this?

00:42:27.852 --> 00:42:29.810
JEREMY SHERMAN: Well,
Terry's a neuroscientist.

00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:31.018
He's got theories about this.

00:42:31.018 --> 00:42:33.200
There are hunches about
how you'd actually get

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.850
to qualia and consciousness.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:38.240
I just got back from the
biannual Tucson conference

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.500
on the science of consciousness.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.260
And it's remarkable
how much there

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:46.670
they are talking as though
everything is conscious.

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:49.721
And then there's some
kind of quantum leap.

00:42:49.721 --> 00:42:51.470
It crosses a threshold
and then it becomes

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.850
conscious in ways we recognize.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:53.930
Then you've got
people who are saying

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:54.890
that there is no consciousness.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:56.450
And there's people who are
talking about it coming out

00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:57.660
at the quantum level.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.390
All this sort of
stuff, very satisfying.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:03.350
I don't think realistic at all.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.060
So it's one of the
questions that we

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:07.670
deal with, you know, Terry
having spent the first 20

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:11.840
years working on how language
affects consciousness.

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.540
I have hunches
about consciousness

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.340
being the really big difference.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.960
And I'm especially interested
in how it changes adaptation.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.600
That is, life has been
adapting for 3.8 billion years.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.330
And now, we're doing it under
the distorting influence

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:30.650
of language, which makes us like
these chronically hallucinating

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:33.650
mammals with all sorts of
interesting consequences,

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.670
positive and negative.

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:36.950
And how to manage
them, it's a focus

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:38.960
of another whole book of mine.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.400
But "satisfying" is a
really key word here.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.670
Yes, in many ways, this has
to be simpler because you

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:48.140
don't get any engineering.

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.570
You don't have life
already existing.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.410
And you don't get that the
light of the impression that you

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:59.120
have discovered how life
as you experience it works.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.880
It's going to have to be a
simple solution at this level.

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.970
And yet, I would argue that
whether you buy this solution,

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.100
this proposed answer
to it, or not,

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:09.860
that's the level to work on it
because if you cannot explain

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.780
striving selves, you are not
going to be able to get beyond

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.390
explaining hair
with wigs or quills.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:21.650
You're way up at the high levels
and assuming or assuming away

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:24.030
all sorts of stuff
at the lower levels.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:26.930
AUDIENCE: Is there a point at
which awareness, or awareness

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.300
of awareness, becomes
significant or important

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:30.100
to the definition.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.474
JEREMY SHERMAN: Yeah, it's
another area where we explore.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.310
We think that, basically,
what we're describing here

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:40.525
is what Terry calls
"vegetative sentience."

00:44:40.525 --> 00:44:41.900
I don't like the
word "sentience"

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.510
because it implies feeling.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:44.990
I like "responsiveness."

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:46.400
He and I have been
working on how

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.460
to find words that don't
carry a bunch of baggage

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.770
and yet nail it.

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:54.230
So responsiveness, there's
responsiveness from the

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.980
get go with these.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.490
If they break open, they
respond by doing work

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:02.600
to regenerate themselves,
to repair themselves.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.110
Then there's a feeling,
which is more like sentience.

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:07.700
And then there's
conceptualizing.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.410
These are the three that are
of greatest interest to us.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.410
And yes, there are a bunch
of wonderful articles

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:14.300
by Terry and
colleagues about how

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.500
it works at the higher levels.

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:18.080
But again, for
this presentation,

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.450
I really want to
concentrate on patients

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.790
zero, because if we
can't explain him,

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:25.699
we're groping in the dark.

00:45:25.699 --> 00:45:26.990
AUDIENCE: I take it too morbid.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:29.190
But where does death
fall into that cycle

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:30.820
of regenerating and this--

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:31.030
JEREMY SHERMAN: Death?

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:34.760
JEREMY SHERMAN:
Wonderful question.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.140
I am chronophobic.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.360
I am chronophilic.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.467
Death fascinates me.

00:45:39.467 --> 00:45:40.550
I memorize poems about it.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:44.210
Where does it fit
into this model?

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.770
What is dying?

00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:49.160
When one of these
breaks apart or opens

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.220
in the presence of
reactants, what is dying

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.889
is not the material form.

00:45:53.889 --> 00:45:55.430
The material form
can actually change

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:56.960
over openings and closings.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.990
That is, several generations
down the line, one

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:05.030
of these seeds may have
no molecules in continuity

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.030
with the original one.

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.030
And it's not the energy.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.700
The energy's coming
from the outside.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.850
What is being lost
is the constraint.

00:46:13.850 --> 00:46:19.670
When I die, my molecules are
free to do way more things.

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:22.400
Life is not an add-on to
physics and chemistry.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.240
It's a subset.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.760
It's a self-constrained
subset, that

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.890
is, me reducing
the possibilities

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:29.090
as long as I live.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:33.980
And as the synergies, by
now, through evolution, I've

00:46:33.980 --> 00:46:36.500
accumulated vast
quantities of synergies,

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.820
like the one we started
with, the complementarity,

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.820
where they both prevent
each other from ending--

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.980
we do that all the
time in our bodies

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:46.610
at so many different
levels, it's a marvel.

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:48.680
It's many PhDs.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.560
But what you lose
is the constraint.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:55.790
And suddenly, the
molecules are free.

00:46:55.790 --> 00:47:02.030
I read recently Dan Brown's
new book on origins of life.

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:06.260
And he tries to make
that a pretty picture, as

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:08.816
if everything is
moving towards entropy,

00:47:08.816 --> 00:47:10.190
and that means
that they're free,

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:12.020
and that means that they're
shining their light everywhere

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:12.561
in the world.

00:47:12.561 --> 00:47:14.600
That is not how entropy works.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.200
Entropy is things falling apart.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.185
And if life was about
maximizing entropy,

00:47:18.185 --> 00:47:20.060
which is also a popular
notion in this book--

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.840
Jeremy England brings this up--

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.440
then let's just
explode the sucker.

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.980
I mean, if you want
maximum entropy,

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.740
there are faster ways
to do it than we do it,

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:31.670
we living beings.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:33.420
We actually sequester energy.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.140
That's one of the reasons
why we've got petrochemicals.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.347
So the thing to pay
attention to here--

00:47:38.347 --> 00:47:40.430
I was trying to get to it
in the last two slides--

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:44.060
is that what I am is a
constraint on what happens.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.994
And when those constraints
start to fail, I lose my agency.

00:47:47.994 --> 00:47:49.910
And at that point, I'm
dead, and the molecules

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:56.440
are free to be in a whole
lot more configurations.

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.480
And often, with offspring.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.280
In fact, my fellow grandfather
of my grandchild is right here.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:04.870
Talk about offspring.

00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:08.230
This is my first time
at hecca tech Mecca.

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:10.810
I am delighted to be here.

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:13.060
I'm grateful that you
were able to give me

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.290
your attention for this time.

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:17.430
And do feel free to get in
touch about any of this.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:20.890
If questions, and challenges,
and kickings of the tire

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.520
come to you tonight or
any time, I'm around.

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.470
OK?

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:25.660
Very local in Berkeley.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:27.220
And thank you very much.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.870
[APPLAUSE]
