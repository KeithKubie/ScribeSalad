00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:04.560
Erosion, at fact, in some sense,
is easier to even think about.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.958
Again, I have a binary image B.

00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:09.700
And I've got a structuring element,
okay?

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.550
And now, my structuring element is this
little tall column here of just ones,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.700
and its origin is in the middle.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.000
And the way erosion works is,
I take my structuring element, and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.492
I run it over a picture.

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:24.520
I, and, and what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to take the AND of the ones i,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.530
in my structuring element with the,
with the pixels below it in the image.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.270
And I take the AND.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.200
Well that means that all of them
have to be a 1 for it to be a 1.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.200
So another way of saying this is,
when I put my structuring element down,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.660
all of its 1s that are touched
1s in the underlying image, or

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.990
I'm going to set the value to a 0.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.460
So before we take a look at what the
result is, let's think about where can

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.920
you put this thing down in this picture,
such that it touches only 1s.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.190
And you realize, well, I could put
it here with my origin there, right?

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.100
I could put it here,
with my origin there, and

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.640
the same thing over to this column.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.750
And that's the only place, and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.810
that's why the result of
this is this right there.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.325
And by the way,
I guess I didn't mention the other one,

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:13.840
this circle with a minus on it,
that's referred to as erosion and

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.223
the circle with a plus,
that's the dilation nomenclature, okay?
