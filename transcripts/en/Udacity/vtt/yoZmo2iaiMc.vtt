00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.410
The first property that we looked at is concerned with whether we understand

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.430
the problem we are trying to solve. Property two is concerned with whether we

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.190
have solved it correctly. We can state property two as follows, each level in

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.210
a design must be internally consistent. Technically, what this means is that we

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.470
must make sure that for each operation. Defined at that level.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.510
Each operation leaves whatever invariants are there true.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.460
That is, if the invariant was true before the operation took

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.650
place it's still true afterwards. The operations don't break anything.
