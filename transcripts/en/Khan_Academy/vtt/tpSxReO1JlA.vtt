00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.440
- [Instructor] A student
builds a circuit with a battery

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.410
and two light bulbs in series.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.840
Then the student builds
a second circuit with two

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.440
light bulbs in parallel.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.000
Which battery runs out of power first?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.590
Assume all bulbs have equal resistance.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.190
Assume both batteries have
equal electrical potential.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.640
All right, so let's just think about this

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.100
before we even look at the choices.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.750
So the first scenario,
you have your battery,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.840
positive terminal, negative terminal.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.320
And you have two light bulbs in series.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.800
So let's just draw it this way.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.210
And traditional light bulbs
really are just resistors

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.300
that when a current goes through them

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.450
they get hot enough, that's
because the energy dissipated,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.060
that they emit visible light.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.200
So that's the first resistor,
or the first light bulb,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.880
second one, and it goes back.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.420
So that's the first scenario.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.840
The second scenario looks like this.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.370
Plus minus, where they

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.820
are in parallel.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.060
They are in parallel.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.140
Just like that.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.870
And they say assume all
bulbs have equal resistance.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.350
So could just call their
resistances R, just like that.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.680
And we assume that both of these batteries

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.630
are, for the sake of argument, identical.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.280
So one way to think about it is,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.390
what is going to be the
equivalent resistance

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.700
for these circuits?

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.430
This one when you have
two resistors in series,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.020
you could simplify, or
you could do this circuit

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.020
as you have your voltage
source, which is our battery,

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.220
and you could model it as a circuit

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.900
with one resistor where
it's resistance is two R.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.330
If you wanna think of an
equivalent for this parallel

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.283
circuit, you have your
same voltage source,

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.830
and you could model it as
having a resistor there.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.250
And what would this resistance be?

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.610
What is equivalent to these
two resistances in parallel?

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.610
So if we call this resistance
sub two, we know that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.760
one over resistance sub two is equal to

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.760
one over R plus one over
R, and this is the formula

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.340
for equivalent resistance when you have

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.630
resistors in parallel.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.830
And so this is going to
be equal to two over R.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.150
And so if you just take the
reciprocal of this and this,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.130
you get R two is equal to R over two.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.720
So this is equal to R over two.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.920
Now, what is the power
dissipated across a resistor?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.610
We know, let me just do
this in a different color,

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.330
power dissipated across
a resistor is going to be

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.150
the voltage across the
resistor times the current

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.930
going through that resistor.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.290
Well, we know that the
voltage across both of these

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.890
resistances is going to be the same.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.620
So V is going to be the
same in either situation.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.033
But what about the current?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.065
Well we know that V is equal to IR.

00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:02.160
Or another way to think about it is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.960
current is equal to
voltage over resistance.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.130
So our current in this first scenario

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.330
is going to be V over
two R, while our current

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.330
in this second scenario is
going to be V over R over two,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.990
which is the same thing as two V over R.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.280
So our current in this second scenario

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.950
is going to be four times as large.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.950
So if you quadruple the
current and you have the same

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.050
voltage, well you're
gonna quadruple the power.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.730
And so if you're quadrupling the power,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.140
you're quadrupling the amount of energy

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.310
that's dissipated per unit of time.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.295
And so in this second
scenario where we quadrupled

00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:45.700
the power, we're quadrupling the energy

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.130
dissipated over time.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.560
That battery is going
to run out a lot faster.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.620
So they ask which battery
runs out of power first,

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.270
well that's gonna be the
batter in the circuit

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.610
with two light bulbs in parallel.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.593
And we're done.
