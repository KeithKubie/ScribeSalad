00:00:02.756 --> 00:00:05.886
&gt;&gt;Quin: My name is Quin and I live
on the Central Coast of California.

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:11.956
I really like to do embedded
electronics, soldering, hacking,

00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:14.426
3-D print ing and laser-cutting.

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:17.006
It's really cool seeing
your project come to life.

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:26.386
I used to do a lot of LEGO
stuff, like taking things apart,

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:29.546
and a computer is something
that you can easily take apart

00:00:29.546 --> 00:00:32.126
and sometimes not as
easily put it back together.

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:36.526
And so I got an interest in that
and I went to the Maker Faire

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:41.206
in San Mateo in 2011 with my dad
and so there I got my first Arduino.

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:44.126
This is the Arduino.

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:46.096
This is the main board, the Uno

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:48.786
and this is the Make
Edition for the Maker Faires.

00:00:48.786 --> 00:00:53.166
&gt;&gt;So here I'm using my phone and
when I text it a certain command,

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:55.876
like "LED ON", then it
goes through the Internet

00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:57.476
and comes back to the Arduino.

00:00:57.846 --> 00:01:00.936
&gt;&gt;The main thing that's special
about this is that you can program it

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:01.906
to do whatever you'd like.

00:01:02.436 --> 00:01:04.956
You can attach sensors,
such as light sensors,

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.846
and attach it also to LEDs or motors.

00:01:07.976 --> 00:01:11.246
Everything's open-source, which
means you can get everything

00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:15.826
for free online and one-by-one I
went online and looked at tutorials

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:17.146
and that's how I learned.

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:19.036
&gt;&gt;This a WeevilEye kit.

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.686
I used a soldering iron and
some solder to solder the kit

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:25.366
and basically solder is electric glue

00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:28.646
and so I bond the circuits
together using the solder

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:31.946
and thus the wires would be
connected inside this board.

00:01:32.556 --> 00:01:34.236
This could be used as a nightlight.

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:37.946
So when the room is darker
then the lights would turn on,

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:41.216
and as it went darker then
the lights would be brighter.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.926
&gt;&gt;James Hogeboom: Well, I didn't know
anything about the maker movement

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:48.316
until I heard about
Quin and it's pretty fun

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:50.376
when you have a gem right
there in your own district.

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:55.326
It's pretty cool to have a
student who's that curious and that

00:01:55.326 --> 00:01:58.316
into learning on his own, basically.

00:01:58.456 --> 00:01:59.326
&gt;&gt;Quin: This is filament.

00:02:00.456 --> 00:02:02.046
This is a soldering iron.

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:03.706
This is a Leatherman.

00:02:04.076 --> 00:02:05.616
These are solder supplies.

00:02:06.016 --> 00:02:06.886
These are breadboards.

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:08.756
These are Arduinos.

00:02:09.706 --> 00:02:11.546
And this is my 3-D printed logo.

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.436
&gt;&gt;James Hogeboom: Quin came to
one of our school board meetings

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:17.286
and he talked to the school board
about what he does with Arduinos

00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:19.166
and all those circuit
boards and things

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:22.036
and really gave us his
thoughts on how we need

00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:24.496
to be more engaging
as a school district.

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:28.746
&gt;&gt;Quin: The 3-D printer that
I have is called a Bukobot.

00:02:29.156 --> 00:02:32.656
&gt;&gt;So here's the filament and
it's basically a spool of plastic

00:02:32.656 --> 00:02:34.346
and it has the spool holder, too.

00:02:34.346 --> 00:02:39.506
It goes all the way down into here
and this is the main extruder part

00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:43.676
and so basically it melts it and
it spits it out in the nozzle.

00:02:43.806 --> 00:02:46.906
This axis is the X-axis,
so it moves side to side.

00:02:47.476 --> 00:02:52.076
This is the Y, and right here
and right here are the Z-axis

00:02:52.076 --> 00:02:53.726
and so these move up and down.

00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:56.996
First, you take your 3-D
model from Tinkercad.com

00:02:57.086 --> 00:02:59.056
and download it into
your host program.

00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:01.766
Then you slice it using
the program called "Slicer"

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:06.416
and this basically turns the 3-D
model code into 3-D printer code.

00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:09.636
And so the 3-D printer code
is basically a set of X,

00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:13.476
Y and Z coordinates that my
computer tells the 3-D printer to do.

00:03:15.206 --> 00:03:18.576
Layer by layer it prints a
3-D object with filament.

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:21.776
&gt;&gt;James Hogeboom: The power I think

00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:23.606
of the maker movement is
they're really focused

00:03:23.606 --> 00:03:26.036
on building something
that they think is cool.

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:28.656
They're not like, "Well,
here's our math problem.

00:03:28.656 --> 00:03:29.166
You need to learn it."

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:31.756
No, "Here's a cool project and
I want to build that project.

00:03:31.756 --> 00:03:34.106
Oh, and by the way I need
to learn about electricity

00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:35.626
and then engineering principles."

00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:37.996
They're learning all
these STEM kinds of things

00:03:37.996 --> 00:03:40.326
that are gonna be helpful
to them later on.

00:03:40.596 --> 00:03:42.056
But they're learning
it in the context

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:44.256
of something that's fun
and interesting to them.

00:03:46.836 --> 00:03:49.196
&gt;&gt;Quin: The hacker space I was
teaching my friends how to solder

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:52.906
as well as teaching them how to
use the Tinkercad.com software

00:03:53.306 --> 00:03:56.326
to design their own key
chain and 3-D print it.

00:03:56.326 --> 00:04:01.396
&gt;&gt;Click on the box and change
the one that goes up and down

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:04.406
to five or actually to three.

00:04:04.626 --> 00:04:08.156
&gt;&gt;I really like to teach other
people how to do embedded electronics

00:04:08.156 --> 00:04:09.516
in the Arduino and stuff like that,

00:04:10.096 --> 00:04:12.506
because once I teach them they
can teach some of their friends

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:15.966
and that overall makes
the maker community bigger

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:17.256
and everybody can help each other.

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:18.276
&gt;&gt;Is it working?

00:04:18.686 --> 00:04:18.806
Yeah.

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:23.276
&gt;&gt;Student: So I've noticed it
looks like that thing always stays

00:04:23.276 --> 00:04:25.896
in the same place and then that
board moves around a little bit.

00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:26.466
&gt;&gt;Quin: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:26.586 --> 00:04:30.786
So the X-axis is like that, Y
is like that and then Z is--

00:04:31.196 --> 00:04:32.916
&gt;&gt;Dale Dougherty: I'm
interested in this idea

00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.786
of Maker spaces finding
their way into schools

00:04:36.236 --> 00:04:38.726
and transforming a number of things.

00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:41.846
You know, the art studio
connected to the computer lab,

00:04:41.936 --> 00:04:44.796
connected to the shop class,
connected to the biotech lab,

00:04:45.186 --> 00:04:49.576
but the difference is instead of
directing students to do things,

00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:52.646
you're inviting them to
create things and make things.

00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:57.516
&gt;&gt;James Hogeboom: The self-confidence
and sense of self-efficacy

00:04:57.516 --> 00:05:01.226
that I think students get from
creating their own projects

00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:03.956
and seeing them be successful
and seeing that they can do it,

00:05:03.996 --> 00:05:05.646
that I think is so powerful.

00:05:06.596 --> 00:05:10.336
&gt;&gt;Dale Dougherty: We are defined
very much by our culture as consumers

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:13.356
and we're users in that
sense and what I'm trying

00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:17.016
to really effect is a
transition from that mindset

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:18.236
to one where you're a maker.

00:05:18.236 --> 00:05:22.286
The world around me isn't just
something that was built for my use.

00:05:22.376 --> 00:05:24.326
It's something that
I need to contribute

00:05:24.326 --> 00:05:26.086
to and I could change that.

00:05:26.086 --> 00:05:31.156
If something isn't the way it should
be I have the power and the sense

00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:33.476
of control to be able to do that.

00:05:35.116 --> 00:05:37.066
&gt;&gt;Quin: I look at everything
a lot differently now

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:40.296
because now I can see what's
in every electronic product,

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:44.936
what's in a smart phone, every
component in it, as well as what's

00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:50.186
in a computer, but other things
such as skateboards, bicycles,

00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:52.416
I could see different ways
on how to make it better

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:56.166
so that other people could
iterate on that design.
