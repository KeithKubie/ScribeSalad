00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.580
Kids absolutely love Disney movies and TV
shows and in turn they usually also love the

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.820
stars who are in them.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.740
While a lot of these stars make sure that
they are great role models for the kids who

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.750
love them, some of them make some major slip
ups.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.630
For this list we are taking a look at some
Disney stars who have committed crimes and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.119
are not such great role models after all.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.240
Here are 10 Disney Criminals That Kids Actually
Looked Up To

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.450
Britney Spears
Britney Spears has been through a lot over

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.730
the years and some people might actually forget
that the popstar actually started out as a

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.340
Disney phenom as a part of the Mickey Mouse
Club.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.710
Britney Spears has been arrested multiple
times and she was first locked up after being

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.629
involved in a hit-and-run accident where she
was also using an invalid drivers license.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.649
The singer has also had multiple stints in
rehab centers and has racked up her fair share

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.500
of charges for public misdemeanors.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.399
All in all, Spears serves as an example of
what can happen to a young impressionable

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:23.990
kid who reaches extreme levels of fame too
early.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.720
In recent years, she has gotten her act together
and seems to be sticking to straight and narrow

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:36.369
path and focusing on raising her kids.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.520
Matthew Broderick
Matthew Broderick is probably most famous

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.310
for his iconic turn as Ferris Bueller and
some fans may not even know that Broderick

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.569
actually voiced Simba in Disney’s The Lion
King.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.790
That makes him a legitimate Disney star, but
unfortunately it also makes him a Disney criminal.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.109
Back in 1987 Broderick was involved in a car
crash that actually killed two people and

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.439
although he was originally facing jail time
he ended up only having to pay a small fine.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.630
There is a new live action adaptation of The
Lion King in the works and do you know who

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.629
has recently been cast to voice Simba?

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.959
Hold on to your answer until the end of the
list!

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.650
Robert Downey Jr.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.069
Although Robert Downey Jr. may not be the
first name that comes to mind when you think

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.760
about Disney stars, the truth is that he is
biggest star Disney has right now as he plays

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.459
Tony Stark AKA Iron Man who is still the centerpiece
of the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.129
(one of Disney’s most successful properties).

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.739
According to RDJ, he has been addicted to
drugs since he was 8 years old, and he was

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.569
arrested numerous times on drug charges, and
went back and fourth to rehab.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:52.140
Fortunately, he’s been able to turn his
career and life around and actually uses his

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.669
troubled past to fuel his characters.

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.500
We think we speak for a whole lot of people
when we say that we are thankful for Robert

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.459
Downey Jr.’s redemption story!

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.070
Christina Aguilera
Another alumni of The star-studded Mickey

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.610
Mouse Club is Christina Aguilera and just
liker Britney, she too has gotten herself

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.010
into quite a bit of trouble over the years.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.709
Back in 2011, X-Tina was booked for public
intoxication and this definitely hurt her

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.000
image and career.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.220
Aguilera was able to find success again when
she became a Judge and Mentor on The Voice,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.840
but her status took a hit yet again when she
was in the car with her boyfriend Matthew

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.769
Rutler while he was being arrested for driving
under the influence.

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.129
Lately, we haven’t heard much from Aguilera
but she still does have one of the most powerful

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:48.640
voices in town so we wouldn’t be shocked
if she made a comeback sometime soon.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.599
Phillip Lewis
Most people actually don’t know this actor

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.730
by his name as he is far more recognizable
as Mr. Moseby from Disney’s hit show The

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.249
Suite Life Of Zack and Cody (and The Suite
Life On Deck).

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:04.909
Lewis’ character on the show was fantastic
but unfortunately his personal life doesn’t

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.680
shine so bright.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.480
The Disney actor has a pretty serious criminal
record as he was charged with manslaughter

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.590
for killing someone with his car while driving
drunk – not exactly the greatest role model

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.730
for young kids.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.110
Here’s a little bit of trivia for all you
fans of The Suite Life Of Zack and Cody - What

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.740
actor from the famous Disney show is now starring
on a new Netflix drama?

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.699
Answer will be at the end!

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.440
Lindsay Lohan
While she was never a television series regular,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.509
Lindsay Lohan was right at the center of a
lot of great Disney movies like The Parent

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.860
Trap, Life-Size and Get a Clue.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.710
As a youngster, it looked like Lohan was on
track to become a major star but unfortunately

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.620
those plans got derailed when she started
getting in to some serious trouble.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:00.150
Between 2007 and 2012, the actress got arrested
for everything from DUI to cocaine possession,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.750
violating probation, burglary and even a hit-and-run.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.430
The internet was bombarded with images of
Lohan looking more and more disheveled and

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.200
the once sought after Disney star transformed
into a cautionary tale.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.990
We’re definitely hoping that Lohan can turn
it around, as she is still quite young!

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.070
Demi Lovato
This former Disney Star has really transformed

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.440
her image in recent years.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.410
Starting out as a nerdy kid on Barney and
Friends and then a happy go lucky teen in

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.300
Camp Rock, Lovato is now a full-fledged pop
star whose songs are packed with adult themes

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.300
and racy outfits.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.380
While Demi Lovato may not have any arrests
under her belt, she did do a stint in rehab

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.690
for an eating disorder and what’s much worse
is that she has also confessed to doing heavy

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.740
drugs with Miley Cyrus and Joe Jonas.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.631
Eveyrone goes through some tough years, but
when you are a star like Lovato, you have

00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.919
a lot more people watching and that can be
tough!

00:05:55.919 --> 00:06:01.639
We are happy that she has found herself and
seems to be doing a lot better these days.

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:05.960
Shia LaBeouf
Whether you hate him or you love him there

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.740
is no denying that Shia LaBeouf is an interesting
guy.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.590
The actor got his start on the Disney channel
show Even Stevens but as he grew older he

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.300
quickly shed the Disney persona and started
starring in blockbuster films and bizarre

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.509
art projects.

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:25.750
Unfortunately, Shia was arrested in 2008 for
driving under the influence and he has been

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:33.740
involved in a lot of other bizarre stories
in recent years.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.569
At the end of the day, the guy is talented
but we can’t in good conscience recommend

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:57.240
that parents have their kids idolize him until
they are at least in their late teens.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.789
Orlando Brown
If the name Orlando Brown doesn’t ring a

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:05.569
bell right away, we understand, as the actor
hasn’t been up to much since his days as

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.419
a Disney channel star came to and end.

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:12.639
The That's So Raven alum has gotten into trouble
with the law numerous times since his show

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:14.560
went off the air in 2007.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:20.759
In fact, that same year, Orlando Brown was
arrested for possession of marijuana and in

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:23.910
2011 he received a DUI while driving with
his girlfriend in Hollywood.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.539
Then, in 2012, he was arrested twice for not
completing the conditions of his DUI.

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:34.210
This is definitely an example of a fall from
grace and we have to say that Orlando Brown

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:42.380
does not make for a good role model for kids
whatsoever.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.720
Selena Gomez
Photos leaked online of the actress/singer

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.150
being hand cuffed and put into a cop car and
they went even more viral because the star

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.310
was wearing basically nothing but lingerie.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:57.039
Thankfully, it was later revealed that this
was actually part of a video shoot for one

00:07:57.039 --> 00:07:58.930
of her upcoming music videos.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.810
The actress has been to rehab as well but
this was more due to the fact that she was

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.539
having a tough time handling her then recent
Lupus diagnosis as well as some other tough

00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:08.539
personal issues.

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:13.210
While the real Selena hasn’t broken the
law yet, she has definitely played some characters

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.210
who have.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.729
Can you name the movie in which Gomez played
a law breaking party animal alongside some

00:08:18.729 --> 00:08:20.650
other former Disney stars?

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.470
The answer will be revealed at the end of
this video!

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.960
And that brings us to the end of our list!

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.669
But what about those trivia questions?

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:29.189
Well, here are the answers!

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:30.189
Donald Glover will be voicing Simba in the
live action Lion King movie, Cole Sprouse

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:31.189
is playing Jughead on the Netlix series Riverdale
and the movie that had Selena Gomez wilding

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:32.189
out was 2012’s Spring Breakers.

00:08:32.189 --> 00:08:33.189
How many of these answers did you get right?
