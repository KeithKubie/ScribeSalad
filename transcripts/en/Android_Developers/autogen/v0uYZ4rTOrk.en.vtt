you can with app actions you can

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560
you can with app actions you can
 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.950
you can with app actions you can
basically get your Android apps to have

example if you live in San Francisco and

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:43.350
example if you live in San Francisco and
 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.500
example if you live in San Francisco and
you use the transit app at the transit

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:45.510
you use the transit app at the transit
 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.020
you use the transit app at the transit
station when you approach the transit

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.030
station when you approach the transit
 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.750
station when you approach the transit
station it knows that particular context

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:50.760
station it knows that particular context
 

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.190
station it knows that particular context
and it will automatically show a

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:52.200
and it will automatically show a
 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.820
and it will automatically show a
suggestion for the transit app and those

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:55.830
suggestion for the transit app and those
 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.680
suggestion for the transit app and those
are the types of predictions that we can

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:57.690
are the types of predictions that we can
 

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.839
are the types of predictions that we can
do based on many different inputs of

00:07:59.839 --> 00:07:59.849
do based on many different inputs of
 

00:07:59.849 --> 00:08:05.320
do based on many different inputs of
context and routines we are also

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:05.330
context and routines we are also
 

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.629
context and routines we are also
directly working with app actions and

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639
directly working with app actions and
 

00:08:08.639 --> 00:08:12.050
directly working with app actions and
things like smart select so in an email

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.060
things like smart select so in an email

if I click on floor in this particular

00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:27.419
if I click on floor in this particular
 

00:08:27.419 --> 00:08:29.779
if I click on floor in this particular
example it basically selects the whole

00:08:29.779 --> 00:08:29.789
example it basically selects the whole
 

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:31.850
example it basically selects the whole
floor and water which is a restaurant

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:31.860
floor and water which is a restaurant
 

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.089
floor and water which is a restaurant
and shows me the action for reserving a

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099
and shows me the action for reserving a
 

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:37.730
and shows me the action for reserving a
table using open table now when I click

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:37.740
table using open table now when I click
 

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.740
table using open table now when I click
on open table it immediately takes me to

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:39.750
on open table it immediately takes me to
 

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.719
on open table it immediately takes me to
the open tables floor and water page

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:41.729
the open tables floor and water page
 

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:44.240
the open tables floor and water page
where basically I can book the table

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.250
where basically I can book the table
 

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.630
where basically I can book the table
immediately so these are all ways in

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640
immediately so these are all ways in
 

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.930
immediately so these are all ways in
which app actions surface across many

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940
which app actions surface across many
 

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.330
which app actions surface across many
different places for

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:52.340

now let's take a look at some of the

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:47.270
now let's take a look at some of the
 

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.510
now let's take a look at some of the
steps of creating app actions to achieve

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:49.520
steps of creating app actions to achieve
 

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.180
steps of creating app actions to achieve
just that so first using tools you're

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:52.190
just that so first using tools you're
 

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.100
just that so first using tools you're
all familiar with for building and

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:54.110
all familiar with for building and
 

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:56.050
all familiar with for building and
publishing Android apps namely the

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:56.060
publishing Android apps namely the
 

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.550
publishing Android apps namely the
Android studio and the Play Developer

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560
Android studio and the Play Developer
 

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.430
Android studio and the Play Developer
console you'll create an actions XML

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440
console you'll create an actions XML
 

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.130
console you'll create an actions XML
file and this is the central place for

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:03.140
file and this is the central place for
 

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.460
file and this is the central place for
all of the actions that your Android app

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:05.470
all of the actions that your Android app
 

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.010
all of the actions that your Android app
can't support there are two key pieces

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:08.020
can't support there are two key pieces
 

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.810
can't support there are two key pieces
of information that you'll need to

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:09.820
of information that you'll need to
 

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.150
of information that you'll need to
provide for each action and that is the

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160
provide for each action and that is the
 

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.710
provide for each action and that is the
intent and the fulfillment which

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720
intent and the fulfillment which
 

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.840
intent and the fulfillment which
describes the what and the how of your

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:15.850
describes the what and the how of your
 

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:18.690
describes the what and the how of your
actions so let's dive deeper into some

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:18.700
actions so let's dive deeper into some
 

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.430
actions so let's dive deeper into some
of these concepts and we'll start with

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.440
of these concepts and we'll start with
 

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.200
of these concepts and we'll start with
built-in intents which is how you

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:22.210
built-in intents which is how you
 

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:25.770
built-in intents which is how you
indicate what your action does my team

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:25.780
indicate what your action does my team
 

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.900
indicate what your action does my team

actions if you think about the way users
ask for information there's a myriad of

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:39.940
ask for information there's a myriad of
 

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.150
ask for information there's a myriad of
linguistic variations that they can use

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160
linguistic variations that they can use
 

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.520
linguistic variations that they can use
to construct their query so for example

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:44.530
to construct their query so for example
 

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.980
to construct their query so for example
they can say calming activities or they

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:46.990
they can say calming activities or they
 

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:49.110
they can say calming activities or they
can say breathing exercises to relax

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120
can say breathing exercises to relax
 

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.960
can say breathing exercises to relax
about a presentation or they can ask for

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:51.970
about a presentation or they can ask for
 

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.110
about a presentation or they can ask for
10-minute meditation techniques all of

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120
10-minute meditation techniques all of
 

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.240
10-minute meditation techniques all of
these queries they indicate that the

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.250
these queries they indicate that the
 

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.430
these queries they indicate that the
user would like to de-stress or they'd

00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440
user would like to de-stress or they'd
 

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.720
user would like to de-stress or they'd
like to calm down

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:00.730
like to calm down
 

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.390

so we've designed built-in intense in

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:03.400
so we've designed built-in intense in
 

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.240
so we've designed built-in intense in
such a way that they abstract away all

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:06.250
such a way that they abstract away all
 

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.670
such a way that they abstract away all
of the natural linguistic variations and

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680
of the natural linguistic variations and
 

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.920
of the natural linguistic variations and
we pass on only the relevant information

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:10.930

we'll show you how to do that at the end
of this talk now let's talk about

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:01.270
of this talk now let's talk about
 

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.170
of this talk now let's talk about
fulfillment which describes how a user

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:04.180
fulfillment which describes how a user
 

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.050
fulfillment which describes how a user
would invoke a specific action within

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.060
would invoke a specific action within
 

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.810
would invoke a specific action within
your app so when users express an action

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:09.820
your app so when users express an action
 

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.510
your app so when users express an action
that they'd like to accomplish a task or

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:12.520
that they'd like to accomplish a task or
 

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.940
that they'd like to accomplish a task or
an intent that they have you can help

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:14.950
an intent that they have you can help
 

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.220
an intent that they have you can help
them fulfill that action by specifying

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.230
them fulfill that action by specifying
 

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.639
them fulfill that action by specifying
deep links into your

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:18.649
deep links into your
 

00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:21.670
deep links into your
Android apps so in your actions XML you

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680
Android apps so in your actions XML you
 

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.439
Android apps so in your actions XML you
can define the mapping between the

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:23.449
can define the mapping between the
 

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:25.509
can define the mapping between the
built-in intents and the deep link URL

00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519
built-in intents and the deep link URL
 

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:28.269
built-in intents and the deep link URL
and this will enable Google to show the

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:28.279
and this will enable Google to show the
 

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:30.249
and this will enable Google to show the
right content to your users from your

00:13:30.249 --> 00:13:30.259
right content to your users from your
 

00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:32.319
right content to your users from your
Android app and deep link them directly

00:13:32.319 --> 00:13:32.329
Android app and deep link them directly
 

00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:34.900
Android app and deep link them directly
into the experience that they seek in

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:34.910
into the experience that they seek in
 

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:38.499
into the experience that they seek in
that specific moment so we have two

00:13:38.499 --> 00:13:38.509
that specific moment so we have two
 

00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:40.900
that specific moment so we have two
models for fulfillment in the first

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:40.910
models for fulfillment in the first
 

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.480
models for fulfillment in the first
model which is the URL template model we

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:43.490
model which is the URL template model we
 

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:46.299
model which is the URL template model we
construct the deep link URL based on the

00:13:46.299 --> 00:13:46.309
construct the deep link URL based on the
 

00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:49.329
construct the deep link URL based on the
user's query parameters and your actions

00:13:49.329 --> 00:13:49.339
user's query parameters and your actions
 

00:13:49.339 --> 00:13:51.699
user's query parameters and your actions
XML will tell us how to map the

00:13:51.699 --> 00:13:51.709
XML will tell us how to map the
 

00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:54.249
XML will tell us how to map the
parameters from the built in intent to

00:13:54.249 --> 00:13:54.259
parameters from the built in intent to
 

00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:56.799
parameters from the built in intent to
the URL parameters and this model is

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:56.809
the URL parameters and this model is
 

00:13:56.809 --> 00:13:59.829
the URL parameters and this model is
ideal for action centric apps with deep

00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839
ideal for action centric apps with deep
 

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.439
ideal for action centric apps with deep
link api's and in the content driven

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:02.449
link api's and in the content driven
 

00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:05.319
link api's and in the content driven
model we discover the the fulfillment

00:14:05.319 --> 00:14:05.329
model we discover the the fulfillment
 

00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:09.129
model we discover the the fulfillment
URL through your web content or the

00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:09.139
URL through your web content or the
 

00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:10.960
URL through your web content or the
structured data that you give us and

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:10.970
structured data that you give us and
 

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.720
structured data that you give us and
then based on the user's query we find

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:13.730
then based on the user's query we find
 

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.609
then based on the user's query we find
the relevant content and then use your

00:14:15.609 --> 00:14:15.619
the relevant content and then use your
 

00:14:15.619 --> 00:14:18.910
the relevant content and then use your
actions XML to connect the content to

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:18.920
actions XML to connect the content to
 

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.660
actions XML to connect the content to
the appropriate intent so let's see an

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:22.670
the appropriate intent so let's see an
 

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.759
the appropriate intent so let's see an
example of how this would work and we'll

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:24.769
example of how this would work and we'll
 

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:26.980
example of how this would work and we'll
use the Coursera Android app and we'll

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:26.990
use the Coursera Android app and we'll
 

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.629
use the Coursera Android app and we'll
show you how they registered for the

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639
show you how they registered for the
 

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:31.090
show you how they registered for the
action of take course and the reason

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:31.100
action of take course and the reason
 

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.679
action of take course and the reason
that they want to do this is so that

00:14:32.679 --> 00:14:32.689
that they want to do this is so that
 

00:14:32.689 --> 00:14:35.019
that they want to do this is so that
when a user comes to the Android and

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:35.029
when a user comes to the Android and
 

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:37.030
when a user comes to the Android and
they want to they want to know

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:37.040
they want to they want to know
 

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.579
they want to they want to know
information about courses or education

00:14:39.579 --> 00:14:39.589
information about courses or education
 

00:14:39.589 --> 00:14:42.579
information about courses or education
we can ensure that the Coursera app is

00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:42.589
we can ensure that the Coursera app is
 

00:14:42.589 --> 00:14:45.400
we can ensure that the Coursera app is
shown to them as a suggestion and for

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:45.410
shown to them as a suggestion and for
 

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.169
shown to them as a suggestion and for
this demo we'll also show you how the

00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:47.179
this demo we'll also show you how the
 

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:48.790
this demo we'll also show you how the
suggestion will show up on the Google

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800
suggestion will show up on the Google
 

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.230
suggestion will show up on the Google
assistant so for the built in intent we

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240
assistant so for the built in intent we
 

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.389
assistant so for the built in intent we
created one and it's called take course

00:14:55.389 --> 00:14:55.399
created one and it's called take course
 

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:58.749
created one and it's called take course
and it takes a single parameter of the

00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759
and it takes a single parameter of the
 

00:14:58.759 --> 00:15:01.059
and it takes a single parameter of the
type course and this is the parameter

00:15:01.059 --> 00:15:01.069
type course and this is the parameter
 

00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:03.879
type course and this is the parameter
that if you were to implement to

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:03.889
that if you were to implement to
 

00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:06.160
that if you were to implement to
register for this particular intent you

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:06.170
register for this particular intent you
 

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.989
register for this particular intent you
would need to handle it from the user's

00:15:07.989 --> 00:15:07.999
would need to handle it from the user's
 

00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:10.569
would need to handle it from the user's
query and so for example the user might

00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:10.579
query and so for example the user might
 

00:15:10.579 --> 00:15:12.549
query and so for example the user might
say take a machine learning course with

00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:12.559
say take a machine learning course with
 

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:14.859
say take a machine learning course with
Coursera and the assistant will know

00:15:14.859 --> 00:15:14.869
Coursera and the assistant will know
 

00:15:14.869 --> 00:15:18.069
Coursera and the assistant will know
that machine learning is of type course

00:15:18.069 --> 00:15:18.079
that machine learning is of type course
 

00:15:18.079 --> 00:15:21.489
that machine learning is of type course

that named it about because that's what

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600
that named it about because that's what
 

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.960
that named it about because that's what
the course is about now you might wonder

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:31.970
the course is about now you might wonder
 

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:32.590
the course is about now you might wonder
how to

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600
how to
 

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.689
how to
you will exactly know this particular

and there's a page called machine

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:44.990
and there's a page called machine
 

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.439

learning and it is associated with a

00:15:47.439 --> 00:15:47.449
learning and it is associated with a
 

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:50.620
learning and it is associated with a
specific URL so this is an example of

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:50.630
specific URL so this is an example of
 

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.620
specific URL so this is an example of
the content-based fulfillment that we

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:52.630
the content-based fulfillment that we
 

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:56.340
the content-based fulfillment that we
talked about a couple of slides back and

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:56.350
talked about a couple of slides back and
 

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.430
talked about a couple of slides back and
so to bring these two things together we

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440
so to bring these two things together we
 

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.910
so to bring these two things together we
have our actions XML and we tie these

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920
have our actions XML and we tie these
 

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.920
have our actions XML and we tie these
two things together in a really simple

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:05.930
two things together in a really simple
 

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:09.100
two things together in a really simple
way so first you register for the built

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.110
way so first you register for the built
 

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.009
way so first you register for the built
in intent of take cores and then we take

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:12.019
in intent of take cores and then we take
 

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.860
in intent of take cores and then we take
the course parameter and map it to the

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:14.870
the course parameter and map it to the
 

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.319
the course parameter and map it to the
main web page URL for Coursera for

00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:17.329
main web page URL for Coursera for
 

00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:20.550
main web page URL for Coursera for
learning and that's it it is that simple

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560
learning and that's it it is that simple
 

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.710
learning and that's it it is that simple
so let's now see how this app action

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720
so let's now see how this app action
 

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.410
so let's now see how this app action
will show up on my pixel device in the

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:26.420
will show up on my pixel device in the
 

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.309
will show up on my pixel device in the
assistant so let's go to the assistant

00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:30.319
assistant so let's go to the assistant
 

00:16:30.319 --> 00:16:35.579
assistant so let's go to the assistant
and we'll ask it about machine learning

00:16:35.579 --> 00:16:35.589
and we'll ask it about machine learning
 

00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:42.170
and we'll ask it about machine learning
machine learning

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180
 

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:46.440
great so what we see here is a basic

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:46.450
great so what we see here is a basic
 

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.300
great so what we see here is a basic
part about machine learning from the

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:48.310
part about machine learning from the
 

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.940
part about machine learning from the
assistant but now below in the

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:50.950
assistant but now below in the
 

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.060
assistant but now below in the
suggestions we see the take force action

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:54.070
suggestions we see the take force action
 

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.310
suggestions we see the take force action
that we just created and we know that

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320
that we just created and we know that
 

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.139
that we just created and we know that
it's from Coursera because of the apps

00:16:58.139 --> 00:16:58.149
it's from Coursera because of the apps
 

00:16:58.149 --> 00:17:00.449
it's from Coursera because of the apps
icon now let's see what happens when I

00:17:00.449 --> 00:17:00.459

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:10.350
then I'm going to create an Android app
 

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.530
then I'm going to create an Android app
which basically talks to the web server

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:12.540
which basically talks to the web server
 

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.230
which basically talks to the web server
to get that users information provided

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240
to get that users information provided
 

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.150
to get that users information provided
back to my app which will render it

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:17.160
back to my app which will render it
 

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.180
back to my app which will render it
based on the UI design of my app the

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:20.190
based on the UI design of my app the
 

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.250
based on the UI design of my app the
same concept works for our friends down

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:22.260
same concept works for our friends down
 

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.610
same concept works for our friends down
the street and it also works for ever

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620
the street and it also works for ever
 

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.600

based interface to your app when you

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:29.610
based interface to your app when you
 

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.570
based interface to your app when you
then go to conversational agents what

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580
then go to conversational agents what
 

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.650
then go to conversational agents what
you're going to do is you're going to

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:33.660
you're going to do is you're going to
 

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.440
you're going to do is you're going to
create a conversational agent which

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:36.450
create a conversational agent which
 

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.480
create a conversational agent which
basically will talk to your web server

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:38.490
basically will talk to your web server
 

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.850
basically will talk to your web server
using the same API same infrastructure

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860
using the same API same infrastructure
 

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.549
using the same API same infrastructure
that you're provided what happens is for

00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559
that you're provided what happens is for
 

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:45.020
that you're provided what happens is for
a query of

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:45.030
a query of
 

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:48.320
a query of
what tasks do I have today the assistant

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:48.330
what tasks do I have today the assistant
 

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.390
what tasks do I have today the assistant
will take care of all of the natural

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400
will take care of all of the natural
 

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.060
will take care of all of the natural
language processing query understanding

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:53.070
language processing query understanding
 

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.700
language processing query understanding
it understands what the query is and

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:55.710
it understands what the query is and
 

00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:00.110
it understands what the query is and
then invokes your agent your agent will

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120
then invokes your agent your agent will
 

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.920
then invokes your agent your agent will
then basically you understand that query

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:03.930
then basically you understand that query
 

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.750
then basically you understand that query
and now your agent has to actually do a

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760
and now your agent has to actually do a
 

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.840
and now your agent has to actually do a
fulfillment for that query so to do the

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:08.850
fulfillment for that query so to do the
 

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.060
fulfillment for that query so to do the
fulfillment what you're going to do is

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:11.070
fulfillment what you're going to do is
 

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.580
fulfillment what you're going to do is
you're going to use a web hook which

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:13.590
you're going to use a web hook which
 

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.890
you're going to use a web hook which
will connect to the web server on your

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900
will connect to the web server on your
 

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.740
will connect to the web server on your
back-end and then provide the response

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:18.750
back-end and then provide the response
 

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:21.530

developers what he did is they thought
 

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.519
developers what he did is they thought
of this very specific use case and built

00:31:58.519 --> 00:31:58.529
of this very specific use case and built
 

00:31:58.529 --> 00:32:00.859
of this very specific use case and built
a conversational action so here are my

00:32:00.859 --> 00:32:00.869
