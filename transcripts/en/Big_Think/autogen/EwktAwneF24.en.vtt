physics it basically it's a list of

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070
physics it basically it's a list of
 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.860
physics it basically it's a list of
particles and how they interact in some

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870
particles and how they interact in some
 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.140
particles and how they interact in some
sense so there's it turns out there are

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
sense so there's it turns out there are
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.050
sense so there's it turns out there are
particles called quarks which experience

electromagnetism and gravity which is
 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.980
electromagnetism and gravity which is
negligible so we'll ignore it for now as

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
negligible so we'll ignore it for now as
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.540

what we call three generations of
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.310

force and gravity and basically that's

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
force and gravity and basically that's
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.810
force and gravity and basically that's
the stain of all where fall short is in

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820
the stain of all where fall short is in
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.640
the stain of all where fall short is in
explaining masses in fact there's some

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
explaining masses in fact there's some
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.859
explaining masses in fact there's some
aspect of this animal we expect to be

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
aspect of this animal we expect to be
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.050
aspect of this animal we expect to be
completed very soon and there's another

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
completed very soon and there's another
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.700
completed very soon and there's another
more subtle aspect so let me explain

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
more subtle aspect so let me explain
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.789
more subtle aspect so let me explain
those so first of all it's important to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
those so first of all it's important to
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.609
those so first of all it's important to
know that if all the symmetries were

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
know that if all the symmetries were
 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.679
know that if all the symmetries were
that are part of the standard model were

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689
that are part of the standard model were
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.020
that are part of the standard model were
there forever every particle wouldn't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
there forever every particle wouldn't
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.399
there forever every particle wouldn't
have masked the fundamental particles

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
have masked the fundamental particles
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.230
have masked the fundamental particles
wouldn't have masked now we know

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
wouldn't have masked now we know
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760
wouldn't have masked now we know
fundamental particles have mass so the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770
fundamental particles have mass so the
 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.230
fundamental particles have mass so the
question is how does that happen

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
question is how does that happen
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.030
question is how does that happen
and it's because there's a small

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
and it's because there's a small
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700
and it's because there's a small
breaking of these symmetries a small

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
breaking of these symmetries a small
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800
breaking of these symmetries a small
breaking of the symmetries and it's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
breaking of the symmetries and it's
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.450
breaking of the symmetries and it's
associated with a mass scale so there's

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
associated with a mass scale so there's
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.130
associated with a mass scale so there's
some Maskell at which the nature of the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
some Maskell at which the nature of the
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.350
some Maskell at which the nature of the
theory changes in some sense and there's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
theory changes in some sense and there's
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.639
theory changes in some sense and there's
a particle called the Higgs particle

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
a particle called the Higgs particle
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.889
a particle called the Higgs particle
associated with that the Higgs particle

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
associated with that the Higgs particle
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.530
associated with that the Higgs particle
is associated with the mechanism through

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
is associated with the mechanism through
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.130
is associated with the mechanism through
which fundamental particles acquire mass

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140
which fundamental particles acquire mass
 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.649
which fundamental particles acquire mass
but I know it's a mouthful but that's

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
but I know it's a mouthful but that's
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.510
but I know it's a mouthful but that's
what happens and so that one of the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
what happens and so that one of the
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.060
what happens and so that one of the
things we want to understand is is there

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
things we want to understand is is there
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.620
things we want to understand is is there
this Higgs particle we haven't found it

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
this Higgs particle we haven't found it
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.660
this Higgs particle we haven't found it
yet I mean the theory seems to only make

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
yet I mean the theory seems to only make
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.730
yet I mean the theory seems to only make
sense if something like it Higgs

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
sense if something like it Higgs
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.380
sense if something like it Higgs
particle is there but no one has

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
particle is there but no one has
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.779
particle is there but no one has
observed data so one thing is to find a

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
observed data so one thing is to find a
 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.320
observed data so one thing is to find a
Higgs particle study its properties but

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
Higgs particle study its properties but
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.870
Higgs particle study its properties but
another thing is to understand

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880
another thing is to understand
 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.480
another thing is to understand
where does this math skill come from why

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490
where does this math skill come from why
 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.940
where does this math skill come from why
is this mass scale so small compared to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950
is this mass scale so small compared to
 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.590
is this mass scale so small compared to
other scales that exist in the problem

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600
other scales that exist in the problem
 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.370
other scales that exist in the problem
and also why our forces are such

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380
and also why our forces are such
 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.040
and also why our forces are such
different strength gravity is much much

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
different strength gravity is much much
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.680
different strength gravity is much much
weaker than the other fundamental forces

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690
weaker than the other fundamental forces
 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.450
weaker than the other fundamental forces
when acting on elementary particles and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460
when acting on elementary particles and
 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.240
when acting on elementary particles and
the question is why is that why is this

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
the question is why is that why is this
 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.850
the question is why is that why is this
force so much weaker so we know that if

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
force so much weaker so we know that if
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.130
force so much weaker so we know that if
we just assume these masses are what

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
we just assume these masses are what
 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.720
we just assume these masses are what
they are if we assume this force is much

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
they are if we assume this force is much
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.700
they are if we assume this force is much
weaker the theory works beautifully its

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710
weaker the theory works beautifully its
 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.490
weaker the theory works beautifully its
predictions work but right now there's

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
predictions work but right now there's
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.410
predictions work but right now there's
no explanation for the scales in the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420
no explanation for the scales in the
 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.570
no explanation for the scales in the
problem and furthermore it seems almost

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580
problem and furthermore it seems almost
 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.910
problem and furthermore it seems almost
inconsistent if you just follow the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920
inconsistent if you just follow the
 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.310
inconsistent if you just follow the
rules of quantum mechanics and special

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320
rules of quantum mechanics and special
 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.800
rules of quantum mechanics and special
relativity you would expect that all the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
relativity you would expect that all the
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.330
relativity you would expect that all the
forces should have comparable strength

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
forces should have comparable strength
 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.010
forces should have comparable strength
the fact that there's this enormous

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020
the fact that there's this enormous
 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.600
the fact that there's this enormous
discrepancy between gravity and other

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610
discrepancy between gravity and other
 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.420
discrepancy between gravity and other
forces means we have to make a fudge in

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430
forces means we have to make a fudge in
 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.680
forces means we have to make a fudge in
the theory what we call a fine-tuning

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690
the theory what we call a fine-tuning
 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.050
the theory what we call a fine-tuning
and so no one believes that's what's

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060
and so no one believes that's what's
 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.310
and so no one believes that's what's
there so we believe there's something

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320
there so we believe there's something
 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.830
there so we believe there's something
that completes this theory and that this

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840
that completes this theory and that this
 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.390
that completes this theory and that this
thing that completes the theory might

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400
thing that completes the theory might
 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.220
thing that completes the theory might
well be something as exotic as extra

is this question of why gravity is so

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290
is this question of why gravity is so
 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.800
is this question of why gravity is so
weak compared to the other fundamental

forces that is to say even though
gravity seems strong it's because you're

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940
gravity seems strong it's because you're
 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.420
gravity seems strong it's because you're

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.900
experienced in our three dimensions that
is to say charged particles can only

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910
is to say charged particles can only
 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.560
is to say charged particles can only
exist on the brain where we live but

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570
exist on the brain where we live but
 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.060
exist on the brain where we live but
there still could be another dimension

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070
there still could be another dimension
 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.790
there still could be another dimension
where gravity travels so this idea of a

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800
where gravity travels so this idea of a
 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.590
where gravity travels so this idea of a
brain is that there's lower dimensional

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600
brain is that there's lower dimensional
 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.720
brain is that there's lower dimensional
surfaces in higher dimensional space and

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:11.730
surfaces in higher dimensional space and
 

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.570
surfaces in higher dimensional space and
we can actually live
