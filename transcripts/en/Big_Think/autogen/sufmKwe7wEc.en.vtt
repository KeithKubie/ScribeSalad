some misunderstandings are of course

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380
some misunderstandings are of course
 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.160
some misunderstandings are of course
notorious we're now dealing with a

notorious we're now dealing with a
 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.890
notorious we're now dealing with a
completely separate species then you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
completely separate species then you
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.810
completely separate species then you
have to think what on earth have we got

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
have to think what on earth have we got
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.160

things we're most proud of and if you
 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.840
things we're most proud of and if you
just go out on the street and ask people

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850
just go out on the street and ask people
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.760
just go out on the street and ask people
well what do you think are our finest

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
well what do you think are our finest
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.260
well what do you think are our finest
achievements chances are that you'll be

painting or something like that and I
 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.240
painting or something like that and I
have no quarrel with that but the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
have no quarrel with that but the
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.970
have no quarrel with that but the
problem is that our appreciation of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
problem is that our appreciation of
 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.119
problem is that our appreciation of
works of art and music are very much

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
works of art and music are very much
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.270
works of art and music are very much
tied to our cognitive system and an

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.430
probably wouldn't have any understanding
of it and said it would have any

anything of that sort so be no point in
sending those things now there's one

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
sending those things now there's one

thing we're all agreed that we must

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
thing we're all agreed that we must
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.630
thing we're all agreed that we must
share and that is mathematics

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640
share and that is mathematics
 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.399
share and that is mathematics
mathematics is universal it's it's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
mathematics is universal it's it's
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.770
mathematics is universal it's it's
discovered by human beings but the rules

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
discovered by human beings but the rules
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.030
discovered by human beings but the rules
of mathematics are the same throughout

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040
of mathematics are the same throughout
 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.680
of mathematics are the same throughout
the universe and the laws of the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690
the universe and the laws of the
 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.899
the universe and the laws of the
universe are mathematical relationships

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
universe are mathematical relationships
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.270
universe are mathematical relationships
so the underlying laws of physics we can

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
so the underlying laws of physics we can
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.390
so the underlying laws of physics we can
cast in mathematical form so if they are

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
cast in mathematical form so if they are
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.250
cast in mathematical form so if they are
communicating with us if they have

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260
communicating with us if they have
 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.929
communicating with us if they have
technology they will understand the laws

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939
technology they will understand the laws
 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.030
technology they will understand the laws
of physics and the nature of mathematics

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
of physics and the nature of mathematics
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.670
of physics and the nature of mathematics
these are things that we can share so it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
these are things that we can share so it
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.649
these are things that we can share so it
seems to me that our communication will

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
seems to me that our communication will
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.740
seems to me that our communication will
begin in terms of mathematics and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
begin in terms of mathematics and
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.980
begin in terms of mathematics and
physics so me I'm a mathematical

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
physics so me I'm a mathematical
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.469
physics so me I'm a mathematical
physicist so you might say well you

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479
physicist so you might say well you
 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.170
physicist so you might say well you
would say that wouldn't you but I really

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
would say that wouldn't you but I really
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.690
would say that wouldn't you but I really
do think that this is the common

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
do think that this is the common
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.700
do think that this is the common
currency of the cosmos and so we will

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
currency of the cosmos and so we will
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.319
currency of the cosmos and so we will
want to communicate about our

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329
want to communicate about our
 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.119
want to communicate about our
understanding of mathematical physics so

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129
understanding of mathematical physics so
 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.039
understanding of mathematical physics so
we could tell them things that we have

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049
we could tell them things that we have
 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.960
we could tell them things that we have
discovered in the realm of mathematical

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
discovered in the realm of mathematical
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.250
discovered in the realm of mathematical
physics but there's stuff that I would

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
physics but there's stuff that I would
 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.660
physics but there's stuff that I would
like to know there are some famous

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670
like to know there are some famous
 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.540
like to know there are some famous
problems like how to bring gravitation

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550
problems like how to bring gravitation
 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.210
problems like how to bring gravitation
and quantum fees

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220
and quantum fees
 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.400

six together the long sought after
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.230
six together the long sought after
theory of quantum gravity that's one

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240
theory of quantum gravity that's one
 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.380
theory of quantum gravity that's one
thing that I would like to know it may

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390
thing that I would like to know it may
 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.700
thing that I would like to know it may
be hard to understand the answer that

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710
be hard to understand the answer that
 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.680
be hard to understand the answer that
comes back there's something that's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690
comes back there's something that's
 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.540
comes back there's something that's
perhaps a little easier there's a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550
perhaps a little easier there's a
 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.540
perhaps a little easier there's a
quantity in the theory of quantum
