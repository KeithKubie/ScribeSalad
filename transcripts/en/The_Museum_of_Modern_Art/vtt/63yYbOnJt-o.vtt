- Hi, my name is Jackie Delamatre,

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:12.911
I'm a School Programs Educator

00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:14.362
here at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:16.951
And this is Bicycle
Wheel by Marcel Duchamp.

00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:18.970
It's a work that I think is really great

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.387
to talk to kids about what is art.

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:22.883
What makes something art.

00:00:22.883 --> 00:00:24.243
When I bring kids into this room

00:00:24.243 --> 00:00:25.890
what I'll do is I'll have them sit all

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.961
the way around the white platform here,

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:32.124
and then you know, I
will often start with,

00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:33.528
actually with this piece

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:35.049
I really don't have to say anything.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:36.048
(laughs)

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:36.936
That's when I kind of like,

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.253
that's my favorite kind of piece,

00:00:38.253 --> 00:00:39.774
the piece where the
kids are the first ones

00:00:39.774 --> 00:00:40.772
to say something.

00:00:40.772 --> 00:00:42.689
So they say, "What?

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:43.791
"What is this?

00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:45.370
"This isn't a painting,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.088
"this isn't a sculpture, this is a wheel.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.227
"What is this doing here?"

00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:49.770
And I say, "Well, I don't know.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.325
"Why do you think it's here?

00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:52.394
"Why do you think it's taking up

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:54.866
"so much valuable space in
the Museum of Modern Art?"

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.551
One thing that I do a lot at this piece

00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:58.687
is I tell them that Marcel Dechamp,

00:00:58.687 --> 00:01:01.646
another one of his famous
pieces called Fountain,

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:03.968
was voted a few years back

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:06.173
by hundreds of art historians

00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:09.785
to be the most influential piece
of modern art in existence.

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:12.768
And I actually show
them a picture of that,

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:14.870
of that piece, and of course,

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.389
they all really start
freaking out about that

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:19.687
because it's a urinal and you know,

00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:21.811
some of them have to recognize
that's a urinal at first.

00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:24.159
Often I do this with middle schoolers.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.628
And so that really brings them into

00:01:27.628 --> 00:01:30.752
well, okay here these
are similar in a way,

00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:32.934
these are both objects that Marcel Duchamp

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:34.872
didn't actually create himself,

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:36.672
they're manufactured objects,

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:39.307
but not only does MoMA respect it,

00:01:39.307 --> 00:01:41.234
but all these art historians respect it

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.266
and it's supposedly the
most influential piece,

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:45.076
so what is it that's doing this?

00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:47.027
I think because of that compare contrast

00:01:47.027 --> 00:01:49.732
they are able to start to get to the fact

00:01:49.732 --> 00:01:51.950
that this is doing something different,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.236
that this is Marcel Duchamp saying,

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.489
a lot of them say anything can be art

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:58.812
and then I try to push them
a little bit more on that.

00:01:58.812 --> 00:02:03.628
Why can't I just declare any object art?

00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:07.822
Why can't I say this
manufactured pencil is art?

00:02:07.822 --> 00:02:09.895
And so we have to have a discuss

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.681
about well, what makes you
saying this pencil is art

00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:16.280
different than Duchamp
saying this pencil is art?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.474
And they are really
willing to engage with me

00:02:18.474 --> 00:02:21.504
around the fact that
artists make a lot of art,

00:02:21.504 --> 00:02:22.735
they make it their career,

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:24.616
they declare themselves artists.

00:02:24.616 --> 00:02:27.216
And so they'll get a lot
of respect for the things

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:32.175
that they make in the context
of their whole life's work.
