00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:03.868
(bright instrumental music)

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.870
- How can you optimize your health

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.920
in preparation for pregnancy?

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.190
Let's explore five steps you can take

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.370
when you're planning to get pregnant.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.510
If you have any chronic
medical conditions,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.880
including diabetes, high blood pressure,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.980
thyroid conditions, or depression,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.540
it's important to meet with
your primary care provider

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.610
or obstetrician before becoming pregnant.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.550
It's vital to check that all medications

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.780
or supplements you are taking
are safe for pregnancy.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.900
Excellent management of
diabetic blood sugars

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.800
before you are pregnant
is especially important

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.340
for the normal fetal development

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.040
in the first eight weeks of pregnancy.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.840
If you've had prior complications

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.350
during pregnancies in the past,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.610
it's also important to
discuss this ahead of time

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.890
with your obstetrician,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.250
as there are often
interventions that may help

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.093
avoid these complications
in future pregnancies.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.620
Preparing for pregnancy
is an important time

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.210
to reflect on alcohol,
caffeine, or marijuana use.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.510
I recommend to my patients

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.930
wean down caffeine intake to less than

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320
a 12 ounce cup of coffee daily

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.530
and eliminate alcohol and
marijuana or drug use completely.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.720
This can be hard to do

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.990
and I strongly encourage
doing it before pregnancy,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.963
as it may take some time to adjust.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.670
Most women will be tested
to see if they are a carrier

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.720
for cystic fibrosis or
spinal muscular atrophy,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.860
even without a family history.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.090
Take the time to review
your family history

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.950
with your relatives to find out

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.090
if there is a known hereditary carrier

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.200
in your family tree or
that of your partner.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.270
If so, it's advisable to
meet with a genetic counselor

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.460
to discuss further screening tests

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.840
prior to becoming pregnant.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.090
Pregnancy is a marathon and
labor is a sprint at the end.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.460
Working to ensure that
you are physically fit

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.780
entering pregnancy will improve
the health of the pregnancy,

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.080
ease of delivery and
your postpartum recovery.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.070
Regular cardiovascular exercise

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.880
can and should be
continued during pregnancy,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.530
as well as most other kinds of exercise.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.730
If you are overweight, even
a 10% reduction in your BMI

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.250
can improve your pregnancy outcomes.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.320
I recommend minimizing environmental

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.200
exposures in your home and work,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.880
such as mercury, lead, pesticides,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.690
air pollution, household
cleaning products,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.230
plastics for food
storage that include BPA,

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.410
and infection risks such as exposure

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.163
to common childhood viruses.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.940
Women who start prenatal
vitamins with folic acid

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.670
at least one month prior
to becoming pregnant

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.350
have a reduced risk of nausea
and vomiting during pregnancy.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.390
Additionally, folic acid supplementation

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.310
of 400 micrograms daily is recommended

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.510
for reduction of spinal
cord malformation risk.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.980
The neural tube is forming

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.060
in the first few months of pregnancy,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.300
so starting before
you're actually pregnant

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.090
helps makes sure that your body is ready

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.290
to support this important
developmental time.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.540
Finally, checking that you are up-to-date

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.200
on your vaccinations, such
as MMR or German measles,

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.830
and varicella or chicken pox
will help reduce the risk

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.880
of these dangerous infections
during your pregnancy.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.260
These vaccines can not
be given during pregnancy

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.630
and should ideally be given

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.833
at least one month prior to conception.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.900
Taking these steps will help
you to be better prepared

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.120
for the physical demands of pregnancy.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.610
Your doctor is here to
support you on your journey

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.378
to a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.
